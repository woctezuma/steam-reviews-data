This is a good \"start\". I quote as it's been 2 years almost, I decided to pick this up and it seems competant but there's too many issues for me right now. \n\nFirstly it's packed with invisble walls I bounce off. This isn't a big problem but in tighter spaces it's not so much that I lose control but that I've jumped a big portion of the race, without any input which sucks. I'd of liked a campaign, even something simple, each track with a medal, just for a sense of progression. It goes too fast and doesn't suit the scale, at least I feel, rollcage felt more elegant because the restrictions of the technology. Slower and smaller is better. Finally, I hate the term \"inspired\", it's a direct copy. Which is fine, I'm glad they're doing it, I just hope that in time they'll do it properly.\n\nI intend to keep up to date with this, if you're interested I'd reccomend you follow the development and buy it when it's a bit more complete.", "timestamp_created": 1514168384, "timestamp_updated": 1514168384, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462286", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1515427377, "developer_response": "Hi there,\n\nThanks for you review, there are some points in there that we feel we ought to address.\n\nThe invisible walls you shouldn't encounter too often in normal racing and are designed simply to keep you close to the racing track and not have you going off exploring parts of the world that you're not supposed to be in. In this regard, it employs the same techniques that Rollcage did, only less stringently.\n\nCampaign mode is coming with the full game, and we'll be launching later this year\n\nAt the end of every game you play you're presented with your personal statistics about the XP gained within the game and how this has affected your current player level. We even give you a ton of game stats that show how you did within the game compared to everyone else. This should give you a fairly solid sense of progression as you get more experience within the game, but we'll be adding more to progression in general\n\nAs for speed, simply choose which engine power you prefer in the game options to match the level of speed that you're looking for.\n\nWe hope this information tempts you back into the game in order to give it a 2nd chance.\n\nRegarding the Rollcage similarities of course there are many and GRIP was always designed to be its spiritual successor. However, we do have players on either side saying it's too much like Rollcage and conversely it's too far removed from Rollcage. We're trying hard to get the balance right and hopefully arrive at something very new that captures effectively everything that made Rollcage great.

Use it or not, your choice. In essence, it was designed for player's mastery of the game rather than being required to play the game. It was designed to allow you to hit your opponents hard, but only after you've paid a price for that ability. The price, is the drop in speed, which is a choice you have to make. It also quite visibly shows how hard you wanted to hit your opponent and as such helps to promote rivalry within the game.\n\nHolding down buttons shouldn't be a problem as master players will be charging their pickups when they need to reduce speed instead of using the brake. At these times, you're not boosting so don't need to hold that button down simultaneously.\n\nThe idea for the charged turbo or Firestorm was that reducing your speed in order to receive a charged Firestorm made no sense at all. So instead, we decided to not slow you down while charging that particular pickup and then give you a ton of boost, but you had better be ready to handle it and use it wisely. In this respect, the wheelies were very intentional as this of course hampers your steering so challenges the master players in using it well. We're not going to give you that much speed for free now are we? You have to be selective and tactical when using this particular charged pickup.\n\nThe game in general is no slower than it was beforehand. The only concession we made was making the uncharged Firestorm less powerful than it was before in order to balance the charged and uncharged versions of it. We have since boosted it back up a fair bit during the last 1.2.8 build due to player feedback.\n\nWe hope this answers some of your concerns and explains the direction of the game more clearly."}, "38505757": {"recommendationid": "38505757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019256630", "num_games_owned": 898, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513893522}, "language": "english", "review": "I was play Rollcage 2 <3", "timestamp_created": 1513893703, "timestamp_updated": 1513893703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38501600": {"recommendationid": "38501600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256830834", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514463499}, "language": "english", "review": "GRIP is a great racing game, pretty fun to play.

Every now and then you'll drive over a pebble and go flying wildy into the air. Sometimes you'll hit a barrel in the middle of the road and stop dead in your tracks. If you get turned around the arrows showing you which way to go can sometimes straight up lie to you and have you turn nearly 360 degrees. That's GRIP at its worst.\n\nBut when the game is working at its best, a 10 minute race will feel like 3 minutes. You'll be totally immersed in the race. When you pick up a speed boost, be prepared to let Jesus take the wheel. Watching your missile take flight and slam into the car in front of you, then dodging it as it crashes against the course is just so satisfying. Check out some gameplay to decide if this game is for you, but chances are it is and you won't regret the purchase.\n\n4/5", "timestamp_created": 1512082880, "timestamp_updated": 1512082880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37900879": {"recommendationid": "37900879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044779186", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "last_played": 1515707758}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun racing combat game that is actively developed and has a lot of content even in its early access state (a bunch of cars, maps, weapons, functional multiplayer, etc).

The graphics are spot on and look stunning. But the gameplay feels contradictory. You have extremely fast vehicles going around on an open track. You know what that causes? Discomfort. Its just annoying to have the vehice caught on a silly little \"bumb\" and have it fly off in a random direction. It encourages learning the tracks by heart rather than trying to encourage instinct as most similar racing games do. If you want players to dodge and avoid a crate or a clif or a flag post, give them decent breaking and tight low speed cornering. If you want them to juke, jump and wallride give them large tracks with obstacles that are extremely well defined. Story wise, the \"cars have extreme downforce\" makes no sense becuase they don t feel like it. They feel like a barrel could shoot them in the air at 60\u00b0. The jump.mechanic feels clunky and seems to rely too much on the slowmo. Yea you can get better and better and stop using slo mo, but that is by learning the maps not by improving your skill. As a result gameplay quickly looses interactivity. You guys are so close. The weapon system feels well done, rewarding planning over flick movements. I suggest either making jump instantaneous at full velocity, or removing it completely. Remove slo mo and force players into training towards a fast paced gamestyle. The engine power option is amazing. Or at least it feels like it. Make tracks larger, wider for more movement and decision options. \"Do i shoot? Do i steer? Do i break?\" Make all these be 33% valuable each and make the responses faster towards these goals and i am sure the gameplay would be legendary. Do not punish players for hitting an object, a pole from a damn bridge. You already have \"force walls\" in the game why not center the gameplay around a fast tubelike structure instead.of silly \"hit the entrance\" games. Collisions do not help either. Turning a vehicle 180\u00b0 only to have the player turn it back and slow to 0 is just not fun in a massive velocity based game. Reset should be rarely needed and not a \"cheat ability\" as it is now. I hope this helps. Your game has amazing potential and i believe with some tuning around what i mentioned you could really outdo nitronic rush and perhaos become he racing staple of the past 2 decades. Just focus on players having fun rather than \"tryharding\" and it should work miracles. I do.not regret buying this game one bit and love coming to it every 2 3 days for a few races.

I've had the game from very early on when it only had three tracks and one car, and even then I could see this game was going to be great. The basic fundamentals of the game felt right, the physics, momentum, speed and looks all came together so well, though minor quirks and issues were present. Over time this experience has improved tenfold. For instance, in earlier incarnations of the game it was far too easy to go airborn from the most minute pebble and lose control, flying from barrier to barrier once launched. This has been addressed, with impacts causing less ricochet and a general smoothing out of the handling mechanics. This includes drifting of vehicles, which is now far more intuitive and less of a cloth touching exercise. The amount of content in the game has increased substantially since I first bought it too, with tons of new tracks and vehicles having been added along with multiplayer finally getting put into the mix. \n\nThe graphics are amazing. It is a modern game through and through, with some great post processing effects and highly detailed vehicles. The textures for the circuits themselves are decent enough and considering the speed at which you go flying through them you will barely pick up on their finer details. The game runs smooth for me, though I have had the chance to run the game on a Fury X and 1080, so am unsure on slightly less powerful cards. However considering the flexibility of the graphics settings and the way the game is optimised already, I feel it should run well on pretty much any modern dedicated graphics hardware.\n\nThe cpu difficulty is sufficient and provides a moderate challenge on it's hardest setting and it's highest speed, although this is highly dependant on your start and how well you've mastered the basic mechanics. If you manage to get away well from the start and distance the opposition, it's not overly difficult to go on and win the race. Even then, if you have a decent grasp of the physics of the game and understand where the best lines are then you usually stand a good chance of winning regardless of how well you start. I suppose this is only a minor gripe and will be polished up as the game reaches it's proper release.\n\nOne of the additions I was very happy in seeing was the vehicle customisation option which was added into the game. This lets you choose the base chassis, with lots of different variants with different stats, and then decide your colour scheme for wheels and body aswell as choosing from a number of different tyre designs. It's not a huge change but it's a great addition that will likely see fleshing out in the future. \n\nThis game is a great homage to arcade racers dating all the way back to F Zero. It may specifically target those fond of the rollcage games, but it easily scratches the same itch that fans of Wipeout and other similar titles play these games for.

With races playing out across a wide variety of sci-fi settings, it manages to make them look pretty convincing. Though you can spot some less-than-incredible textures if you stop and scrutinise every rock or building, in motion everything looks glorious. Wheels kick up dust or snow where applicable, missiles create very satisfying fireballs and damaged cars leave a spectacularly excessive trail of flame in their wake. The car designs of course take their basis from Rollcage, with wheels taller than the body. A lot of effort has gone into making them look more believable, with most wheels actually floating off the axle - a blue glow implying some magnetic trickery going on.\n\n\n[h1]How does it sound?[/h1]\n\nIn keeping with the aim of replicating the feel of classic racers, the soundtrack is primarily made up of drum 'n' bass from contemporary artists, and it works extremely well. There's a good variety of pieces, though they're randomly selected at the start of a race - meaning they're not specifically designed for or matched to any particular ingame track or environment. Regardless, it's good listening and fits the game perfectly. Sound effects are a mixed bag. On the whole everything works, some effects are excellent - you really feel it when an assassin missile impacts for example. However, a lot of sounds - including important things like some of the cars' engines - are placeholder thanks to the game's early access nature. One car's engine is often barely audible, while the recently-added inbuilt boost sounds somewhat pathetic when activated. There are some really nice touches though, such as echo effects when passing through cave areas.\n\n\n[h1]How does it play?[/h1]\n\nAs a whole, Grip can feel quite sluggish at times. A conscious decision has been made to give the cars the feeling of a lot of weight, which is fair enough. Unfortunately that means acceleration can be painfully slow and turning tends to have a lot of understeer, leading to frustration when the car just doesn't make the turn. This is in stark contrast to its spiritual predecessor, in which the vehicles felt almost weightless. Once you come to terms with Grip's handling, though, it's not bad at all - although classic arcade-style drifting isn't really an option thanks to the understeery model, there's plenty of room for skill in taking optimal lines. The game's big gimmick, the ability to drive on walls and ceilings, works a treat, with transitions being perfectly smooth and tracks making creative use of it. The 'launch' ability allows cars to jump quite a height, and opens up even more possibilities for shenanigans - though I feel it runs the risk of being too much of an extraneous gimmick. Although the vast majority of the time the game behaves very well, there is an unfortunate and long-standing bug which can cause cars to suddenly stop or bounce violently for seemingly no reason. Hopefully this gets squashed, as it is common enough to be frustrating.\n\nThe 'combat' part of the combat racer moniker comes with the wide - and still widening - array of powerups at racers' disposal. Appearing as green holograms at predetermined points on the track, pickups will grant one of many weapons and tools for either making someone else's life miserable or making your own more comfortable. Missile hits will blast cars clean off the track, while the 'Ram Raider' generates a repulsive field around your car, pushing adversaries away. The chaos that can ensue when a pack of cars is vying for position is remarkable. There is some limited interplay between powerups - the 'Raptor' machinegun can be used to destroy mines while a barrier shield can protect racers from attacks from behind. Planned for the future is destructible scenery, with the first steps towards that goal being already present on one of the tracks.\n\nTrack variety is already quite good, with ten ingame spread across the four environments. There are a couple of arenas to support the deathmatch game mode and a large number of 'carkour' maps that rigorously test your control of the cars. As stated earlier, good use is made of the cars' ability to drive on any surface, especially in tracks created later in development.\n\nThere are currently eight cars available across three manufacturers, each with their own visual style and performance specialties. The 'Terra' manufacturer has a bulky, armoured appearance and its cars tend to be good all-rounders. 'Cygon' looks very futuristic and features very polarised cars - they harbour the slowest and most controllable car in the game alongside the fastest and least controllable. 'Vintek' take cues from classic cars, the old rollcage games and a bit of scrapyard chic with surprisingly good agility. Cars are categorised into three groups - the agile, quick-off-the-mark 'speedsters', the balanced 'all rounders' and the fast, tough but unwieldy 'tanks'. Car balance is currently fairly good, with certain cars being favoured over others depending on the track but few situations where a choice would be completely incapable of winning.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer?[/h1]\n\nSplitscreen functionality has been present for a long time and works well, but requires two controllers to work. It will not work with just a keyboard, or a keyboard and a controller at present. Online multiplayer was added recently and is very fun if you can find a race, but has been plagued with crashes, bugs and disconnects. The most recent patch addressed this to a large degree but multiplayer is still very unreliable by most accounts. Numbers online are generally very low, and it's probably best to try and organise races via the game's Discord channel which has a fair few active users.\n\n\n[h1]Closing thoughts[/h1]\n\nGRIP is already very, very playable. Despite being in early access with all the rough edges and issues that entails it's presented very professionally with active and receptive developers who have a lot of dedication for the game.

Yes, it's still a work in progress, and seeing other reviews, lots of people apparently fail to realize that, but it IS getting better. Another thing people complain about is the steering. Well, if you played the above mentioned rollcage games, you'd soon find out that the steering was never easy to begin with, but you gotta practice. There's this wonderful thing called drifting, and it's highly involved in the rollcage series, a lot more so in this one. The old ones, well, of course physics aren't gonna be as good. That's 90's tech right there, but you'd soon find out, especially with the faster vehicles, that you have to drift quite often.

What a story man.\n\nIt all started when Robert Baker arrived in the Rollcage Steam Group, a group of Rollcage fans - the game GRIP inspires itself from - created just for the sake of having some MP games on it. Rob arrived here, and [b]more than 15 years after Rollcage's release[/b], when he saw we were so excited about the game, he agreed to patch the game [b]just for us[/b] so that we could have our multiplayer games. On his free time. This dude is amazing.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/rollcage/discussions/3/35220315778034627/\n\nThen he met Chris, another Rollcage fan with a lot of experience in UE4, and they decided to start what is now what we (Rollcage fans) thought impossible a couple of years ago - a Rollcage spiritual sequel! They both abandonned their respective jobs, to dedicate themselves to this gem.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/rollcage#announcements/detail/209761440203015771\n\nOn their journey, they faced (and are still facing) a lot of difficulties. They tried a Kickstarter which failed - but nevertheless, they kept going. Despite being outnumbered in regards to the [b]huge[/b] task that represents developing a proper racer, they kept pushing. They are the most determined devs I have known so far, they want to finish this game no matter what it entails.\nhttp://www.gripvideogame.com/\n\nNot only are they working hard - but they're also listening a lot to their community. They encouraged us to give them ideas - and actually, a non negligible amount of features now present in GRIP are the result of propositions and discussions in the main forum. Even when the feedback isn't positive, they're always reading it, and trying to understand what is wrong.\n\nWhat you're about to experience (if you decide to buy GRIP), is not only a fan game a-la \"I want to make a modern version of Rollcage\", it's a game where the community played a big role in helping shaping the game.\n\nIt's also the result of 2 years of working very hard, the size of the team never bigger than 3-4.\n\nIt's not perfect, and there's still a lot of features and rebalancing that need to be done before it becomes a great game. But the devs are aware of it - it's not like some of the games where they say \"yeah yeah\" and then they do as if they didn't read. They actually acknowledge the defaults of the game in the case of GRIP, and imo it's a great strength that every developer out there should have.\n\nNow that I've given a little bit of context, here is the part more relevant to the actual game content/gameplay.\n\n[h1]What is GRIP ?[/h1]\n\nGRIP is combat racer, which is meant to be intense and very dynamic. Think of Mario Kart, but with actual physics and weapons that actually explode. What puts GRIP apart from the other combat racers, is the craziness of the physics. The vehicles can be driven upside down (and now since a recent update you can even make your vehicle jump), which allows to do some crazy manoeuvers\nhttp://i.imgur.com/I2IoorK.gifv\n\nThe tracks can range between \"very open with a lot of different paths\" to \"single road with lots of crazy loops a-la Trackmania\". Their design is not perfect, but it shows some huge potential when it comes down to the variety of the tracks and the different environments.\n\nAs for the speed, it's supposed to feel very fast. Maybe not as fast as Redout, but fast enough to give you chills. If you can keep up the pace ;)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtkvfAwY6jE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHWfA_LqLxU\n\nThe weapons could use more work right now, but their goal is to either blow a vehicle, or just push him out of the way, making his vehicle uncontrollable, etc.. With the \"Destruction\" option enabled, your vehicle can even blow off if it has taken too much damage. Just like Megarace, but in better :-)\nhttps://youtu.be/DrWRpB1inqI?t=1m17s\n\nGRIP is the kind of game where you can become first quite unexpectedly if you time right your weapons, and if you also have the right opportunities. It's a combat racer, meaning predicting weapons is just as important as racing in itself. This is what made Rollcage so unique, and it's one of the greatest strength of GRIP.\n\nHowever, GRIP is not perfect, and it does have a few points that prevent it (so far) from becoming a great game:\n[list]\n[*]Tracks have a bit too much of a \"press accelerate and go straight\" feeling - some of them would need some additional elements to break that feeling\n[*]Weapons also need some rework - some of them are hard to counter, while some others feel not that powerful\n[*]GRIP is still not very beginner friendly - racing in GRIP is very special and unlike the other racers out there. It's not as hard as BallisticNG (i mean no offense, I actually love BNG :-) ), but it does require you to be focused while racing\n[/list]\n\nBut the developers are more than aware of the issues, and step by step we're watching GRIP becoming the game we were waiting for.\n\nAn example of something they strived a lot to get working correctly: the steering physics within UE4, the collisions, the traction of the vehicles on the road.. Just racing in general. The first iterations of the game were quite not that right in terms of handling. The devs went as far as [b]modifying the actual UE4 code[/b] to bend it to what they wanted the handling to be. A bunch of crazy people, i'm telling you. But thanks to their dedication, now the handling really feels great, and that's one step closer to what we (the fans) are expecting GRIP to be :-)\n\nIf you want to support the developers, and get at least a couple of hours of fun, buy it. You won't regret it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0xBWUbtZbY", "timestamp_created": 1497993714, "timestamp_updated": 1497994375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 136, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.915596", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32602274": {"recommendationid": "32602274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254195038", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1515367492}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely Terrific!", "timestamp_created": 1497991581, "timestamp_updated": 1505157250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32580584": {"recommendationid": "32580584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122071663", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497921413}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7a7a\u6709\u4e00\u5e45\u79d1\u5e7b\u5916\u8868\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b80\u76f4\u4e00\u5768\u7fd4\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684\u4e50\u8da3\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1497921536, "timestamp_updated": 1497921536, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419048", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32528173": {"recommendationid": "32528173", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994976337", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497964505}, "language": "english", "review": "This game does not have mouse look or steer.

Yes and no. \n\n- No, mostly due to the car handling that ironically doesn't feel GRIP-py enough. Maybe it's not a fair comparison, but in an arcade racing game like NFS you feel much more in control and at the same time you still drive a highly responsive car. In GRIP it's very easy to totally lose control.\n- No, because the physics definitely feel flimsy and unpredictable at times, adding to the frustration. Little bumps can cause your car to unpredictably jump or spin around.\n\n+ Yes, because of the (re)fresh take on the genre. I miss games like Rollcage Stage and and ReVolt, and I think many people do so too.\n+ Yes, because of the good graphics (cars look great, environments - not so much)\n+ Yes, because of the awesome DNB soundtrack and juicy sound design\n+ Yes, because of the numerous game modes that should end up in the final game (there are  just a few atm)\n\nGRIP has a lot of potential to reach great heights, maybe those of Rocket League, but still needs a lot of blood and sweat invested by the developers :)\nNote that as of the moment of writing this review there aren't many active players so you will need a buddy if you want to play in multiplayer.", "timestamp_created": 1496776509, "timestamp_updated": 1496776639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32216693": {"recommendationid": "32216693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150737139", "num_games_owned": 454, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515014806}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer sich noch an die \u00c4ra der PS1 High-Speed Rennspiele erinnert der kennt vor allem einen Namen: \"Psygnosis\".

Dieser Titel ist die Grundlage f\u00fcr Grip und das sp\u00fcrt man sofort genauso wie die Beteiligung ehemaliger Entwickler des Originals.

Sehr positiv finde ich das die Programmierer dem Spiel einen lokalen Splitscreen Modus spendiert haben und das vor kurzem auch der Online Multiplayer Part eingef\u00fcgt wurde.

They offer some very very decent graphical aspects of the game and some overal a nice detailing on the cars, tracks, weapons, explosions and runs smooth! - There are some nice detailing like EMP strikes shaking the map and things falling down.\n\nAudio: The audio of the game is very nice! The music is constant and you can turn it off if wanted, the engines do sound different but the weapons, guns, explosions etc offer some nice sound effects into the game when racing through the maps with chaos behind you.\n\nControls: The controls I found super easy to use because I was using an Xbox one controller in my PC.  Not a single problem with the game in this aspect and perfectly fine to use and play with keyboard if need be!\n\nGameplay and everything else: The game is basically a revisit off the old 1999 Rollcage game, which at the time was amazing and top fun... It was my childhood game I would say!\n\nProblem I found was the lack off maps.  There is a fairly decent amount of modes and content, it is just the lack of maps that makes it slightly sad, but the gameplay style, fun, multiplayer etc makes the game an awful lot of fun to be had!\n\nThe game is fast paced and should be played with friends for maximum enjoyment and the game is still in early access as I write this review, so please bare that in mind!\n\nIf you are racing, then it is simple objective to win and by any means, so blowing them up and setting mines etc.. Move as fast as possible and do not stop with the insane speeds at hand.

Thankfully though, there's still some good fun to be had by virtue of the aspects of the game that shine.\n\nFirst and foremost on the positives; anybody who loved Rollcage back in the day will naturally wonder whether Grip succeeds in paying homage to the aforementioned game that inspired its design, and for the most part I reckon it does. The circuits flow well and are great fun to blast round at blistering speeds, often prompting the player to defy gravity by tearing along walls and ceilings, as is iconic of the original Rollcage. By that same token, the cars handle with the same general feel as in the original game, abiding by just the right amount of traction and inertia relative to the car you've chosen and the type of terrain of the circuit being driven. An especially excellent feature is being given the option to promptly respawn your car if you get into a pickle trying to regain composure following a collision or sustained attack, however this doesn't always work perfectly, sometimes spawning you too far behind or ahead of where you just were, though this is something that may be resolved with future updates.\n\nThe visuals are not only gorgeously detailed but wonderfully optimized as well. Running this game on my GTX 970 at maximum quality, this is one of the best looking arcade racers I've ever played, yet not once have I encountered a noticeable drop below 60 frames per second. If I had to nitpick, I would only say that the general atmosphere and visual vibe of Grip are somehow more sterile and not quite as \u201cgroovy\u201d as that of Rollcage, but on the whole, the different circuits and worlds are nonetheless very pretty, as well as the selection of cars.\n\nNow onto the negatives. The soundtrack, while suitably fast paced, is utterly dull and forgettable, certainly in comparison to the soundtrack of Rollcage; you might as well just find the latter on YouTube and have that playing instead while you race!\n\nAnd going back to the subject of handling; while Grip does indeed honor the general feel of Rollcage, the unfortunate side effect of this is that your car will sometimes lose control in a seemingly spontaneous manner, rather than as a consequence of your own error. For instance, I'll sometimes be driving along my usual racing line whilst traversing a bump in the track, then all of a sudden my car will act upon its own will and just decide to spin out or flip into the air, only to land back down facing the wrong way and thus ruining my momentum, and all by no fault of my own. This is why you can't afford to take this game too seriously or competitively, because no matter how skilled you may be, every player is ultimately subject to the precarious nature of the game's physics, meaning that you always need some luck on your side in order to maintain control of your car at high speeds, even when you're not being attacked by mines or missiles. Moreover, your car can sometimes be rather slow to initially pick up speed after grinding to a halt, making undeserved spinouts and such all the more tedious.\n\nThis characteristic of the game may be a forgivable flaw for some players, perhaps even an oddly desirable quality for others, but for me it undermines the general appeal of competing for superior lap times in time trial mode. To elaborate on that, I feel that an impressively quick lap time should always be the product of almost nothing but skill, judgment and experience, but in the case of Grip, luck plays too large a part in this regard. For instance, it's dissatisfying when another player of the same level of skill manages to set a lap time that's really tough to beat just because they had one lucky attempt whereby their car behaved in a consistently stable manner throughout the lap, despite their judgment having been no better in terms of racing line. I'm hoping that this inconsistency in the game's physics will at least be mitigated as updates continue to be made, though I'm not counting on it.\n\nLastly, the variety of weapons/pickups is, at least currently, kind of meager. I wouldn't mind seeing at least two more types of pickups introduced, to help prevent skirmishes from growing stale.\n\nOn the whole, as long as you don't play with an especially competitive frame of mind, lovers of Rollcage in particular will find that there's a good bit of fun to be had here.", "timestamp_created": 1494548714, "timestamp_updated": 1494548714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31683156": {"recommendationid": "31683156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000053623", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488740472}, "language": "german", "review": "Der heutige Wetterbericht sagt hei\u00dfe, brennende Luft und Metallregen an.", "timestamp_created": 1494510148, "timestamp_updated": 1494510148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31674157": {"recommendationid": "31674157", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971331262", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "last_played": 1515372111}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved rollcage on PS1 and I love this.

Kudos to Caged Element for reviving Rollcage in spectacular fashion.\n\nSo yes, yes you should buy this game. However, I feel as if there's some expectations about Grip worth addressing after reading through some other reviews.\n\nRemember that Grip is a [b] battle racer, [/b] and gearing up to be a hardcore one at that. There's going to be collisions, explosions, bumps, jumps, missiles, mines and a whole wealth of other upsets lap after lap that can make this game an intense ride at the best of times, and you'll need to embrace this before you can really begin to enjoy this game for what it is: a battle racer.\n\nYes, the bleeping warnings of an incoming payload may trigger PTSD as you pray in vain for a shield pick-up or sharp evasive manoeuvre, but one missle impact and a handbrake turn later, the real fun is had chasing back up the pack with two fresh machine guns and one lap left to run - even more so online.\n\nAnd should worst come to worst, if you find yourself gracefully flipping 60ft up in the air with thrusters in the wrong direction, just remember that there's a reset button. Map that baby to something memorable and use it well.\n\n[b] Grip's races can be hard to win, and that's exactly the way it should be for a game of this calibre. [/b]\n\nIt should go without saying, but if you want a conventional racing experience without (sometimes literal) bumps in the road, then this isn't the game you're looking for.\n\nAll in all, for an early access game Grip so far is phenomenal.

I will update this review as new updates arrive (Review was last updated on the [b]26th of October, 2017[/b])\n\nGRIP is a spiritual successor to Rollcage/Rollcage 2, with polished graphics and physics.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[b]\u00bb Driving physics[/b]\nThe driving physics are a serious step up compared to the Rollcage-titles. However, I think the vehicles could use a little more grip on dirt-services, and a little less on asphalt. Perhaps a kind of drift-system would also be nice, because steering as of now kind of feels a little strange.\n\n[b]\u00bb Tracks[/b]\nThe race tracks all have a good amount of curves and straights, however, compared to the Rollcage titles, they are way less unique and varied. Most tracks look quite barren without much going on, although the new maps definitely look promising! A track editor would be pretty interesting, but maybe that's too much to ask.\n\nSpeaking of destruction: As of now, the game is really missing out on that. The most destruction I ever saw were some knocked around barrels, that's pretty much it.\n\nFurthermore, the mirrored mode is very appreciated, you don't see that in many newer titles.\n\n[b]\u00bb Vehicles[/b]\nThere are a bunch of vehicles to choose from with different stats. They are all modifyable with different colors, wheels and tyres. All vehicles look pretty unique; a very good step up from the Rollcage series.\n\n[h1]Misc[/h1]\n[b]\u00bb Splitscreen[/b]\n[b]THIS GAME HAS A SPLITSCREEN MODE.[/b] More games need this.\n\n[b]\u00bb Soundtrack[/b]\nThe soundtrack is not really of my taste, personally. I preferred the style of the Rollcage games with great Jungle/DnB tracks. It's just too wobbly, it's missing that raw-ness and punch. But that's just me, everyone's taste in music is different.\n\n[b]\u00bb Graphics[/b]\nThe graphics look very beautiful. Bloom effects, motion-blur, etc. look just right. Although the performance is a little lacking on higher resolutions/settings and the framerate likes to drop a little sometimes (Playing this at 4k on a 980ti felt kinda sluggish).\n\n[b]\u00bb Settings[/b]\nThe game has tons of settings. Shadows, object quality, post-processing, etc, etc. There also is a FOV setting, which is really appreciated. The only thing that is missing is a master-volume slider, that would be great.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nThis game is not a bad racer at all. It feels fast, and it's difficult. While the lack of varied maps is kind of bugging me (although that seems to be fixed soon), I'd say it has serious potential.", "timestamp_created": 1492620596, "timestamp_updated": 1509000392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670930", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31240309": {"recommendationid": "31240309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156702647", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513018444}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, let me say this... I'm very sceptical if it's about Early Access games. Those \"games\" often tend to be scams just to rip You off. However, that's not the case for GRIP. This game, for me, is a proof that there are studios out there that genuinely care about their projects and their fanbase. Caged Element are the good guys. Why You ask? I had this game on my radar for a long time, since I saw the first trailer, and the devs are constantly adding new stuff to the game, fixing bugs and tweaking the mechanics etc. This game is evolving, it keeps getting better and better. It traveled a long way since it's first versions.\n\nI won't be comparing this game to it's predecessor Rollcage. I'll focus entirely on my feelings while playing, without any nostalgia involved. Also keep in mind GRIP is constantly growing so my \"review\" can become out of date. I will update it i there will be a need for it.\n\nSo... GRIP is an amazing combat racer, with exciting gameplay and amazing audio-visuals. It's fast, it's aggresive, sense of speed on highest engine power is face-melting, and to top it off, its Drum & Bass soundtrack is a cherry on the cake, it will make Your blood boil if that's the type of music You dig. And even if You don't, there is always the option to throw Your own music to the playlist but to be honest I didn't test this feature well enough because I thought it's unnecessary, for me, the original soundtrack is perfect.\n\nGameplay itself feels demanding at first. Getting used to the vehicles take a little bit of time since it's not the type of racer where You can just hold the accelerate button to win, You must actually tame Your vehicle to have a chance of winning, they are designed in a way to allow driving on the walls and ceiling and it takes some practice and track knowledge. Every vehicle has different statistics, and even though the differences are subtle, they have a big impact on Your driving, You have to match the car to Your driving preference. For example, there is Cygon Ictus that is very agile but it can only take a few rockets on its face to blow up. On the other hand there is Vintek Juggernaut that is a typical tank and it can take much more hits but its handling is worse. And there are some cars in the middle also. Currenly there are more middle weight and tanks class in the game and only one speedster but it's going to change with the upcoming update.\n\nNow, the tracks themselves. They are classified in three categories, easy, normal and hard, and some of them are insanely hard. There are a total amount of 7 tracks right now and some of them comes with their reversed versions. Some of them are taking place on the ground and some of them are taking place high in the sky in a form of roads suspended in the air, and those are among the hardest. Environments are interesting, good looking, pleasant for the eyes. Even though there are not much tracks at the moment, there are options to stop You from being bored. For example, You can mirror every track so it can have a slightly different feel, so if You choose to race on a reversed and mirrored, it feels like You're racing on a completely different track. You can change vehicle destruction, number of contestants, number of loops and turn on/off the upgrades appearing on the road.\n\nIs there only racing mode? No. There is Classic Racing where only Your position matters. There is a Ultimate Racing where You gather points by being first and by using Your weaponry on the opponents. There is the Eliminator where every last car explodes every 30 seconds and it goes until one car survives (it's hard as hell btw) and there is my favourite mode which is Time Attack where You race alone infinitely just to improve Your track time. I tend to spend most time on Ultimate and Time Attack. There are also three arenas where there is no racing involved at all. You just have to kill Your opponents with rockets and mines. That mode took me by surprise, I didn't think I would like it, even though it's simple it is still a fun mode.\n\n...but is there something wrong about GRIP? It's pretty impossible to create flawless game and GRIP is no exception. There are occasional issues with collision boxes where You can bounce unexpectedly or get stuck. It happens more often at breakneck speeds but even then it's rare. Also, You have to be careful where and when You shoot Your rockets because if used in the wrong place and time the rocket can slam back at You immediately after deploying. As far as I know it's the issue the devs are currently fixing.\n\nThere is also another mode in which I've put the most hope but it turned out to be the most boring one by far. I'm speaking about the Playground mode. It was created due to people demand (I'm not going to hide, I was one of those people), it resembles the Scramble mode from Rollcage where You test Your driving skills on a very demanding short tracks. For some reason, this mode feels simply uninteresting. It feels like it was added as a bonus, like it's a very unpolished DLC or something. I have two predictions about this mode, either it will be improved last after tweaking the core mechanics of the game... or it will be obsolete and deleted in the future patch. Time will tell.\n\nWell... I wrote an essay didn't I? Long story short... I love this game and I can't wait how it will evolve in recent months, or even years.

By default, the settings had everything sluggish and really almost unplayable... and I have a fairly good system. A few tweaks, including having to reduce the resolution to 720p and killing all graphical enhancements, including the blur effect, she was purring like a kitten. Even at reduced settings, the game still looks sweet, but I can't help but think about what it could look like. Controls are fairly tight once you get the hang of it, but it's one hell of a hard game to handle at times. When you reach top speeds, if you hit one thing wrong, you're sent flying all over the track with little to no chance of recovery.

A welcome change. Thank you.]\n\nThough GRIP is now more than a year old, I can recall only the vaguest memory of it before its current multiplayer iteration. And that is a great shame, since it\u2019s quite a remarkable game. This week it\u2019s my favorite (non-pinball) game, and that\u2019s even including some wonderful racing/driving games. But it\u2019s not perfect...\n\n(For this review, I consider SINGLE-PLAYER only. At least for now.)\n\nGRIP, as the Store Page indicates, is a futuristic racing game, taking place on other planets with a varied selection of technologically advanced vehicles. What really makes these \u201ccars\u201d stand out\u2026.they can\u2019t land wrong! (Other than backwards.) Because of design, whatever side they land on is the bottom, and they can instantly GO!!!...reaching speeds of about 600 MPH (1,000 KPH.) Of course, at those speeds, steering requires some substantial degree of precision, and even a small bump (or impact) can send a car HUNDREDS of feet into the air........!\n\nWhat makes GRIP special? You don\u2019t have to be a great driver-gamer to have fun, or even to do well. While an experienced driver will certainly have an edge (especially with \u201cnewbie buttons\u201d turned off), unlike most racing games, any player should outright WIN some percentage of races. And there\u2019s even a \u201cbail-out\u201d button; holding the \u201crespawn\u201d button will get you back in the race with little time or distance lost, almost no matter the situation you may be in.\n\nGRIP is hard to explain. The vehicles basically \u201cstick\u201d to the track, so players will often find themselves traveling at high speeds\u2026\u2026completely upside down. And that's often not obvious until something goes wrong, and gravity instantly takes control.\n\nThe GRIP tracks are beautifully designed for functionality, as well as appearance. The Store Page trailers and screenshots say more than my words can begin to express (so I won\u2019t try, except to say that what they add to the game can\u2019t be measured.) Most tracks offer shortcuts that may offer an advantage\u2026.. if you dare! I expect to still be discovering new nooks and crannies for quite some time.\n\nThe GRIP cars offer features very specific to players\u2019 driving styles. Fortunately, I quickly found a car that suits beginning drivers (such as myself); slower, but with maximum control (and at average speeds of 250 \u2013 300 MPH, good to have.) None of the cars are locked (and in fact, nothing in GRIP is locked at this point.) But none of the cars can be upgraded either. Yes, their color and rims can be changed (yawn), as can the tires. But does a tire change alter performance? Hard to say, and GRIP isn\u2019t talking (that I could find.)\n\nThe GRIP game modes are pretty standard. Simple racing (yet with weapons. Strange.....), battle racing, elimination racing and best time with one player only. For beginners, I\u2019d strongly suggest the time trials. Being on the course alone is the best way to learn the tracks. (Although just being thrown unto an unknown track with nine other racers has a certain undeniable, desperate charm as well!) There are also two Deathmatch arenas and something referred to as \u201cCarkour\u201d that one presumes to be a form of car parkour. I have little experience with either.\n\nWhile GRIP\u2019s best features speak for themselves (and LOUDLY so!), there are some less fortunate aspects that should be noted:\n\nWhile the tracks available are great, there aren\u2019t very many of them, and almost half of them are simply reversals.\n\nAlmost everything about each race is GREAT! But then what? There is no type of progression (at least for single player.) Presumably, much of the reason is that there are so many variables, possibilities and options, it would be difficult to create a standardized system of progression. Yet, it takes much out of the game (in this player\u2019s opinion) to go nowhere. For example, currently in battle races, the final scoreboard has to wait for all racers to complete to finish calculating (even if you're last), which often never happens, no matter how long one waits. But the player soon realizes; So what if there\u2019s no final score posted? It would serve no purpose in GRIP\u2019s current form.\n\nPickups are basically a \u201clearn as you go\u201d process, as well as studying the controller settings to try to understand how to use them. There\u2019s nothing even remotely like a tutorial, and that would be VERY helpful (at least for beginners.) Which is a weapon? Which is a tool? What do the symbols mean? How do you use them?\n\nGRIP\u2019s battle system is weak. Some weapons have little purpose, are badly utilized by the controller, and come with no explanation. (In fact, the only difference between the regular race and battle race is the final scoring method. This seems inexcusable.) The notification of points scored is almost meaningless. (Who did what, and to whom? Green text? Red text? Which name first\u2026or second?)\n\nPersonally, I find techno music lacks the sort of heart-pounding intensity I would choose for such immersive racing, but players have the option to race to their own music as well.\n\nThe cameras can behave unpredictably, especially if you happen to get turned around, or are involved in a collision. And more camera choices really need to be considered.\n\nBest scores aren't stored. What's your best time on time trials? Your best Battle race score on a certain track? Once you leave that mode, it's gone forever.\n\nWhile GRIP has many changes to consider (some of which will be dealbreakers for many gamers), it\u2019s still a fun game with lots of potential at a reasonable price. If these changes are made, this could be a top tier game. Otherwise, it\u2019s still a fun game, just not with the power to keep most players\u2019 attention for an extended period of time. (NOT written as a criticism, simply as an observation of a VERY competitive genre I've spent a respectable amount of time in.)\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1491587368, "timestamp_updated": 1505015260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724278", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30999890": {"recommendationid": "30999890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091602939", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507394821}, "language": "english", "review": "You can drive upside down. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1491581536, "timestamp_updated": 1491583565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30997388": {"recommendationid": "30997388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204710795", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491573051}, "language": "english", "review": "Theres only 5 circuits and my brain felt like it was numb after 10 minutes.\nLots of glitches on multiplayer\nluckily had an uninstall and refund option, i could use my controller to do that aswell", "timestamp_created": 1491573266, "timestamp_updated": 1491584768, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.386388", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30994997": {"recommendationid": "30994997", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998042773", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514741416}, "language": "english", "review": "I am not into racing games and I bought Grip for nostalgia reasons.

This game is based on a late PSX arcade racer called Rollcage. It was a futuristic racer like Wipeout and F-zero, with speed and course layout were the primary focus of the game. As with wipeout, Rollcage had weapons, which (if used correctly) could give you an edge or help you get back in the race. But most of all it was the rush of combining the speed, chaos and great music that made the game great.\n\nGRIP doesn't do much different than Rollcage did in it's days. It's still amazingly fast, it's tracks are still build to give you that awesome rollercoaster feeling and the music still completes the experience. But it only adds to that old Rollcage game with everything we like from our games these days, without taking anything away. \n\nThe graphics are great, the tracks look magnificent, with my avagage PC setup the game moves at a steady 60 fps, weapons look awesome and work like a charm the 6 cars (which differ more than enough) sound great with each car another engine sound,. Talking about sound, there is so much quality and detail in that department here. We got the different engine sounds per car, the speed boosts sound powerful, you can hear the drivetrain sqeak at high speeds, missiles and machineguns sound great and the music completes it. \n\nYou can do some basic car customisation by choosing the color of your car's paintwork, changing the rims and their paintjob and change which kind of tires you want on the car (although it doesn't change how the car handles). \n\nThen there are quite a few tracks and game modus (including a new online multiplayer) added to the game allready, but more will come. Tracks can be rough, which might make your car bump out of bounds, but resetting your car to the track is both easy and looks awesome too. \n\nThe best thing is: the action and fun is so good, that it doesn't matter if you get 1st or last. It brings a smile to your face and before you know it, you are in another race, having the time of you life boosting through upsidedown tunnels, blasting other cars away, dodging obstacles and enjoying the immense sense of speed this game gives you. \n\nRollcage is back, better than ever and now for the new generation to enjoy :D", "timestamp_created": 1491492720, "timestamp_updated": 1491492720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30979145": {"recommendationid": "30979145", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970827971", "num_games_owned": 758, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494585323}, "language": "english", "review": "A very fun futuristic arcade racer, lovingly executed.", "timestamp_created": 1491486478, "timestamp_updated": 1491486478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30971156": {"recommendationid": "30971156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035147341", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491554880}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh my goodness. I don't know what to say! I bought this game, having entirely missed that it's in Early Access, and STILL found myself grinning ear-to-ear and laughing - with no one else around - at how tremendously silly and fun this game is! What a gem! I can't wait for it to be completed. I never played the games it's based on, either, so nostalgia is not a factor, here.\n\nAs for the mechanics, the racing is glorious and smooth. If you see a smooth surface, you can drive on it...and ramp off of it, transfer to the ceiling of a tunnel, stay stuck to it somehow, come rocketing our the other end, land upside-down onm a wall, and keep going. The game also clearly tells you when a feature isn't quite ready for primetime: there's a work-in-progress map in the game, multiplayer is present but incomplete, menu navigation is limited to mouse input in parts...and I know everything is working as currently intended because the game is actually upfront with what's being worked on.\n\nOn top of that there are options I don't normally expect to see in cheap racing games (or, in fact, *any* arcade racing games). The HUD has a visibility slider, you can adjust the FOV up to basically fisheye levels, you can disable certain crash effects - although honestly the crash effects on the HUD are so mental that I love them, you can toggle slow-mo in a race by hitting Select on the controller, there are several types of game modes with multiple different types of tracks and arenas to accomodate them.\n\nI'm sure there are issues, and I've only played for an hour or so, but I have been enjoying the game so much that I had to close out and give it a hearty recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1491440797, "timestamp_updated": 1491440797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30970473": {"recommendationid": "30970473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116124263", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491598898}, "language": "english", "review": "Like the old Rollcage game but with modern graphics with the Unreal Engine 4.

You will only be able to race with 10 people at the same time anyway and you can connect to a race which is already in progress, although you need to wait till the next round. So as long there are more than 10 players in multiplayer you won't notice any difference between 10,000 or 100 people playing it, since you will find a lobby with players right away and can't play with more than 10 anyway. Also missing players are replaced by bots to fill up the field if that is the case.\n\nNow I am not sure how many hours I will spend in this game but it is a really fun arcade futuristic racer and is basically a true Rollcare remastered version one could say.

Isto n\u00e3o significa que s\u00e3o ruins, s\u00f3 que voc\u00ea meio que entra no jogo j\u00e1 \"Sabendo\" o que vai ver, entende? Meio que estraga o Game, se torna algo repetitivo. E as trilhas sonoras s\u00e3o bem alegrinhas, eu me sinto com 10 anos denovo, \u00e9 super divertido, recomendo ein?!\n\nMas falando de GRIP agora, e o que o jogo traz de novo e diferente:\n\nO gr\u00e1fico feito na Unreal Engine 4, traz consigo uma grande variedade de detalhes, de efeitos, e de op\u00e7\u00f5es para que os criadores do jogo possam brincar bastante com diferentes Power-Ups, Mapas e Customiza\u00e7\u00f5es de ve\u00edculo.\n\nOs carros em si tem um Design bem legal, nada muito diferente no entanto... Voc\u00ea pode customizar a Cor em diferentes areas deles, alguns podendo alterar a calota, e todos eles o pneu. O Bacana \u00e9 que cada carro tem Detalhes T\u00e9cnicos \u00fanicos, e ai cada pessoa desenvolve sua habilidade em um, seguindo sua l\u00f3gica na corrida XD\n\nJ\u00e1 os mapas tem um cen\u00e1rio bem desenhado, porem \u00e9 sempre ou tudo muito \"Met\u00e1lico\", ou muito \"Cheio de pedra\", ai fode n\u00e9? queremos variedade, Devs!\nMesmo assim, s\u00e3o mapas incriveis, de todos eles eu recomendo o Bowl pra poder zuar ;p\n\nOs Power-Ups s\u00e3o bem bacanas de usar, voc\u00ea pode juntar 2 deles e usar na hora que quiser, nada muito diferente...\n\ncara, sendo sincero o jogo est\u00e1 bem \"Completo\", nada vai fazer voc\u00ea pensar que ele esta em acesso antecipado, de verdade isso. Mas falta algumas coisas no jogo mesmo assim... Sinto falta de controlar o carro no ar quando saio voando da pista, as vezes ele cai todo torto e tu se fode inteiro :c gostaria tambem de um editor de niveis, ou at\u00e9 mesmo (assim como em outros jogos) que a comunidade pudesse criar os novos carros, power-ups, mapas, etc. Ia ser muito bacana! Sinto falta de algo visualmente mais atrativo no HUD, e o \"radar/mapa\" \u00e9 um pouco confuso, seria mais legal se fosse similar ao do \"The:Crew\", as vezes eu percebo que tem um caminho paralelo s\u00f3 depois de 5 voltas, se eu tivesse um mapa mais detalhado saberia exatamente por onde ir, e onde localizar meus inimigos no mapa, ent\u00e3o arrumem isso!\n\nPra finalizar, vamo falar da sua exp\u00eariencia como jogador, como ela ser\u00e1?\nAh, ai tu vai ter que comprar pra sentir!

I'm not really a super awesome curator review person, but, since it's had some attention I'll update it to be a bit more proper using Pro's and Con's\n\nPro's:\nVisuals are fantastic\nIMO the game feels kind of immersive due to way the screen has a visual effect at higher speeds\n\nCombat is well done without being overpowering, and if thats not your sort of thing you can disable pickups and use classic race mode where position determins a win.\n\nThe maps are varried accross different planets, each with a different enviroment.\n\nThe multiplayer is good and works. I don't have a lot of play time, but, I played several matches in arena and racing, and I didn't encounter any issues. Abliet the voting system did just recieve a patch.\n\nCons:\nSome of the maps can be quite difficult but are still a WIP. I played the WIP Sky track map today and found it somewhat difficult to get back in 1st after getting hit by a rocket on an upside down portion of the track which leads me to my next con\n\nThe Reset mechanic. It can be a bit squarilly at times, and is best invoked yourself rather than letting it do it itself. And even then, when you are reset on an upside down portion of the track, it can be very hard to get enough speed back up to not fall again to get reset again. Try and aim for a green turbo arrow on the track right away when your reset if in this situation, if there are any.\n\n\n------\nSo, thats a bit of an update to the review, yes I know it's not the best review, but, I have a huge backlog of games and ADHD so it's a bit hard at times for me to keep track of it all. If this review keeps getting attention, I'll try to update it as I play more. \n\n\n\nTLDR; It's a great remake of an older game with a pretty unique style of racing. I'd buy again.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n WOW. JUST WOW! I have played only 3 races and I am BLOWN AWAY! If you have ever played Rollcage GET THIS GAME! If you have never played anything like this, GET THIS GAME! GET IT RIGHT NOW! You will not be dissapointed. I actually felt like I was screaming down the track at 400+ KPH a couple of times.

It saddens me when I ask someone if they enjoy racing games, and they say 'no, I don't like Forza or Project CARS'. There is so much more to the genre than having the highest polycount vehicle model.\n\nThis is a racing game for people who don't usually play racing games. It's easy to learn but difficult to master. You can play it for 10 minutes, or 100. It's versatile, loud, engaging, and strikes the perfect balance of inducing righteous fury at the guy who hit you with a missile while not making you so angry you quit the game.\n\nMost importantly - it's fun to lose.\n\nFor myself, who grew up with Rumble Racing, Motorstorm, Test Drive: Eve of Destruction, and Jak X, I can immediately see that the developers care about what they are doing. The music is amazing, the environments are stunning, the motion blur is excellent, the particle effects are the right mix of sensibility and EXPLOSION. Each sound and visual is tailored so that you know exactly what is happening on screen. As your vehicle gets more damaged, your HUD begins to lose integrity in a fantastically thematic way. The vehicles feel meaty and weighty, and you rarely feel like a crash was the fault of the physics engine.\n\nEDIT: Okay, not rarely. Usually. The physics engine is the devs' current main focus, and while it's come a long way, your car will still do some wacky things on occasion.\n\nIt is in early access, so there are bugs. There is an excellent forum for reporting, and bugs are constantly being fixed by the dev team.\n\nWe need to prove to the world that games that aren't MOBAs, arena shooters, or freemium microtransaction stores can SUCCEED.

I would reccomend putting some taller walls on some levels so if you spin out or get flung you don't immediately get outside the intended play area of the track. thankfully there is a reset button which helps in situations like that but it's uncanny how many times I found myself having to use it because of things liek that. these are the biggest issues I have with the game but overall I see a lot of promise in this game and I hope as it develops we'll see some of these issues fixed. also just a suggestion to the developer, maybe add a turbo boost meter that fills up with boost pickups? I know you have turbo as a power up but I feel a bar that everyone can fill up and store for later use and use it up only as long as you have the turbo button held meaning you could just give yourself a nudge to get going again and still have plenty left over would be a very welcome addition to the game. getting up to speed after a crash is much to slow given how often you'll end up crashing from the controls and bouncy nature of the physics as it is right now. being able to get back up to speed faster after a halt would help keep the pace of the race going for the player. anyways I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a combat racing game for the price and I wish the best to the developer in making this game the best it can be.", "timestamp_created": 1488214094, "timestamp_updated": 1488214094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30220132": {"recommendationid": "30220132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064684304", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509116454}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome fun, Would recommend to anyone", "timestamp_created": 1488203795, "timestamp_updated": 1488203795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30183415": {"recommendationid": "30183415", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989819013", "num_games_owned": 538, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513369872}, "language": "english", "review": "Rollcage all over again :D\nKeep the DnB coming :D\nIf you like the review, give your neighbour a cookie :D\nAnd dont blame me for my bad spelling, im dutch :D", "timestamp_created": 1488074684, "timestamp_updated": 1488074684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548948", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30120600": {"recommendationid": "30120600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027198152", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511469035}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

Also that my views are based on that fact that I wanted this game to be NEXT RollCage.  \n\nIt had such a great start a year ago when I first looked  at it.   The vehicle and driving characteristics was spot on.  The fun and the edge of the seat racing was what it was all about.  Check out my first impressions back then:\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM-xEtZsmR0\n\nThen a year later I was told that this has been updated, more cars, more tracks and a huge overhaul.  I fired the puppy up and this is what I got after these major updates:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlAOTbX3PIg\n\nFrom my first impressions this has now been turned into a Mario Kart style racing game?  Gone are the edge of the seat driving physics and in most cases the fun.  \n\nIts a \u00a311.99 game and its been in early dev for a year.  Nothing bad about that.  But only a couple of new tracks, no default online multiplayer, still no menu pad controls.  \n\nAgain, its early access and I understand that.  But for the price this is being sold I got to judge it on what else I can get in that price range.   Looking back at some of the games released a year ago, many AAAs, some awesome Indies and at the moment this is falling well short.  Not to mention some of the great titles released cheaper and in some cases FREE?\n\nIt has the promise to be so much.  To take the mantle of the best racer in this genre.  But in this latest update the handling has been nerfed, none of the promises of the Multiplayer have come, basic menu controls missing.  Its transformed everything that made Rollcage a hit and replaced it with Mario Kart.\n\nIts not a bad game, its just not the game it wanted to be right now.  But for the price and what has been done int he space of a year I cannot recommend this game :(  I hope that things do change and I can do another one of these videos.  But for now it looks like this is going to be deleted from my HDD for another year until the next \"update\"\n\n*JUDGED FROM THE 15 MINUTES I GAVE IT, ITS NOT A REVIEW ITS MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS*", "timestamp_created": 1487072324, "timestamp_updated": 1487072324, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478580", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29915903": {"recommendationid": "29915903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088319927", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514103164}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u043e \u0436 Rollcage, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c? \u041d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c! :D", "timestamp_created": 1487057610, "timestamp_updated": 1487057610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29883140": {"recommendationid": "29883140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002982369", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507838743}, "language": "english", "review": "So you used to play Rollcage?

Remember playing hot wheels when you were young? \nShooting up your brothers and sisters' vehicles and learnig how to be a general douch, While occasionally pulling off stunts.  This game is Very nice and you would definitely get the same feeling from here. It's fast and the mech-like vehicles gives you a weird sense of badassery without doing really anything.\n\nThe only real Items I have to pick with this is: Lack of barriers, bounce physics and machine gun.\nBarriers because it is amazing to get on a mountain and be able to just flip or flop off of and back to stage.(Made me think of Mass Effect), BUT! flying off  into them amidst heat is really annoying. One major flop and that race is done. \n(Speaking of when online was to hit).\n\nBounce Physics. In some parts of the maps there are spots In the middle of the road where you can just flip out. \nSky Track Has landing points where you will pop off of the road, and if you have played the track for a long while you notice, falling off is the easiest thing to do there.  Missile? Off you go. Machine gun> Goodbye. Random wreck because all other racers spun out due to bounce? You know the drill. Just tone down the bouncing on the road. \n\nMachine Gun. This seems to be overpowered. I know this isnt finished but just so you know. Machine Gun makes the vehicles hit bounce and swerve (of course) as long as you keep hitting them. It takes down the opponents full shield and can still kill that opponent IF you tardet only him. All in one. Maybe im wrong ther, but i'm positive I've destroyed may cars by just slowing down and letting it go.  \n\nOh, You can glitch through Sky Track. Besides these, This is just an awesome game.\n\nLastly, I thought having to hand break just to make a small turn sometimes was a pain, but the vehicles are massive and it began to feel good.\n\nEdit: Last Last thing...

This is even being made by some of the dudes who did the original. nice\n\nAnyway, IMO:\n\n-Grip looks great visually and retains the style of it's inspired original very well, not just in the levels but the cars too. \n\n-Performance wise, the only issues i've had has been while alt-tabbing... nothing new there. Otherwise it's been butter smooth for me.\n\nThe controls and feel of the driving?\n-The speed feels great and faced paced once you get going and set up the race to use the faster engine types (a bit like mario karts 50cc/100cc/150cc etc).\n-The steering for keyboard users, I personally feel the steering aspect still need work, there's something about it i can't put my finger on but when going too fast or too slow, i end up losing my position in the race because i cant turn fast enough to correct a crash when im going slowly, and when im going fast i feel like its too easy to oversteer. A controller of some sorts is definately advised, as with pretty much all racing games. (or maybe i'll try and get my wheel to work...that'll be interesting)\n-Rolling in the air to perfect your landing is much harder than the original. it felt really slow to rotate and correct myself and by the time i'd started turning, i'd crashed awkwardly.\nBut who knows, maybe i just need more practice since i haven't played a rollcage-esque game since 2004-6\n-the weapons so far are a trip down memory lanealthough missing some of the originals, but this is early access at the moment and there's more on the way so here's hoping for the time warp, wormhole and ice sheet to come back because they were my favourites:fingerscrossed:.\n\n-The music, while i'm not a fan of the genre, it definitely still suits the game very well so i don't mind listening to it since it isn't bad at all... just not to my taste to want to listen on the daily.\n\nI don't find the price to be too high either. In fact I would've probably paid a little more, since despite it's early access, it's still a great solid arcade racing game, and also because im slightly biased and loved the original.\n\nOh it also has splitscreen so thats a great bonus.

(to at least 30 tracks or more)\nWould be cool if all tracks from Rollcage 1 & 2 could be easily added.\nPlease add so many tracks as possible. (i know you are hard working - later you could add more tracks - DLC's)\nThe tracks so far are fantastic. The new Islandtrack & Skytrack is awesome as the others.\n\nTop statement of the devs:\nWie lange wird dieses Spiel ungef\u00e4hr den Early Access-Status haben?\n\u201cThe \"final\" version of GRIP will be released sometime in 2017, though with the right support GRIP will never be final, \nas we hope to be adding new cars, tracks and possibly pick-ups throughout the game's life cycle.\"\n(yeehaw)\n\nReally cool music ingame. (I love deep dubsteb & trance - drum n bass not so)\nGreat that you implemented a custom jukebox for our own music. Thanks a lot, but your sound is also wicked.\nBut it would be cool for the custom music jukebox to choose a song from a list with numbers.\nOr at least a next/stop song button would be great. (+++)\n\nAir control \u2013 I let go of the gas as said on the loading screen tips but the control of the car in air is very little. (this could be a bit more active for more control)\n\nQuote\nRockets \u2013 However, it would be really cool if there would be a last-second evasive maneuver \n(a roll or something)\nMy proposal is that mines could have a second double click on switch after you throw it for 1-2 seconds as a timebomb for defending firstmissiles.\nIf the missile is few metres behind you could take a shield, emp, turbo or throw a mine and for 1-2 seconds you can explode it with a second switch on the same button with a small delay. \nSo that in other situations the other racers could react on mines. \nWhen you throw a mine ingame it has a delay until it is on the ground and activated. \nSo it would be good that you could not explode the mine until that delay and then for only 2 seconds time range to destroy firstmissles, when you are intime with a missle or racers. \nOtherwise it would be to much chaos if all mines could be timebombed directly or as long as the mine is planted.\nBut its only a tip for more defense. Besides of it - the devs will add Stingers and other pickups.\nI'm not sure if it would be also very good to differ the symbols for powerups (or differnt colors), so that you know what you could get for more defense and battle.\n\nSwitch target does not work and destructables couldn't be aimed. (i think this will be working with the next updates in some weeks)\nSlow Motion special - could you please make a time range of only 2-3 seconds and than only 3 times each race. (somtimes in hard situations i switch the digibutton accidentially)\nPlease add a replay after each race - i wish you could add the replay tech as it is in Project Cars. \n\nOk the graphic is cool and very nice - but compared to Project Cars or Redout it could get a bit nicer - better hd textures or whatever - for nextgen gaming 2017/2018.\nCan't wait to see *Grip2* in 3-4 years - hopefully. :P\n\nIf you like racing games get Grip.\nKeep up the good work and hopeful for a long long time.\nI am excited to see what will be added in the future.\n\nIt has so much potential.", "timestamp_created": 1484408455, "timestamp_updated": 1484415738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29249627": {"recommendationid": "29249627", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979894981", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1515442019}, "language": "polish", "review": "Stary dobry Rollcage :) \nGra jest dla starych graczy i m\u0142odych.\nMiejmy nadzieje ze sie bedzie dalej rozwija\u0107", "timestamp_created": 1484406855, "timestamp_updated": 1484406855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29233050": {"recommendationid": "29233050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105784224", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513425246}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it!", "timestamp_created": 1484343081, "timestamp_updated": 1484343081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29216213": {"recommendationid": "29216213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217721584", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492304429}, "language": "english", "review": "needs TRUE 21:9 support, tweaks to handbreaking and steering please", "timestamp_created": 1484277843, "timestamp_updated": 1484358486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459629", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29189154": {"recommendationid": "29189154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036220143", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511702416}, "language": "french", "review": "Rollcage est clairement de retour avec ce fils spirituel.\nMeme adr\u00e9naline, m\u00eame vitesse, meme armes et meme v\u00e9hicules en polycarbonate de kevlar (pour ceux qui avait le livret de Rollcage) avec une bonne dose de personnalisation des bolides.\nQuel plaisir de retrouver la sensation de rouler au plafond a plus de 400 km/h.\n\nGraphiquement rien \u00e0 redire, c'ets beau et peu gourmand.\nFluide et rapide peut etre manque encore un tout petit peu de dynamisme (trop de sensation de slide au d\u00e9marrage \u00e0 mon gout).\n\nPas encore de d\u00e9marrage turbo, peu de v\u00e9hicule et peu d'armes pour le moment mais les quelques deja pr\u00e9sentes sont deja tres bien abouties.\n\nUn petit manque aussi peut etre a venir plus tard : floutage des contour avec la vitesse ou pouvoir retrouver comme sur Rollcage le nez du bolide port\u00e9 au rouge par la vitesse.", "timestamp_created": 1484161911, "timestamp_updated": 1484162237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552326", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29118170": {"recommendationid": "29118170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043226294", "num_games_owned": 471, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483879881}, "language": "english", "review": "Its kinda cheap and so much fun!\n", "timestamp_created": 1483887699, "timestamp_updated": 1483887699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29115651": {"recommendationid": "29115651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058073709", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513796539}, "language": "english", "review": "aaaaah rollcage is back!

High octane driving that will literally make your head spin as you try your best to keep control of your car as you fly down the race track at 300mph+.\n\nWinning in this game isn't just about being fast, regardless of what style of race event you are entering. It's about driving on each of the beautifully designed and well crafted tracks intelligently. Using the multiple routes the tracks offer you to your advantage, using the speed boosts effectively, collecting power ups and using them to pummel your opposition into submission all the while avoiding their returning fire. The AI are intelligent and aggressive, requiring you to keep your tactics changing almost instantly on the fly throughout the race. (I can only imagine what racing against real people will be like)\n\nThe game also features a stellar soundtrack, it's one of the few games in my library where instead of having my own music blasting in place of the games, I happily turn up the in-game music and enjoy it. \n\nThis game is indeed a very worthy spiritual successor to Rollcage & Rollcage 2.

Mostly fun, however at this point in time there isn't enough content here to keep you playing.\n\nI'd say even though it's been out now for nearly a year, that this Early Access title is still  a little TOO early and probably should have started it's life as a Kickstarter instead of EA.  You might be best to wait awhile longer to see how things progress over the next 6-12 months.

The campaign mode is still up and coming, I know, and I assume there will be some sort of introduction there as well.  Maybe sort tracks by difficulty, also.\nIf you guys can get this game polished out and get some marketing for it- maybe get in contact with some other influential Rollcage fans (maybe Sony), and show them how great and unique the concept is, I truly believe this game will sell millions.

Wer Rollcage, Destruction Derby und WipeOut geliebt hat, der wird sich in GRIP auch sehr schnell heimisch f\u00fchlen. Es ist brutal schnell und durch die moderne Engine sieht es auch einfach nur verdammt gut aus. Der Spielspa\u00df kam bei mir allerdings erst nach 4-5 Rennen auf, da ich mich erst an die etwas schwierige Steuerung gew\u00f6hnen musste \u2013 um wirklich auch auf hohem Schwierigkeitsgrad gegen die Bots gewinnen zu k\u00f6nnen, darf man sich keinen Fehler erlauben und muss die wichtigen Item-Spots erwischen.\n\nAlle Strecken machen sehr viel Spa\u00df und die paar Autos, die es bisher gibt, sehen zwar irgendwie gleich aus, aber das war mir egal. Bei den hohen Geschwindigkeiten hat man f\u00fcr Optik in dem Game eh keine Zeit mehr. Daher finde ich es auch etwas \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig, dass man sich Reifen und Felgen auf-pimpen kann. Aber wer's braucht \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nWenn dann endlich mal der Multiplayer-Modus es ins Spiel schafft, d\u00fcrfte das Spiel noch mal deutlich aufgewertet werden.

Also, I wish I could give this a \"meh\".\n\nProvisional review: I got this game for $15.29 CAD, and I am personally excited for the game to be finished, but as-is, the content is severly lacking, especially less than two months before the targeted \"final\" release date.\n[b]Rant Incoming, mouse over if you care.[/b]\n[spoiler]Currently, the game's features, as compared to the aimed goals, are far below the values they hoped to reach in time for the release. There are only 5/16 tracks (not counting the hallowe'en tracks) from 2/4 planets, only two-player local splitscreen (although the beta currently has online multiplayer being playtested), no mod tools, and no career mode! According to the Early Access page, the developers have stated that they expect to finish \"the \"final\" version of GRIP by the end of 2016\". Considering that more than half of the game's content is missing just 8 weeks before their deadline, I am worried that developpment may be pushed back into mid-2017. From there, who knows when/if we'll ever see a final version.[/spoiler]\n[b]End Rant[/b]\n\nSorry, I just had to get that off my chest, first. Now, as for the game itself, it revives the long-lost art of \"non-Mario Kart\" combat racing: The weapons are satisfying to use, although I feel like the missle needs to lock-on and launch faster. The gameplay is fast paced, and the physics are dead-on, but I feel as though the combination of the speed of the cars and the fact that even the smallet barrel can affect the car's path, it leads to a few too many circumstances where the car flies up in the air and off course, in one case costing me the race. This combined with the fact that the controls (not sure if this is just me and my toaster of a PC) feel delayed at times, regardless of keyboard or Gamepad, and it could make races seem unfair at times, especially since the AI can be brutal on the higher speeds and difficulties.  Overall, it just makes me wish that I could pick a maybe for a recommendation. Ultimatley, I have followed this game since it was first founded, and have good faith that the developpers will do whatever they can to make the game better as time goes on.\n\nStill, if you don't have this game in your library yet, hold off for a little bit: Follow this game on steam, and once developpment gets to a point that you feel confident enough to jump in to try the game... wait a little while longer, at least for a sale.

The game harnesses super high speeds, resulting in very intense, fast moving action. You can find yourself being flung into the sky at points simply because you were going at speeds around 600 KMH, but this is not an issue in the more complete maps. Do not let the speed be a turn off for you however, as I would say its one of the most captivating mechanics of GRIP for good reason. To feel competitive in a race with such tremendous speeds around you, in such a way that your vehicle can drive smoothly up walls, is a feature found few and far in racing games, probably because its hard to utilise as a fun aspect of a race. GRIP executes this well with their tracks being built around many optional roads, shortcuts and large, curved terrain. This gives nice replayability with driving the race tracks, and can put forward different play styles as you go.\n\nGraphics: The graphics in GRIP are probably some of the best graphics I have seen of any racing game, to date. I have Play quite a few racing games over some time, and GRIP has captured almost perfect graphical immersion. From the textures on the car, to the back ground of race tracks, to the beautiful looking transparent shields, GRIP has shown no remorse towards a graphical component. When it comes to immersion, the game will produce a flame like HUD around your screen when you are hitting high speeds as well as a dust effect, having dots splinter your camera. You also see the physical gears of your rough gutted car switch as you gain speed. This game looks beautiful.\n\nContent: Of course, GRIP actually doesnt have a supreme amount of game to play currently as it is in early access. You will find yourself bored and wanting more within 5 hours of play time. As sad of a fact as this is, the developers are not weak with updates, most having content around 1.5 GBs, so you will always have something to toy around with on new updates. However as it stands now, you will run out of things to do quite quickly.\n\nI reccomend it. I encourage that you dont fear a lack of content, as it is dispensed some what consistantly. This game has mega potential, as I am sure you will feel when you try it for the first time.", "timestamp_created": 1477823486, "timestamp_updated": 1477823486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26297059": {"recommendationid": "26297059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251510766", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501360577}, "language": "czech", "review": "Nev\u00edm jestli to bylo Halloweensk\u00fdm updatem nebo prost\u011b jenom t\u00edm, \u017ee je hra v early accsess, ale hned p\u0159iprvn\u00edm spu\u0161t\u011bn\u00ed je sekla a bylo nutn\u00e9 restarovat po\u010d\u00edta\u010d.

The style and atmosphere is top notch imho.\n- the gameplay is ..kinda insane. car combat on 400-700+ km/h (300-400+ mph)+ speeds..\n- ride on walls and ceilings, nothing should stop a speed demon.\n- very fun if you don't fear death or epilepsy. Feels like Neo Tokyo racing scene at times.\n- Great to play sober and not... (I consider it a bonus) Just don't expect to win at that point. \n\n- different weapon pickups aswell as boost/shield pickups and more. \n- Boost pads on tracks to keep your momentum going if you can handle it.\n- different Game modes (more Combat or Speed/final placement focused racing, Arena, Sudden Death etc.), options to choose from (Reverse track!/Mirror Track!/ CatchUp/Laps/Destructible cars etc.)\n- selection of planets, each containing varried tracks for racing with alternate paths to take on and master each of them.\n- its raw, it will neeed more development time to go and all that... and who knows what will be added/changed.\n\n- It got 4 cars at the moment each with its own character, with color/rims/tires customisation. Naturaly, all of them are insane in their own right, depends on how you like your endorphin delivered.\n- multiplayer is in early development/test stage. Split screen available !\n- hard to learn, harder to master. \n- begs for a steering wheel/joystick to get the maximum control of your own death...when the speed gets to 600+ km/h\n- You can already feel like Yuri Gagarin.

What an awesomely spectacular game!\n\nIt is fast-paced combat racing the way it should be.  Beautifully flowing tracks and intense speed.  At 400+ km/h you're almost a fighter pilot :) ... and you WILL be doing some flying.  Futuristic-looking.  Different planets with different tracks that are gravity-defying and alinear - up becomes down and down becomes up and the tracks split off to form alternative routes.  I totally love the roll-cage thing: you keep going even when the car flips over.  You have a range of weapons to keep your competitors at bay: rockets, guns, shockwaves, mines ...\n\nEven if you're not a big fan of racing games, like me, you might be surprised by this one.

The somewhat aenemic lineup of cars and tracks has been filled out with more to come. The physics have greatly improved and the cars are far less prone to floating about when you ramp off obstacles within the circuits. Track detail is excellent and the art is great all around. Grip looks terrific with nice sound effects and a very good neurofunk style soundtrack.\n\nThe price is right and the devs have been updating the game regularly, if you ever played the original Rollcage games and enjoyed them or have enjoyed more current combat racing games like Blur or Split/Second you should definitly pick it up.", "timestamp_created": 1471753394, "timestamp_updated": 1491431668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25044972": {"recommendationid": "25044972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326012132", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509457084}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly amazing game, I've played Rollcage on the PS1 and this is an awesome remake.

There's even a missile with a blue smoke trail that goes for the guy in first reminicent of the blue shell from Mariocart, which is always a good laugh (unless you're in first).  The car choice is very limited with mulitple colorations for the 2 choices, but this isnt really a bad thing.  The tracks are mostly well designed and thought out quite nicely.  The scenery of each track is great to look at too, especailly when you crash into something and come to a dead stop (then you can really enjoy the view!).  \n\nThe controls for the game, overall, are very responsive which is great.  However, there are times where, when your car catches air, the vehicle controls about as well as a paper plate with a radio transmitter on it with you telling it through a microphone to turn left or right depending on where the track goes. This can be frustrating mainly due to the fact that you can throw yourself off the track by mistake, ruining the great positioning you achieved.  Now, this isnt game breaking by any means, but its still quite the annoyance when your car bumbs into a rock going 300 mph which sends your car tumbling and skipping along the track every which-way making it all the more difficult to regain control and get your car moving in the right direction again.  But getting a better feel for how the tracks are and how your car handles on them can compensate for this later on.\n\nThe A.I. is also good.  They are about as competent as you are on the track and can mess up the same as a normal player would.  If the A.I. becomes too challenging for you, there are adjustments in the game that makes it so the computer wont completely leave you behind, giving you a chance to catch up.\n\nThere are a few things still needing improvements on, but the developers are excellent in recognizing potential problems and correcting them.  They are deligent in keeping their game as balanced yet fun as possible.\n\nOverall, if you have 15 bucks to spare and are in the mood for EXTREMELY fast paced racing, i highly recomend this game. \n\n9/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1471327690, "timestamp_updated": 1471327690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24944437": {"recommendationid": "24944437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108099827", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504979478}, "language": "english", "review": "elimination mod is the funniest stuff I ever played in my gamer life, i'm not kiding !

The missile pathing still needs some work, but the devs have been on that from the getgo, trying to get it right.

Don't worry too much, as the devs have tweaked the physics in every patch, and are trying very hard to get it right.\n\nNow, is the game worth the price? Eehhh.....maybe. Depends on you really.

Bit of a fan of the original Rollcage, even if I did find it tricky. This game has a futuristic cool very much like Wipeout, another favourite of mine. If anything this is cooler, with its grungy electro, DnB sountrack.\n\nSince I last played, the control feels tighter, and more responsive. Although you can still easily take off and seemingly spend an age in the air. I think the vehicles could use more weight to bring them down when airborne. Also air control.... Let go of the gas and steer left or right. Ok, and what does that do? I have yet to notice it doing much at all. Once airborne you can pretty much kiss that lap goodbye in a lot of cases.\n\nI do like the fact this game rewards a more careful use of braking and acelerating than some arcade racers, and the handrake will be something I have to decide to use now and again. It is a game that rewards mastery of its precise controls. That being said, they may alienate some people looking for a more instantly pleasing racer. \n\nSo in these early stages it is playable and improving, if not exacty innovating in any way. Maybe that is a gamble they don't want with this first \"Grip\", but I hope it is popular enough for a sequel which experiments with the weaponry and tracks and adds something new to the mix..

Where were going we don't need 'roads' \" \n\nA great futuristic racer with all of the familiar \"tropes\" from what made the original inspiring series so awesome.\n \nTLDR: Worth Buying! Great graphics, sweet electronic tunes and fluid controls.\n\nSleek design, a unique mechanic of driving on any surface at high speeds, and the unbridled speed and chaos of launching yourself at high velocity into a wall only to barrel off and continue blazing along down the track. This stays true to its source material by including a great soundtrack with heavy electronic tunes that blast along as you continue down the track. Some cool weapon pickups (I wish the warphole weapon of the original were here still!) and great track design.\n\nIf you remember the PS1 era futuristic racer (Rollcage) this has all the original trappings of that great series and more, presented with a stylish visual update. If you're a fan of futuristic racing games or racing games in general it deserves a playthrough especially if you have never experienced the series before. \n\nAs far as future content goes, the tracklist is very limited as of 07/22/16 at  there are only 4 tracks and no League Mode as of yet. It appears the developers intend to include at least league mode. Hopefully some tracks similar to the levels in the original i.e. a downtown metropolis / futuristic city, a coastal area with building struts you can take out to take down buildings, a lava level, etc... Would be great to see! What matters is what content that is presented is very well done. I almost feel I could do without the playground, deathmatch, and elimination modes in favor of a more robust league / cup tournament mode and more levels. \n\nIf you're a fan of the old series Rollcage it's a no-brainer purchase. If you're a fan of racing games otherwise, it's worth experiencing. If you're a fan of electronic tunes and futuristic stuff / cart esque racers with weapon pickups, you'll probably dig it.

With very nice looking graphics and nice soundtrack, the game can be an adrenaline rush. It\u2019s a racing game where you can drive on walls and even the ceiling upside down. This takes racing to another level as you can use the terrain to your advantage. Combine that with weapons and power ups it\u2019s a really nice game. It\u2019s in early access at the moment so you can expect bugs and such.\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n\nThe graphics looks absolutely gorgeous in this game. It runs on Unreal 4 engine so you can expect some nice graphics. The maps also look very themed, like the snowy track is dark and really feels like you\u2019re racing in the snowy mountains. Plenty of option in the graphics menu as you can expect from any Unreal engine based game. I played the game on high settings (maximum is the EPIC setting.) and I was getting 40-60 FPS throughout.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\n\nThe music in this game is sort of a hybrid between techno and a little bit of metal thrown in. It\u2019s very upbeat and fuels your adrenaline you get from the races. This sort of music is well suitable for a fast paced combat racing game. The good thing about music in this game is that you can individually select the tracks you like and turn the others off. There are a total of 10 tracks as of this review.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nAt the moment you can only play 1 player or 2 player split screen. The split screen can be done horizontally or vertically. There is no campaign or multiplayer mode as of now but the developers are working on it. The car has huge wheels with the body in the middle so the wheels are sticking out on top and bottom, this means if the car even gets flipped upside down, you can keep going.\n\nThere are many types of games you can play. Simple race, elimination, deathmatch, playground and time trial. All of these are pretty fun. Simple races are regular races where you have to complete a number of laps and whoever finishes first wins, if you get hit by enemy missiles or gun you will respawn. The Elimination is also like racing except when you eliminate someone they\u2019re permanently out of the race. Deathmatch is a car arena where you have a certain number of combatants and you must go around collecting power-ups and trying to eliminate others. Last one standing wins the match. The playground is also arena with all sorts of tunnels, pipes, half-pipes and other obstacles and there are a certain number of collectibles you must pick up within the allotted time. The time trial is basically you trying to do the track in best time.\n\nYou get pickups and you can hold 2 pickups at one time. The first one can be triggered using the shift while the second can be triggered by pressing the control key on the keyboard. These power ups include a machine gun, missiles and mines. There\u2019s also the nitro boost speed power up and another protection power-up which sort of gives you armor at the back of your car so you can defend against machine gun or missiles attacks from behind. \n\nThere\u2019s a total of 2 racing tracks, 2 combat arenas and 1 playground map at the time of this review. The developers are working on more maps and more content. So keep an eye out for future updates which can make this game even better. \n\nA gameplay video of a race I did can be found below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=724952100\n\n[b][u]Graphics: 8/10[/u][/b]\n[b][u]Sound: 7/10[/u][/b]\n[b][u]Gameplay: 8/10[/u][/b]\n[b][u]Overall: 7/10[/u][/b]\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nThe game has very fast paced adrenaline fueled combat racing.  Arcade type of racing with weapons combat. You can drive on walls, ceilings of tunnels, sides of the mountain basically any terrain. The camera will follow you no matter how many times you flip upside down inside of a tunnel, this makes it a very fun experience in my opinion. The game certainly has bugs and low FPS from what I could tell but it\u2019s in early access, so the developers are ironing out the bugs hopefully.\n", "timestamp_created": 1468588089, "timestamp_updated": 1468588089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24315670": {"recommendationid": "24315670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281446209", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478265766}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a vehicular combat game with high pace racing in tracks that use your car's ability to run upside down also.

With beautiful visuals and a heart-pumping soundtrack, GRIP is a fantastic way to release any pent up destructive tendencies. Note: GRIP is still in [b]Early Access[/b]. There is currently no online multiplayer or campaign mode as of yet, but the game is still extremely promising. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[u][b]Game Modes[/b][/u]\nGRIP can be played either solo, or with a local coop buddy. There is currently no multiplayer/campaign [i]yet[/i]. To start a match, you must first choose a game mode, then a planet and track/arena. There are 8 different maps, some are WIP, available for play at the moment with a few tracks that are mode-exclusive. Each game mode can be customized by changing various settings, such as: No. of laps/combatants, difficulty, reversed/mirrored tracks, etc. The included game modes are:\n\n[list]\n[*]Races\n[*]Elimination\n[*]Deathmatch\n[*]Playground\n[*]Time Trial\n[/list]\n\n[u][b]Item Pickups[/b][/u]\nPickup platforms are placed throughout the levels which provide the player with weapons or powerups, such as:\n\n[list]\n[*]Raptor: high-impact machine gun.\n[*]Scorpion: homing missile that targets the opponent in front of you.\n[*]Assassin: tracking missile that targets the current opponent in 1st place.\n[*]Quaker: proximity mine.\n[*]Aegis: rear-facing shield.\n[*]Firestorm: turbo-boost.\n[*]EMP: EMP that shuts down opponents' engines. \n[/list]\n\n[u][b]Video Gameplay (15 min)[/b][/u]\nhttps://youtu.be/d5Ht7D3tHtc \n[h1]Controls[/h1]\n[u][b]Handling[/b][/u]\nGRIP's vehicular handling is not as tight as a kart racer, nor is it as realistic as a racing sim (for obvious reasons). The cars seem to be designed to go airborne, careen out of control or switch perspectives very often as you are essentially controlling an RC flip car. Although the handling is perfectly acceptable if these are the design intentions, controlling the cars are not as fluid as I had hoped. The developers are aware of this and the collision physics are a WIP. A couple suggestions that may help improve handling experience are listed below, however, I understand it may be very difficult to actually incorporate them. \n\n[list]\n[*]Increasing the vehicle\u2019s weight, or sense of one. \n[*]Reducing the reliance of releasing the accelerator to improve control; allow for strict handbrake control at full acceleration.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n[u][b]Art & Sound Design[/b][/u]\nGRIP's visuals are truly magnificent. The tracks are extremely varied from each other with regards to level design, aesthetics, and environments. The different biomes you can race or battle through can be extremely luscious, barren or frigid; however, what remains the same is that the graphics are so good that they can sometimes distract you from the main objective. The accompanying EDM and fast-tempo soundtrack also does a fantastic job keeping you focused and immersed while providing a sense of speed and adrenaline rush.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[u][b]Early Access[/b][/u]\nFor those that are not aware of the Early Access concept, it is perfectly acceptable for bugs to be present (only minor ones observed) and game mechanics to be missing. According to the Early Access notes:\n\n[i]The full version of GRIP will have 12 cars (3 classes), 16 tracks (4 planets), 10 pickups, career mode, arcade mode, arena mode (with arenas), precision mode (with a few tracks), multiplayer (online or local LAN and split-screen), mod tools for custom cars, and (depending on funding moving forward) a track editor so players can build their own courses. Our goal is to have the \"final\" version of GRIP by the end of 2016, though with the right support GRIP will never be final, as we hope to be adding new cars, tracks and possibly pick-ups well into 2017. [/i]\n\nThe developers have shown interest in maintaining GRIP\u2019s balance and development progression as seen in the major monthly patch notes [url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/396900/announcements/]here[/url], and active responses in the Discussions board.\n\n[u][b]Verdict[/b][/u]\nGRIP is an extremely promising, albeit limited-content, combat racer/arena battler. With its impressive visuals, level design and combat mechanics, I can easily recommend this game to battle racing/arena fans; however, it is understandable to want to wait until the game releases career/multiplayer modes (local coop is already supported). For those that pick-up the game right now, understand that you have the power to help guide the developers with their balancing tweaks and feedback suggestions. They are very receptive and seem to incorporate player responses fairly well. \n\n[table][tr][td]Review copy provided by Caged Element Inc.[/td][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1468435183, "timestamp_updated": 1468447551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609930", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24250066": {"recommendationid": "24250066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113315448", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501635560}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is turning out to be awesome!!\n\nWasn't sure about it at first with it still been in early access, but i was really suprised at how good it is and how well the devs have done with this idea.\nWith each update it just gets better, with good tweaks to the game and new stuff added.\nSo far its got some great fast tracks with weapons and powerups in there, plus events like deathmatches in huge areana's.\n\nReally looking forward to playing the multiplayer in the future, hoping it gets added to the game soon in the next few updates! :)", "timestamp_created": 1468229921, "timestamp_updated": 1468229921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550820", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24245137": {"recommendationid": "24245137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004577008", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468803383}, "language": "english", "review": "I just bought GRIP and played it for about two hours today.

And they don't hesitate in using them on you......   \n\nBetween the sexy graphics, blistering speed, intense sound effects, pumping electronic musica and general mayhem, it's enough to leave you feeling a bit woozy. \n\nAt this point that's the only downer with GRIP - as much as it's sensory overload for your brain, it's also a little bit more than the camera can keep up with at times. However that can be easily fixed as the game develops. This is otherwise pretty polished for Early Access, though considering they previously developed two Rollcage games that's hardly surprising as this is, well, Rollcage in all but name.\n\nThe content is a bit small at the moment, and online play isn't implemented yet, but the early signs are very encouraging. And it's super fun......but sick bags are not included with a purchase of the game.

Your cars flip and tumble like crazy and your weapons are more destructive than ever.

Also learning how to cop a hit can save you from spinning out from a missile\nDifferent day, different mode \u2013 Multiple modes of play are fun. You have standard races, elimination races, battle arena mode and time trial will keep you occupied\nDiverse tracks \u2013 all the tracks are very distinct and have their own unique feel. You can also reverse and mirror the tracks too\n\nCons:\nToo easy \u2013 at first I struggled to take first position, but now I can snatch the trophy even when giving the AI a lap lead\nPhysics are inconsistent \u2013 much better than what they used to be, but the physics can get annoying when you\u2019re airborne or collide with other racers\nStatic tracks \u2013 at the moment there is only one track which can have its course altered by racers. This feature is promised to be fleshed out, but for now it\u2019s lacking\n\nPoints about early access:\nUpdates occur about once a month, but they usually have substantial content. The physics engine is being worked on, so at the moment the car physics are a bit wonky. But I like to think that adds to the challenge.

With a cast of some of the previsious developers of the original game, Grip doesn't fall short of taking me back to the days of sitting around my Playstation 1 whilst flipping my 4-wheeled monstrostity up the walls and through the air.\n\nAs an arcade-feeling race game, Grip delivers gorgeous graphics using the unreal engine 4 and a variety of colourful and challenging tracks. The vehicles have a gratifying sense of weight to them, yet they are quick and nimble enough to satisfy you speed lovers.\n\nThe soundtrack for GRIP is brilliant! With various artists providing their thumping drum & bass/ dance/ electro tracks you can't help but feel the excitement as you race. Not only that, there are more artists to be added as the game develops further.\n\nOverall, GRIP provides and fun and entertaining single-player and more importantly split-screen mode that follows the feel of the previous games. With a small selection of tracks to choose from and varying levels of difficulty and speeds, should you invest in this early release title? The answer, yes! While, at the moment, I would suggest there is enough in the current title to give you value for money. Clearly, this is an unfinished title and it isn\u2019t without it\u2019s minor bugs, but, these are minor such as the odd glitch or game crash here or there. I would expect that these issues are ironed out as the game progresses and I\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on this game, I am impressed and I can\u2019t wait for more.\nI really do think this game is going to be huge!

At the start, it all was looking promising. Dev team although comprised of just two people, was actually listening to community and doing their best to make this a spiritual successor to the Rollcage games. That however was then...\n\nAt the moment of typing this review, I've just finished playing the game after a few months break from it. A break that was caused with me not being happy about the direction the devs were taking the game. Unfortunately the game has exactly the same feel as I last played it... one could argue it means it's worse given how much more development time has passed since then.\n\nSo what exactly is the issue? The game is advertised as a spiritual successor of Rollcage, but aside from the cars looking similar... it feels nothing like a Rollcage game. The best way to describe this game would be... a mish mash of games like Rocket League, Mario Kart, Need For Speed and what not. This game lacks identity and you can feel it very quickly. It tries to be everything while at the same time it doesn't really do anything well enough to be anything. Racing gets boring/annoying/frustrating (feeling depends on the track) after just few laps, let alone few races. There's quite literally nothing that makes you want to keep playing the game. And that's probably the biggest crime any game can do.\n\nHere's a more concrete list of everything else that is a problem:\n- physics are still broken (after nearly 2 years in development...), you get random bounces here and there, cars take ages to settle down properly after a landing and it doesn't take much to make you crash. One could call the game a \"reset simulator\" and would be very on point with that description.\n- Acceleration is brutally low until you get to 350km/h. There are cars in real life that will beat you to 350km/h... production cars that you \"can\" buy. This means that the start of each race feels like you're in a slow motion and it only forces the \"reset simulator\" feel even more. Not what you would expect from AWD jet powered tanks with insane traction and brutally low centre of gravity.\n- Developers throw features at the game instead of actually tackling the problems. Namely jumping and nitrous. Jumping with few thousand tons tanks? You'd need a nuclear bomb blast to get those things off the ground, let alone some \"poof\". Those ain't RC cars that you can grab with your hand... and Nitrous? It only exacerbates the problems, since it barely helps with acceleration when below 350km/h... and there's already a pickup that is supposed to act like a turbo...\n- Pace of the game is incredibly slow and chaotic, rather than fast paced and brutal. By that I mean everything takes too much time to do, be that cars acceleration or weapons deployment time or the speed at which they travel and you have little to no control over what happens. In Rollcage you could always do something and everything was very quick, almost instant.\n- Menu navigation with gamepad/keyboard is still non-existent. Or should I say it went from working (not great but better than nothing) to nothing and ever since it's been \"gamepad and keyboard navigation is coming\". Yeah, right -_-\n\n\nThat's pretty much all. The main two issues are essentially the devs and... well... game itself being boring. Rest simply adds insult to the injury.\nNow to make this clear, I'm not expecting a Rollcage game with newer graphics. That would be a sequel. I expected a spiritual successor. In other words a game that may work slightly different but still has the same feeling about it. This feels nothing like a Rollcage game. In that sense it's a scam. If you're a Rollcage fan or simply value your money... DO NOT buy/support this game.\n\n\n[h2]TL;DR;[/h2]\n- Devs are no longer listening to the community and are throwing content at the problems instead of solving them.\n- Game gets boring after few laps. Doesn't keep you in.\n- Physics still broken.\n- Slow paced and chaotic gameplay, instead of being fast and brutal.\n- Keyboard/Gamepad menu navigation still not implemented.\n- This is NOT a spiritual successor to Rollcage.", "timestamp_created": 1463163311, "timestamp_updated": 1504877315, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1514885552, "developer_response": "Hi Ryu,\n\nWe would urge you to look again at the game as we've taken massive strides forward since this review was posted.

Now I am on win 10.\n\nSo to the game:\n. Graphic is stunning, UT engine is really doing his job at full force here and I played the game at maximum graphic level.\n\n. Music fits perfectly the game pace and puts you in the right mood of futuristic races, I really felt like going back to the good ol wipeout 2097 or Dethkarz (anybody here who played it? that was incredible!)\n\n. Concept is really well done, I loved the different ambientations of the three tracks I could race into. This is very important because a player really need to have in mind the world where the track is located and to have a clear idea of it, I mean \"this is snow track, this is jungle track that is desert, etc etc\"\n\n. Cars: that's where I would have to point something: I think it would be good to have more differentiation in cars, maybe on the aesthetics but most of all in stats. I was searching for car stats!!! (acceleration, grip, top speed, etc) \nMore car identity please!\n\n. I couldn't really understand the difference between the two leagues, except for car being a little more \"tanky\"\n\n. Playabilty: difficulty is not a problem, but car control it is. I know we are talking about a \"scrambled eggs\" race type game, but I played Rollcage a lot, in GRIP if you lose control of the car it's a bit more difficult to regain it.\n\nExcept for this this is a race game I was hoping to find and I am really glad it's in the making (and it's still in Alpha!)\nSo if you like the genre and you come from millions of hours of race with rollcage, dethkarz, wipeout like me, keep an eye on GRIP cause it really may be the present day futuristc race game we always wanted.

Its not the easyest game. First few tries I came in 10th or 9th but eventually you learn how the car handles and you are able to lap opponents, even on hard difficulty.\nI found it better with engine power set to high as the cars accelerate a lot quicker and therefor easier to recover when facing the wrong way.\na tip: set engine power to max.\nTrack design looks nice, but sometimes its (especially in the beginning or split screen) its hard to see upcoming obstacles. When you eventually know the track, you know where the are and ok to navigate around.\n\nI also found that the menu is not controller friendly. You really need the D-pad to navigate the menus. With the analog stick of an xbox 360 controller its easy to overshoot that option you want to set.\nThe AI is is OK. If you master the game its pretty easy to get to the front and stay there. Its also nice that the AI tries to block you when you are driving slightly faster just behind them.\n\nWhat I would like to see is that the AI accellerates of the starting grid. Now and then they hit the trottle a bit later, seeming they don't pay attention and you eventually need to drive around or into them. When a race starts, everyone should accelerate as fast as the can!\n\nPros\n- AI that tries to block you\n- Spit screen rules!\n- Grahpics look amaizing\n- Mediocre to learn, hard to master\n- Speed!\n- If you fuck up, it's really your own fault!\n\nCons\n- Recovering with low engine power is slooow\n- Sometimes the camera has some awkwark anges when hit by a rocket or mine\n- Still early access and room for improvements\n- Too easy when you master it\n- Menus are not that controller-friendly.

Es gibt 2 Fahrzeugsets mit verschiedenen Lakierungen, 3 Maps, von denen 2 noch unfertig sind und einen lokalen Mehrspielermodus. Au\u00dferdem kann man vor jedem Rennen verschiedene Sachen einstellen, beispielsweise wie viele Gegner/Runden man haben will, wie viel Power die Motoren haben sollen etc. Es gibt 3 Modi, beispielsweise das normale Rennen und Zeitfahren. Die Performance des Spiels ist schlecht. Auf niedrigen Einstellungen habe ich 30-50F FPS, die allerdings manchmal stark droppen. Zum Vergleich: Project Cars kann ich auf hohen Einstellungen mit 40-60 FPS spielen. Au\u00dferdem gibt es ein paar Bugs, manchmal gibt man etwas zu viel Gas und landet neben der Strecke - wieder rein zu kommen kann manchmal etwas dauern und man glitcht sich durch paar Texturen - sollte noch etwas \u00fcberarbeitet werden.

Since I bought the game with its first Release on Steam the Game changed a lot and this far mostly positive. The Developers listened to feedback from reviews and made changes or additions were they were needed.\nIn the beginning the Game had some flaws like weird physics, missing map borders and the Tracks were often unclear which lead to difficultys in navigating the vehicles. BUT at the current point these errors are all fixed an the Game is easily playable without encountering any Game Breaking Bugs or vice versa. For the Controls I can't say much about the Controller support because I never played it with one but I can say that it is nice to play on a Keyboard (No sluggish or inaccurate movements when doing so)! One Thing I still wish is that the developers implement mouse support for the Menu and maybe a Setting to enable a free Mousecontrolled Camera while in a Race (but this is also only because I am used to vehicle controlls used in Games like GTA, Watchdogs or the Crew).\nThe Game just looks stunning in most of its aspects, the Vehicle Models are well made, very detailed and are customizable like you want. Also they done a nice Job on effects of Pickups ecetera. My only complain is that the Game looks sometimes to sharp at edges due to its Anti-Aliasing (Which is a thing that is easily fixed with Postprocessing - in my case Reshade). Also I should mention that I never encountered any Crashes or FPS drops / spikes (even tough I only have 5 Hrs of playtime on record). Currently I don't know what I could also mention instead that I am truly impressed so far by the Progress this Game made. It probably will take quite some time until it is finished completely but it is always nice to just jump in a Rice against NPCs, which are quite challenging in my experience. Also I am excited for the Multiplayer when I finally get to chance to play it with friends. :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1457864068, "timestamp_updated": 1512855589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21804205": {"recommendationid": "21804205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096865908", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492954256}, "language": "german", "review": "Also erst mal bin ich Mega-Fan von Rollcage Racer und GRIP erf\u00fcllt meine erwartungen zu 100% \n\nIch habe es Angespielt und war sofort geflasht von dem Highspeed Feeling Tunnelblick pur.\nDie Steuerung ist auch super daf\u00fcr das es eine Early Access ist, ist Grip von der Technik her Verdammt Gut.\nDie  Ki sind Anspruchsvoll kein Gummiband Effekt die ziehen dich halt ab.\n\nUm mal auf den Punkt zu kommen Es macht einfach spass, ich bin gespannt was noch alles kommt.", "timestamp_created": 1457835543, "timestamp_updated": 1457835543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504946", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21803947": {"recommendationid": "21803947", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961725525", "num_games_owned": 794, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1516050869}, "language": "english", "review": "As an Early (early) Access game, this game has a promising future.

I haven't been this into a racing game in a long time! \n\nGRIP is basically a spiritual successor to the popular PS1 and PC classic \"Rollcage\" (both 1 and 2). If you don't know what Rollcage is, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXfbo9JPM9U\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ Beautiful Graphics (Once again, Unreal Engine 4)\n\n+ Runs very well at a constant 60fps with Vsync on at max settings in 1080p (Specs are on my profile)\n\n+ It's fast, intense, engaging, and consistant. This game FLOWS like no other racer i've played before!\n\n+ Weapon Pickups (This is a combat racer after all)\n\n+ Well done track designs, which offer you some shortcuts to either get ahead, or stay ahead of the game\n\n+ Splitscreen multiplayer. Again, we need more devs to start including this in their games. NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ONLINE ONLY PEOPLE! \n\n+ Playground mode, which is essentialy a free roam mode\n\n+ Time trial mode (I'm sure you know what this is by now)\n\n+ The floaty controls have been bettered in this new update. Cars drive much nicer now! As a result, i have now moved this to the pros.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Cars STILL bounce easily on even the smallest things. This can also be a bit annoying at first, but it can be funny when you manage to tumble into everyone causing them to tumble and bounce around with you XD\n\n- Still no mid-air control. You cannot steer yourself in the air like most other racers let you do, which can at times get ridiculous when you just cannot stop running into things and bouncing around everywhere\n\n- Arena mode is kinda lacking, but then again this game doesn't have too much to offer at the moment. I'm not surprised, but maybe this'll be more fun with a friend or friends.

Racing in the same league as the likes of Rollcage, F-Zero and Wipeout, GRIP brings futuristic combat racing bang up-to-date.\n\nUnlike in F-Zero and Wipeout, your racecraft sits on four wheels (most of the time), but you can ride up the walls and onto the ceilings of tunnels. The brilliantly designed courses go from narrow winding corridors into wide open spaces that encourage the daring racer to take shortcuts to attain first place. Much like in the aforementioned games there are plenty of pick-ups to grab. Speed boosts, machine guns and rockets litter the course allowing you to gain a timely advantage over your opponents. I love how intense the racing is in this game. Everything can change in a split-second, which is very exciting.\n\nApart from the standard races and time trials, at time of writing you also get access to 'arena' mode which throws you into a battleground against a number of opponents in a last-man-standing fight to the finish. 'Playground' rounds off the game modes in the current build, which challenges you to find all of the pick-ups on an elaborate testing ground. Even in early access GRIP provides lots to keep you occupied.\n\nGraphically, GRIP looks and sounds great. The maps are vibrant, the craft are colourful, it just looks nice. The soundtrack is the kind of techno that we've heard in other future-racers, and might not be to everyone's taste but the music's not overbearing and fits the theme nicely.\n\nEven in its current early early-access stage GRIP is shaping up very well, and might very well end up being a modern day contender to the brilliant futuristic combat racers of old.

It IS Rollcage 3, whether you want to call it that or not.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get into the actual review. This is based off of playing Time Attack for almost the whole time, and should be treated as such. \n\nThe sense of speed is exhilarating. I never expected to come into it and do well, and I didn\u2019t; the case was the same with the first two games. I crashed a ton of times on every lap, span off or did a 180, drove up the side of walls, left the track boundaries, always struggling to get back on track, and losing a lot of time in the process. But it never feels cheap, nor is it frustrating. When you do screw up, you always know that it\u2019s because that you just couldn\u2019t quite handle the beast that is your vehicle, and that\u2019s great, because Grip \u2013 and Rollcage as a whole \u2013 is not an easy game/series by any means \u2013 this game is [b]hard[/b]. It takes a lot of precision and skill to master handling this four wheeled juggernaut; the smallest mistake can screw you over, but it really is rewarding when you can get it under control. And even if you do crash, drive off or spin off a bunch of times, the game never stops being fun as hell to play. \n\n***BUG REPORTING STARTS HERE***\n\nNow let\u2019s get onto the bug reporting. As it\u2019s only 3 weeks into early access, I can forgive the fact that the UI and everything except the core game needs a huge amount of work. Still, it needs to be addressed:\n\nScreen resolution options: The resolution sets itself every time I click the arrow to go through the available screen resolution settings. So when I go from 1280x720 to 1280x768, screen flashes to black and then sets to the new res. And this happens for as many different available settings there are: the screen flashes to black no more than a dozen times before I can reach 1080p. We need to be able to click through them all without it auto applying every time: give us an \u2018Apply\u2019 button or a dropdown menu, the current system is far too slow. \n\nSecond issue \u2013 the res resets itself from 1080p (my selected res) to 720p when I alt tab out and back in, and to make matters worse, there\u2019s no \u2018Options\u2019 menu in the Pause menu. So all that time spent clicking through every available resolution to get to the one I need, down the drain. After that I just left it at 720p out of frustration.\n\nThe menus can\u2019t be navigated without a mouse \u2013 not even the Pause menu. I don\u2019t think the keyboard can be used either. So I can pause the game with my controller (for reference it\u2019s an Xbone controller), but to resume I need the mouse, which requires me to get into an awkward position so that I can left click resume with my left hand while keeping my finger down on the right trigger to accelerate. \n\nThat\u2019s the next issue \u2013 upon resuming the game at the Pause menu while holding down the right trigger, it does nothing: I have to release it and press it again to accelerate. \n\nFor some reason I can pause the game after I finish the race and viewing my \u2018You placed 1st!\u2019 (Hahaha, me, first\u2026) \u2013 This should not be possible. Nor should I be able to pause the game at this point.\n\nPlease auto-hide the cursor during gameplay, or when a controller is in use.\n\nThe hit boxes for the menu buttons are too small to be clicked with a mouse: the hit boxes should be the same size as the menu buttons themselves. \n\nOn the track Transport, on the planet Liddo 5, the frame rate gets cut in half every time I enter a tunnel, and returns to normal when I exit.\n\nThe setup menu needs settings removed from it depending on the game mode currently selected. AI difficulty, number of bots, and number of laps are still included in Time Trial mode, even though there is no AI, and there are unlimited laps. \n\n****BUG REPORT ENDS****\n\nDespite all of these typical Early Access issues (as is the way with Early Access), for the love of god, buy this game, and support the developers. You won\u2019t regret it, especially considering everything that the team has to offer in the Early Access description. I\u2019ve been waiting for Rollcage 3 for over a decade, and well, here it is. \n\nI was gonna give this game 22/10 but then the front half of my car got stuck in the ground when I landed after being launched into the air (fix this pls), so I\u2019m gonna take half off and say 11/10, cos the AI names sound like Transformers.\n\n\u2026\n\nFuck it, one of them is a Transformer and his name is Jetfire.", "timestamp_created": 1456352408, "timestamp_updated": 1456395858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502516", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21433155": {"recommendationid": "21433155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068442456", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499283198}, "language": "english", "review": "Aight so I know all the jokes surrounding games on Early Access, BUT MY GOD, if you ever were or still are a fan of combat racers, you ABSOLUTELY need to play and follow this game, cause it can bring the genre back into its former popularity. The game is only in pre-alpha (only 6 tracks currently, most of which are still under construction), but that alone is already more than just a proof of concept. The fun of GRIP is %50 competition, %50 sensory experience. I prefer to focus on the latter in this review, as I'm sure plenty others will make it a point to address performance/controls/UI (which aren't too shabby imo).\n\nSo, GRIP manages to create that rush of high-octane chaos when you launch out of the finish line and you and the other racers are funneled into that first tunnel section; where the boys get sorted from the men. You truly feel the sense of speed as dilapidated sections of blast doors and support columns whip passed you. You feel the weight of your tremendous battle wagon, HAULIN' it down the track. You feel the GRIP of your monstrous tires claw at the ceiling and walls as you ride them like a damn maniac. It is all just that wondrous combination of STEEL and FIRE and GRIT, all going 10fold faster than what you ever thought possible. I hadn't felt these things in a long time, until GRIP FUCKING RIPPED THEM OUT OF ME.\n\nAnd this is just what the early access pre-alpha dishes out...\n\nSo please, pick up this game on early access to support these awesome guys at Caged Element, and give them your feedback if you do, cause they're always looking for input from players on the forum regarding game mechanics, vehicle and track design, etc. We can bring combat racing back.\n\ntl;dr: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

If you don't know the concept of Rollcage yet: your car can drive on walls and roofs and it can drive both on its topside and underside. This creates an unique way of racing, because you can continue driving on falls and upside-down jumps. Combine this with various powerups as mines and rockets and you'll have a lot of fun. \n\nThe gameplay of GRIP is already very enjoyable in this early access version. It's combination of racing and weapony provides a high-paced and intense experience. The graphics are great and the up-tempo music really adds to the feeling of speed. With each patch, the tracks are getting better flow and many improvements are made to the physics. Besides normal racing, there are interesting game modes such as time trial, arena (deathmatch), and playground (capture powerups in a sandbox environment) . The powerups such as speed boots, shields, mines, rockets and miniguns are fun and are visually appealing. All in all, all the main elements that you would expect in a combat racer are already there. \n\nClearly, there are still downsides that can be expected in an early access version. Multiplayer mode is yet to be implemented. The content is still rather limited with one car and three racing tracks, one of which is heavily work in progress. There is also a noticeable framerate drop when shooting a minigun in some sections. Despite these downsides, you can have a lot of fun with this early access version. \n\nAs final remark, I would like to add that this game has a great development team.

The lack of air control, and steering sens being hard to find, this game is hard to love. There is no sense of \"god damn im going fast\" other than the engine revving with a deep bass and your tailpipe flaring, but thats only when youre in the last 3 spots and have \"catch up\" turned on. The tight maps (with the exception of the wide open jungle track thats still in early alpha as of now) are hard to navigate when you do get up to speed or have other racers around you. The collision in the game is made even worse due to the lack of air control or any kind of function to knock other drivers out of the way. If youre going anything above 300mph and hit even the slightest rock or a hair on another racers tire, expect to do go in a random direction with no chance of recevery except resetting your vehicle onto the track.\n\nHowever...even with all of these flaws, the game has the makings of an incredible release. Since the top hitting racing (car) games are Rocket League and anything involving Grid or Dirt Rally and, as mentioned above, Distance; this brings a refreshing 'grit' to the genre. It has the octane feeling of Rocket League, the cumbersome yet tolerable controls of Grid and Dirt, and the scifi thrill of Distance. I would very highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to jump in early on a game that could potentially be a heavy hitter in the racing scene.

A beautiful racing game with weapons on the unreal 4 engine? SIGN ME UP! This game is fantastic fun even in its early access stages.

Let me say, this game is HARD. Even on slowest speed and easiest AI. That is part of why I'm so drawn to it.

Here are my opinions, pros and cons.\n\nI only finished 2 races in the game and tickled with settings. Design of the game is pretty straight forward and fluid.\nGameplay feels like old rollcage and this is a good thing. Develoeprs should keep this unchanged.\nI'm sure tracks and music are gonna be realy fun and appropriate for the context.\n\nOnly downside seems to be high performance graphics card requirement. My hd 6950 is having hard time running on high settings. I think this will be optimized as days go by. But the important thing about rollcage-like game like this is to be fluent and playable. This game doesn't require amazing visuals and stunning environment. This game has to keep to action and excitement up, and the gamer on toes. I'm sure we won't have time to appreciate visual details as we are strugling through obstacles and doding missiles.

That one damn song that's been stuck in my head with the female's voice that makes you just want to drive faster. The wooosh of the slow motion power up as you eat deck and flip over in the opposite direction.. Ah the feels.. And this games revives them in it's own way! \n\nI always had Rollcage in my head growing up, game was old.. New consoles were out and I was moving on my trail of life. Till I saw a post of a kickstarter... About a game named Grip. And I looked, smiled, then perceeded to bottle my energetic feels of this game -Grip- Going. \"Its a Rollcage remake! Ohhhhhh snap!\" (Sadly couldn't get the founder packs before Early release.. O well, I just want to play the heck out of this game, and am and will!) \n\nIt's such a unforgiving game, which makes it great. ((Unless you use the catchup feature... bleh)) Which can get some angry, but it's how a race in the future with bunkers on wheels should be... Un forgiving, intense, mind blowing. This is one of those games that once you find your groove of a track, and you make mental checkpoints of where you need to be in turns, when to boost, and doing a loop in a tunnel to ride that lovely shoulder to lose little speed and fly past other racers. Gives you a real good feeling of being in the zone.\n\nI'm just doing these tracks AT LEAST once a day when time permits. Perfecting my -groove- and waiting for new tracks to add to my list. / The sand and spark pelts of the minigun as you spool up is eye candy, the subtle whine as the boost fuels up and you can't help but grin that wide as smirk as you watch a orange circle appear infront of your vehicle, as if you were re entering the atmosphere from space and reach 450 MPH plus! \n\nThe game is great! Is just all it boils down to. I can't wait for more to come, with cars, tracks, power ups, music, etc etc. ((The engine power being maxed at mid... That's going to be damn good when it's high and max!)) It's a game that if you love racing in any form, should give it a try, understand that the first couple races won't be good for you, and you use them to learn the track more than anything. Once you know the obsticles and hold momentum, you'll get a real feel for the game, and it's addicting.\n\n10/10 would recommend! -Just do eet, you know you want to...

It's similar but a bloody good reboot of the classic and does it justice already and it's in EA.\n\nIt's just as challenging as I remember but now you can adjust difficulty to your liking, especially with engine power. Jesus crank it up to just medium and the sense of speed is incredible, but very difficult to control (mostly because you don't want to brake). \nAI isn't f*cking r*tarded either so are strong competitors, there's no online racing mode yet but there's 2 player (I don't have friends so can't comment on this).\nMajor-ish problem so far is the camera, it makes it real hard to know where you are and what's the floor sometimes, if they made it so the car rotated without the camera doing so while flipping I think it'd improve things (especially if you get motion sickness)\n\nGraphics look good, nice to see TXAA being in there, but of course being early access at high you'll probably get 40-55fps on a sh*t tier mid rig like mine (all AMD, fx6300, R9 270x 4gb), sure this'll be improved later though. Also noticed there's not much difference between fps on low-ultra.\nPhysics are a bit meh for now but work fine between cars, environments can sometimes eat your car for a few seconds though (luckily there's reset feature). \nMaps are all nice but limited so far, my favourite is the newer one transit, lots of nice winding tunnels to zoom about in, looking forward to more planets and so on. \nThere's also only one car type but loads of paint styles, again it runs well and doesn't necessarily need a controller, wads works just fine compared to other racers. \n\nThere's also some nice DnB in the background that suits the game well, although a couple of the songs are really quite repetitive, even for a DnB fanatic like me who's been listening since I was 13. You can turn tracks on/off but now steam music is about I don't know if it's just going to clash with people already listening and end up being unused mostly.\n\nSome things I'd like to see:\n- body damage (not soft or FPS would weh itself)\n- environmental hazards; lava, ice, turrets, storms/wind pushing you about (optional for hardcore racers)\n- tazer pickup that fries cars nearby or sends them flying\n- customisable car parts, lights and so on, not an xp system though otherwise it'd ruin the pure fun of driving \n- John B DnB\n- a map which is mostly tunnel, with adjusting platforms to knock you about (call it claustrophobia or something idk)\n- adjustible camera, move it further away or closer or even a wheel view for the ones crazy enough\n\ntl;dr- yes", "timestamp_created": 1454969606, "timestamp_updated": 1454969631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21060782": {"recommendationid": "21060782", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970826416", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508094995}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game feels exactly like the original games with a modern twist.

It's excellent with a controller, and alright with a keyboard - but I strongly recommend playing with a controller.\n\nI miss the older, lighter, more chaotic handling. However, as it currently stands, there's the potential for a game that's not just a curiosity or a fun pick-up game, but a classic. A few minor annoyances such as snags on invisible parts of the map and what feel like overly-harsh collisions with the force-fields that now form the map boundaries need to be ironed out.\n\nThe game would also benefit from some more finished and polished levels that make the *absolute* most of the fun and exciting toolset they've got. The Hard levels they have are great, but some Easy levels that really flow (almost like a good Sonic level, with setpieces and the opportunity to really open up the accelerator) would really help to 'sell' the game to new players.\n\nEARLY ACCESS EDIT (11th February 2016):\n\nAs of the latest patch, the nature of the game has changed a little, compared with my initial review. Cars no longer feel like RCs and in general feel weightier and less flighty. It's still fun, but it's less radically old-school than it used to be. With the difficulty as it currently stands, I am able to win races, sometimes easily - I'm not sure how I feel about this as it seems a little odd after so many losses, but the game is definitely still fun. As I mention below, the main adversary is the track/environment. Winning is kind of ancillary to nailing a split-second manoeuvre.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nGRIP is an incredibly fast-paced spiritual successor to Rollcage.\n\nIt's a hugely difficult initial experience because the default difficulty setting is Hard, and it's hard to overcome the instinct instilled in you by most other futuristic or combat-oriented racing games - just hold the accelerator down. If you are having the same difficulties many have had with the game - failing to get beyond 10th place in Hard - simply slow down and don't turn so violently. A gentle touch is required, and contrary to what you might expect, it feels much more stylish to succeed in this fashion than it does to succeed with brute strength and raw speed.\n\nIt's nothing like most other racing games, because it doesn't come down to racing lines and subtlety (in the fashion of more realistic racing games), but equally it doesn't rely on ekeing out a lead with raw speed, or even taking out the competition in brutal fashion (as other futuristic 'knockabout' racing games are wont to do). These elements are sort of present, and they'll help to an extent, but they're not the main challenge, and focussing on them will harm more often than it helps. The main challenge primarily comes down to the environment, where hitting a single rock in just the wrong way can completely scupper your chances of victory. In this sense, it has much more in common with old-school games like Micro Machines than it does with its contemporaries, and you'll often feel like you're piloting an RC car in first person.\n\nUnlike many of the other positive reviewers, I sucked at Rollcage and I still suck at GRIP. I struggle to place 7th on the Medium track. And it's still fun! There are so few games where you can get your arse handed to you, repeatedly and thoroughly, and still enjoy the experience. A game where you can accidentally flip upside down from hitting a ramp too hard just as you launch a missile - causing you to spin right into your own missile and take yourself out - is definitely a game where it's fun to lose.\n\nI also recommend Arena mode, which is a lot of fun even against bots.\n\nMultiplayer is currently limited to (correction) two-controller split-screen, so if that's all you're after you'll be disappointed.

I quickly lost all desire to play after a handful of races. If you're looking into this game, it likely means that you already know what the positives are of the game currently, which is just the core idea behind it (It also looks nice, for what it's worth). Because of that, I'll only be discussing the negatives and why I don't think it's worth spending money on right now for most people.\n\nThe handling feels very sensitive to me. It's possible that it's just a thing that takes some time to get used to, but in a game where you need to fit your car into tight spaces and are driving down small corridors, I feel like it screwed me up a few times. Related to that, is the camera, which can shift wildly while your car flips or turns and sometimes lingers in an awkward position, making you feel the need to tilt your head just to keep up. It's unbelievably jarring, and I found myself getting completely lost in tunnels and ending up going the wrong direction by the time I got myself oriented again. The last problem that I have with the game is that it punishes you for being in the air by making landing cleanly very difficult. Very often, your car will lose control once it hits the ground again, which seems like a really poor decision to me in a game that's so arcadey and encourages you to do crazy stuff such as jumping off of ramps.\n\nThe game also seems to have some optimization issues and is missing some key features for its options menu, but I don't see these as huge negatives since it is indeed an EA game.\n\nOverall, I found this game to be pretty frustrating, and I think that would be the average gamer's impression of the game if they were to play it in it's current state, which is why it's very hard to recommend at the moment. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this game in hopes that they make some key changes to the game so that I'll want to buy it again once it officially releases.", "timestamp_created": 1454769650, "timestamp_updated": 1454769650, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551729", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20995750": {"recommendationid": "20995750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035075045", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497693983}, "language": "polish", "review": "To jest to czego nie by\u0142o na rynku od dawien dawna.

Think Trackmania mixed with Mariokart mixed with Rocket League, and you pretty much have this series of games, it's challenging, fun, addicting, and generally just really, really good. It's got online multiplayer planned, and unlike most other modern PC games, it also has splitscreen multiplayer available.\n\nI see that some people complain that the game's currently too hard, which is something I disagree with. Like most other racing games, the tracks themselves are bigger foes than your opponents. The difference being that this game, just like it's predecessors, kick this up a notch through a combination of neckbreaking speeds, tunnels, and obstacles that require skill, timing and precision to avoid in an efficient manner, but of course this becomes harder when the racers in front of you plant mines for you and the other competitors to hit, and the ones behind you fire various projectiles your way. It won't hold your hand, and nor should it. It'll be hard when you first start playing, sure, but this only ensures it being a satisfying experience once you've gained the skills required. I will admit that I find the game a bit too easy at the moment, if anything. In it's current state, the AI's pretty stupid and will do many mistakes, and the tracks themselves aren't particularly hard to master either (explained by the fact that only \"Easy\" and \"Medium\" difficulty tracks are currently available, with only one of the tracks being relatively finished). One thing to note however is that the controls currently in place adds some difficulty that wasn't present in the older games; the steering feels a bit clumsy and unresponsive, which is something I hope and think will get fixed fairly soon.  \n\nIt's also got a really stable technical foundation, beautiful graphics, and great performance, I've tried it on different hardware ranging from a relatively \"low-end\" gaming system with an AMD A10 7850K coupled with an Nvidia GTX 560, and a \"higher-mid-end\" system with an Intel i5 4690K coupled with an Nvidia GTX 970, and it runs really well on both, with the latter system running it with max settings in 1920x1080 with ease, making it a gem compared to most other graphically advanced early access titles.\n\nThe sound design is also really good, with satisfying 3D effects and feedback, albeit it's suffering from some glitches at the moment (certain explosions and bullet impacts sounding as if they're right next to you, even though they're happening at the other side of the track), but minor quirks like that are to be expected in such an early stage of development, and the developers are working on a fix. \nAs long as you like Drum & Base, it's also got an absolutely killer soundtrack. \n\nThe developers are perfect for this game, not only because some of them worked on the previous games, but also because they listen to and interact with the player base, not only on the Steam forums, but on their own forums as well, making sure reported problems get fixed, and popular suggestions get implemented.\n\nI think most of the success about this launch is thanks to the fact that these developers work out of passion. This whole thing started out of love for the original games, and even though their kickstarter campaign failed horribly due to a lack of attention, they still fought on and got it into a working state, as opposed to quite a lot of EA developers out to make a quick buck by catering to popular genres, and then more or less abandoning the project once a satisfiable amount of money has been made.\n\nOh, and if everything goes according to plan, which I have no doubt it will, we will also get modding tools allowing players to create their own cars and tracks.\n\nSo, TL;DR:\n\n+ Fun, addicting gameplay\n+ Splitscreen support\n+ Great sound design\n+ Amazing soundtrack (If you like DnB)\n+ The rare combination of good graphics and great performance\n+ Awesome developers that are actually passionate about their work and release good while listening to and interacting with the community (I.E how Early Access should work)\n+ IT'S FUCKING ROLLCAGE\n\n- The AI's currently a bit too easy/stupid\n- The steering's currently a bit unresponsive\n- Some minor glitches\n", "timestamp_created": 1454724807, "timestamp_updated": 1454724807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695197", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20983609": {"recommendationid": "20983609", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998346044", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514961150}, "language": "english", "review": "ROLLCAGE IS BACK !!!!

There are two full RACES (Yuri Industrial and Wastelands) along with a couple prototype tracks the devs give you to test out.  There are a couple ARENAS (Biodome, an XMAS Map [as of this review] and a test area) as well as a \"PLAYGROUND\" mode where, well, you just goof around.  \n\nThere is only one car, but a good selection of paintjobs to choose from.  You're able to customize how many racers are in the match, how many laps, toggle pick-ups ON/OFF, and set Engine Speeds (think CC in Mario Kart).  Only SOME of the item pick-ups are in the game as of now, but here's where things get good:\n\nNot only are some of the developers those who have originally worked on the RC games from 1999/2000, but they're VERY active in the community and VERY willing to listen to the community's opinions.  They've got specific checklists of suggestions for the games, bugs, what-have-you on their forums, and the updates they've given the game up to now have proven that these devs aren't simply another collective of empty promises.\n\nBut this is a review for the game, not of the developers, so here are my personal thoughts on how things are ->AT THIS TIME IN EARLY ACCESS<-.\n\nPROS\n- Wonderful Drum 'n Bass OST\n- Splitscreen multiplayer\n- Controller support\n- Graphically, the game is quite pretty (and I have to run it on a lower-res than most)\n- Driving 500+KM/h on walls, ceilings, driving loops in tunnels and cars that drive right upside-down or rightside-up.\n- Fast-paced combat racing shenanigans you knew and loved in RC (or hopefully will come to love if you're a newcomer).\n- The devs listen to feedback and work on that feedback. Hell, even the map-designers and the 3D modelers.\n- Arena and Playground modes give you a couple nice-to-have alternatives if you're not in the mood for just racing all the time.\n\nCONS\n- As of now, there is only one type of car. (More will be added.)\n- A limited selection of tracks. (More will be added.)\n- Some people may find the car handling to be difficult at first. (They're actively working out the physics.)\n- The collision between cars - and occasionally the environment - is pretty wonky right now.\n- You can't rebind your keys or controller settings (it will be implemented).\n- No ONLINE Multiplayer (it will be implemented after core gameplay is nailed down).\n\nBut I would always recommend that you check out some videos for GRIP to see if the gameplay is your cup of tea before purchasing, keeping in mind that some footage may be outdated (from the private Alpha test) as the changes that come with the patches often come in strides. \n\nAnd FYI, you can refund the game as long as you've played for less than two hours courtesy of Steam's refund policy, if it rubs you in all the wrong ways.

[/quote]\n\n[h1] It's finally here...[/h1]\n\nThe successor for the PlayStation and PC game, Rollcage, has arrived in full force! The current version gives us on the plate three game modes (Race, Arena, Playground), one car and plenty of stages for now. The single problem I had so far was the lack of control, steering of the car proved to be really difficult and I could not maintain my first place at all, I hope it is going to get fixed as soon as possible for a smoother gameplay, I pretty much felt like a newbie. It is one of the few cons I've found so far in the game, the rest of it is simply divine.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nGoing onto the game modes, race let us compete against computer controlled cars with some intense combat in the package, basically high speed chasing after the first place with miniguns and missiles. Sad thing is, there's only miniguns, two types of missiles and landmines so far and I'd love some more diversity in the weaponry, but it's early access so they'll probably develop some more in the meantime. While racing gives us a combat for the first place, arena is a merciless carnage where all drivers are put to fight against each other with the mentioned arsenal at disposition along with a speed boost and shield (They are also in the race mode, do not fret) powerup. Then, comes the playground mode where it pits the player to find all the 42 packages on a map that looks like a construction site but also gives us a few hints as of what destruction to expect later on (In the site map you can destroy walls, pillars) yet I ran into the problem that if you crash into certain places and get stuck you can't respawn but to exit and restart it from the start.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nThe stages are pure eye candy, just stunning and extremely detailed even for the ones that are prototypes. They all have a different setting which makes them unique but, there's something that bugs me and those are the barricades in the tunnels which are really easy to hit and can make you fall down in the leaderboard to the last place quite fast.\n\n[h1] OST & SFX [/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack? Drum and bass is enough for an eargasm and some chills down the spine as you destroy your way to the first place!\n\n[h1] Should you buy it? [/h1]\n\nGrip is already a masterpiece and has met my expectations. You should buy it as soon as possible, because this is a gem that shouldn't be missing from your game collection and its the best experience you can get for this price.\n\n[quote=] If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation] Original Curator Group [/url] [/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1454703410, "timestamp_updated": 1457184528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20976453": {"recommendationid": "20976453", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964104671", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515002555}, "language": "german", "review": "Bis jetzt spa\u00dfig.

We need more of these combat racers.  The graphics engine used is perfect, Unreal 4 does a great job here.  For an early-stage alpha, it shows great promise.\n\nThe problem is that I think the controls are a little sluggish.  I can notice at least a 0.25s input lag on every turn of the joystick.  It made it difficult to play, to be honest.  I'm normally very good at racing games, but this game made me feel like I had never played a racer before.  Each time I had to avoid an object, it was like I pressed the controls too late.  Even on easy mode, with the rubberband \"catch up\" mode enabled, I can barely avoid make last place in a race.  It's actually almost impossible for me, and when I compare my reaction times with something face paced like Race The Sun, this game feels like there is an old grandma at the wheel.  PLEASE make the turning reaction quicker!  \n\nThere are only a few modes right now; racing, arena, and playground.  Racing I found too difficult due to lag, and that leaves arena as a focus point.  Well, there are machine guns and rocket launchers.  It's very ordinary.  We need many, many more weapons to make it interesting.  But it's a good start.  Playground could be fun, but there's only one map right now, they should let us explore the racing maps and arena maps too.  In the one \"construction\" map, there is some fun to be had here, but a problem I had is that you cannot respawn.  If you get stuck, you need to exit and enter the map again.  There are 42 packages to find in the playground map, but you need to find them all before you get stuck somewhere, as every time you reload the map you need to start over.  Lame!  Let us just find all 42 packages once, or at least remember which ones we previously found, otherwise it's not an easter egg hunt anymore.  A fix for this would be to make the respawn button just respawn us at the beginning of the map.  Also, in playground mode there is some excellent examples of map destruction (walls to destroy, pillars) which I suppose are previews of what to expect later.  These are really cool.  But for some reason you can't play local co-op in playground mode.  This would have been the most fun!!!\n\nThe map design for the races are done very well.  There are only a couple that do not have \"VERY EARLY ALPHA PROTOTYPE\" plastered all over the thumbnails, but to be honest they are all very good.  It was never the maps that threw me off, and they are all very unique and well though out.  Except that one where you go through tunnels and have to somehow fit in a pathway that is the width of the car.  Please remove or limit the size of these little barriers.  I have never been able to make it through that gap.  It's a problem.  Especially with how sluggish the controls are.\n\nSo overall, the game is very hard to recommend.  However it IS an early access alpha, and it looks great.  It feels right, but not tight.  It's just in need of a few more maps and weapons before it's ready.  The hard part is done, now they just need to finish it.  I'm really looking forward to seeing patches for this game come rolling down the pipeline and to watch it progress. \n", "timestamp_created": 1454616430, "timestamp_updated": 1454616430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662793", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20953820": {"recommendationid": "20953820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054321417", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482530816}, "language": "german", "review": "BOAR DIESES RETROFEELING \n\nwar das erst an was ich dachte als ich dieses game sah das erinnerte mich an viele Stunden die man an der PS 1 hockte und mit einen Kumpel suchtete wie wie die verr\u00fcckten nie wieder gab es so ein game und nun ich bin total hin und wech ich bin gespannt ob sie da noch ein Online Multi reinhauen ansich einfach die Idee.

Simply amazing.\n\nThis game has potential to be one of the greatest. Being one of the few lucky individuals to beta test GRIP, I have seen this game grow.\n\nAs mentioned by others, GRIP was not created by a big game company whose only interest is revenue. GRIP is a small family of developers whose only interest is creating a really good game for people to enjoy. The proof is their involvement with the community. Not only reading people's comments/suggestions, but also taking part in discussions. When was the last time one of the big game companies got involved and actually listened to the public?\n\nGRIP is constantly being updated and improved. The music and the game go together really well. The sound effects of the vehicles and especially the weapons are really cool. The level of detail (vehicles, weapons, and environment) looks really nice, even when going 400km/h. The in-game play is challenging, even on the easiest setting. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game and for less than $20, how can you go wrong?", "timestamp_created": 1454601216, "timestamp_updated": 1454607955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20949920": {"recommendationid": "20949920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085796208", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512599767}, "language": "english", "review": "You can drive at 300mph shooting rockets and firing multi-cannons.\ni havnt had this much fun in a driving game for a long time.\nplease keep in mind this is still very early in development so the worlds are not as detailed.\nbut it runs great on my rig on epic graphics configuration. \nwould i recommend this game? the anwser is an EPIC YES.", "timestamp_created": 1454594516, "timestamp_updated": 1454594516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20949666": {"recommendationid": "20949666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069960991", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "last_played": 1515887334}, "language": "english", "review": "Here is a review of the game, from my viewpoint, as of EAbuild1.0.6.\n\nThe handling has undergone some massive changes since 1.0.4, and is doing amazingly well. Take a gender through the forums to understand why these beasts are suppossed to slew around after a sideways landing, they're freaking HUGE.\n\nThe weapons are as volatile and crazy as weapons should be. Never trust a rocket to go forwards if you're not facing forwards. That's what makes the way this game is being built so good, attention is being paid to all appropriate aspects.\n\nThe music is VERY good. Different from Rollcage (I don't think anything can beat Doubelcross by the ever prevalent E-Z Rollers) but very much in fitting with the game.\n\nBut the best bit of the game so far, is how everything works together. Yes, the driving mechanics will probably get tweaked a hundred times through development. Yes, the weapons will turn into pink unicorns at some point, just to see what happens. And yes, things are going to break, and be buggy, and just refuse to drive around obstacles...\n\nBut that's what's so great. All these bugs help shape the game naturally. It can actually develop, and not just be bashed together. It can be continuously tweaked, and refined, and purified until it is the best combat racer for a long time. \n\nBecause, at the end of the day, what makes the game great is how great it is to play. The feeling of the guns, the rockets, the way you can feel the car sliding, even though you're holding a controller and sitting on your couch at home. The way that you literally scream at your screen when an opponent smacks you in the face with a rocket, or tickles you from behind with the machine gun. It takes you back to the quintessential point of a combat racer. Driving fast, driving hard, and being angrier than everyone else on the track.\n\nSuffice to say, I really like this game.

First things first: GRIP definitely has the \"Early Access feel\" to it. There currently is only one proper vehicle (though in several color variations), there are not that many tracks yet, my controller doesn't work in the menus and it's a pain to change some settings like resolution. There are also some glitches and bugs I've experienced, plus the physics and collisions don't always feel on point. Yes, this is in Early Access and very much feels like it, so those of you who want an absolutely polished, content-rich game should probably wait out.\n\nNow on to the things GRIP has in store and already makes right - it is ridiculously fun and addictive! I never played the original Roll Cage, but I quickly fell in love with the concept. It's mad fun driving on the walls and on the ceiling and makes for a very dynamic gameplay. The controls, while a little tricky at first, feel tight. Just as tricky can be the car's behaviour on ramps and during landings playing it for the first time, but it's easy to get used to the physics. The sense of speed is in full effect, though it rarely feels like actually driving 400+ km/h ;) Still a fantastic feeling to drive past all opponents when the nitrous pickup kicks in! Speaking of pickups: The current selection of pickups offers the typical variants that I expect from such a car combat game. Nitrous, mines, shields, short-range miniguns as well as chasing rockets. Each pickup can help tremendously when used right, but also be wasted when the usage is timed badly. A great feature that compliments the pickup weapons well is the function to manually activate slow-motion. You can pull off very cinematic sequences with enemies losing control because of you shooting at him, causing him to drive up a rock, spinning uncontrollably in the air - all in awesome slo-mo! The game does a good job at presenting all the action that is caused by the sly tracks, by the use of pickups and by the AI drivers. I quite like all of the three AI presets that this game has to offer. But GRIP is tense even on the easiest difficulty, as a simple screwup or a well timed hit by an enemy in the last section of a track usually results in losing several spots.\n\nLet's talk about content, that is not too shabby considering the EA state. There are three game modes available that contain different maps and tracks. Race is my favorite and currently contains three tracks. Two of those are more or less finished as far as I can tell, with the third one being in an early work in progress state - still being lots of fun already though. Players have several options to setup the action on the tracks. Along with the difficulty setting there are options to disable pickups, to configure the number of laps (2,4 or 8) and the number of combatants (6,8 or 10). On top of that, the engine power can experimentally be raised and a catch-up assist can be enabled. I really like this option for a rubberbanding AI, as it can be easy to mess up and loose the opponents. This option helps catching up on the enemies to ensure a tense race. Arena has all the same options and sees all the combatants trying to damage and eventually frag each other. Once again, there are three levels ready, with one being an experimental early build. Both Arena and Race seem to ultimately get 12 tracks each, which I would be totally fine with. I'm having so much fun on every single one of the available maps that I'm sure that the others will be equally great. Next up is the mode Playground, that has the player collect some orbs spread across a huge, you guessed it, playground and just mess around with the vehicle and lots of ramps and walls. The devs apparently want this mode to have three playgrounds, with one already available. Greyed out for now is the Time Trial mode, which I guess will pretty much be Race without the opponents. Not there yet but hinted at already is \"Grip League\". As the devs want to add online functionality with a future update, I figure this will be a competititve online league. Lastly, there already is a splitscreen mode for two players in place with the same modes and options as in solo play, minus Playground. Great fun for some couch competitiveness, with four player splitscreen already announced as well. So all in all, I wouldn't call the content sparse, though it's also not packed with lots of vehicles and tracks...yet. The content as of today is solid for EA and there are many great things in prospect.\n\nThe soundtrack consists of some great Drum'n'Bass tunes that fit amazingly well to the action and always get me pumped. Graphically, it looks pretty good. Even though the early version tracks might look a little barren, the game overall looks good in motion. I'd even call it pretty on the most barebone graphical settings. It has a decent amount of settings in this department, ranging from FXAA and TXAA as Anti-Aliasing solutions to object quality, effects, shadow, post process and texture quality settings. Playing on a R9 390, I5 6600K, 8GB RAM at 1440p, I use most settings at their highest choice and get a decent performance that sits well above 60 FPS for most of the time. I feel that the higher effects settings cost a lot of performance, so I leave that on Low and it still looks really good. Performance is pretty consistent, though the game might dip when lots of opponents are on screen next to explosions. With my slightly lowered settings, I keep the dips at a small pace though. Once again, considering the EA state, I'm impressed with both the looks and the performance.\n\n[b]I absolutely love what I've played so far and immediately wanna get back into the combat madness! The main concept is brilliant and well executed. The content is okay-ish, with much more on the horizon though. There are some smaller issues that still scream \"Early Access\", but nothing that really comes in the way of having fun. If you are even slightly interested in what you are seeing and fine with content being gradually rolled out, go for it! Now!

Die Strecken sind perfekt und bieten immer M\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr Abk\u00fcrzungen oder coole Tunnel in denen man die W\u00e4nde hoch fahren kann.\n\nGameplay:\nEs ist schon ein sehr Actiogeladenes Spiel. Es erm\u00f6glicht das Fahren an W\u00e4nden oder Decken und bietet auch den Abschuss, oder Schutz durch Power-ups. Das besondere ist sicherlich, dass Autos keine wirkliche Oberseite besitzen. Vielmehr k\u00f6nnen sie auf beiden Seiten fahren, daher ist eine Fassrolle kein Problem sollte man den Abschluss nicht hinkriegen bei einer Rampe oder gar von einem Mitspieler umgesto\u00dfen werden. Die Power-Ups sind die \u00fcblichen bekannten, die man schon aus anderen Arcaderacern kennt.\n\nMankos:\nDie Men\u00fcf\u00fchrung mit dem Controller ist noch sehr schwer und vorallem extrem un\u00fcbersichtlicht. W\u00e4hrend man bei einem mouseover den effekt bekommt, dass sich der Men\u00fcpunkt orange f\u00e4rbt, ist beim Controller nur eine leichte kaum sehbare wei\u00dfe gestrichelte Linie (Bei Wei\u00dfen Buttons!!)\n\nFazit:\n\nHat sehr viel Potenzial das Spiel freue mich schon auf mehr von den Entwicklern nur weiter so!

Eine krasse Leistung f\u00fcr ein kleines Indie-Team.\n\n+ Das Streckendesign ist wie ein Mix der vorherigen Rollcage Teile: \nViele verschiedene Routen, Spr\u00fcnge und versteckte Eing\u00e4nge zu kleinen Abk\u00fcrzungen sind sch\u00f6n platziert. Die M\u00f6glichkeit an der Decke zu fahren, kann man oft zu seinem Vorteil nutzen.\n\n+ Das Spiel gibt jetzt im f\u00fchen Entwicklungsstadium ein richtiges Geschwindigkeitsgef\u00fchl. Die Lenkung ist nicht zu einfach, aber mit etwas \u00dcbung geht sie sch\u00f6n von der Hand. Meiner Meinung nach ebenfalls ein Mix der ersten zwei Teile.\n\n+ Perfomancetechnisch ist die Alpha schon gut gelungen. Mit meiner GTX 560 sind 50 FPS m\u00f6glich.\nDa es eine Alpha ist, erwarte ich nat\u00fcrlich noch eine Verbesserung, auch wenn meine Karte nicht mehr die st\u00e4rkste ist. :-)\n\n+ Wer den alten rohen DnB Soundtrack geliebt hat, wird mit dem neuen genau so Gl\u00fccklich. Es sind unter anderem auch wieder Musiker der ersten Teile engagiert. Der Soundtrack passt wie angegossen.\n\n\nIn diesem Moment ist die Version 1.0.6.0 aktuell.

Generally, the physics are really good, but in very small cases this will happen.\n\n*2 - The issue is mainly with the options menu sub-menus. They look incomplete, feel barren.\nThe video options need some improvement where the resolution selector 'rolls' onto the next resolution/refresh rate and applies it immediately. Example, the game picks 1280x720-30hz as your main resolution/refresh rate, but you want 1920x1080-60hz. You have to click an arrow to change forward the resolution/refresh rate, but everytime you change it, it applies immediately. This problem is bad for people who have monitors with lots of choice of refresh rates. You have to go from 1280x720-30hz to 1280x720-60hz to 1280x720-120hz so on and so forth.

Nat\u00fcrlich fehlt noch viel Content wie z.B. ein Online Multiplayer oder mehr Maps (Bis jetzt gibt es n\u00e4mlich nur f\u00fcr jeweils den Arcarde und den Race Modus eine Map + 2 unfertige Maps, die eindeutig noch verbessert werden m\u00fcssen, f\u00fcr den Race Modus) \nAber im Gro\u00dfen und ganzen ist es ein Top Spiel und die oben genannten Sachen werden schlie\u00dflich auf jeden Fall kommen. Sie brauchen halt nur noch etwas Zeit.\n\nZwei Fehler die ich hatte m\u00f6chte ich hier aber gerne anmerken:\n- Grip hat meinen neueren Controller nicht erkannt, meinen \u00e4lteren allerdings schon. Aber auch der funktioniert nur im Spiel direkt und nicht im Men\u00fc. Wenn ich versuche den 2-Spieler Modus zu starten funzt das auch, aber den Linken auf dem Splitscreen kann man mit Tastatur UND Controller steuern, den rechten gar nicht. Ich hoffe das wird noch gefixt.\n\n- Der zweite Punkt ist, dass selbst die Bots auf \"Easy\" zu gut und Perfekt fahren. Wenn man am anfang nur einen Fehler macht und irgendwo gegen f\u00e4hrt hat man so gut wie keine Chance mehr zu aufzuholen. Den Bots passiert sowas n\u00e4hmlich nie. (Sollte einem das allerdings erst sp\u00e4ter in der Runde passieren hat man meistens eine Chance aufzuholen, da dann alle genug Powerups und Waffen haben und man sich gegenseitig besser aus der Bahn werfen kann, was dann auch die Bots gegeneinander machen).\n\nAber wenn man sich nach ein paar anf\u00e4nglichen Fehlern und Misserfolgen ins Spiel eingefunden hat macht es echt Laune und man kann einfach nicht genug kriegen!

There are only a couple of early access games for me personally which have been a pleasure to watch develop over the time they've been available on Steam, and Grip is one of those games.\n\nGrip is a direct descendant of the futuristic racing genre of the 90s. It is a sublime modernization of the classic Rollcage series in Unreal Engine 4. This is not necessarily a reboot of Rollcage, it has all new tracks, locations and overall lore, however the development team behind it feature people who were involved in the original games, and the gameplay could be described as a direct evolution of the original Rollcage series.\n\nIf you've not experienced Rollcage before, let me try and describe it. You have a 4 wheeled vehicle which can spin 180 degrees and operate on its roof as efficiently as it does under its starting orientation. At high speeds and against challenging foes, this mechanic bursts to life. There are weapons you pick up and use throughout each race, as well as other modes which are more combat-orientated. The whole thing runs at a blisteringly brilliant 60fps and feels genuinely faster than a lot of its competition.\n\nThroughout its early access release, the team at Caged Element have rolled out updates with satisfying regularity, which is impressive for such a small collective. They have recently launched the online multiplayer mode, and although it is still early days, the mode functions very well already and shows excellent promise for the future. I should also point out the game features an absolutely superb original soundtrack of techy drum and bass and nu-skool breaks. As a drum & bass DJ myself this is a very welcome thing to hear in a modern game, and is something you don't see all that often these days.\n\nI am massively enthusiastic about futuristic racers and have bashed the hell out of them over the past 30 years. They've had a bit of a resurgence recently with games like Distance and Redout on Steam, Fast Racing on Nintendo, as well as various others. For me, Grip is the best of this bunch, and as it continues to become a better game, there's never been a better time to jump on board.", "timestamp_created": 1454440009, "timestamp_updated": 1492695540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20916759": {"recommendationid": "20916759", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971043789", "num_games_owned": 1577, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512633862}, "language": "french", "review": "HOULALA ! \nAlors la c'est du lourd m\u00eame  en E.A avec pour le moment 2 circuits + Ar\u00e8nes ce jeu est grosse bombe !\nje retrouve tout le plaisir de Rollcage sur ma ps1 import jap ! avec en plus des graphiques somptueux un frame rate stable pour moi 70fps en 2560x1440 des effets de folie (lumi\u00e8res explosions).\nbref ..... je vous le conseille fortement c'est un jeu avec un gout de reviens-y et surtout au tarif propos\u00e9 !\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1454439114, "timestamp_updated": 1454439114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20916617": {"recommendationid": "20916617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037080732", "num_games_owned": 976, "num_reviews": 234, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454438405}, "language": "english", "review": "I would like to recomend this game, but I cant.

Einen Teil der originalen Entwickler hat das aber nicht davon abgehalten dieses Spiel zu entwickeln und man merkt auch schnell warum, die Entwickler lieben ihr Spiel. Hier sind keine Leute am Werk die schnell Geld machen wollen sondern echte Fans der beiden Vorg\u00e4nger. Das ganze Spiel f\u00fchlt sich vertraut an und bis auf die tolle neue Grafik (Unreal Engine 4) hat sich auch nichts ge\u00e4ndert. Genau so soll es auch sein. Man muss nicht immer auf Teufel komm raus neue Features integrieren um ein Spiel f\u00fcr die Masse zu entwickeln. Dass dies nicht das Ziel war merkt man auch an der bekannten sensiblen Steuerung und der teils extrem hohen Geschwindigkeit. Anf\u00e4nger d\u00fcrfte das Spiel garantiert \u00fcberfordern was aber kein Nachteil ist. Ihr merkt schon ich liebe das Spiel \u00fcber alles, musste schlie\u00dflich auch 15 Jahre darauf warten. \n\nWas dieses Spiel so besonders macht sind in erster Linie die Fahrzeuge. Aufrund der Gro\u00dfen Reifen k\u00f6nnen sie n\u00e4mlich auf beiden Seiten Fahren weshalb \u00dcberschl\u00e4ge im Spiel ganz andere Auswirkungen haben als bei normalen Autos. Da auch die Strecken meist offroad sind macht es richtig Spa\u00df H\u00fcgel als Sprungschanze f\u00fcr tolle Stunts zu nutzen und sich durch nichts und niemand aufhalten zu lassen. Bei hoher Geschwindigkeit haften die Fahrzeuge auch an Tunnelw\u00e4nden und Decken wodurch man seine Gegner l\u00e4ssig \u00fcber Kopf \u00fcberholen kann um dann l\u00e4ssig vor ihm auf die Stra\u00dfe zu h\u00fcpfen. \nAufgrund ihrer robusten Bauweise (Die Lenkachsen sind ein futuristisches Energiefeld) sind die Fahrzeuge nahezu unzerst\u00f6rbar. Hier kommen die Waffen ins Spiel, denn eine gezielte Rakete in den Gegner l\u00e4sst diesen alles andere als kalt. So fliegen diese brennend von der Strecke meist mit spektakul\u00e4ren \u00dcberschl\u00e4gen und tollen Partikel-Effekten. Damit man sich gegen Raketen und MGs wehren kann gibt es auch Minen und Schilde. Dank der zwei Waffenslots kann man sich immer das passende Item in der Hinterhalt bewahren. Zus\u00e4tzlich gibt es einen Turbo-Boost der das Fahrzeug ordentlich beschleunigt weshalb man den Einsatz gut planen sollte. Mit dem besten Motor und dem Boost erreicht man locker 1000 Km/h. Dank dem tollen Geschwindigkeits-Gef\u00fchl f\u00fchlen sich diese auch so an und jede Kurve l\u00e4st einen erzittern. Da eine Bodenwelle erwischt und man fliegt wortw\u00f6rtlich aus der Bahn. Der Motorensound der Fahrzeuge mit einem sehr hohen Pfeifen ist ebenfalls sehr gelungen und unterstreicht das futuristische Setting.\n\nAuch sehr toll sind die Strecken. Leider gibt es erst 3 Rennstrecken von denen 2 jedoch schon sehr detailliert sind und wirklich Spa\u00df machen. Beide finden in einer au\u00dferirdischen W\u00fcste statt, die erste Tags und die andere nachts. Gerade nachts ist die Atmosph\u00e4re sehr unheimlich, die guten Lichteffekte tun hier ihr \u00dcbriges. Die Alien-Architektur mit grellen Blitzen und aufgewirbelter Staub gefallen mir hier sehr. au\u00dferdem gibt es viele zerst\u00f6rbare Objekte auf den Strecken wie F\u00e4sser oder Br\u00fcckenpfeiler welche teilweise sogar ganze Geb\u00e4ude einst\u00fcrzen lassen und dann die anderen Fahrer behindern.\n\nNeben den Rennen gibt es aktuell noch 2 Kampfarenen und eine Stunt-Arena in welcher man auch viel mit der tollen Physik herumspielen kann. \n\n\nPositiv:\n+ Es ist Rollcage\n+ Gute Steuerung\n+ Tolle Grafik mit vielen Partikel-Effekten und detaillierten Strecken\n+ Guter Elektro-Soundtrack\n+ Gute Physik\n+ 3 Geschwindigkeitsstufen\n+ Sehr gute Perfomance (120 Fps mit einer GTX 970)\n+ Multiplayer mit Splitscreen\n\nNegativ:\n- aktuell noch etwas verbuggte KI (Streckenabh\u00e4ngig)\n- aktuell wenig Umfang (3 Strecken + 3 Arenen)\n- (noch) kein Online-Multiplayer\n\n\nFazit:\nFans und Kenner des Originals sollten unbedingt zuschlagen und sei es nur um die Entwickler zu unterst\u00fctzen. Dieses Spiel wird etwas Gro\u00dfes! Alle anderen sollten vielleicht noch etwas warten bis es mehr Umfang enth\u00e4lt.", "timestamp_created": 1454438628, "timestamp_updated": 1454442856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704972", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20916162": {"recommendationid": "20916162", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999909667", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 41574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 624, "last_played": 1515959358}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked Rollcage you will love this", "timestamp_created": 1454437171, "timestamp_updated": 1454437171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566973", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20916032": {"recommendationid": "20916032", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985374616", "num_games_owned": 1203, "num_reviews": 181, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514571114}, "language": "english", "review": "2016 Rollcage is back for good but it still need alot of things but overall it's really good and the driving and music is just epic, feels 120% like playing Rollcage so get if you did like Rollcage and get if you like combat racing for this game is one of the best at it and really good for been in early access also i have been watting years for new Rollcage like right from Rollcage Stage II for it was really awesome racing game back there and it means i have wait 16 years for a new Rollcage", "timestamp_created": 1454436774, "timestamp_updated": 1454436933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20916020": {"recommendationid": "20916020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018175900", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454433421}, "language": "german", "review": "ein sch\u00f6nes Spiel viele dinge sind schon im Spiel eingebaut also mir macht es spa\u00df auch wenn das fahren schwer ist bei den Geschwindigkeiten :D", "timestamp_created": 1454436746, "timestamp_updated": 1454436746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20915771": {"recommendationid": "20915771", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998741098", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512596111}, "language": "french", "review": "\\\\Attention c'est un VERY EARLY ACCESS//\n\nJe ne vais pas \u00eatre objectif car j'\u00e9tais un grand fan de rollcage et ce que nous avons l\u00e0 est une promesse de rollcage3.

My play time doesn't quite factor in the full story as i've probably done about a 100 racers in this so far and wow.\n\nIt stands on it's own from Rollcage even though it is very very like it (and that's a good thing) with the sounds of those powerful engines and the glorious high speed transmission whine which is a fantastic sound sample, one of the most enthralling I've heard in a while, this game is set up to be doing everything right.\n\nCreated in UE4 (yes!) it's one of the first proper games to be coming using the power of this new engine, from the sensation of high speed which is getting better with each update, to the sounds and graphics and of course the physics, which is the most important aspect for a game like this, is on track feeling great.\n\nThis review will be updated in time as more content is added but for now, it is a shining gem in a catagory on PC which all but forgotten. A scifi combat high speed racer that is featuring expansive tracks, a full career mode to come like RC1 and RC2, and brand new additions such as destructible environments (to what extent we yet not fully know), get this now and support a game that is shaping up to be one of the best of this year if the current communication with devs is anything to go by.\n\nLoved RC1/RC2 on PS1 and PC of the past? Love that high speed, combat racer feeling but in a UE4 game? Love that nostalgia from over 16 years ago? Then get it now, support the devs, and be in for a good time!\n\n***Last updated 02/02/2016***", "timestamp_created": 1454432165, "timestamp_updated": 1454432165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20914466": {"recommendationid": "20914466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017610390", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512928833}, "language": "english", "review": "Prepare your ANUS because that game will fuck your ass and won`t even pay for it!\nIt`s a must buy for every oldschool racer lover.

But hell I\u2019ve sunk 20 hours in already just racing around with the AI and I\u2019m still having so much fun with it.\n\nThe latest update has added a third racing track (very early in development) as well as making some massive improvements to the other two.

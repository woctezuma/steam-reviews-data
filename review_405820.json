Of course, now that I'm older (and don't have any nightmares on it for obvious reasons anymore), I can say this is a game that truly was given the love and creativity that we sadly don't see much of in modern day video games anymore, especially with the FPS genre. The weapons you get range from the everyday simplistic to the truly devastating that you can have a lot of fun with in your own time. While the game isn't expansive when compared to something vast like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Super Mario Odyssey, it does provide a nice variety of secrets that encourage exploring around the eight levels this game provides here. Honestly, I could continue going on with the positives involved with this game lately, but the best thing you could do for yourself is buy it for yourself! Trust me, it'll be worth your time.

It has 8 enormous levels. The levels are done in order, but you can always go back and play previous levels because each level is accessed through a central hub area, similar to Quake 1. Unlike Quake 1, Turok lets you keep your weapons and other gear when changing levels (comparable to Quake episodes). \n\nThis game was made in the era of Goldeneye 007 for N64, and the similarities are easy to see. Goldeneye had replayable levels, and so does Turok. Goldeneye had an achievement system to unlock things like a gold or silver PP7, and Turok has a similar unlockable cheat menu. Even the assault rifle is copied from Goldeneye. It looks like an AK and fires 3 round bursts.\n\nThat said, the game is far from perfect. Here are some of the things I didn't like:\n1) Enemies often blend in with the background, so I can't tell what is shooting me.\n2) Ammunition limits are absurdly low. 20 shotgun shells and 100 bullets, but it raises to 40 shells and 200 bullets after finding the backpack.  In contrast, the original Doom started with limits of 50 shotgun shells and 200 bullets, which increased to 100 shotgun and 400 bullets after finding the backpack. Doom and Turok require roughly equal amounts of ammo for their respective guns, so imagine playing Doom with severe ammo limitations.\n3) Due to the ammo limits, ammo always seems to be in short supply unless you've played the game before and know exactly where everything is located. This means the pistol at the start of the game is the most used weapon in the game simply because it consumes the least amount of ammo. If you watch a Let's Play on youtube, you will notice that all people play Turok with the pistol.\n4) The enemies respawn, which I think is really cool, but the ammo doesn't respawn at the same rate. If you get lost in a map and need to double check every place you've been, you'll probably equip the knife and try to run around as many enemies as possible. It's not run and gun; it's run and avoid enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1510437374, "timestamp_updated": 1510447862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36440174": {"recommendationid": "36440174", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995355610", "num_games_owned": 1329, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510582750}, "language": "turkish", "review": "UGH!

Pretty Good but despite its improvements, this game is showing its age.\n\n+Everything that was good about the Nintendo 64 version of Turok Dinosaur Hunter is good in this game. This remake is amazingly true to the original.\n+The most major change between this version and the original is the fact that the game's fog has been pushed so far into the background that it is no longer an issue. The game is much easier and much less frustrating as a direct result.\n+Fast paced action.\n+Interesting variety of enemies.\n+Interesting variety of areas.\n+Interesting variety of weapons (though some weapons seem fairly useless) and the weapons themselves are often quite creative in their effects and operation.\n+Cool and exciting boss fights.\n+Very few bugs and no freeze ups.\n+Good menus and settings which are true to the original version.\n+The deep bass-oriented drum music is still pretty good and the music for the game's boss and final confrontation level are still excellent.\n+Can download user-created mods including a texture pack for higher-resolution textures (but I did not personally test this out).\n+Extremely responsive mouse/keyboard controls which were easy to customize/re-map.\n+Very nostalgic for those who played the original Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\n\n+/-True to the original, this game has fairly mediocre sound effects of fairly low quality.\n+/-Interesting hub-based level/area structure which requires you to track down keys to unlock additional areas. Unfortunately some keys can be difficult to find or can be easily overlooked. Fortunately, the Internet has a lot of help freely available on the subject.\n\n-Textures seem blurry, repetitive, and stretched by today's standards and have not aged well.\n-Though the game's levels/areas are technically hub-based, areas themselves are designed to be run through in a fairly linear manner. Areas have a definite beginning area (near the entry portal), middle area and ending area (near the exit portal).\n-Although the enemy AI in this game was pretty good at the time the game was first made it is showing its age now.\n-This game has none of its story explained in-game. You must pretty much infer what is happening from seeing your surroundings from area to area. There is nearly no dialogue and no narrative.\n-Still cannot save your game wherever you want but must rely on irritating checkpoints and game save sites built into the physical confines of the level. These game save sites look like weird altars.\n-Jumping puzzles are still a recipe for potential frustration, particularly for inexperienced FPS players.\n-Relatively short game by today's standards which also seems to encourage you to rush through it due to the fact that your character moves so fast that he can outrun and dodge nearly any enemy in the game.\n-Cannot duck or go prone.\n-Repetitive enemy death screams throughout.\n-Oddly, the effects for the Nuke and Chronoscepter weapons were not as amazing or awe-inspiring as they were on the Nintendo 64 as these weapons create a lot of fog (or rather temporarily change the color of the area's fog) and that fog is largely absent in this version of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1504954664, "timestamp_updated": 1504954980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34791228": {"recommendationid": "34791228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221187740", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504776858}, "language": "english", "review": "It brought back really nice memories, I haven't played this game in the past 16 years or so.

This will disable achievements for the rest of your play-through.\n\nYes, even if you check one of them 'on' for a split second then revert back to playing normaly you will have 'conned' yourself of any further acheivements. Kind of silly seeing as how the game literally gives you and unlocks the cheats for completing specific task (ie: collecting 9+ lives = infinite lives)\n\n\nBut if you don't care about the achievement progress then go right ahead and use them. I just wish I was warned before hand. Seeing as how I beat the game today, (Chronoscepter, T-Rex, and Campainger) all in the last hour and didn't receive a single achievement for those.\n\n\n__REVIEW__\n-------------------\n\nGAMEPLAY:  Whether you played back on the N64 or are new to the game, this version is well worth the money. Straight up run in gun gameplay, secerets to be found and lots of killing to be done. Some levels play linear, some play more Doom-ish with labrynth level design. Lots of weapons gives you the ability to choose how to play. Go for distance, or just shotgun everything in the face.\n\n\nCOMPATABILITY: Enhanced to run on modern systems. This is a huge plus, just install and play! No trouble shooting or anything outragous. Supports 1440p which made playing this game super nice. Caps just past 60 fps, to be expected for a game that was coded into the fps. Feels liquid smooth. I used to run this on an old AMD dual core, and HD 7770 on windows 7. Ran perfect then. I Still play it on my updated system Quad core, 1050 ti, and windows 10. No complaints\n\n\nConclusion:\n----------------\n\nThe whole achievement bugger aside, this game rocks.

I decided to pick it up in the recent summer sale based on numerous recommendations from a friend, who frequently uses it as a point of reference when discussing other games. \n\nFor those unfamiliar, Turok began as a comic book in the '60s, concerning Native American warriors accidentially finding their way into a realm known as the \"Lost Land\", a land forgotten by time, populated with extremely irate dinosaurs. This was kept intact with the 90s reboot by Acclaim Comics, which added aliens and advanced technology into the mix, and told a story of a family line of these warriors, the Fireseeds, and their taking up the mantle of \"Turok\", Son of Stone, to face the Lost Land's many dangers. This first videogame adaptation concerns a man later identified as Tal'Set, who would reappear in a prequel, Turok: Evolution.\n\nFrom what I can tell, Turok 1 was considered by some reviewers to be derivitive, praised for its graphics but largely regarded simply as a \"doom clone.\" In particular, the PC version was seen by some reviewers as inferior to Quake. Considering it's largely more of a console game, having released on Nintendo 64 first, this doesn't seem to me like a fair comparison. Others later lauded it as a \"system-selling franchise\" that established that PC was not the \"exclusive realm\" of good FPSes. In retrospect, such an assessment may have been premature.\n\nRegardless, Turok 1, and in particular, this Night Dive rerelease, shines through mostly in its controls. I can't speak for the original PC release, but this one handles so well its scarcely feels like im playing a console game, permitting me to straferun and jump with the best of them. It also runs very well, subject to none of the frame loss and distance fog issues of its original N64 incarnation. It does have anumber of odd console-game features, such as its extensive platforming sections, limited lives and fixed save points. My few deaths were found in the bottomless pits, and I can't say I miss that particular aspect of the era. Nor am I particularly enamoured of the game's cryptic item placement. As a child playing things like the Doom and Quake demos, which comprised early, comparitively easy-to-navigate levels, Turok would have driven me up a goddamn wall. It reminded me oddly of Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, which actually had much more awkward platforming. I don't think less of the game now given easy access to guides, but the game does stand out as an example of a very different era in level design. There's also absolutely no story text or narrative cutscenes anywhere in the game, which even Doom and Quake managed a bare minimum of. \n\nThankfully Turok also delivers a wide array of nasty weapons and enemies, eclectic and colorful environment design, thematically appropriate music, and some fairly well-executed boss fights. It also has a well-executed hub system with seamless level transisitions, permitting the player to freely explore available areas at will. Compared to the dark and dreary castles and temples of Quake 1, and the grim and gritty military complexes and canyons of Quake 2, Turok's visuals stand out. The hub-based level design is also executed far more smoothly here then in Quake 2, in which one becomes hopelessly lost quite easily.\n\nTurok occupies an important place in the history of singleplayer FPS and this release is certainly worth a purchase.\n", "timestamp_created": 1500082905, "timestamp_updated": 1500082905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33541591": {"recommendationid": "33541591", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984065640", "num_games_owned": 520, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500055840}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si te gusta los juegos estilo DOOM, Duke Nukem y Quake clasicos, estas tardando en pillarte este juego.

Die Antwort ist simpel. Ja es kann. Turok versucht sich nicht neu zu erfinden. Klar es ist etwas aufgeh\u00fcbscht und an neue Systeme angepasst, aber es ist immernoch das selbe Turok wie damals. Und es macht immernoch viel Spa\u00df. \n\nWie immer wenn Ihr was zur Story h\u00f6ren wollt, schaut Euch ein Let\u00b4s Play an oder spielt es selber. Schauen wir und doch stattdessen lieber das Gameplay an. Welches im Grunde ebenso simpel ist. Wir rennen und springen durch Level, verpassen im vorbeirennen Gegener eine Bleivergiftung, sammeln Schl\u00fcssel f\u00fcr h\u00f6here Level ein und aktivieren diese im Hub,  Was?  Das war jetzt jetzt zu kurz erkl\u00e4rt. Nagut dann etwas ausf\u00fchrlicher. \n\nDas gute an \"Oldschool Shootern\" ist das sie schnell und flexibel sind. Das heisst vereinfacht. Wir m\u00fcssen nicht von Deckung zu Deckung hetzten und uns Taktiken ausdenken um den Feind zu \u00fcberrumpeln. Hier heisst es einfach, oh schau mal da hinten ein Schl\u00fcssel, eine Ammo Box, was auch immer, also wird die Richtung gewechelt und gerade zu gelaufen, und eventuelle Gegner die unseren Weg kreuzen, bekommen wirklich im vorbeirennen eine Ladung Schrot verpasst. Die dicken Brocken schickt man mit ausweichen und etwas Dauerfeuer im rennen auf die Bretter. Und damit wir nicht dazu neigen Munition zu horten, spawnen Gegner nach etwas Zeit wieder nach, nur um wieder umgeholzt zu werden. \n\nEine der typischen Krankheiten von \"Oldschool Shootern\" findet sich leider auch in Turok wieder. Keine Ahnung ob die Programmierer wollten das ihre Sch\u00f6pfung fit bleibt aber ja ich bin kein Fan von Jump & Run Einlagen in Shootern. Und davon gibt es hier leider reichlich. Das heisst, auf der Suche nach Schl\u00fcsseln, Munition, Secrets, Waffen oder nach den Dreickenen, ist es teils n\u00f6tig sich wie ein \u00c4ffchen auf Koks zu verhalten. Welche Dreiecke, willst du wissen? Nunja diese Dreiecke, sammeln wir ein um uns Extra Leben zu verdienen, haben wir 100 eingesammelt gibt es eins. Wie Extra Leben? Genau, wir haben mehrere Leben die wir verbrauchen k\u00f6nnen, bis wir endg\u00fcltig ins Gras beissen. Desswegen auch sch\u00f6n Dreiecke sammeln (zumindest bis ihr Euch 10 Leben verdient und den Cheat f\u00fcr unendlich Leben freigespielt habt, dann hat die sammelei auch ein Ende). Zum Gl\u00fcck gibt es aber auch vor \"schwierigen\" Passagen oft einen Speicherpunkt an dem wir saven k\u00f6nnen. \n\nWozu brauchen wir die Schl\u00fcssel? Einfach. Du willst in h\u00f6here Level, fiesere Viecher vom Polygondasein befreien, fettere Wummen mit dir rumschleppen und noch mehr Chaos verbreiten. Dann wirst du Schl\u00fcssel sammeln m\u00fcssen. F\u00fcr jedes freischaltbare Level ben\u00f6tigen wir drei Schl\u00fcssel und die sch\u00f6n in den Levelabschnitten davor zu finden. Das gute ist, hat man mal was \u00fcbersehen kann und sollte man ruhig nochmal im Hub ins vorherige Levelportal hopsen. Das Hub ist quasi die Verbindungstelle f\u00fcr die Levelportale. Dahin kehren wir auch nach jedem absolviertem Levelabschnitt zur\u00fcck. Beim Thema Portale f\u00e4llt mir noch was ein. Es gibt noch Bonusportale in den Levelabschnitten zu finden, die uns bei erfolgreicher Beendigung mit mehr Munition, Leben usw. versorgen. \n\nZum Spiel generell: Ja ich weiss das die Grafik keinen mehr hinter dem Ofen vorlockt. Aber dank Sch\u00f6nheits OP sieht Turok mit seinen 20 Gamejahren immernoch gut aus. Der Sound wirkt stimmig und nicht zu sehr im Vordergrund. Und ich muss anmerken das sich das Gameplay deutlich verbessert hat. Die Steuerung mit Maus und Tastatur f\u00fchlt sich nicht mehr so schwammig an wie es in der Originalversion der Fall war.\n\nVon mir gibt es einen Daumen hoch, weil ich mit Turok immernoch viel Spa\u00df am ballern habe und es mich immernoch verdammt gut  unterh\u00e4lt. Und weil ich endlich nicht mehr auf Neon farbende Roboter schiessen muss.\n\n[i]Ps: F\u00fcr Rechtschreibfehler \u00fcbernimmt der Rezensent keine Haftung und schiebt die Schuld auf seine Tastatur.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1499782023, "timestamp_updated": 1499858594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33451484": {"recommendationid": "33451484", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960478145", "num_games_owned": 1449, "num_reviews": 295, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491640649}, "language": "english", "review": "Boring. I don't get the buzz this game generates. The maps are, while outside areas, pretty meh, I've seen better level design in Quake that came out way before it.

Alternative ammo types is a great idea in theory, but you gotta do it right. When you pick up special ammo, i.e. expliding arrows, it downright replaces your main ammo type so you can't just keep the exploding arrows for the big baddies and switch as you wish. The HUD even hides the default ammo! Same goes for health & armor, if you have armor, your health is hidden. WTF? Last but not least, respawning enemies. I've entered an interesting area where I wanted to explore and find all goodies on the roors and some minutes later, I was out of ammo as enemies respawn all the time without dropping all the ammo I need to kill them.

This of course comes with a familiar set of good and less good aspects:\n\nPros\n- Good old run n' gun combat. Like other shooters of the time (and stuff like Doom 2016), it's worth staying on the move to avoid getting shot and/or torn apart. Add on top of this the fact the game will periodically spawn in more enemies, and there's almost always some kind of action to keep you on your toes.\n- Large arsenal of weapons with plenty of variety, from the mundane but effective (shotgun, assault rifle, a knife that, unlike Doomguy's fist, is actually fairly useful in a pinch), to the unusual and flashy (energy weapons and explosives of various sizes and effects).\n- Element of exploration in the levels. While the level layouts are mostly linear, you are rewarded for going off the beaten path and checking all the nooks and crannies. Usually this bags much-needed health and ammo, but there's also the possibility of finding a new weapon early or a nifty powerup. And you WILL have to do some searching if you want to collect all the pieces of the Chronoscepter, this game's ultimate weapon.\n- Plenty of intersting enemies to use said weapons on. Of course you'll have dinosaurs and humans to shoot, stab and blow up with explosive arrows, but the Lost Land is a weird place filled with all kinds of crazy stuff. Expect every level to throw something new at you that you haven't faced down yet.\n\nCons\n- To get to new levels you need to find keys in previous ones to unlock them. Fortunately keys are usually not that hard to find if you're already hunting around everywhere for goodies, but nonetheless if you miss any it means taking another trip through the level to find what you missed. Level 5 in particular is a kind of a maze, and I wouldn't blame anyone who misses at least one key during it.\n- Remember when FPS games thought they should have platforming as a key element, without fantastic controls to back them up? Yeah, this game looooves its precision platforming over perilous pits of alliteration. Obviously this remaster's mouse and keyboard controls help a lot compared to the old N64 incarnation's janky setup, but you can still expect the game to punish you with lost health and/or lives when you screw up even a single jump. And it's still not hard to screw them up, even with modern controls.\n- Speaking of lives, you have limited lives and save points. Just one of those things I suppose the genre hadn't grown out of yet at the time. Not the friendliest thing to have to deal with when you consider how quickly enemies can tear you to pieces on higher difficulties, plus the aforementioned platforming. If it's any consolation, the game is designed around this, with it not being TOO difficult to get more lives if you remember to explore for resources and grab the bonus stage portals when they show up. Also, slain enemies stay dead between lives and bosses retain whatever hurt you put on them before they killed you, meaning you won't lose quite as much progress as you may normally expect.\n\nSo overall, we got an old shooter with old design quirks, given a fresh coat of paint and controls that won't make you tear your hair out. The original N64 version would be a bit hard to recommend today, but having a mouse and keyboard to use makes a huge difference (or a modern controller; I played this all the way through with an Xbox One controller and, thanks to the sizeable amount control customization options, had a ballin time that way too). Given that huge change, this is now totally worth playing, whether you're an old player going back for that sweet nostalgia or a new player wanting to check out a fun bit of gaming history. Either way, I can guarantee this one still delivers.", "timestamp_created": 1499221059, "timestamp_updated": 1499221131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33255933": {"recommendationid": "33255933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203135126", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499477704}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Pfff excelente titulo! que puedo decir, recorde toda mi infancia, matando dinosaurios siendo un cazador con muy pocos poligonos.\n\nNo hay problemas de crasheo o guardar partidas.", "timestamp_created": 1499218508, "timestamp_updated": 1499218508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33253452": {"recommendationid": "33253452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186868737", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484742846}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like killing Dinosaurs?

But not really able to recommend to newer players.\n\nDo I enjoy the game? HELL YEAH!! It's fun, it's frustrating, it's old-school quirky and fast paced. Do I recommend it? Hell No! The reason I don't recommend it, is the only people whom it would need recommending to probably won't see the same game we all enjoy. \n\nTurok is 100% a product of it's generation. That doesn't mean it's a bad game. It means this game will only really be enjoyed by those who grew up at that time. The first problem this game has is it's level design and engine. It reeks of N64! Which the game was built for, I know. However, the limits of that console keeps this game feeling cramped. Keep in mind this was the same time games like Blood, MDK, Quake II, Hexen II, Tomb Raider II, & Star Wars Jedi Knight II were coming out on PC.  Those games had a much more open feel. Their level designs still hold up today. Turok does good for the tech it was built for, but it does lack in comparison to these titles.\n\nWeapons are another concerning factor. There is variety, but they don't have range. Enemies can shoot you further than you can. It's strange to be taking damage from someone and when you shoot at them the bullets don't reach. The shotgun is underpowered imho. Why does it take 2 hits to take down a raptor? You have limited ammo and a long animation sequence between shots. Unless you have explosive shells, this gun is hardly worth it in most situations. The bow and arrow is another one. Other than hitting large enemies, this weapon leaves a lot to be desired. And why can't you switch ammo? You have to use your best ammo no matter what. Then there's the knife. It doesn't 1 shot even some of the most basic enemies. You take a big risk using it, but the reward is not there. That's just my take on things.\n\nThe limited lives and spaced out save points are another throw back to an older generation. I doubt most new gamers will appreciate mini-bosses standing at every save point. Exploration is punished by enemies respawning. You have to play the levels a few times to get all the niche's figured out. The secret warps are limited. Although spread out nicely throughout the levels, they repeat and bring you to the exact same secret you entered at the last checkpoint. \n\nIt also must be commented on that a crazy faced, fully stereotypical, Native American may put an itch under the skin of SJW's. But this game came out in a time when that wasn't considered taboo or even that bad. Carmageddon had just been released rewarding players who murdered innocent people. Shadow Warrior was making fun of Asian stereotypes. GTA 1 had just been released. Duke Nukem was objectifying women. It was a different time for sure.\n\nThese are just a few quirks that Turok has. Do I think they are barriers to enjoying the game? Depends on the type of gameplay you were raised on. If Halo was your first game, and you were raised on infinite, op, pistols, and the ability to hide in a corner until you regained sheilds, then this game will feel very unfair. If you were raised on Doom, and sometimes running for the exit switch was your only option, then this game is a nice balance between FPS speed-running and exploration/platforming. \n\nBut hey!

I had no idea what the game was about, what my objective was, or why everything wanted to eat me. Playing this remaster was a major nostalgia trip for me, and it was interesting to see how much of the game I had not yet explored as a kid. As far as the game itself goes it is a very high octane shooter with a pretty large selection of weapons. Your mission to mission goals are exclusively centered on gathering keys to unlock the next level, and perhaps a piece of the game's penultimate weapon. When compared to its sequel, Turok Dinosaur Hunter really isn't all that special; it is definitely a relic of its time. Having said that, for those of you who may have played bits and pieces way back when, I would recommend traveling back in time with this game. It was extremely satisfying to see this journey come to an end 16 years after I first played it. If nothing else, that was worth it for me.

The game is a FPS game originally released in 1997 for the Nintende 64. You play as a Turok, who has to go through 8 levels and collect 3-4 keyes per level and a piece of the Chronospetre. The Chronospetre is needed to defeat an evil alien called the Campaigner. I have only played level 1-3. I have collected everything for level 1 and level 2 but I still need to get a key in level 3. The keys are hidden fairly well in this levels and in two levels I didn't find all the keys. If you don't find all the keyes, you have to replay the level to find the keys. The Chronoseptre parts are usually found in secret areas. The guns I got so far are fun to use, although not super creative. There is a bow (with explosive tipped arrows and regular arrows), a pistol, a assault rifle, a shotgun and automatic shotgun (both with explosive shots) and finally a plasma rifle. The enemies are varied and interesting. I have encountered mercs, raptors, natives with melee weapons and blow darts, grenade throwing mercs, monkey like things (Aliens or dinosaurs, not sure what) and bugs. The game is really fun so far and I haven't encountered any problems I had with it. (Some people may be bothered by the replaying of levels to find keys)\n\nRemaster Technical Review:\nThis remaster is really good. I never played the N64 version of the game, but I did look at gameplay videos to get a sense of the graphical improvements in the remaster. The fog has been reduced, giving the game a much bigger draw distance. There have been various effects added and the game is playable in any resolution up to 4K. The texture resolution didn't look much better, but to me its part of the games charm (being a real old school shooter). The game runs buttery smooth at 60 frames on my average pc.

The original N64 version of the game had a low framerate and an annoyingly short render distance, not to mention the akward N64 controls. The original PC version is better but still suffered from many of the N64's problems. All that doesn't matter now because Nightdive has given us an amazing remake. There are many ne options such as the ability change the render distance, up to 4k resolution support, the option to change the fov, the game is capped at 60 fps but it can be unlocked, and a level editor so this game can blossom a new modding community. This may all be expected for any game on steam, but for Turok this is a godsend. They only thing that may be a negative if you're a true Turok purist is that some of the levels are re-designed and some of the keys and levels have been moved around, but that's only if you're the type that simply can't accept any change.

I'm assuming that those reading this are familiar with the original PC/N64 releases, so bear with me not going into too many details on gameplay and story.\n\nWow, what a remaster. It kept everything I knew of the original game and put a bunch of changes on top, that, in my opinion, improved the game quite a bit, but not to a degree that it felt different from what I remember.\n\nThe annoying view bobbing that plagued the original game can be turned off now and the draw distance (fog) can be increased (but not entirely removed). Sounds are decent (and easily moddable!) and are based on the N64 version.\n\nThe higher resolution and improved lighting makes it a good looking game, although the textures are merely upscaled, not necessarily HD by today's standards, same with character and item models. Basically it looks like a more polished version of the original game.\n\nAs far as my 6 hour playtime is concerned, you have to know that I used to know this game inside-out as a kid, around 15 years ago. I barely ever got lost this time, and even then, just paying attention to the environment helps. Increased draw distance helps a ton in this regard as well. While the level design can be confusing (especially for first time players), it can eventually grow on you, barring initial annoyance. Never before were keys this important to find.\n\nSo the game can be short, but with stuff like finding the Chronoscepter pieces and (truly well) hidden secret areas, there's reason for further playthroughs.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who liked the original and everyone else who wants to play a classic shooter that was a bit different from the masses at the time, both in style and in gameplay, as this game can almost be seen as an FPS/Platformer hybrid.", "timestamp_created": 1489353081, "timestamp_updated": 1489353331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30459488": {"recommendationid": "30459488", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972635749", "num_games_owned": 2310, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489277869}, "language": "english", "review": "Stupidly easy on a computer.

Not quite as well as Quake, maybe, but I expected Quake to age well. I had no expectations whatsoever for Turok, but lo and behold, it's a really fun game. Not perfect by any means, but definitely really solid and enjoyable.\n\nThis was one of the first FPS to be on consoles, to prove that the genre could exist on more than just PC. A lot of the design decisions reflect this: there's a fairly generous auto-aim feature to make up for the lack of mouse, and the weapon select feature is clearly designed for scrolling, not selecting with specific keys. There's also no \"Use\" button, probably to make up for the relative lack of buttons on a controller compared to a keyboard. More generally, however, there's a more arcadey feel to the mechanics. Your character can jump really high, swim for a very long time, and not take any fall damage whatsoever. This complements the near-omnipresent platforming (another arcadey touch), which is surprisingly good for an FPS. Additionally, there are pickups scattered around that, if you collect 100, give you an extra life. These arcadey features seem more geared toward the consoles of the 90s than PC, and give Turok: Dinosaur Hunter a very different feel to most FPS of the time.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any plot whatsoever, only circumstance. You are Turok, a baffling Native American stereotype living in some weird world that seems to combine elements of prehistory, such as dinosaurs and extensive jungle, with elements of the future, such as laser guns and high-tech bases. For whatever reason, you've decided to kill every living thing in sight and assemble the eight pieces of the Chronoscepter. I don't know anything more about the plot than this, but it gives me an excuse to shoot cyborg Deinonychus with an explosive shotgun, so I'll give it a pass.\n\nThe gameplay is fucking great. Besides all the platforming, the main focus is shooting, which feels wonderful. It's fast and frantic and almost effortless at times, the difficulty curve is well-managed, and there's lots of variety to add interest to proceedings. There's an excellent selection of 14 or so diverse weapons from all sorts of time periods, although it's pretty poorly balanced (I couldn't find any use for the Alien Weapon or the Shockwave Weapon). A couple have different ammunition types, but you can't toggle them, so all you can do is wear out the better type before moving on to the normal one. That's dumb, but it's not enough of an issue to really be worth complaining about. Ammo caps are also kinda low, but the Backpack powerup remedies this to some extent. There's also an AK-47 that fires 9mm pistol rounds, which I thought was interesting.\n\nThe enemies are about as diverse as the weapons, in both design and gameplay execution. There are some fun enemy death animations, and you can shoot random harmless animals for health pickups. The game is also very bloody, but not gory; defeated enemies practically gush blood particles, but other than that appear untouched. Unfortunately, enemies spawn infinitely even though ammo does not, but this can be worked around to some extent by simply ignoring and running past them.\n\nThe levels are pretty well-designed. The game forgoes the usual structure of 15-30 normal-sized levels in favor of 8 massive ones, each with tons of secrets and alternate pathways. These levels can be replayed as often as you want in order to get enough keys to unlock later levels. The level design is often quite maze-y and easy to get lost in, but it has the same odd property as Quake where the levels are intuitively designed enough that you can often have only a vague idea of where you are, but as long as you keep moving forward you can usually get to where you want to go. This works well enough that I barely ever needed a walkthrough. I can only imagine the backbreaking amount of effort it took to design the levels to work this way, but I certainly appreciate it.\n\nThere are no quicksaves. Instead, there's a system of checkpoints and lives that can be gained by collecting enough points, as mentioned above. Occasionally, there'll be a statue where you can save as often as you want, but they're generally limited to 2-3 per level. This doesn't work as well as quicksaves, of course, but it's basically fine; checkpoints are spaced well enough to avoid serious frustration.\n\nThe camera jerks around constantly in response to various actions, such as climbing, swimming, and turning sharply. I got used to it fairly quickly, but if you have trouble with FPS-induced nausea, be warned.\n\nOverall, Turok's a very solid game that has certainly stood the test of time. The gameplay is enjoyable, there's a lot of variety, it works to set itself apart from other FPS, and what issues there are are generally minimized as much as possible. I recommend it.\n\nEDIT: $20 is a bit steep for a game this old, though.

Let's first see why it shouldn't be fun and then I try to explain why I enjoyed it anyway. \n\nI first played Turok on the original Nintendo 64, many years ago. At the time, the game had a lot of problems, some of them still apply, even to the remastered PC version. The game was still praised back then because at the time, there wasn't much else on the N64 and it was kind of a new experience on console. Among the issues are the incredibly short viewing distance (improved in the remaster) and difficult controls (also not an issue on PC). \n\nThe problems that still apply, even to the remaster, are some ridiculous jumping sections, unnecessary tedious back tracking if you miss some required keys and constantly respawning enemies. Some secrets are a bit too obscure for my liking, like jumping into a random wall from some random ledge to find an illusory wall. \n\nBut that is a minor thing. The later levels, especially the last level, get really big and boring and you start to realize that it's better to just run through without fighting much. This is possible because Turok is fast, like, really fast. I think that is one of the reasons I like this game anyway.\n\nThe gameplay is really frantic, fluid and fast. There aren't any cutscenes interrupting you constantly which actually makes the game better I think. You are always moving, running and gunning. You have cool weapons which make you feel powerful. Also the world in the game has a pretty unique style to it, with that dinosaur and jungle theme. I always liked that threatening and dangerous feeling atmosphere in Turok.\n\nThe game isn't overly long, it took me around 7 hours to complete everything but I think this is OK. After that amount of time you have seen all the tricks the game can throw at you. This also makes it less of a problem that you cannot save the game anywhere but some sparsely placed save stations.", "timestamp_created": 1486031766, "timestamp_updated": 1486031766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29620041": {"recommendationid": "29620041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158700076", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491438154}, "language": "french", "review": "Je recommande ce jeu turok suivant mon test :\nGRAPHISMES : 19/20 . tr\u00e8s beaux , textures Full HD , fluidit\u00e9 de 60Hz et + , animations 3D \nJOUABILITE : 18/20 . bien prise en charge compl\u00e8te de la manette XBOX 360 sans fil pour PC , peut aussi prendre en charge beaucoup de manettes de marques diff\u00e9rentes , tr\u00e8s correct gameplay , on sent notre personnage marcher sauter et voler ! ,   tr\u00e8s r\u00e9actif sur les boutons , differentes options permettant de tout param\u00e9trer la jouabilit\u00e9 comme la sensibilit\u00e9 , la difficult\u00e9 , etc ...\nDUREE DE VIE DU JEU : 15/20 . avec une dizaine de niveaux et leurs boss + un nouvelle partie \u00e9diteur (cartes et objets) , comptez 15-20 heures pour avoir fait le tour\nBANDE SONORE : 16/20 . ah les musiques d'\u00e9poque (le jeu turok est une remast\u00e9risation de celui de 1997)\nFUN : 17/20 .

Sadly more of the latter two than the first one, but the dinosaurs are usually the tougher opponents.\nIf you care to explore and use the map feature you will most likely find all the secrets pretty easily and get rewarded with a weapon that can basically two shot the final boss (if you hit him well, I needed all three shots it had).\n\nThe bosses, outside of the first one, are a bit too easy, because you can easily run away and shoot them without taking any damage if you do it well. The regular enemies are fine overall, but I would have liked more variety at times (there is a decent amount, but not within the stages) especially in terms of dinosaurs. There are raptors and dimetrodons with and without guns and triceratop riders. other than that the dinosaur-like opponents could just be considered aliens as well. There's also dragonflys and beetles, which are merely there to annoy you.\n\nThe biggest issue in terms of enemies for me was the respawn rate. Dinosaurs always respawn after a while, and later on even the cyber seargents, which take lots of ammo and deal good damage respawn quite a bit (even though not infinitely I believe). I'd rather have more initially than run back and get randomly attacked in an area I believed I cleared out.\n\nThere are also quite a few platforming sections, but outside of a few exceptions they are pretty easy and give you a safety net early on. The hardes ones are ironically inside of secret portals where you can't die anyway.\n\nLast but not least you sort of have to manage your ammo occasionally. It's not a big deal most of the time, and basic enemies early on can actually be one shot with a knive, but later on you might get phases where you get low on ammo for a few minutes. I repeat it's managable and adds to the difficulty in a nice way, but you can't just randomly shoot at everything without aiming and hope for a quick ammo refill. I would also recommend, unless you got really far into a level to simply reload a save instead of respawning. You keep your ammo but loose your backpack, armor and health above 100.

I'd forgotten just how good this game was/is. One of two first-person shooters - the other being Exhumed/Powerslave - that took the genre and redefined it for a console audience in a way that didn't make it feel like we were being given a cut-down, second-rate experience, but instead something that was polished and thoroughly entertaining, while still designed specifically around the way that console games are played. Games for playing on the television, sat on the sofa, controller in hand.\n\nTurok consolises the FPS experience fantastically well. Secret bonus levels! Collect 100 things for an extra life! JUMPING! Most developers *still* can't get first-person platforming right. Iguana perfected it the first time of asking. \n\nThe sense of movement and momentum in this game is spot-on, from the character's walking and running speeds - it's here that we're introduced to analogue speed control in an FPS and what a diffrence it makes - to that tilting thing that the screen does when you strafe. \n\nLittle tricks that you discover the more you play. Want aiming assistance? Turn the mini-map on. Not sure precisely when to jump when running to the end of a platform? Keep going until the view dips a little. \n\nEverything else about the game is nuts, in the way that the FPS used to be before developers started introducing missions, \"reality\" and po-faced storylines. Who the hell are these people you're fighting? Why are some of them dressed in army fatigues and armed with automatic rifles and shotguns while others are in skull costumes blowing darts at you? Where the hell did the dinosaurs come from? Where the hell did the bloody *aliens* come from?\n\nAlso, dat weaponry. Every single gun is satisfying to use, not just the later, nuclear-powered madness. There's a sense of impact and power to your attacks that marries to the movement brilliantly. \n\nYeah, there are aspects that weren't great originally and remain kind of rubbish now. That first boss is a real pain in the backside and, I'd imagine, a potential sticking point for many. There are too many identical-looking caves linking areas together. But those things are forgotten about once you're past them. Everything else is good enough to make you forget them.\n\nWhen this version initially came out, the 'overwhelmingly positive' reviews baffled me. Surely it was just a nostalgia thing, people's memories clouded by the fact that there wasn't really anything else available on the N64 at the time, once you'd polished off Mario and Pilotwings? But no. In its own way, Turok is as enjoyable as anything else that ever hit Nintendo's machine.

The bosses in this game seem to drag on for a long time. They just feel like bullet sponges and they aren't really that hard to beat, all it takes to beat them is to constantly strafe around them. And my biggest gripe with the game has to be the platforming. Most levels require you to make these ridiculous jumps on small platforms. You have to be super precise with your jumps or else you'll fall to your death with most jumps. This can get really frustrating considering the later levels have many platforming segments.

Truth is it's not exact - the fog is much further away, and the textures are better (though I didn't really notice this until looking back at the N64 version).\n\nWhilst I struggled through the levels on the N64 game, I was now able to whip through them, slowed down primarily by the maziness of some of the levels which Turok 1 and 2 are known for. The AI definitely feels somewhat nerfed to cater for the expected N64 controls and pace, though I did lose a few lives here and there regardless.\n\nThe final level feels a bit too big for the sake of being big, but at least it didn't involve monotonously getting lost for hours. Some of the plasma weapons felt useless too compared to the other options, though these are critisisms of Turok 1 itself, and not this release.\n\nThe map editor is a fantastic bonus, though custom-made maps are few and far between. Shame, because there's some good potential with the objects provided by this game (as opposed to other options, such as Duke3D).\n\nOverall I am very pleased with this.

Well, actually, no, it's not. I'm recommending it because of nostalgia, nothing more. If you never played the N64 original then you might as well consider this review a thumbs down. Despite the many refinements Night Daive have made to the original game it's still not good, and never will be.\n\nSo what's wrong with Turok?, you might ask. Well, other than the obvious aspect of the visuals, which can be excused due to the game being 20 years old, there's a list of problems that exist not only in this port, but in the original game too. The port is actually very good, and credit to Night Dive for a job well done.\n\nThe main issues with Turok, mostly left over from the original version, are as follows:\n\n-Poor level design. There are many areas in the vast, sprawling levels where it's very easy to get lost or turned around. The map helps to alleviate some of the issues but is not really dequate. In many places vital areas are hidden like secrets, making progress difficult and replaying the levels a neccessary chore.\n-Terrible hit boxes, both for enemies and your own weapons. The hit boxes tend towards the large side which isn't so bad for enemies, although it does look stupid, but will lead to cases of shooting the ground at your feet when you know you were aiming clear over the edge of a ledge.\n-Poor audio/visual feedback. It's often unclear whether or not you are hitting an anemy, and even when you do the response from enemy is very unsatisfying. Enemies have no stagger animation, or indeed any response to being hit.\n-Nonsensical arsenal layout where redundant weapons are not replaced or removed, but exist in the player's inventory alongside the superior version of the weapon.\n-Lack of challenge. This is more of an issue with the port than the original game, as having access to mouse and keyboard controls in a game made for a controller with a single analogue stick makes everything a lot easier.\n\nThose are the main problems I found with Turok. There are others but those are mostly nitpicks so I won't go in to them here. But even so, if you played Turok when it originally released then go ahead and give this version a try. The port is better than the original, certainly, adding many quality-of-life features that we have come to expect from modern games, but doesn't detract from the nostalgia feeling.

The outdated controls ruin it for me, making Turok lost to me... until now.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI think it is important this remastered version\u00a0exists; projects like this are great for the preservation of video games. Custom controls, improved resolution, and reduced fog in the game make me feel like I am playing Turok the way the original developers intended.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nTurok consists of eight fairly large and open environments packed with clever level design, platforming, and\u00a0gunplay\u00a0that is\u00a0heavily inspired by early Id Software First Person Shooters.\n\u00a0\nThe weapon variety in Turok keeps the shooting mechanics fun and fresh.\u00a0 With the exception of a cheap sniping enemy and some inconsistent boss fights I really enjoyed the classic shooting style of\u00a0Turok, it is fast paced and keeps you on the move.\n\u00a0\nThe speed of Turok and the clever level design make the exploration in Turok fun. The in-game map is basic but I found it essential to helping me navigate Turoks worlds. There is a lot of swimming, climbing, and platforming involved in the exploration, the latter of which can be challenging depending on your experience and skill level with platforming in a first person view.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nI enjoyed Turok a lot and think it is a great classic First Person Shooter. The shooting mechanics are good but it is the level design and exploration that I enjoyed the most. If you are new to Turok and are expecting a straightforward shooter just\u00a0keep in mind there is a lot of exploration and platforming involved. Turok\u00a0is just as much about navigation and\u00a0fast paced exploration as it is shooting.\n\n(I played on Windows 10, no crashes, overall the game ran very well.)", "timestamp_created": 1484110609, "timestamp_updated": 1484276177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29167280": {"recommendationid": "29167280", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960838790", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483752891}, "language": "english", "review": "Just as great as I remember it to be.\nThe music in this game is as close to perfect as it comes.

While the controller looked like it was designed by aliens for people with more than two hands, the games it had and the way it utilized that controller cemented it into the hearts of gamers in all corners of Earth.\n\nAnd when it came to the top FPS titles, there was GoldenEye... And then there was Turok.\n\nTurok: Dinosaur Hunter was the first FPS I ever played, and it is one I have fond memories of. And while I loved the second in the series the most, I will never forget this game.\n\nStory:\n\nOddly enough, the story was not told in-game, but was hinted at in manuals and other forms of media.\n\nYou play as Tal'Set Fireseed, a Native American from the Saquin Tribe as he is transported to Galyanna, The Lost Land, a land where time has literally NO meaning and is inhabited by all sorts of aliens, peoples, interdimensional beings and DINOSAURS.\nHowever, this new world and ours are now under a terrible threat.\nThe Campaigner, a meglomaniacal cybernetic tyrant, has devealoped a superweapon that threatens not only The Lost Land, but also our world as well, as he masses an army of cyborgs and cybernetically-enhanced dinosaurs in a terrible plan of universal domination.\nIt is up to Tal'Set to become Turok, the Son Of Stone, and end the diobolical machinations of The Campaigner once and for all.\n\nGameplay:\n\nI'll admit, the N64 verson was a lot harder to play, but this one is definitely better to control, though the difficulty is still there.\n\nThe game really does handle smoothly, and it does manage to feel fluid, without any hiccups at all.\n\nThe enemy AI is very notable, as they are vicious and can think cunningly and gang up on you, so be wary what you do.\n\nGraphics:\n\nSadly, the graphics look very dated, but that is not imprtant to me. You can be a delicious cake even if the frosting looks as old as your granny running in terror in the rain. Even so, the graphics add to the charm, and to be honest, they aren't the worst.\n\nWeapons:\n\nThere is an INSANE amount of weapons you can hold and carry, from the usual pistol, shotguns, assault rifle and bow, to a minigun, rocket and grenade launchers, a cannon that unleashes a NUCLEAR BLAST, and a fair bit more. Whatever you decide to tackle your enemies with, this game will give you those options.\n\nSound:\n\nThe sound has upgraded quite a bit since the N64 version, and while it does have moments where it could have been better, it is a far cry better than it once was, and the N64 version was pretty good for it's time.\n\nRating (1 being the best, 10 being the worst) 3.2 (Gold Rating, Four Stars out of Five)\n\nThis game is the best way to experience the original Turok, with the upgrades and better bells and whistles that you need.

The levels are largely fun to explore, you have a fairly wide arsenal at your disposal and most (but not all) secrets aren't excessively obtuse to find. \n\nI would definitely consider this game to be a must-have for any fan of the genre who's already played the classics (Doom, Quake, Unreal) and who seeks something fresh to scratch that itch.  \n\nIt's also worth noting that Turok was originally meant to be played with a controller on an N64, so you may want to up that difficulty a notch if you're going to be using mouse+keyboard. \n\nFinally, if longevity is a worry, all I can say is that it took me somewhere around 10-11 hours to complete it blind and find the \"main\" secrets linked to an endgame unlockable. This was done in 'Hard' mode, which is not the hardest setting, so your experience may vary.\n\nFor those who like meaningless numbers I rate this game 7 Triceratops out of 10.\n", "timestamp_created": 1484004013, "timestamp_updated": 1484004013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29136110": {"recommendationid": "29136110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062813911", "num_games_owned": 586, "num_reviews": 575, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483815784}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine [/h1]\n\nTurok: Dinosaur Hunter (or simply Turok) is a game originally developed by Iguana Entertainment and originally published by Acclaim Entertainment and now has been faithfully ported to modern systems by Nightdive Studios\n\nTo keep it short, Turok has aged incredibly well from the first time I played it to this modern port, especially with this very good overhaul, and even without the obvious nostalgia that this game has for me personally\n\nIf you are looking for something that can compete with the incredible DOOM, pick this one up.

Turok is a visually limited, dated game with next to no story, but it had a bouncy, almost Crash Bandicoot-esque feel to it that made the game feel surprisingly upbeat and unambiguously fun-for-fun's-sake in a way that very few FPSes manage. Even Doom is a bit bogged down in that regard with its demonic gloom and preoccupation with macho metal badassery. Plus you get to fight dinosaurs, which I don't think happens nearly enough in games, despite it seeming like an obvious match.\n\nBuuut then the last two levels happened, and my goodwill dropped like a rock. I feel like the game's assets were planned and developed before they even thought about doing any level design, because while the last two levels have more unique enemy models than the rest of the game put together, the actual design of the levels are absolute crap. The penultimate level is crowded with way too many respawning enemies, no real visual direction so it's impossible to get any sort of instinct as to what's an exploratory path and what's a main path, and is filled with points of no return, especially after the halfway point where it basically turns into a totally different level. And the final level stacks hordes of overpowered enemies on top of making most of them respawn, is now almost completely linear, and drags on for FAR too long so that by the end of it even the two back-to-back final bosses were just an extra speed bump to the end credits.\n\nThe first 3/4 of the game is actually a lot of fun and made me wish that the other Turok games were available on Steam, but if they're anything like the last quarter of this game I wouldn't bother with them even if they were.", "timestamp_created": 1483914041, "timestamp_updated": 1483914041, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500949", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29123458": {"recommendationid": "29123458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287735468", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484517839}, "language": "english", "review": "Man oh Man!!

Each stage has a number of keys to collect which unlocks the other stages.\nLevels are not straight forward so you will have to explore alot. You may have to play some stages multiple times.\n\nThere are a variety of weapons. However some weapons share the same ammo. Which means some weapons become redundant. Or you end up wasting ammo that could have been used for a stronger weapon.\nAnd some weapons look fancy and powerful but feel useless.\n\nThere are platforming sections. They are not terrible like Rise of the Triad 2013 for example. But certain jumps require extra precision since you cant see your feet to know how far from the edge you are.\n\nPortals for bonus levels appear from time to time. They are not bad just boring.\n\nYou can only save at specific locations. There are checkpoint in between you can go through. You collect items for extra lives.\n\nThe game is not timed but you'll find yourself rushing because enemies respawn fast in some areas.\n\nGame suffers from framerate drops.

Je ne peux pas vraiment juger du travail de remast\u00e9risation, par contre, ne pouvant pas comparer au jeu original. \n- La dur\u00e9e de vie est correcte, consid\u00e9rant la difficult\u00e9 et la rejouabilit\u00e9. \n\nQu'est ce qui fait que Turok est ... pas cool? \n\n- Les ennemis qui apparaissent totalement randomly, sans raison, comme \u00e7a. Ce n'est pas frustrant, \u00e7a n'a juste aucune logique et vous fait user vos munitions (et votre patience) pour rien.\n- Le fait que les ennemis humains et dinosaures ne se battent pas entre eux, en tout cas pas dans mon jeu.

Ce sont s\u00fbrement des magiciens, ou des demi-dieux.\n- Les bugs.

Much like Doom 64 EX (which this same person created), it is a hybrid of a PC gaming engine with N64 assets to make it compatible with modern systems, resolutions and Keybindings. If you can stand the first person platforming, respawning enemies along with limited ammo (on hard mode), potentially annoying backtracking, and N64 Era textures, you'll find an entertaining classic with fun guns.[/h1]\n\nTurok: Dinosaur Hunter on the Nintendo 64 was one of those many games in my childhood that I played and remembered fondly, but never finished. The world design, sound design, and weapons stuck with me. Trying to play it now can be a little cumbersome, so playing it with modern controls and resolutions make it alot easier to play. You can actually find the abandonware of the PC edition - but it is probably missing music and doesn't support modern resolutions and I think you can't rebind keys - also it costs $50 Amazon.  I'm not 100% sure on the development of the game, but it is some sort of hybrid of the N64, a PC engine and maybe the PC version. There are improved graphics (anti-aliasing, lighting), depth of field options (which reduces the distance fog for you AND enmies), and even a recently added Level editor and Workshop/Mod support - I recommend the iddqd_textures (HD Textures)\n\nThe game is largely the same as the N64 version, though there are some minor level detail edits/editons that I don't remember from the N64 classic and didn't see in the PC version - so extreme purists might be turned off, but I don't think any \"level flow/pathing\" has changed. One of the updates mentions the game uses the N64 sounds which were apparently better than the PC version - which is welcome because I loved some of the classic soundtrack (especially Lv 1, Underwater, and Cave themes) and Turok 1 has some of the best death grunts in FPS history. I didn't realize until playing far into this game how prevalent first person platforming is, which will turn some gamers of. Also, some enemies have hitscan weapons - it doesn't make sense how a blowdart can hit me from behind the shooter or the pulse rifle shots hit me near instantly while mine travel a bit slower. You can exploit the AI the bit and most humanoid enemies can be killed in 1-3 knife hits.\n\nI recommend Turok. It comes from a passionate developer that makes blog posts lamenting over minor issues many gamers wouldn't notice.  The $20 tag is high for an old game, but it has at least that amount of work put in to make it happen.

One of my favourite games from my childhood. Grew up mostly playing this one and Evolution, but man oh man is it a great series. This game in particular is probably one of the best and this remake does it even more justice.\n\nPros \n- Amazing, powerful, hilariously unrealistic weapons. From the Bow to the Chronoscepter, they're all useful in all stages of the game and incredibly fun to use (my personal favorite being the Grenade Launcher).\n\n- Fun sense of exploration. All of the levels have different secrets to be found, many are in very unsuspecting spots. They are also fairly complex and not so straight-forward.\n\n- Good selection of graphical, audio, video, and gameplay options. I'm so thankful to be able to play with  110 FOV.\n\n- Very Quake-like. Secrets, the weapons, etc. \n\n- Level Editor! The devs released this pretty recently to open up the community to making their own levels and the like. I've been having a bit of trouble with playing some custom levels, but its not a huge deal. \n\nCons\n- Lack of story. Not really a major con, as it doesn't really affect the gameplay. You gotta read the comics to get a basis of the game and understand why you're a Native American man running and gunning other men, dinosaurs, dinosaurs WITH GUNS, aliens, robots, etc.\n\n- A LOT OF JUMPING PUZZLES AND PLATFORMING. This isn't something that can really be changed, but it is what it is. They're just a little frustrating on some levels. \n\nVerdict: 9/10\n\nThis is a fantastic game and definitely worth the price.

I was more of a Nintendo fan back then so the N64 was my main console over the PS1 granted I was till a PC kid but once the N64 games started pumping out games like Goldeneye 64 and Turok I mainly played them for quite some time.  While the N64\u2019s hardware was lacking in a few ways I still loved the console even if by today\u2019s standards looking back it was horribly antiquated compared to disk based console systems.  \n\nTurok was a good game back then, I don\u2019t remember a lot about it but I do recall it running moderately well compared to higher fidelity games like Perfect Dark 64 (even with the extra ram).  It may have been even one of my first semi open world/exploration kind of games that I ever got into but I\u2019m not sure, still though the different worlds/levels and weapons always added some refreshing gameplay from time to time.\n\nThis remake of the original PC port is every way better then the 64 version by far, now that it\u2019s on PC you can now mod the game to have say user made higher def textures and now the developer Nightdive studios has added a level editor, something that the original N64 version did not have.  The game itself is everything that I remember it from my younger days yet runs at least 10 times better as far as performance which should go without saying given how powerful PCs are today compared to back then.  If you had fond memories of this game back then or even recently if you are a retro gamer then you will get those same feelings.  \n\nTurok is an early platformer and because of this you will probably die to falls quite a bit or have to redo sections because you fell off or missed a jump.  That is one thing that at times frustrated me because it is quite prevalent in many levels and while the extra performance boost for this port is helpful so that there is little to no input lag you will still probably die or fall many times.\n\nI\u2019m glad that Nightdive is continuing support for the game, as they just recently released the map editor and now the Steam version has Workshop support for user created levels.  I eagerly await Turok 2 if this is the type of quality that I should expect from this developer, and considering they have done other games like a remastering of System Shock 1 and 2 which players seem to like quite a bit.\n\nIf you are into retro play or you were alive and playing on an N64 platform you will enjoy this for sure.  Though while the price is a bit steep given how old the game really is, I\u2019d say it\u2019s mostly worth it but I\u2019d still get Turok on sale unless $20 is not that big of a deal for you.", "timestamp_created": 1483409607, "timestamp_updated": 1483409618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561440", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28963272": {"recommendationid": "28963272", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985396953", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483409389}, "language": "english", "review": "Holds up niceley.\nCant wait for seeds!\nbewareoblivionisathand", "timestamp_created": 1483409439, "timestamp_updated": 1483409439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28960999": {"recommendationid": "28960999", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970576399", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484800526}, "language": "english", "review": "TUROK 2 WHEN??", "timestamp_created": 1483402695, "timestamp_updated": 1483402695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466263", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28926242": {"recommendationid": "28926242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120796441", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 8118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511753636}, "language": "english", "review": "Turok Dinosaur Hunter was the game of my childhood, and when I heard  they were going to remaster my favorite video game.

Story\nIn Turok spielt man den titelgebenden Ureinwohner Turok. Seine Welt wird von einem B\u00f6sen Wesen namens Campaigner bedroht und so macht man sich auf, dass B\u00f6se zu besiegen. Wie bei vielen Shootern ist die Story auch hier eher Nebensache. \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=824179210\n\n2. Gameplay\nHier bekommt man typische Shooterkost, der man aber anmerkt, dass das Spiel aus einer ganz anderen Zeit kommt. (Release f\u00fcr das N64 war 1997). Das Gameplay ist sehr schnell und die Level teilweise extrem verwinkelt. Ganz anders als bei heutigen Shootern. Und was macht riesig Spa\u00df, wie zu Zeiten von Quake und Unreal durch die Level zu jagen und reflexartig die Gegner abzuknallen. \n\n3. Steuerung\nIch spiel das Spiel mit M+T wie es sich bei einem Shooter geh\u00f6rt (Wie ich es damals auf dem N64 mit Pad spielen konnte ist mit ein R\u00e4tsel) Auch hier ist alles sehr klassisch. Laufen, schie\u00dfen und springen. Mehr braucht man nicht. Kein Nachladen, keine Deckung suchen.\n\n\n4. Grafik/Technik/Musik\nDie Grafik ist nat\u00fcrlich v\u00f6llig veraltet war damals aber super. Bei diesem HD Remaster wurde auch kam etwas daran ge\u00e4ndert. Es l\u00e4uft auf aktueller Hardware und in den entsprechenden Aufl\u00f6sungen. Dazu ein paar Kleinigkeiten wie z.B. Godrays und eine sch\u00f6nere Wassertextur. \nDer Soundtrack ist passend und sehr treibend. Dazu h\u00f6rt man immer wieder einen Dino br\u00fcllen. \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=824179168\n\n5. Add-On: \nGibt es nicht. \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=826445015\n\n6. Multiplayer: \nGibt es nicht.\n\n7. Achievments: \nIch habe 7 von 8 geschafft (88% ) bei einmaligem Durchspielen.  \n\n8. In-Home Streaming / Steam Link\nNicht getestet.\n\n9. Pro und Contra \n\nPro:\n- Wunderbares Retro Shootergameplay\n- Toller und treibender Sound. \n- Gute Steuerung\n- Sch\u00f6ne und komplexe Level mit verschiedenen Themen. \n- Viele Waffen die man auch alle dabei hat.\n- Faire Bossk\u00e4mpfe.\n-\tFreies Speichern\n-\tUnverbrauchtes Setting\n\nContra:\n- Grafik veraltet. \n-\tRecht kurze Spielzeit.\n-\tTeilweise zu komplexes Level Design so dass man trotz Karte eine bisschen herumirrt. \n\n\n10. Fazit\nAls Fan der ersten Stunde hat es riesig Spa\u00df gemacht, das Spiel nochmal durchzuspielen. Vor allem mit HD Grafik und mit M+T. J\u00fcngeren Spielergenerationen w\u00fcrde ich aber von dem Game abraten. Es ist grafisch zu alt und auch sonst nicht mit aktuellen Shootern zu vergleichen (evtl. noch mit dem neuen Doom). Fans der alten Turok Spiele kann ich dieses Remaster aber ans Herz legen. Ich hatte sehr viel Spa\u00df damit, zumal man doch einiges Vergessen hat. Im Sale war das Spiel f\u00fcr 5 Euro zu bekommen. Der Release Preis war mit 20 \u20ac f\u00fcr meine Begriffe zu hoch angesetzt. Der Entwickler hat auch schon angek\u00fcndigt, dass Turok 2 ebenfalls kommen wird. Ich freu mich drauf, zumal ich den zweiten Teil nur mal angespielt habe. \n\nVergleichbare Spiele: \nAlte und schnelle Shooter der alten Schule wie Doom, Quake, Unreal usw. \n\nFragen und Anregungen oder Kritik immer gerne in die Kommentare posten :-) \n\nPC: \nIntel i5 2500K @ 4Ghz\n16 GB Ram\nnVidia GF 970 mit 376.09\nWin 10 Pro 64 Bit\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1483143506, "timestamp_updated": 1483143506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28848580": {"recommendationid": "28848580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031477352", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511653775}, "language": "english", "review": "Great remaster that brings back good memories.

Keine Ahnung warum aber eine Story gibt es nicht, aufjedenfall ist von Menschen, Dinos, K\u00e4fern, Echsen und Robotern alles dabei. Es gibt ausserdem 4 verschiedene Schwierigkeitsgrade die man einfach \u00e4ndern kann nach Belieben.\n\nMan k\u00e4mpft sich von Level zu Level sucht Schl\u00fcssel, Chronozepter-Teile (f\u00fcr die st\u00e4rkste Waffe im Spiel) und Secrets. Die Level sind alle sehr weitl\u00e4ufig aufgebaut und haben immer verschiedene Thematiken, im Spielverlauf bekommt man allerhand Waffen die alle ihren eigenen Charme haben und auch f\u00fcr verschiedene Gegnerarten Speziell sind. Was das Spiel vielleicht etwas Schwieriger macht ist das man nur an Speicherpunken Speichern kann und der Rest des Levels mit Checkpoints ausgestattet ist.\n\nEs ist auch keine 1:1 Umsetzung von der PC oder N64 Version die man gut auf YouTube vergleichen kann.\n\nDie \u00c4nderungen sind:\n-\tEs gibt ein paar neue Schl\u00fcsselstandorte\n-\tDie Grafik ist besser als bei der N64 oder alten PC Version\n-\tDie Aufl\u00f6sung kann sehr hoch gestellt werden und hat Widescreen\n-\tDie Musik ist die von der PC Version und nicht von der N64\n-\tEs ist Modbar gemacht worden und hat einen Workshop\n-\tUncut im Gegensatz zur Deutschen Version\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGrafik:\n\nDie Grafik aufjedenfall besser als die von der alten PC Version und vom Nintendo 64.

Now as I have played my way though half of the game and just completed Level 4 I have to say that buying this game (even only at -75%, sorry Nightdive) was absolutely one of my best buys this year.\nThis game brings back so much memories and is so fun to play. I thought like \"what the hell, 97% positive reviews ... they can not be serious\" before, but i pretty much like it too. This is one gold old FPS from \"good old times\" :)\nOne thing I was a bit confused about is that Level 1 is at some points DIFFERENT from the Level 1 on N64 (PAL Version). I only can compare it to N64 PAL version, not to the original PC Version.\nThis might also apply to some other Levels. I guess you originally were NOT able to get the Minigun in Level 2 (a few metres away from the end portal) because you could not destroy the \"spikes\" with a Tek-Arrow. In Level 3 it seemed like there have been some backpacks added, but some Tek Armors are missing. I played it more than 15 years ago for the last time, so maybe I remember something wrong^^\nThe games is apparently faster than before and I think this is really good.\nStill each level untill now took about 45-60 minutes for me to complete it.\nI liked the robots in N64 PAL version more than the humans in this version, because the robots colours were more different from the environment, while I have got sometimes problems to see enemie humans near some walls. Moreover the robots just disappeared when they were dead, while the humans sometimes still keep on moving some seconds and you can not be sure if they are really dead already.\n\nThe only pretty bad issue:\nYour characters positioning is sometimes very frustrating. Back on N64 I could very good use the character arrow on the minimap and center it on some plattforms at areas requiring lots of jumping. The center of the arrow was the center of your character. NOW the tip of the arrow is the center of the your character. When you look down to where your feets are supposed to be and then go to the edge of a plattform, you will fall down (visually through the plattform) even if you see yourself still standing on the plattform.This feels and plays really different from the original. especially in Level 3 directly before the boss I messed up more jumps than ever before in all complete playthroughs of Turok.\nThis problem also occurs at some stairs in Level 3. If you a close to a stair and want strafe to the left or right, then you can not move. It feels like if there is a invisible wall.\nWhen you turn around 180\u00b0, then you can understand both of these issues, as your view then is completely different from before. Then you can see, that you are leaving the plattform and you can see that you are still next to the stairs.\nSomething is pretty wrong with it to be honest.\nAnd one more smaller issue... dodging the falling down rocks at some point in Level 2 really is a PAIN. If you dont look at the sky (where you can see them hanging^^) and are REALLY slowly and carefully, then you will get smashed. If you walk straight forward and hear the sound of them falling, they it is already too late and you will die.\nMoreover I had wished that you (even though it also was not possible in the original game) can change the ammo of Bow and and Shotgun, so that you can choose on your own whether to use arrow or tek-arrow and regular shotgun ammo or explosive shotgung ammo. I pretty much never use all of my explosive shotgun ammo (dont wanna waste it^^), so I barely ever could collect any regular shotgun ammo.\n\nBut still this is really a great old-school FPS, which I absolutely can recommend, but - sorry again Nightdive studios - not for the full price of 20 bucks. I bought it at -75% and if I had knewn before how good and fun it is, i would have bought it before already at -50%.\nAt max. 10 Bucks you can not do anything wrong buying it, when you are a fan of old FPS games.\n\nEDIT:\nNow I have completely finished the game after about 8 hours. More or less 1 hour each level, but Level 8 took longer. I could not remember how big it is^^\nJust to add: In one Level I had some technical problems which only could be fixed by restarting the game.

Es la primera palabra que se me viene a la cabeza al hablar de Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. No se trata solamente del mismo juego que maravill\u00f3 al mundo tanto en Nintendo 64 como en PC hay\u00e1 por el 97, sino que estamos ante una edici\u00f3n mejorada con bastante trabajo detr\u00e1s para mejorar la experiencia que nos ofrec\u00eda Turok, que ya en su \u00e9poca era sobresaliente.  \n\nSi est\u00e1s leyendo esto seguramente sea porque como yo, jugaste a Turok en su d\u00eda en PC o N64, donde destac\u00f3 de sobremanera por unos gr\u00e1ficos espectaculares para su \u00e9poca, una jugabilidad endiabladamente fren\u00e9tica y niveles gigantescos llenos de secretos por descubrir, puzzles, trampas, etc. acompa\u00f1ados de un arsenal enorme y variado y una gran cantidad de enemigos entre los que se encuentran los famosos dinosaurios, uno de los principales atractivos del juego. \n\nGracias a todo esto y m\u00e1s, el primero de la saga est\u00e1 considerado como uno de los mejores shooters que existieron por aquel entonces y que a\u00fan a d\u00eda de hoy se sigue recordando, aunque la mayor\u00eda de los dem\u00e1s juegos que continuaron la saga no estuvieran a la altura (salvo Turok 2, que fue genial y que tambi\u00e9n viene camino de Steam remasterizado de la mano de Nightdive Studios). \n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 tiene este Turok que hace que sea la mejor versi\u00f3n disponible? pues muy f\u00e1cil: aparte de a\u00f1adir total compatibilidad con sistemas operativos y equipos actuales, podemos jugar a altas resoluciones, se han mejorado texturas, distancia de representaci\u00f3n, efectos de luz, algunas modificaciones en los niveles (desde hace unos d\u00edas incluye editor), reflejos en el agua, logros y un control totalmente remodelado, adapt\u00e1ndose al rat\u00f3n + teclado a la perfecci\u00f3n y a\u00f1adiendo total compatibilidad con mando. \n\nTodo lo que un remaster debe tener: respetando fielmente el t\u00edtulo original pero puliendo peque\u00f1os detalles y a\u00f1adiendo mejoras para que la experiencia sea lo mejor posible teniendo en cuenta la antig\u00fcedad del juego.\n\nOs dejo mi lista de pros y contras (muchas cosas se valoran en funci\u00f3n de la \u00e9poca en la que sali\u00f3 el juego): \n\n\u200b[h1]PROS:\u200b[/h1]\n\n- Si fuiste fan de Turok en su \u00e9poca, ES UNA COMPRA OBLIGADA\n\n- Remaster muy currado: respeta fielmente al t\u00edtulo original pero incluye muchas mejoras que lo hacen muy disfrutable a pesar de la antig\u00fcedad\n\n- La mejora del control es impresionante, muy recomendable usar rat\u00f3n y teclado.

To 1997! A time when 3D graphics had firmly supplanted 2D on consoles, and analog control was new. A time when reflection mapping and particle effects meant a game was realistic, and we considered these derp faces highly detailed.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=789409826\n\nA time when platforming meant insanely challenging precision hopping 1,000 feet in the air between what one magazine article of the era lamented as \"floating rocks the size of dinner plates.\" All with slippery, floaty controls compared to what you're likely used to today, and a draw distance we all didn't know better than to think was just \"ambient fog\" that added atmosphere to our games.\n\nAn era where grey, green, and lava red were considered a stunningly vibrant array of colors.\n\n[h1]Make dinosaurs extinct again[/h1]\n\nThis game... ohhh, this game! When I purchased an N64 back in the 90s, I got four games with it. Doom 64 (still my favorite classic style Doom ever,) Mario 64, Star Wars Shadows of the Empire (someone please remaster it with modern controller support and upscale like this game, please!) ... and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\n\nBy today's standards, this is a brief, ridiculously challenging on any difficulty above easy from the second or third level on, very ugly, less than ideally controllable (although it feels fine with mouse and keyboard) first person shooter. But in 1997, it felt revolutionary. With a speed and polish something akin to the original Quake, graphics which at the time were gorgeously slick, the appeal of fighting dinosaurs and soldiers in jungles, and plenty of secrets, it was a big hit and a staple on the system.\n\nThis is a fairly no frills port, but adds modern controller support, FOV settings (I recommend the lowest one for something akin to the original game's FOV, but crank it up for that high speed feeling fisheye effect if you want it,) vibrancy settings (with Reshade - use version 3 and OpenGL incidentally - and vibrancy turned on but all the way down, the game really pops and looks like the original but with much higher contrast,) FXAA, bloom, *massively increased draw distance*and other bells and whistles. There is no retexture, but existing textures natively scale all the way to 4K resolutions. So everything looks sharp, if dated.\n\nThere are eight levels, and one hub stage. The goal of the levels is to find all the keys which unlock subsequent stages (so if you miss any, you'll need to replay them a bit.) Saves work via manual save points, and a checkpoint system only restores you after death during your current session. Loading always takes you to your last manual save point. Old school.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=788498785\n\nThe game is much more challenging than I remember. Some of that is due to revamped AI toughness, but mainly it's just that this is a pretty challenging game, especially the platforming sections. I'm much better at it now than I was in the 90s, thankfully. But expect a tough time due to the save system. \n\nUsing a controller, the game works fine (native dual analog control just like you'd expect,) but even after tweaking the sensitivity and turn acceleration settings for more than an hour, I couldn't ever get it to feel quite as precise as modern games do. The acceleration curves are very dated. Mouse and keyboard feel great, however. That said, I did adapt and play with my 360 controller. I wanted to relive the console experience, just with twin analog. \n\nLevel variety is decent. Jungles, treetop villages, lost ruins, volcanic plains, and mechanical bases. Enemies are pretty epic in my opinion. Dinosaurs, soldiers, soldiers riding dinosaurs, dinosaurs modified with weapons, and later on, some fairly intimidating mechs. And this Suburban Commando era Hulk Hogan looking boss that I completely forgot about until replaying the game after 20 years.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=788498946\n\nWeapon variety is nice. Exploding arrows, a variety of guns, advanced energy weapons... all the things you'd expect. This game and its sequel always stuck out in my mind as the point where modern, animated weapons, and crazy alien tech with blue glowy energy started showing up in first person shooters. They still look pretty good, and as mentioned, have some pleasing particle effects. Honestly at times while replaying this, I was reminded of the Halo games' arsenals. Which may give you some idea of how modern it felt for 1997.\n\n[h1]Who should buy it?[/h1]\n\nAnyone cool with old school games in the vein of Quake, but with a more outdoor vibe. Anyone who doesn't mind old school save systems, and challenging platforming.\n\n[h1]Who should steer clear?[/h1]\n\nAnyone who doesn't want tough platforming sections, limited lives, manual save points, and dated visuals.

The Turok series has always been a strange one: Largely popular on the N64 platform it was best known for, but it had absolutely nothing on PC shooter competition even in the year it came out. Its sequels would take radical turns in gameplay style and features, often with mixed results, with Turok 2: Seeds of Evil typically being regarded as the last great Turok game, at least the last one most similar to its predecessor. A lousy reboot in 2008 simply called Turok all but killed off the semi-popular franchise, at least until last year when Night Dive Studios resurrected the first title and gave it a bit of a facelift (remaster, not remake) bringing the N64 classic to a wider audience. I never owned thus never played it on the N64 but I did acquire the PC version many years ago and enjoyed it quite a lot despite its shortcomings.\n\nTurok was originally a comic book, Turok: Son of Stone in the 60's, a relatively innocent series of books about two Native American brothers who went on adventures in a desolate valley populated with dinosaurs. In the early 90's Valiant Comics brought back a revamped series called Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and the setting was vastly altered: the valley is now 'The Lost Lands', a place where time moves in a self-contained loop. With dinosaurs, aliens, demons and future tech in a bizarre unison. The villain is an entity known as Mothergod who uses the Lost Land as a base of operations and outfits dinosaurs with intelligence-boosting implants turning them into 'bionisaurs'. From there on there's things like a post-apocalyptic future Earth, various Lovecraftian abominations and high-tech future warriors. Yeah, the 90's were here. There's many elements in this iteration that would show up in the games. Later on another series was published by Acclaim Comics in 1998 as a tie-in for Turok 1 and 2.\n\nTurok is not a character's name but a title meaning 'Son of Stone'. For many generations the mantle of Turok has been bestowed upon those who saw the protection of the barrier as their sacred duty, the barrier between this world and the others. The axis of all being the Lost Lands. Turok travels between alternate dimensions stopping those who would try to conquer the Lost Lands and thus all of the multiverse with it. In this game you are Tal'Set, a time-travelling Saquin warrior tasked with stopping The Campaigner, an evil warlord who controls a vast army of creatures in addition to his own troops, seeking pieces of the Chronoscepter in the Lost Lands. This ancient artifact, once assembled contains the power to rule the known universe.\n\nTurok's gameplay is standard for the era but closest I can compare it to would be the first Quake. Movement speed and jumping height are excellent and grant you a lot of mobility which allows you to easily sidestep and jump over enemy attacks. And jumping you will be doing a lot of, for even the most rudimentary skill it is absolutely mandatory to master if you're going to finish the game. Platforming is commonplace but not hard to pull off and is very responsive. Among this there's an assortment of keys you obtain in each level which are used to unlock the next, and a piece of the Chronoscepter in each level as well. The majority of the game takes place in outdoor environments with the occasional indoor section. Exploration is key as there's all kinds of stuff hidden around. Interactivity is decent with being able to scale certain walls, swimming, collapsing trees with explosive weapons and hunting deer and warthogs for extra health (tip: use regular shotgun shells for best results). There's no use function so activating things requires a simple approach or stepping on pressure plates. There's only eight levels but they're pretty large and take anywhere from 45 minutes to a little over an hour to finish.\n\nThe bestiary is surprisingly varied, well animated and different from one another. It's a bit ironic that the game's subtitle is Dinosaur Hunter since 6 of the 8 levels contain mainly humanoid enemy types like poachers, evil natives and the Campaigner's own troops. But there's a host of other lifeforms like cave dwelling leapers, giant beetles, the ape-like Purr-Linn, and of course dinosaurs, mainly biomechanical velociraptors and dimetrodons. The enemies get more bizarre the further you go, with aliens, demons and robots near the end and of course a few bosses sprinkled along the way. Death animations are also pretty violent, but nowhere near as gory as the sequel, considering this was on the N64 but by that time Nintendo had backed off with its censorship. People grab their throats with blood jetting out of their neck and raptors produce a crimson volcano from their maw more often than not, but it's pretty tame by today's standards.\n\nThe weapons were another highlight from this time period as most shooters had little more than 10 or so but Turok boosts a whoppin' 14 in all. From a lowly knife and Tek Bow to high-tech death dealing in the form of the atomic energy Fusion Cannon to the Chronoscepter itself. And all manner of shotguns, miniguns, grenade and rocket launchers, and alien technology in between. They're all great fun to use and are one of the main selling points of the game. The iconic Cerebral Bore from Turok 2 isn't in this one but what's here already is more than sufficient to get the job done.\n\nVisuals are obviously aged with early 3D models and low res textures but they're still competent like Quake's IMO and leave little guesswork as to what the hell you're looking at. As stated earlier everything's animated well and the addition of updated graphics options in this remaster do make things look a bit nicer. Originally the draw distance for the fog was abysmal due to console restrictions, the FOV was insanely low and the frame rate for the original PC version was capped at something odd like 42. Now the draw distance allows you to see more things (and some things you probably weren't meant to see), the FOV isn't retarded and the frame rate's a silky 60 easily making this the superior version of the game. Audio's low quality as they come straight from the source but they're not too ear-grating. The music's not bad though and mostly consists of fitting tribal beats, dreary ambient pieces and a sinister industrial style on the final level. The levels are mostly set in a jungle or ancient temple but throw some curve balls later on. Night Dive greatly reduced frustration in exploring these by doing some very minor streamlining, removing redundant hallways or reworking a section to flow better, and the placement of certain keys and some extra save zones on the tougher maps.\n\nCriticisms include the low difficulty in combat as most enemies aren't that challenging to fight and are easily exploited due to their animation, but hitscanners can be annoying and the pulse rifle wielding Campaigner sergeants are extremely aggressive and require a lot of jumping around while laying into them to not get hit. Hard difficulty isn't that much harder and just makes everyone bullet spongy and removes pickups from dead enemies, effectively screwing you out of the Mortal Wound pickup (permanently raises base health) if killing with the knife or regular arrows. Limited save areas as a result of consoles and the amount of platforming can be tedious, and the Chronoscepter piece on level 7 is very out of the way (useful hint: not all lava hurts you). Lastly if you can score hits with the Chronoscepter on the Campaigner it massively cheeses him.\n\nOverall, Turok is a very 90's FPS in its design but that's largely what makes it so unique and fun to play and I highly recommend it to fans of the genre.

Though there were some moments further in the game where it questions you \"Are the developers on crack when they are making this?\" lol.\n\nSo far the game is good, it lacks the story in game. All starts with you playing as Turok and you must collect the keys to unlock the levels, which is the max of 8 levels. Theres also a secret weapon through every level. Find it and you can use it, useful on the final battle.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat weapons.\nmassive killing later in the game.\nA game where you look for important items in order to progress.\nNo glitches or bugs except for one which i'll explain later in the bottom.\nYou play as a Indian tribe using modern weapons, so why not?\n\nCons:\n\nLess ammo and health, you have to be very conservative with your health and ammo, you also have lives which can be used for full health when you die. I just wish there can be some mystic water that regenerates health or something but I guess you'll have to play smart in order to beat it.\n\nNo autosaves or quick saves, you have to use a golden statue in order to save your game which is throughout the game. It gets pressuring without saving later, but when you do, its a relief. You have to walk at it in order to save your game.\n\nOverall: Its a really good game and I have a blast. Its actually worth a buy.\n\nGlitch/bug: Theres a white flickering light when you start playing and it gets annoying. However, I discovered the solution. Just click this link for instructions as it helped me and I was able to play it perfectly well.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/405820/discussions/0/365172547950979990/\n\nFollow it and you should be able to play.\n\nTips:\n\nDO NOT KILL ALL ENEMIES! Not sure if it depends on difficulty (I played hardcore) but some enemies respawn but not all. Just dont kill everyone, use your ammo wisely as I said its low. Very scarce. Some enemies like dinosaurs are not necessary to kill, if you seen some just run away. Dont bother knifing if you know how to not take damage and if you are patient. If any monsters that respawn such as dinosaurs are in your way, kill them but get out of that area quickly before they respawn. Which would mean you waste your ammo for nothing and you'll have a hard time finding refills.\n\nA secret weapon will help you in the final boss battle and the last piece of it will always be at the final boss so no worries, always keep your eyes on any suspicious areas. You'll know when you get it from the key menu in the pause menu. Its that lonely symbol from the other symbols (other symbols are keys btw).\n\nSecret areas exist in this game, so look out for them. It can save your life on crucial situation whenever you are low on health or ammo.\n\nCollect ammo and health wisely, the moment you collect everything, you'll probably wish you didnt when you are low on health and ammo. Leave them alone if you are packed, come back later when you actually do need it.\n\nLives, dont waste them on something ridiculous. Such as falling to your death, which is a primarily worst thing to waste your life on unless you knew you were going to die anyways. If you do just load a game. If you lose all your lives, its game over. If you have lives, it'll bring you back to life, taking you to the checkpoint or the statue you saved at.\n\nCheckpoints arent saves, so dont turn off your game lol. Turn off after you save, which is from a statue.\n\nTurok is a strong swimmer, so he can go underwater for long amount of time. Enough time for you to search the area. Dont sit there too long though, he can die eventually. But it'll be a very long time. You'll know when the air meter pops up, then you need to get out of there.\n\nThe more weapons you collect (without sharing same ammo), the easier the game will be. It starts out rough at start but if you pull it through it gets easier. That I can promise.\n\nRemember to collect ALL the keys, thats the whole point of the game and the way to beat it. You need those keys to unlock levels so you can access them, including the final level.\n\nThis is pretty much all I can give. As for glitches/bugs concerns, all I had was the white flickering screen and the link I sent helped me out with the problem. If you are able to play it, have fun.\n\nI also give this 9/10, despite the glitch/bug but its possible to fix anyways.

Sometimes and later it's a combination of a couple of those.[/b]\n\nThis remaster is probably the best version of the game so far, though I've never played any Turok game prior to this one. I do question why the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_fog]distance fog[/url] is kept here and has to be kept on since I'm pretty sure most people's computers can run this remastered but still age-old game. There's an \"Extended Draw Distance\" option but that only lets you view a little further ahead. I've only seen a couple of enemies actually fire at me from beyond the fog so I don't see much reason to at least not have the option to remove that. At the very least the fog along with the graphics gives it that 90s feel.\n\nA training mode of sorts is available that pretty much teaches you the how-tos of the game.\nThere's a prologue which after that's cleared you'll reach The Hub which is just an interactive level select area. There are 8 pretty long levels to go through with only 4 bosses in those 8 levels and the final boss only a minute after the 3rd's been defeated. \nWithin each level there are 3 keys to collect for unlocking later levels, usually the next one after the current. The 7th level only has 2 and the 8th has none. While they're generally not hard to find, it's possible to actually miss a key as you play so if you exited the area or the level doesn't permit you to backtrack to find the missing key you'll have to exit the level from the end and re-enter from the beginning so you can do a proper search through. There's a \"Keys\" list in the pause menu that allow you to see which specific key you've acquired so you can pretty much determine which ones you've missed. Most of the levels are linear somewhat but they generally have plenty of side routes to sidetrack yourself to as well as secret rooms for useful items or otherwise.\nAs most FPS bosses go their fights aren't very impressive as they're mainly just run & shoot but the idea of fighting one here is a benefit in itself as it's a nice change of pace from the usual levels. Plus, concepts like fighting a cyborg t-rex is always a really cool thing to think about.\nThere's a dynamic map you can view that's really more of an outline of what you've explored. It starts to fill as you go through places you haven't gone to yet but as far as I know you can't zoom out and can only look at parts of the map that's around your location.\n\nExcept for the 8th level's case you can revisit each level again although everything you've picked up and done will stay that way. In a way, ammo and such throughout the game are actually limited and you can't conventionally \"resupply\" yourself but the game's [i]fair[/i] enough to [i]give[/i] enough to get you through, at least on Hard Difficulty and lower. However this can also mean that the fun in using preferred weapons can vanish fast especially when tougher & bullet-spongier enemies start to come in and it doesn't help that the amount of ammo you can carry for every weapon is, to me, really small even if there are loads of weapons to find & carry. Some weapons use the same ammo and two of the weapons have explosive ammo that apparently if you pick them up for said weapon you can't switch to using their regular ammo until you deplete the explosives first; the damage they deal is significantly higher but it just makes for BS reasons to conserve. You've got a knife and you can circle most enemies while slashing them until they die but that just takes too long.\n\nThe game uses a lives system though they're plentiful enough and there are a small number of places in each level you can save your game to. Dying respawns you to the nearest save point or checkpoint and a Game Over obviously means you'd just have to load from a save file.\n\nThere are various health items to pick up as well as overhealing ones and armor that replaces your health completely until the armor itself is gone. The armor here doesn't act like your health at all. The number the armor will represent will indicate how many number of hits it can take from anything before the armor disappears. While you've got armor equipped you can continue to heal and overheal until the maximum you can overheal is reached, which is 250. If somehow you die say from falling to a bottomless pit then obviously the overheal and armor vanish and you respawn with the default max, 100.\n\nPlenty of neat platforming sections in here with many of the platforms almost impossibly smaller than one another. Of course plenty of these sections will have dangerous falls and few with bottomless pits as well as enemies firing at you as you jump from surface to surface. Ironically there's no fall-damage so jumping from any height to a surface below that's designed to be walked on won't hurt unless it's lava or some other hazardous surface. Even those don't do a whole lot of damage unless you're keen on staying there.\n\nIt's a remastered game suited and polished for modern PCs while still retaining its 90s game design charm with even a cheat menu being available. The levels can feel pretty lengthy and can get tedious since you're generally doing the same key searching over and over again only in different environments, but I do think the gameplay itself is solid with how fast & tense it can get. It takes a little around an hour to beat a level so the game can probably be finished in around 8, even while trying to find secrets along the way.", "timestamp_created": 1467454084, "timestamp_updated": 1503593711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23998222": {"recommendationid": "23998222", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967810822", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467743021}, "language": "french", "review": "un classic des ann\u00e9es 90, toujours aussi bon\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467411462, "timestamp_updated": 1467411462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501796", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23996739": {"recommendationid": "23996739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074237143", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467407367}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a ton of fun.

The Lost Land is some kind of weird place, where you'll find endless pits, jungles, ruins, ancient cities, robot fortresses, and all kinds of stuff like that. It's denizens are poachers, soldiers, dinosaurs, giant worms, killer plants, giant bugs, ape like reptile beasts, demons, aliens, natives, hell, all kind of shit is against you in this game. No regenerating lives, in game save points, so you can't abuse quick saves, and limited lives, quite old school. \n\nNow, I played this game back then using the N64 controller, and I was never really a fan of using a joystick in shooters. (Haters gonna hate) \nIn my opinion, the shooting was kinda hard, and the platforming was a nightmare at time. Yes, I blame this game for my fear of heights, because some of those jumps are merciless, and if you miss, you plummet down the abyss. \n\nNow, this port feels amazing. Even if the graphics are kinda dated, because it was an N64 game, they gave it a few improvements, like water reflections, sun rays, and stuff like that. And I still managed to keep a smooth 60 FPS no mater how much shit was moving in my screen. Now, the controls are beautiful. Being able to play this game with a mouse and keyboard made those jumps way easier, and shooting feels way better now. I was able to pull incredibly accurate shots over long distances, something that was quite hard on the N64. \n\nThe soundtrack is amazing, still one of my favorites from that era after all of these years. This game is sort of linear, mostly on the first and last levels, but it still forces you to explore every nook and cranny of the map, looking for keys for the next level or Chronoscepter pieces. \n\nThe only thing I would kinda dislike about this game is that it's rather short.

(Turok 2 being my most played.) *I still own my copies and they still work.\n\nTurok Dinosaur Hunter was, in my mind, one of the BEST FPS games on the N64. Some would argue that 007 Goldeneye and Perfect Dark were better, but Turok was basically the QUAKE/DOOM of the N64. Fast paced and total devastation to your enemies, which is why I hale this better than 007 and Perfect Dark. The quickness and speed to it and the feel of the weapons made it more fun to me than the others.\n\nIt may have only taken me 6 hours to beat this (on Hardcore), but as this game is burned into my memory from playing it so much on the N64, it was easy for me to remember were everything is. I already knew where all the secrets were, all the weapon locations, ultra health, tech armor, keys, etc so I was able to really rush through the game. The game is near identical to the original version, minus the first level. \n\nClose to the beginning of the first level, on your way to get the second key, they had changed an area completely. It had made me stop and think, how much more did they change/add? Well sadly nothing major that really stands out other than that one spot. Some areas were slightly changed here and there, but you honestly would never noticed them unless you were paying real close attention.\n\nThe game consists of traversing 8 levels, of which you run, jump, climb, swim, and shoot everything in sight. Collect 14 weapons to destroy your enemies, and kill the bosses. Exploring the maps to find the level keys, as well as secrets for more weapons/ammo/powerups.\n\nAll the original enemies are still there. All 14 destructive weapons are still there. The music that is engraved into my skull is still there. The same sounds, textures, it's all the original stuff! (Some fan made mods add some HD textures, which is awesome!) Some people may not like it that it looks outdated, but this is NOT a remaster/reboot. This is just a \"upgrade\" to make it work on PCs. No new content was really added into it, and nothing has really changed... But honestly they didn't need to change anything!\n\nThe plus side is since they smoothed out the graphical settings, it can pretty much run on anything. I boot the game up and it already selected my resolution of 1920x1080 60Hz borderless window, and runs at a smooth 60FPS. This has everything from FXAA Antialiasing, Bloom, Light Scatter, Occlusion Queries, a new water texture with new refractions and reflections system, and a freaking FOV setting!\n\nFOV settings has a few choices. 47.5 (which I think was the original N64 FOV, which makes the game unplayable at this day in age, terrible motion sickness,) 74.0 (your standard console FOV,) 90.0, 110.0 (which is what I played at,) and 120.0.\n\nAnother addition to the settings adding a crosshair (which I didn't use), changing the \"weapon bobbing\" settings, being able to change ALL control imputes, as well as using \"Extended Draw Distance\" which can greatly change on how the game plays. With the extended draw distance you can see so much more of the world. Hell I didn't even know certain places had roofs on them! Since of the addition of the extended draw distance, the enemies have also been tweaked. They have been made to work with the extended draw distance so they would shoot you from a distance like you would as well, making it fair. This ALSO causes some enemies to shoot you from parts of the map that you would be going to later. It's not a major problem, but can be slightly annoying. If you really want the \"Retro\" feel on how it played on the N64, turn off the extended draw distance. It gives the game a different feel to it.\n\nAll the little tricks/glitches that I used/abused back on the N64 still work in this game, which is great. The strafe running, the platform shortcuts, the quicker way to get down long flights of stairs. The only sad thing is, back in the original versions, you were able to blow up people off the edges and make them fall into the abyss just because it's funny (to understand what I mean, look at the last screenshot on the store page)... Well they took that out.  Now when you try to fling an enemy off into the abyss, there is like an invisible wall that stops them and keeps them on the platform. It's not a major problem, just sad that I could not do that anymore.\n\nFrom the little problems, it doesn't affect the game. It's still the great game that I grew up playing, and was nice to run down memory lane while murdering everything in sight. This game still a blast to play, and I will always recommend this to everyone to give it a try!\n\nEDIT: There has been a new update that added a Level Editor and Steam Workshop support! Like, WHAT?!?! That is awesome as F*CK!\n\nI've attempted my own hand at the editor, but it seems to be broken for me. Devs are still working on improving and adding more features to it in the future.\n\nPros:\n- Same great game that I grew up on\n- Fast paced Gunplay\n- Smoothed out Graphics\n- Same great soundtrack\n- Old cheat codes still work (disable achievements)\n- Improved Options/Controls fit for PC gamers\n- Runs at a smooth 60FPS\n- Map Editor & Steam Workshop\n- Achievements (only 8)\n\nCons:\n- Some may not like the old look\n- Some minor sound problems\n- No Steam Cards\n- A little expensive\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nAs a message to the Devs Nightdive Studios, if they happen to read this review, THANK YOU SO MUCH for re-releasing this game, and giving it a ton of love and support!", "timestamp_created": 1466898997, "timestamp_updated": 1511402218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770498", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23809076": {"recommendationid": "23809076", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986469879", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489199664}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorate N664 games remastered for PC.

It was a first person shooter based on the comic book of the same name. Set in a world with roaming dinosaurs, creatures, and evil tribesmen. Your character, Turok, is tasked with the simple job of stopping the world falling into the hands of evil. Evil that have, in their power, a weapon that\u2019s as ancient as themselves. Pretty vague blurb eh?\n\nDespite that Turok was a ground-breaking game, taking the player from corridor shooters such as, DOOM, and throwing them into a vastly more open world. It set a standard which made the series a household name, and changed the way level design worked for years to come.\n\nIn 2015, Night Dive Studios released a remaster. Unlike what normally comes to mind when you think of remasters, Night Dive\u2019s work was more of a service, than bodywork. There was no super high rez textures, anti-alias tinkering, or insertion of HDR  sun-rays peering through tree tops. Oh no, this keeps its roots pure, it celebrates the graphical style and standards that the original carried back in the 90\u2019s and, it even kept the controls as simple as the original.\n\nIt looks like the exact same game, but with a resolution, and smoothing fix, it feels like I\u2019m back in my living room on my N64 as a child. Element which would need tweaking as to accommodate the changes in screen resolutions have clearly been prioritised;the HUD looks smoother, sharper than it used too; the overall game brightness is tweaked, brighter, with more vivid colours than the game could manage on it\u2019s initial outing; the frame rate is smoothed, balanced throughout. All this combined with the slightly tweaked textures also come together to keep the game fast, flowing, and as easy to pick up and play as before. which helps with the game\u2019s fast paced shoot outs, and the textures look a touch more detailed giving the world a little more character.\n\nRead the rest: http://bigbossbattle.com/review-turok-dinosaur-hunter-2015/", "timestamp_created": 1465656377, "timestamp_updated": 1465656377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23496014": {"recommendationid": "23496014", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967848367", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463367051}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Back to the basics and it feels so good. [/h1]\n\nAs refreshing and soothing as the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIIt7q_NIbs]Water theme[/url], Turok encapsulates the FPS genre as it was in 1997. Like the long lost and older cousin of [i]Unreal[/i], Turok contains a semblance of an arena shooter but with a focus on adventure. There's no facade or pretense in this game. You are the Turok. You hunt dinosaurs but you also fight aliens, demons, cyborgs and robots, and pesky mercenaries. If that doesn't sound awesome I don't know what is.\n\nAnd if you really care to know what else is going on you can figure it out as you play because it's real simple: [spoiler] Your mission is to stop a guy from using the Lost Land as a base of operations for a future conquest. [/spoiler] Does that sound like a complicated plot? Personally, that sounds like all the plot you need. Plus, the settings speak for themselves. Some are wide and outdoor. Some are haunting and morose. And some are sinister and cold like a machine fortress. Armed with a knife and bow & arrow, you set out and wind up using a quadruple-fire rocket launcher and the legendary chronoscepter. Wait, what's the chronoscepter? Let's view the manual:\n\n[i]\"The Chronoscepter is capable of creating micro-tears in the fabric of space-time, thus disrupting matter at a focus point.\"[/i]\n\nWait a minute, you get to shoot a micro-tear in the fabric of space-time against your opposition? How many other games start you off with simple weapons and by the end you're using scifi weapons and weapons that destroy time and space itself? Don't answer that because all you really need is the knife. Knife > Chronoscepter. The enemies don't stand a chance.\n\nOverall, if you want to go back to a time where games were games, adventure and action was the focus, and it's you versus a wide variety of enemies that make you question reality itself; then the land where time has no meaning awaits. Become the Son of Stone. Take up the mantle of Turok.

Gunplay is reminiscent of bullet hell arcade shooters in that your main focus is dodging enemies and landing shots. Weapons work very simply with no reloading required. On top of shooting out the baddies, you also need to explore and solve puzzles to advance. Cover mechanics were lauded as a great advancement in shooters, and they are, but revisiting this gem from a couple of decades ago reminded me how much fun this simpler style of shooter is as well. It's clearly an older game, but it's just so damn FUN that I don't that a weakness.\n\nAs for the port, it's wonderful. I still have the N64 cartridge so I could do a direct comparison. The feel of the game is preserved flawlessly, plus modern enhancements to fix some shortcomings of the now practically ancient tech the game was made for. The pacing, movement, etc. all feel exactly the same as the original game. What they have done, however, is allow you to fully customize the controls. It works great with kb+m or a controller (I used an XBOX One controller and the default controls worked just fine, but you can reassign the buttons as you please). \n\nAs far as the graphics...well, it's obviously a ~20 year old game, but it's from that period where games were charmingly ugly, and most importantly it doesn't interfere with the gameplay. There are also some nice modern enhancements here. You can choose to enable modern effects like bloom, shadows, sunshafts, etc. You can also enable an increased draw distance. This could almost be considered cheating given that levels were designed with the N64 fog in mind, but it's a welcome feature to keep you from feeling claustophobic if you're understandably not accustomed to the limitations of old gaming hardware.\n\nThe one place I would fault this game is the price. $20 is pretty steep for a remake of a game released before many current Steam users could even read.

I had heard of Turok before, but I never batted an eye until I saw that it was released on Steam. I took the plunge and bought it, and I'm so glad I did.\n\n[h1]How well does the [b]game play[/b]?[/h1]\nThe gameplay in Turok is sort of what you'd expect from a mid-to-late 90s, no-nonsense first person shooter. Turok's gunplay is fast-paced and feels fairly fluid, however Turok isn't all about gunplay. Turok will put you at platforming segments or require you to explore in order to find certain keys. If heights aren't your thing then Turok may or may not be a game you want to play, especially in one of the later levels, and while Turok may not be as fast paced as Quake, it's definitely a game that will require you to be aware at all times.\n\nYou may die a few times in Turok, or even more than a few times. In other games, it'd be like \"Oh no I forgot to save/quicksave and now I have to go back ages!\" or \"Oh no, it saved automatically at this boss and I have little to no HP left!\" However, in Turok, there are checkpoints in the levels (and savepoints, don't forget those!) but when you die, you will respawn at that checkpoint with all of your health, but that's dependent on whether you have [b]extra lives[/b] or not.\n\n[h1]What about the [b]graphics[/b]?[/h1]\nYou see, this is where the game sort of falls short, because even with the enhancements made to the visuals, it still doesn't hold up as well. However, it was mentioned that they improved the water visuals, adding reflections and refraction, and it blends in with the old-school visuals that the game provides. The draw distance is a minor interference but in Turok's case it can add to the tension with the platforming sections.\n\n[h1]And opinions on the [b]sound design[/b]?[/h1]\nMeh, it's something that could have been done better. I hate having to hear obnoxiously loud grunting while my character climbs up vines and transitions between caves and the outside aren't too great either, however other than that the sound design for Turok isn't too bad and it's passable.\n\n[h1]Your [b]overall[/b] opinion on Turok?[/h1]\nIf you're a fan of fast paced, no nonsense first person shooters such as Quake, then Turok is definitely for you. This game is as old-school as old-school gets. It's a game that all first person shooter fanatics should play at least once. While the visuals don't hold up, the gameplay itself is the real deal. Though for a game as old as Turok, I would advise waiting for the price to lower. \u00a314.99/$19.99 is quite a lot to pay for a game from 1997, but if you're new to the franchise it may seem reasonable.

I remember that it was considered a classic adventure game in first person and a technological breakthrough. Turok has been remastered nearly 20 years later. While the remastered version has graphically improved, it still is not up to today\u2019s graphics standards.\n\nThe basic plot of the game is clich\u00e9 and ordinary. The game stars a Native American who is up against an extraterrestrial villain named the Campaigner, who steals the Chronoscepter and ends up being scattered throughout the 8 levels. Turok must fight against dinosaurs and ancient people throughout the various levels which consists of temples and villages, but later levels look like sci-fi sectors.\n\nIn the beginning Turok may look like an FPS game, but it is truly a first person adventure game. It requires plenty of platform jumping in order to navigate each level. If you\u2019re looking for the many secrets in the game you will have to do even more jumping such as jumping long gaps and many pillars. The gameplay and the environments feel old school and can provide nostalgia to those who play the 1997 version of the game.\n\nThe enemies feel old school and consist of velociraptors and mercenaries. The violence in this game is palpable, as you can see blood squirting out of the mercenaries as they die at your hands using the arsenal of shotguns, assault rifle, minigun, and rocket launcher. The enemy A.I. is good, but not great. Sometimes a mercenary will circle around you to hit you, but at other times it won\u2019t. \n\nOther old school elements include the health pickups and ammo scattered across each level. There are keys to pick up in order to access subsequent levels. This means you can return to previous levels to find keys that you may have missed. The save stations are far between each other throughout each level. This means you will have to dedicate some time to the game before finally reaching a save point. There is no quick save feature to help you. Yes, there are checkpoints but they are only good if you die. Upon dying you will be returned to the last checkpoint you crossed. There is the old number of lives system showing how many lives Turok has left. This lives system feels quite archaic.\n\nWhile this game is not up to today\u2019s graphics standards, I do give Night Dive Studios credit for putting forth the decent effort for improving Turok\u2019s graphics. The frame rate has occasional stuttering that can be a little bothersome at times. My FPS instantly decrease from 60 to 35, then increase to 47 and back to 60. It is a minor annoyance, but I think this problem could have been addressed in a patch.\n\nI think Turok is worth playing again for those who played this game back in the late 1990s. The game is technically smoothed out and optimized for modern hardware. I think Night Dive Studios is on the right track when it comes to making remastered versions of games. At 20 bucks or on a future sale Turok would be a decent game to buy if you love first person platform jumping and exploration.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1463940536, "timestamp_updated": 1463940536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494318", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23131928": {"recommendationid": "23131928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003683589", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452562086}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't tell you how many n64 controllers i broke playing this and goldeneye back in the day due to the amazing single stick aiming.

Seeing this gem back on modern systems with improved handling and support for modern screen resolution is great. The game still plays like a charm and has an odd but lovely personality to it. The game world seems to be one giant drug trip, which is quite entertaining to experience.

Beyond this, we don't get much story, the game instead relies on its gameplay.\n\nTurok plays a lot like Quake or Unreal tournament, except the levels have a lot more verticality. Levels are very long and require a lot of platforming, usually not requiring much precision-jumping. You get a large arsenal of weapons including some interesting ones like the bow which shoots explosive blue arrows. You'll also get your typical shotguns and machine guns, which are good as well. You'll face off against dinosaurs, cyborgs, and alien-like monsters, all of which are fun to fight.\n\nOne of the main differences between Turok and other FPS games is that Turoks levels require that you find a certain number of keycards in order to unlock more levels. The problem with this is that the keys are very well hidden and often frustrating to find when you have to backtrack to old areas and face the same enemies again who respawn after a few minutes.\n\nBesides this one complaint, I don't have anything else bad to say about Turok, other than the game is quite dated graphically, so that might turn off some players. The game is fast, fun, and surprisingly holds up well and stands toe to toe with Quake in my opinion.\n\nPick Turok up on sale and you're sure to have a good time.\n", "timestamp_created": 1462033817, "timestamp_updated": 1514610918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22724953": {"recommendationid": "22724953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109132619", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500172991}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Esse foi o primeiro jogo do Nintendo 64 que joguei...

This is not to be confused with a reimagining or a remake; Night Dive Studios' mission was to clean up, repackage, and preserve the original game, and in this modest but noble goal they have succeeded.  [i]Turok Remastered[/i] is a faithful reproduction of the retro classic, which includes all of the charming glitches from the original but none of the technical flaws.  The game is optimized for modern platforms and has never looked better on an HD display.  Minor graphical touch-ups have been added, although they are very subtle.  All in all, this is now the definitive version of the game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThere are three major elements to [i]Turok's[/i] gameplay: combat, platforming, and exploration.\n\nCombat moves at a fast clip, as most areas of the game feature at least one respawn wave of enemies who will flank you if you backpedal from the enemies which lie ahead of you.  The enemy respawns are sometimes quick and occasionally relentless, but it never feels unfair since there are clear audio/visual cues associated with the spawn-in.  Adding to the frenetic pace is a very quick character movement speed.  Enemies can close distance in seconds and the player-character is equally agile and responsive.\n\nThe gunplay itself focuses on the player amassing an arsenal of weapons (found through exploration) and then frequently switching through the inventory wheel to pick the right tool for the job.  Unlike many modern First Person Shooters, [i]Turok[/i] places no limit on the number of weapons that can be in the player's possession at any given time.  Additionally, unlike many of its contemporaries, [i]Turok[/i] does not reset the player's inventory after each mission.  As a result, there's a continuous sense of character progression / growing strength.  Yet, the game also manages to gradually become more challenging as spongier, heavier-hitting enemies are introduced later in the game.  Gunplay in [i]Turok[/i] is just as much about being accurate as it is about managing and conserving ammo; if you use too many rockets on the middle-tier enemies, you won't have them when you really need them to deal with the bigger baddies.\n\nPlatforming in [i]Turok[/i] can be a particularly vexing mechanic, especially for newcomers.  If you haven't done a lot of platforming from a first-person perspective, get ready to learn the hard way.  Missing a jump usually means instant-death, and there is a whole lot of unskippable jumping in this game.  Not even cheat codes can help you get past these segments, so it's a skill you must be committed to mastering if you plan to play the game to completion.\n\nExploration is a large part of the game, and it's one of the most-rewarding.  [i]Turok's[/i] level design is smarter than meets the eye, often employing subtle environmental clues to lead the player in unexpected directions.  Some levels are more linear than others, but all of the game's eight major regions are full of secret areas off the beaten path.  Diligent exploration is rewarded with upgraded-ammo, extra life tokens, keys to open new levels, and early access to more-powerful weapons.  The trickiest and most-rewarding collectables of all are the hidden pieces of the game's ultimate weapon: The Chronosceptor.  It should also be noted that, while some of the mandatory pickups (namely: level keys) are easy to miss, backtracking hardly takes any time thanks to the extremely fast player movement speed.\n\n[h1]Aesthetics[/h1]\n[i]Turok[/i] was originally released towards the beginning of the N64's lifecycle when 3D gaming was still relatively new to the masses.  [i]Turok[/i] was one of the better-looking 3D games of its time, but to virgin eyes I imagine that it must look really rough around its sharp, polygonal edges.  Luckily, Night Dive Studios has cleaned up some of the original game's glaring technical flaws.  Most apparent among them are the oppressive fog and draw distance.  If you remember the N64 game fondly then you'll definitely appreciate how much easier it is to see where you're going in the remastered version.  No longer does the fog hide enemies standing five feet in front of your face.  However, Night Dive has tastefully decided not to eliminate the fog completely, preserving the some of the mysterious, haunting aesthetic of the original without compromising playability.  \n\nTrue to the original, the music is serviceable enough but doesn't stand out.  It's thematically appropriate but not very interesting.  There's a lot of minimalist, primitive-sounding percussion, but the music loops too frequently and conspicuously to effectively blend into a subtle, immersive, atmospheric texture.  The sound effects are actually rather humorous at times, which breaks the mood a little but is generally joyful.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nThis is a solid game.  And the remaster-- price not considered in this review-- doesn't come across as a simple cash-grab, in my opinion.  True, very little has been added to the game.  But Night Dive Studios has made too many considerate, tasteful decisions for me to be cynical about it.  [i]Turok Remastered[/i] is a technically flawless, unadulterated, minimally upgraded port of one of the great N64 shooters, and I recommend it to anyone who still occasionally revisits and enjoys playing the classics.", "timestamp_created": 1461036050, "timestamp_updated": 1461066566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617539", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22463683": {"recommendationid": "22463683", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962074167", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492055732}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1460844585, "timestamp_updated": 1460844585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22461811": {"recommendationid": "22461811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250677978", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450498291}, "language": "english", "review": "much good game killing dinos with grendade launcher when are you going to port turok 2\n", "timestamp_created": 1460838769, "timestamp_updated": 1460838769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22423304": {"recommendationid": "22423304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067355381", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460704936}, "language": "english", "review": "what the f@ck. the game is easy mode from levels 1-6 but at 7 to the end that sh!t got mad hard. awesome game.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1460704997, "timestamp_updated": 1460704997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22419095": {"recommendationid": "22419095", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991096666", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472946292}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant.

If you like older, Doom style games, you'll most likely enjoy Turok.\n\nThe story of Turok is very simple. You are Turok, and you hunt dinosaurs. The game starts you off right into the action with very little context on what is actually going on. This could annoy some people, but it doesn't pull away from the immersion at all. Although this lack of story can make the latter half of the game make little to no sense storywise.\n\nTurok has a very fast movement speed which is a nice change from the sluggish sharpshooters from today. This makes the game playable at any pace you would like, whether you want to speed through or explore the levels.\n\nWhen it comes to the levels themselves, many of them are fairly forgettable in design, but some have a genuinly interesting theme and layout. Either way, they are all fun to explore, with tons of secrets in every level.\n\nThe combat is responsive, and very satisfying with a large variety of weapons to find and use. As an added bonus, none of the weapons feel redundant or outshined by others (with the exception of a few), which allows a lot more options when you're tackling either a boss, a particularly beefy mob, or your average joe of an enemy. Turok also does a good job when it comes to ammunition drops, which seems like a weird thing to think about, but it manages to sit on a fine line, where i needed to be mindful of my ammo, but at the same time I didn't feel the need to be overly conservative with the weapons that I used.\n\nWhile you will be seeing some of the same mobs a lot, there is a nice variety of enemies that keeps the combat from getting too stale and repetative, especially in the last few levels.\n\nOne problem I had with the game however, was that I wasn't %100 certain on what I was actually supposed to be doing. The game does a pretty poor job of telling you what you need to do in the beginning, and you can easily get lost on the first level. If you can get past this however, then it should be easy to figure out what you need to be doing for the rest of the game.\n\nIf you have played a lot of games like doom, then you will not be disappointed with Turok. If you are new to this style of gameplay, then Turok is an excellent introduction to other games like it. While Turok is not necessarily an innovative game, it is a fun one that does what it does well and is definatly worth the $20.", "timestamp_created": 1456068868, "timestamp_updated": 1456068925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21357830": {"recommendationid": "21357830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055623112", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507990577}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game, much rambo, very guns. \n\nIf you're someone who is looking for a game to get your mind off of something, or relieve stress, this is it.\n\nOne of my favorite games on the 64 and i can finally enjoy it on my favorite Platform. <3", "timestamp_created": 1456038661, "timestamp_updated": 1456038661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21331967": {"recommendationid": "21331967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261035290", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455941048}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing.

At the beginning, you're given one goal. That goal is to make it to the hub. The next thing you know, it becomes a collectathon. The part that allows you to figure out the story is what reminds me of what some game devs are going for these days. I would say that this is a good example of what they go for. There may have been a story behind this game at one point when it was still new. Mostly, Acclaim and Iguana Entertainment have made it more gameplay and goal heavy. Though the controls may be more simple, but overall, there are things that are enjoyable about it. Like for example, when I play through it, I got a slight sense of what the story was behind it. That was what made the first game so great. I notice that Iguana Entertainment has attempted to put together a story for the later series like Turok Evolution, as well as Vexx which was a platformer I personally enjoyed and wish Nightdive would bring that out on the Market. Their method of storytelling was... not perfect. However, they did great on putting in an assortment of other monsters than just dinosaurs, giant bugs and soldiers which I commend them for that.

It was one of the games that attracted us to Nintendo's quirky, but unique new system. While some preferred Goldeneye or Doom 64, Turok was still a strong competitor in the FPS genre and spawned a few successful sequels until plummeting into mediocrity. The controls took time to get used to, but the gameplay was fast paced and bloody, and it even managed to please longtime fans of the comic book.\n\nNight Dive's re-release is like plugging in a 20 year old system again. Your memories begin flooding back and the first few minutes are glorious, but then the nostalgia glasses wear off and you realize just how far games have come. Turok is not a bad game in any way, it's just very, very dated. I love classic FPS games. Doom 2 and Blood still get playtime for me after all these years. Turok just has nothing that keeps it fresh after almost two decades.\n\nI have no problem with the graphics, and applaud Night Dive for leaving the original design untouched. They even kept old glitches intact on purpose and, in a recent update, implemented the original N64 sound effects. Visuals and sound are still great. It's the gameplay that hurts. While playing on a mouse and keyboard is superior to the goofy N64 controller, and Turok moves pretty smoothly, some of the platforming in the game is near impossible. Some of the jumps you are asked to perform happen only by miracle, and sometimes just looking at a platform the wrong way can cause you to fall through it. The weapons are fun, but some don't seem to do anything or cause any varying degrees of damage, and just feel like they were put there to look cool. If you are lucky enough to assemble the Chronoscepter, good luck getting a hit in with it.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the levels are TOO DAMN LONG. Level 8 wins the award for the longest, most excruciating level in video game history. It's neat that the levels are so open and there are multiple paths, but good god the last level takes almost two hours to complete! It begins to feel tedious after a while and you stop enjoying the game and just wish for the level to be over. Also, enemies respawn, making the levels EVEN LONGER when you have to clear the same corridors multiple times.\n\nTurok is not a terrible game. If you have played it before and it's cheap, go ahead and relive some memories. Just be ready to cringe. It's very hard to recommend Turok to those who have never played it because it is so dated, but if you enjoy games of old and want a field trip back to when FPS games were still in their infancy, it's worth a look.", "timestamp_created": 1455262753, "timestamp_updated": 1455262924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21141431": {"recommendationid": "21141431", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994408870", "num_games_owned": 4013, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493072082}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Review Written on Thursday, February 11th, 2016[/b] \n\n[h1]Review[/h1] \n\nI wish all classic games were treated this way. The common two mistakes I see is complete laziness where DOSBox\\ScummVM is used and nothing more or a game gets the Fable Anniversary treatment with new and improved graphics, but plays like crap. I personally only care about reliving the original Turok experience with all the bells and whistles this version offers (read the About This Game and Update History to learn more). To any Turok fan criticizing the price because the game was released in 1997, I invite you to play both (N64+PC Classic) then try this version out because I promise you you'll never consider going back. For any non-Turok fans I recommend buying this game at $10.00 USD. There's really not much else for me to elaborate on other than saying checkout the Update History for this game because it's clear the developers really do love Turok.\n\nEdit: A Level Editor + Workshop Support was just incorporated and I wouldn't be shocked if Multiplayer is one day added since Turok 2 is being built from scratch (as this version of Turok was) on the same custom engine.\n\n[h1]Rating:[/h1] \n\n9.7/10 \n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1] \n[olist] \n[*]No DOSBox\\ScummVM nonsense.\n[*]I got to relive the original Turok experience with tons of new game settings.\n[*]A level editor is on the way.\n[*]Mod Support\n[*]The game has a fog reduction setting.

He is the inheritor of a familial mantle that both compels and empowers him to -- well, you know what. None of that is actually important right now, because it's hardly mentioned in the game. And that's for the better, really. The comic books that inspired the game were absolutely all over the place in terms of tone and setting, as seems to be the standard for the medium.\n\nSuffice it to say, you play the role of an awesome Native American warrior who handles ultra high-tech future weapons just as well as he does the bows and knives of his heritage. You travel the Lost Land - a realm parallel to our own in which time has no conventional meaning, and creatures and technologies from countless other universes coexist - in a quest to assemble a forbidden superweapon and use it to take down the evil Campaigner. The Campaigner is like a cybernetic Genghis Khan, only worse, and he's raised a bloodthirsty army to wreak havoc upon the Lost Land and beyond.\n\nTurok was a technological marvel in its time. It's got wide-open spaces like Unreal and it sports the fast-and-furious run-and-gun of Quake, and it blends the best of those two games together. The result remains unique still today because nothing else out there plays quite like Turok does. It's not your typical shooter. Turok requires an adventurer's touch, as the game is just as much about exploring massive, mysterious hand-built environments as it is shooting velociraptors in the face with explosive arrows.\n\nTherein lies the problem most modern gamers are likely to encounter playing this game. Turok is linear to a point, but the action takes place in fairly large, often vertical, outdoor areas, and it's easy to get lost if you don't pay attention. The game doesn't lead you around with big glowing waypoints, either, and uncovering the sprawling environs' many secrets is crucial to getting through the game without cheating. The game utilizes an atypical hub system that links all its levels together. Teleporters to the various lands are opened using keys Turok must uncover along the way. You'll need to find the keys that are scattered throughout the levels in order to proceed through the game.\n\nIf you lack the patience to explore - and you like your games on a leash - then you should know up front that Turok is probably not for you. But if you're anything like me, you're sick of modern shooters and their over-reliance on scripted set-pieces. I find Turok's open-ended, \"archaic\" approach to be a breath of fresh air so many years after playing it last. Exploring the world and finding a well-hidden secret brings a real, palpable sense of accomplishment, the kind of breath-stealing \"eureka!\" moment that very few recent titles manage to evoke even once.\n\nThe various levels are varied and interesting, and are underscored with an abundance of ambient sound effects and a truly bizarre drums-and-synths soundtrack that stands out on its own and is instantly recognizable. Though it began life as an early N64 game, Turok has atmosphere in spades. Its enemy design can only be described as eclectic. Velociraptors with cybernetic gun arms are awesome. Insectoid aliens with plasma rifles? Those are great, too. Sometimes, their armor malfunctions when you kill them, and they struggle against their inevitable explosive demise. Even better. Killer plants, overgrown bugs, armor-clad mercenaries with pulse rifles and tank-top wearing grunts with machetes - your opponents are always varied and never boring.\n\nThe entire experience has a hand-crafted feel, and everything is in its proper place. Though a shooter at heart, the feeling of adventuring in a bizarre otherworld is prevalent throughout, and the architecture occasionally reminds me of adventure games like Myst. Perhaps the rooftop village just reminds me of the Channelwood Age or something.\n\nIt's not all exploration, though. The action is fast and fluid with mouse and keyboard controls, and is super-responsive. It's a blast to blast away while staying on the move. Turok plodded a bit with the flaky N64 controller, but now the game is blazing-fast like Quake on the PC and somehow the game manages to handle the player's faster input very well. Especially if you bump things up to Hard - the setting has obviously been tweaked to be *quite* difficult in order to compensate for the player's better aim. Things get very tough, very fast on Hard, though easy and normal are just as I remembered them back in the day.\n\nThere's a respectable arsenal of exotic weaponry, which Turok literally stores in his magical Bag of Holding. No weapon swapping here. When I was a kid, my circle of friends derived much amusement from the over-the-top excess of some of the later weapons, what with their elaborate folding/unfolding deployment animations and sound effects. Whenever we thought of crazy, overblown weapons or machines, we thought of Turok and laughed. One of those weapons is essentially a portable nuke, and really has to be seen to be believed. Oh, boy, did that ever rock our worlds back then. Watching it blow over trees was exquisite. And of course there's a minigun, which you can unleash into the brush to reenact everyone's favorite scene in the Predator movie. And the ridiculousness of the more advanced weaponry actually serves to make the conventional all the more compelling somehow. Running around with an AK47 and blasting human commandos in the face keeps things feeling real, know what I'm sayin'?\n\nThis is a source port of the PC original by Samual Villareal. If you're a Doomer like me, the name will be familiar. If you're not, suffice it to say that the man is well-appreciated for his work on other source ports, and his involvement in the Doom community. Turok runs wonderfully well on modern PCs, and features some nice, subtle visual improvements that fit in perfectly with the style of the graphics. No ridiculous bloom or lens flares or anything like that - what's here is good enough to highlight that Turok never really looked that bad to begin with. Honestly, I'm surprised just how well it holds up, though the reflective water and atmospheric lighting really does add to the atmosphere. In high resolutions with anti-aliasing, it's a treat to look at. With about 500% of the colors present in Battlefield 4, my eyes almost couldn't handle all the sensory information.\n\nSo is it worth your time and money? Yes, absolutely. There's plenty to see and shoot in Turok's eye-catching, lovingly hand-crafted world, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. And yes, I bought this game years after completing the original multiple times. It stuck with me, certainly. I'm beyond excited for Night Dive's rerelease of Turok 2. As much as I love the original, the sequel is even better. They're noticeably different, though, in terms of style and execution.

A lot of people think that 20$ (usually 15$ when it goes on sale) is real overkill. While I semi-agree I also played turok on the N64 and really enjoyed the game. Trying to find the cartrige online usually results in expensive prices do to a recent influx of retro collectors and gamers. I find the price to be moderate.\n\nAs a player of Turok 2, I cannot wait to see what the devs can do with that glitchy mess of a game.", "timestamp_created": 1455019334, "timestamp_updated": 1455019334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21065255": {"recommendationid": "21065255", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963270421", "num_games_owned": 2541, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454982220}, "language": "english", "review": "As good as I remembered but better!", "timestamp_created": 1454978702, "timestamp_updated": 1454978702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21044951": {"recommendationid": "21044951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038256828", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452329154}, "language": "english", "review": "As a child, this game scared me to tears, but as an adult I could never remember why.\nPlaying the game again in high definition reminded me why.\nThis isn't an FPS, it's a high diving platformer with guns, and a Acrophobic's worst nightmare.\nStay far away if you fear heights, as a majority of the game involves leaps of faith into foggy chasms that may or may not have solid ground at the bottom.\n\nBesides that, it's a very fun old school shooter.", "timestamp_created": 1454910261, "timestamp_updated": 1454910261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21042440": {"recommendationid": "21042440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134191853", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503185509}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely Fantastic Port!\nMouse controls, high frame rate and improved textures makes this easily a top tier FPS that most people missed out on during its N64 reign.

Reading about the Remake and finding Turok on Steam 20 later is just awesome. I guess there are a lot of people who wrote already glorifying notes, hence I'll pinpoint out the differences. \n\n1996 vs. 2016:\n\nbetter graphics: I'm sure there is an overview concerning the graphical enhancements (water, AAFX, fog, etc). The developers didn't enhance the graphics to much. Hence Turok kept its look and feel. For example the fog \u2013 originally designed to save comping-power \u2013 wasn't removed. But the player is provided with the option to reduce. Hence he still can enjoy the original games atmosphere.\n\nmore accurate controls: the PC Version in 1996 felt like a N64 port. Setting up the controls took some time and usually ended up in a half baked configuration \u2013 Uhm... jeah I cyn play with this, but I could be better. The remake controls are WASD-Style and work precicely.\n\naiming: opposing to the 1996 version the Player now can turn the crosshair on :)\n\nthe \u201cmortal wound\u201d: in the current version it drops very rarely, but this doesn't matter because this item was originally designed to increase the auto-aim-accuracy. \n\nViolence and blood-settings: opposing to the games PC Version in 1996 the current Version allows the player to chose red, green or \u201cno blood\u201d. Especially the German Players might be happy to notice, since the German Version was cut by removing Skins and blood effects to match the youth protection requirements.\n\n\nI hope that Turok 2 will be remade soon and that the Developers port the bugfix concerning the Tranquilizer Gun.", "timestamp_created": 1454691854, "timestamp_updated": 1454691854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20972652": {"recommendationid": "20972652", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969957762", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457712902}, "language": "german", "review": "Auch wenn es 20$ kostet (und nat\u00fcrlich netter weise 1:1 in \u20ac umgerechnet wurde) wars mir wert meinen allerersten First-Person-Shooter wieder zu kaufen (und mit zeitgem\u00e4\u00dfer Aufl\u00f6sung zu zocken) :)  Turok rult immer noch!", "timestamp_created": 1454689734, "timestamp_updated": 1454689734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20968100": {"recommendationid": "20968100", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993423351", "num_games_owned": 584, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 1211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511265492}, "language": "russian", "review": "Yes, at last!!!

wird sicher der Begriff\"Remaster\"\u00fcberall gezeigt.Aber es freut schon ein wenig,dass alte aber noch immer gute Titel neu erscheinen und die \u00e4lteren Spieler(auch j\u00fcngere)durchaus in Erinnerungen abtauchen d\u00fcrfen.Zun\u00e4chst wird man sicher \u00fcber die Grafik sehr verwundert die Augen reiben und sich fragen,warum man das damals so als Grafikbombe empfunden hat.Das liegt einfach nat\u00fcrlich daran,dass Turok zur damaligen Zeit eine kleine Revolution darstellte und die relativ neue Konsole\"N64\"medial einen gro\u00dfen Hype bescherte und infolgedessen f\u00fcr mehrere Nachfolger sorgte.Die Grafik war seiner Zeit gegen\u00fcber der ersten Playstation 1 schon etwas weiter und filterte Texturen mit Weichzeichnern und ohne Verzerrungen.Das sorgte f\u00fcr damalige Verh\u00e4ltnisse,f\u00fcr ein ruhigeres Bild und insgesamt sch\u00f6nere Optik.Nat\u00fcrlich kann die Grafik trotz der wenigen Neuerungen kaum noch heutzutage jemanden hinterm Ofen hervorlocken.Aber es ist das Leveldesign,was eine atmosph\u00e4rische und dichte Spielweise erm\u00f6glicht.Viele der Geb\u00e4ude und Texturen wiederholen sich sicher sehr oft,aber sp\u00e4ter f\u00e4llt das aufgrund der immer gr\u00f6\u00dfer werdenden Levels aber nicht mehr ins Gewicht.Die Levels werden n\u00e4mlich stetig gr\u00f6\u00dfer und sehr viel komplexer,was das Erkunden und suchen schwerer macht.Im Gegensatz zum original Spiel,wurde die Nebelwand deutlich reduziert und erm\u00f6glicht mehr Weitsicht in den Arealen.Fr\u00fcher wurde dieser Trick genutzt,um Rechenleistung der nachzuladenen Objekte und Details zu kaschieren.Heute allerdings nicht mehr n\u00f6tig.Im Remaster dient es h\u00f6chstens ein wenig der Atmosph\u00e4re und wohl auch um nicht alles gleich sichbar erkennbar zu machen.Aber st\u00f6ren tut es mich pers\u00f6nlich \u00fcberhaupt nicht.Was die technische Seite insgesamt angeht,so wurde eigentlich nur Aufl\u00f6sung,Widescreen und 60 fps integriert.\n\nAber auch das ist ok und schm\u00e4lert den Fun des Titels keineswegs.Meine Hoffnung setze ich allerdings trotzdem noch in die Modderszene.Da eben diese mittlerweile in fast allen Spielen w\u00fctet und sie sehr oft mehr als aufwertet,w\u00fcrde das einem Turok sicher auch gut tun.Stelle mir grad vor,wie die Vegetation erh\u00f6ht wird und die Texturen noch eine Frischzellenkur verpasst bek\u00e4men.Als Krone dann noch eine Polygonerh\u00f6hung der Gegner,Saurier und Mutationen und das w\u00fcrde sicher dann nochmal den Wiederspielwert deutlich erh\u00f6hen.\n\nAlso ich kann Turok trotz seines Alters empfehlen,da es einfach nur Fun macht und als unkomplizierter Shooter sehr gut funktionert.Der Nachfolger\"Seeds of Evil\"ist ja ebenfalls in der Mache.",

Seeds Of Evil for maybe the first couple of levels and watching the rest as my father played on the Nintendo 64. I've secretly loved this series from the sidelines for awhile now but now have a new revamped nostaglia to give this series a try. \n\nI hope that Night Dive Studios continues in their pursuits of revitalizing this wonderful series. Like some of my fellow steam users, I have the option of playing this on the Nintendo 64 for about (\"$12.00\") on eBay +shipping (\"$13.00\") or simply playing the existing copy of Seeds of Evil that I currently own and the thought had crossed my mind and  I assume yours as well. Although, I much prefer my computer over most consoles these days. For that extra $13.00. I want to believe it's worth more to support Night Dive Studios. \n\nWhat you are paying for is another copy of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter with enhanced graphics and gameplay mechanics. What your purchase means though. It is a contribution, that will help Night Dive Studio's continue to remaster the turok series possibly. Depending, upon the sales of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Turok: Seeds Of Evil. With wishful thinking may lead to another project in which there is a new turok experience. Say 2018. Feeling nostalgic, this game is for you.\n\n A young friend of mine, I was talking to him the other day about how great this game was and still is after 18 years.. What's Turok. So I barried him out backyard with my trusty shovel, no seriously this is a great opportunity to both preserve and showcase to the newer generations. Preservation of an \"Old but not obselete\" piece of gaming history. - Terminator Genisys\n\nGameplay Final Review: Normal Mode\n\n   A fun enjoyable experience to remember, old school mechanics, no reloading firearms, ammunition and health a plenty, remember to save often at the hub and or during levels as they are pretty lengthy, lots of high jumps off of ledges and walking along cliffsides, simple yet sometimes surprisingly clever puzzles, step-on-that, step-on-this, collect that and secret areas. Swimming was an interesting mechanic that I thoroughly enjoyed. Loved shooting just about everything, tribesmen, the variety of dinosaurs in this game. Lots of enemy varieties so you will not be bored by repetition. Was surprised by the fact that the raptors regenerate. Collecting the Chronoscepter pieces is a nice little sidequest that pays off in the end. \n\nAsk me, is it still worth $22. I am satisfied with my purchase and have played at least 12.8 dedicated hours of this title, however there was an issue with the sound and was not available to me during my experience from the start to end. Which in all honesty was a little upsetting and disapointing after waiting 18 years to play this but overall a great experience. Bearing this in mind,  I am looking forward to the entire series being remastered, as well the next remastered sequel Turok: Seeds of Evil, I still have not passed Level 2 after all these years. Help me out Night Dive Studios with sound this time.\n\nI want to believe, what do you believe in Steam users? X-Files :)\n\nNote-worthy issue: \n\n- Sound cuts out for some reason?

Levels also have really good pacing; you'll spend a good amount of ammo exploring and killing guys, then find a room that replenishes some/most of it. You never really feel starved for life and ammo, but you don't feel like its in abundance either.\n\nOverall, probably 7.50/10.

Turok has shown that the FPS genre is not limited to the Quake formula, expanding its genre with big open levels, keys, lives and a HUB, for exemple.\n[list]\n[*][b]GAMEPLAY:[/b]  In Turok, you are first presented in a forest. No intro, no cutscenes. The only story known is some great evil is taking the forest apart and you the Dinosaur Hunter should stop it. And that's about it.\nIn 10-30 minutes of progress through the first forest, you find out a place called The HUB where you can access any level at any time, go back to past levels and search for secrets that he left behind or keys to proceed to the future levels. This system may be nice, forcing the player to explore the level instead of just go through corridors which is very common in today's FPS, but if you miss a single key in a level you have to try the level again and again and again until you find it. It happened only once to me and believe me, it's annoying. \nYou can't save the game everywhere. Instead you find especific places to save through the levels.\nThe weapon variety is great. You start the game with a single knife and a bow. As you proceed the levels you have access to better weapons such as the pistol, the shotgun and weapons go all the way to high tech plasma rifles. The [i]Chronoscepter[/i] is the ultimate weapon of the game that you can acquire it collecting its pieces throughout the levels of the game. Turok has a great balance with its weapons even as you proceed to the end of the game, making the player use almost every weapon he has until the end. It's fun and it works pretty well.\n[b]The enemies are the weak point of the game.[/b] Turok has a low variety of enemies through its levels. The enemies change while you progress, yes, but their attacks are exactly the same even if the models are different, which is unpleasent and sometimes boring. The boss' battles are weak too. If you are expecting a intense and hard experience against the bosses, you chose the wrong game to play. Their attacks have a clear pattern and the boss get very easy when you find out its patterns. Running around in circles and shooting them until the end works well with every boss.\nStill, the level design of the game is very well made. The levels are big. Not only that, they also have nice challenges with plataforms, lava, holes, fake holes, buttons to access secret passages, portals, fire, water and until the end of the game you will discovering new challenges which make the levels very interesting and different from each other. [b]Overall, the level design is what highlight the game into a satisfying experience[/b].\n\n[*][b]GRAPHICS:[/b] Back in 1997, the graphics were great. The jungle, the animals, the fire, the water, the terrain, the weapons design, the animations, everything was made to turn Turok into a realistic and intense experience. So much that, that the Nintendo 64 had a close fog to the player and had problems with lag when the screen was full of enemies which could be annoying sometimes. Still, the enemies models are ugly with a single expression and their animations are very simple. This didn't bother me at all though, since it's still a 1997 game and I wasn't expecting much from it since most games from its time was like this. However, the weapons are very well designed and works nice together with the glowing, colored and sometimes realistic sprites. The textures have a decent resolution and it's not much detailed, I could point it as a passive point of the game's graphics.\n\n[*][b]SOUND:[/b] The sounds are okay. The sound effects are not bad at all but it's not something to notice much through the game. The weak point is that the enemies voices get really repetitive as you progress but it's not much to be bothered though.\nThe music of the entire game is a bit intense with beat and drums that changes with every level you progress. They are not that memorable though.\n\n[*][b]LASTING APPEAL:[/b] Since you need keys to progress the game, you will find yourself searching for every key through every level in the game if you want to get to the end of it. If you want to take the game a little further, you can search for every [i]Chronoscepter[/i] piece too and unlock the ~ultimate weapon~ of the game. It took me 6 hours to finish the game, find every [i]Chronoscepter[/i] piece and find half of the secrets. If you progress a little slower you can take up to 8 hours to do all this but not much more than this. The game offers cheats and about 20 secrets to find to extend the lasting appeal, but, unlike its successor, the lack of multiplayer can be unsatisfying to some people like me that likes to enjoy this kind of game with friends. All of this shouldn't go much more than 8-10 hours of playing time, but thankfully we're not paying a full price for this like back in the day.\n\n[*][b]PORT:[/b] [b]Night Dive Studios made an excelent job reviving Turok.[/b] The game features new graphics enhancements like bloom, light shafts, reflections and SSAO which can be weird for some (I personally disable them) and pleasent to others. It works fluid 60 FPS everytime in HD resolution on my GTX 460 with no problems and no patches needed. The fog are way extended and if you don't like it you can use the old N64 fog too. The keyboard + mouse works exactly the way you expect them to work and the gamepad is now adapted to be modern-like FPS, making the Turok experience even better than the Nintendo 64 one. \n[/list]\n[b]CONCLUSION:[/b] Turok is a great shooter even for today's standards. The variety of weapons, levels and challenges sums up to make Turok a nice and intense experience. The graphics are simple and not much something to notice to, but Night Dive Studios remaster brings new graphics features which can make Turok an entirely new experience from before without lag, HD resolution and fluid animations. The controls are simple and work exactly the way you expect them to with gamepad support. If you don't like them you can change it anytime in the pause/input menu. The game is about 7-10 hours long with every secret found. The price is just about right too. If you liked the old 1997 Turok, buy and enjoy this great remastered version.\n\n[b]tl;dr[/b]: Great remaster of the 1997 classic.

Hi Leute nun auch meine Meinung zu diesem Spiel. Da ich mit Turok aufgewachsen bin z\u00e4hlt es nachwievor zu meinen absoluten Lieblingsshootern.

Ich hatte damals die deutsche Version und mich haben die Roboter \u00fcberhaupt nicht gest\u00f6rt. Grafisch sahen die wie ich finde besser aus als die menschlichen Gegner. Die Gesichter der Menschen sehen wie aufgeklebte Fotos aus^^. Klar Roboter sind leichter darzustellen und es war trotzdem cool das in dem finalen Level neue Cyborgs ihren Auftritt hatten. In der deutschen Version hat man sich also auch M\u00fche gegeben kann man sagen und ich fand die Roboter vom Design echt cool. Das Gameplay ist einfach richtig sch\u00f6n Oldschool:\n\n- Gro\u00dfe verwinkelte Levels (viele Secrets)\n- Keine HP-Regeneration\n- Cooler Soundtrack\n- Coole Waffen\n- Hardcore Modus\n\nStory gibt es zwar nicht viel aber in Turok z\u00e4hlt das Gameplay. Das beste an der ganzen Sache ist das es einen Map-Editor geben wird. Somit kann die Community neue Karten f\u00fcr Turok basteln und man hat ewig Spa\u00df an dem Game. Eigene Kampagnen vielleicht eine die direkt nach dem Ende von Turok Dinosaur Hunter beginnt und und und...\n\nGrafisch hat sich denke ich jeder mehr erhofft aber es ist halt nur ein Remaster aber wenn ich mir diese riesigen gro\u00dfen Levels anschaue die in ner High End-Engine...das w\u00fcrde auf jeden Fall ordentlich Leistung fressen. Meiner Meinung nach h\u00e4tte den Levels bisschen mehr Vegetation gut getan.\n\nAber alles in einem geiles Remaster f\u00fcr Oldschool Fans zwar teuer aber ich finde f\u00fcr Turok lohnt es sich!

Read on for full review.[/b]\n\n[i]Turok: Dinosaur Hunter[/i] made its debut on the Nintendo 64 and PC in 1997. This game was one of the greatest adaptations of the titular hero when it originally released, but does its remaster still live up to today's standards?\n\n[table]\n   [tr]\n      [th]Pros[/th]\n      [th]Cons[/th]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]Turok: Dinosaur Hunter has never played any better than it does here, and it runs at a butter-smooth 60 FPS.[/td]\n      [td]Lack of proper cutscenes within the game to make the story more engaging.[/td]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]Minor changes to level design are seamless.[/td]\n      [td]Enemy AI pathfinding didn't carry over well for the remaster.[/td]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]Difficulty changes were much needed and add great replay value.[/td]\n      [td]Textures are muddied.[/td]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]New lighting and graphical effects are well done.[/td]\n      [td]Sound effects are very inconsistent throughout the entirety of the game.[/td]\n   [/tr]\n   [tr]\n      [td]Ambient environmental sounds are all great and immerse you into the game.[/td]\n      [td][/td]\n   [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe game thrusts you into the Lost Land, a place I can only describe as the garbage dump of time and space. Pretty much anything can get sucked into this land, and you were no different. As Turok, your duty is to assemble together the pieces of the Chronoscepter and put an end to the Campaigner's tyrannical reign.\n\nThe problem? None of this is explained to you in-game. You're left with an opening cutscene that tells you to locate keys to open up level portals in the Hub. The lack of any proper introduction makes you think there would at least be 'something' that builds the plot up as you go along your journey; however, without spoiling anything, the game's ending has a similar feeling of short-sightedness to it that will still leave you completely dumbfounded the same way the introduction did.\n\nIt was jarring in 1997, and it still is now.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nNight Dive Studios has put such an untold amount of work into fixing the original game's flaws while still keeping true to the source content, even with its minor changes made to level design.\n\nOne example of this is that you can now choose between four difficulty modes in this game: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Hardcore. Veteran players will find an added emphasis on survival with conserving weapon ammo and dodging enemy fire on later difficulties that was not present in the original game.\n\nUnfortunately, the pathing for enemies seems to be messed up in this remaster. Simply put, enemies nowhere near your vicinity will detect you and start running towards a wall. While it didn't affect me too much on Normal, it becomes far worse on later difficulties when mixed with the relentless respawn timer and increased enemy speed.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n[i]Turok: Dinosaur Hunter[/i] has never looked better, but that's not saying much. While this version of the game boasts the smoothest Turok experience to date, running at 60 FPS in 1080p, it still looks like a prototype of [i]Turok 2: Seeds of Evil[/i].\n\nThe textures are muddied and lack variety, especially in the game\u2019s early stages, but if you're used to games from the Nintendo 64 era, it shouldn't get in the way of your enjoyment of the game. Much appreciated changes were made to saturation, the addition of bloom, god rays, anti-aliasing, and water reflections, as well as an extended draw distance. All of these changes help make the environments in this game pop and stand-out from each other, though I wish shadows and other dynamic lighting effects were added into the game.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nWhile the Nintendo 64 soundtrack still does this game justice, the sound effects need a lot of work for creatures like Raptors and Leapers, traps, and enemy footsteps. These inconsistent sound effects, which I don't remember being nearly as present in the original game, are so bad at times that they can cause audible pops in feedback for your speakers or headset, no matter the volume settings of the game.\n\nLuckily, the addition of ambient environmental sounds adds a new level of atmosphere and does so without feeling out-of-place.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nFortunately, Turok fans will feel right at home playing the game on Steam as the remastered version of [i]Turok: Dinosaur Hunter[/i] achieves a great balance between platforming action, puzzle-solving elements, and shooter-based mechanics to make an experience that feels unlike anything else on the market even today. While it still has its fair share of issues that can be ironed out by Night Dive Studios, this is by far the most definitive version of [i]Turok: Dinosaur Hunter[/i] out there.", "timestamp_created": 1451779198, "timestamp_updated": 1451894667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20231299": {"recommendationid": "20231299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112952193", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452028895}, "language": "polish", "review": "Nie patrzcie na m\u00f3j czas gry.

Delicious old-school fun this game is: you're running around in mostly maze like levels looking for keys to open later levels while shooting everything that moves (including dinosaurs) in a captivating prehistoric(ish) environment.\n\nThe controls of this game are incredibly tight, it's absolutely spot on with all the additonal animated camera movements as it only adds to the gameplay's \"actiony\" feel as if I'm part of some neverending upbeat chase and the best of all that I actually am (some people might get physically sick of it, because of all the not-so-mainstream camera movements but I'm loving it)!\n\nThe almost continuously respawning enemies will make sure to never give you the time to get bored, so be sure to get those ammo supplies when you see'em!\nThe only negative thing I can name is the finalest level's random hardcore length increase. It's tolerable, but it can get annoying quickly, mostly because of the combination of overall blandness and having to listen to the final level's not so amazing music (the rest of the game's soundtrack is pretty awesome though) for 30 minutes straight (I'm not kidding).\n\nAll in all it's a very awesome game, definitely worth trying if you're into more classic games like Serious Sam or Wolfenstein.\n\nP.S.: Thunder should have been the final boss. That other guy after him may look intriguing, but he's actually MUCH easier to defeat than Thunder. I had a very cool fight with \"little\" Thunder there only to have my ass laughed off when the super dangerous final boss after him almost literally teleported into my fired rockets continuously only to have himself killed off in less than a minute. xD\n\nAlso I AM TUROK!

We meet again.\n\nMy first ever FPS! From my younger days of Christmas time, unwrapping my parents gift to me. Nintendo 64 along with Mario 64! What a great Christmas.. I later purchased Turok and Turok 2 after falling in love with Acclaim and their incredible dinosaur hunter game. Clunking around with the (at the time) state of the art nintendo joystick controller. What can I say. This game has nostalgia written allover it!\n\nThe review.\n\nIts Turok for fucks sake. This game is absolutely incredible and what I have been asking for, for the past 10 years.. Myself-\"Oh hey. I wish someone would buy Acclaim's rights and pick up the old Turok games\" ......Friend-\"oh yeah that would be awesome!\"...Myself-\"Yeah, I hope they include PC, that would be amazing!\"\n\nAfter all of these years, I am so glad to find that someone has decided to bring this game back to life.\nThe game play itself is somewhat linear, yet it leaves room for exploration. There is much more than dinosaurs here. Awesome weapons and very fluid controls. There are a few graphical improvemenets, such as light rays, increased view distance and FOV. The gameplay is the same... Which is all I could ask for.\n\nIf you have never dabbled in the Turok line of games. This may be a hard pill to swallow. The price is absolutely ridiculous for such a dated title.. I paid $14.99 usd for this game on sale from $19.99. I would have never paid that price, however I was overcome by excitement and nostalgia.. I think, In fairness someting along the lines of $9.99 with a $4.99 sale price would fit well. Nevertheless.. This game is absolutely worth a play!\n\nIf you have played the Turok games and are like myself. This was a no brainer. Turok on steam.. What a beatiful thing! The game plays absolutely beautifully on just a modest computer. I wish the price was a little lower, however.

And I couldnt be happier with its arrival on Steam! This is a pretty faith 1:1 coversion of the original game on the N64/PC to modern PC systems. So this is not your typical \"Remaster\" game that changes the whole graphics and gameplay, while ruining or forgetting some stuff in the process. And let me tell you something, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is STILL GOOD AS IT IS! So I'm glad how they decided to aproach this. Instead you get the same classic game with slight but welcomed graphic improvements and the obvious advantages that mouse and keyboard inputs provide.\n\nTo those that dont know anything about this game, Turok is a classic FPS that wasnt like anything back in 1997 or even today. This game introduced something that FPS didnt have back then, platforming and verticality, in fact I think it was the first game that did. Basically this game plays like DOOM with Super Mario Bros. levels of jumping all in a 3D environment. The first thing you'll notice is the incredible speed your character has when you move around. And jumping is not just a secondary occasional action, its the key aspect of the gameplay and without decent control of it you will get nowhere as your shooting abilities wont be enough if you want to progress. But dont worry things can only get more fun and feel natural as you make your first jumps. The game teaches you the basic and advanced actions in a tutorial that WILL help further in the game, such as \"long jumps\" and \"diagonal jumping\". \n\nThe level design is very clever and complex, they are like laberinths, so forget about just corridors and buildings, you are out in the wild with dinosaurs and other hunters that want to cut your head off. The weapons as with all Turok games can be as simple as a pistol or crazy and inventive like the Quad Rocket launcher or the Chronoscepter which you must find all the parts to assemble it if you want a better chance with the final boss.\n\nThe improved PC controls and a simple increase in color saturation and lighting has made wonders to this old game. Dont let the blocky models and old looking textures fool you, this game still has a lot to offer today, specially in an era dominated by online multiplayer modes and the lack of fun and replayable campaigns in FPS games. Also, the gamepad support is still excelent, probably because the original game was meant for a console so if you are looking for an FPS game to play while sitting comfortably in your couch, look no further, this game plays great with BOTH mouse/keyboard combo or Gamepad. And trust me there arent many fps games that play this good with a gamepad (at least not without autofire, LOL), hehe you can thank me later.\n\nI think this game still has the potential to entertain us for years to come, and hopefully it will be here to remember us and future generations what a fun FPS campaign is made of and what we should demand in FPS games and what not. Give it a chance I promise it wont let you down.\n\nOne last thing: a Real Dinosaur Hunter plays withouth crosshairs!

This game is a great WASD/mouse keyboard game but if you want to, you can bind a controller to it. Personally, i feel the mouse works just fine for the type of game this is. \n\nTurok is loaded with secret areas, hilarious AI and a nice variety of weapons. One play through i am guessing takes about 5-6 hours depending on how quickly you move through the levels. Ammo conservation is key to winning this. It can be challenging to learn how to aim at first but do the tutorial and you can get the hang of it quickly. \n\nThe levels are expansive, and often provide multiple paths. Overall, if you love classic games Turok is for you.

There was also a PC port and i guess this Steam version originates from that one. Graphics are still from 1997 but the game is not. It has several visual improvements, such as less foggy feeling and less laggy gameplay. It's also more brighter. \n\nDownsides of this port are the steep price of it and there's several fun bugs missing, such as the grenade launcher shot against dead enemies. In the N64 version, even though they were dead, they were still screaming when you shot them while they flew in the air. As for the grenade launcher, thats a very deadly weapon, against yourself. Even if you think you are outside of the grenade explosion radius, you are still inside it. I do not remember grenade doing this much damage on yourself.\n\nThe later levels are just pipes you run in, the jungle levels are the best ones. You can even explode a tree off against enemy. The enemies have basic health count, there are no headshots.

This port plays like a dream and looks gorgeous to boot. Plays a lot like Quake except with a really pissed off native american and a whole bunch of fuckin dinosaurs with guns in their heads.\n\nUnlike most shooters at the time or in general, your goal is to find level keys to access more levels from a level hub and ultimately put a stop to the evil man that wants to infuse guns into dinos heads. Level Design boasts large and obtuse/abstract jungle/cliff enviroments with some really ambient underwater sections, and some spooky as fuck caves. As you progress through the game, you can revisit any level you've unlocked to go back and get more keys or refarm lives because boy, are you goind to die a whole fuckin lot in this game. Offers no save anywhere function, so you better get used to checkpoint saves mother fucker.\n\nIt's price will be different from person to person, but I believe at 19.99, this is a fairly priced port with modern os support, Lighting engine upgrades, upscaled water physics, and overall smoother gameplay period.

Dinosaurs and you are already hooked, but I shall get into detail.\n\nYou play as Turok, a Native American warrior, and the story simply revolves around you going through 8 levels of action to defeat the Campaigner from taking over the world with a legendary weapon.\nIn those 8 levels is nothing but pure and non stop with a whole assortment of gun after gun after ass-pounding gun.\nIncluded with this levels you also get a variety of enemies that range from tribal warriors, aliens, and my favorite...dinosaurs..and dinosaurs with machine guns strapped to their backs and laser cannons for arms!\nEnough to make a kid from the 90's wet themselves.\n\nAs said the weapons arrange from the usual knives, shotguns, to rocket launchers and weapons that still to this day I have no earthly balls of a clue, all these weapons you are death incarnate.\nWhile you travel through the levels, your main goal is to collect the levels keys to advance and you also collect doritos to get a extra life once you hit 100.\n\nThe levels are really diverse as it will take time to get use to finding all the secret areas, keys, and collectables.\nLuckily you have a map to guide you through.\nControls are fast and smoothe, and sorry COD kiddies but this is an old school gem so do not expect to aim down your sights and get kills so easily, this game comes with no crosshair so you will have to settle with nothing but skill and destruction through the later levels as enemies will be harder to strike.\nGraphics for it's time are great and still hold up in my opinion, nothing to most people today...but still better than Duke Nukem Forever!\n\nMusic and sound effects are of course as awesome as ever, yeah..no complaints.\n\nOverall the game is a great throwback and addition to Steam, thank you Iguana Entertainment for this badass memory.\nRecommended? Fuck yes I do! \nLick it, smell it, buy it..whatever you guys want to do!\nJust play this sexy son-of-a-bitch!", "timestamp_created": 1450979189, "timestamp_updated": 1450979189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695022", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19914171": {"recommendationid": "19914171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053515657", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462481565}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "EXCELENTE JOGO!

I can not recommend this any more for those people that enjoyed the original N64 version. I will have to mention i did notice a few new things that changed... they are minor things but they help out the game i feel for the better.\n\nFirst thing... some level layouts have been changed just slightly to give a better chance of finding the things you need... no more obscure \"must climb this almost hidden wall to get the 2nd key in level 1\" they changed that area a bit to have the key in a much more obvious and harder to miss spot... and honestly it confused me a bit when i came around the corner to see the new area... things like this happen maybe once every level or two... its very subtle but helps with the flow of the game alot more.\n\nSecond thing i noticed.. and i could be wrong... but in the original N64 version of the game when you hit 9 lives and 99 life force... and tried to pick up another.. it would roll the lifeforce over to 0 without giving an aditional life. This version rectifies it by preventing you from ever picking up a life force if you are at maximum... you will never waste those Triangles anymore!\n\nI find these two subtle but very useful fixes made the game even better for me... and seeing the game running at 60 fps on even my potatoe of a system is a possitive. even with all the settings on i got little frame drops when looking at the sun but that is because of the new optional bloom and sunray effects they added to try and make it feel a bit better. \n\nin my oppinion.. this game is perfect... and hearing this company is going to be releasing turok 2 as well.. ooooo i am excited for this... definately pick this up when you can... the price is a bit steep especially compared to the console version used ... but its better than buying it new... this game goes for $400 on online auctions for the console... and this version is far far supieriour to the half baked port we got when it originally came out in 1997. If you really want the authetic feel.... grab a USB N64 controller online and hook it up... from the looks of it its compatible with gamepad rebindings so you can get an authetic feel of the game.\n\nEdit: This game i nominated for the test of time award. This game other than Turok 2 (which is not out yet) are the games that i will always go back to enjoy. no matter how old i get. for that reason i can not think of a better game then this one to get

It's an old school shooter and it's more fun than any new AAA fps (imho).\n\nIf you are playing this game for the first time, you won't be impressed. Nothing new here except fun ;)\n\nI definitivelly recommend it for fans of the series. For people that are thinking of buying it, here are some pro's and cons: \n+ Awesome soundtrack\n+ Fast paced shooting\n+ Dinosaurs\n+ Nostalgia\n+ interesting levels (Spoiler: treetop village)\n\n- Minor bugs here and there, but nothing serious (so far)\n- Game starts windowed by default, so have that in mind\n- Graphics are way better than in the original, but not ok for today's standards - if you care about that\n\nIf you buy this game, you'll have fun. If you don't, you haven't missed much. Considering all said - it's a recommendation from me\n\nThank you Night Dive Studios for enabling this on pc :D", "timestamp_created": 1450970545, "timestamp_updated": 1450970986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19908766": {"recommendationid": "19908766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046242117", "num_games_owned": 621, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452056440}, "language": "english", "review": "Stop reading this and buy this classic.", "timestamp_created": 1450967466, "timestamp_updated": 1450967466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19907089": {"recommendationid": "19907089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064798062", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513532868}, "language": "german", "review": "Muss ich hier eigentlich irgennd etwas sagen ?

The engine it runs on is entirely new and doesn't actually have too heavy a relationship with either the N64 original or the somewhat shoddy PC port.

The levels are packed with secrets which helps with replayability too.\n\nSo TL:DR. it's good. And at that you should thank Kaiser for his great work on the engine.

I remember reading about it in Nintendo Power and getting so excited for it. The crazy guns, the cheat codes and the insanely good graphics (for the time) drew me in.\n\nI remember looking up the cheat codes for the game on Game FAQS and hand typing all of the best codes onto a notepad file because I didn't know how to copy/paste yet. The cheat codes made me feel giddy back then. Little did I know they would ruin the game for me.\n\nSo for Christmas 1997 I asked my Mom for this game. Playing this game back then felt so good at first. The guns felt really good and the enemy death animations were amazing. I was able to make it past the first level, but going into the second level I started to lose interest. I printed out all of my cheats and went HAM on the game, teleporting to every level and killing every boss with the extremely overpowered weapons and invincibility. I was bored with the game after that, because the cheats kinda took the game aspect away.\n\nI later realized why I initially got so bored with the game. The control was terrible. Turning was slow but would quickly accelerate leading to overcompensation which led to very imprecise aiming. You just felt like you were in a vat of sticky goo. The N64 controller really sucked for FPS games. Turok 2 was better but suffered from similar problems.\n\nFast forward to 2001 I downloaded a Turok PC Demo and it was total crap with no mouse aiming.\n\nFast Forward to December 2015, Steam. I bought this game on the hopes that it would be playable and to experience nostalgia from 1997. I knew the game was good as it was highly praised in its day, I just wanted to really experience its goodness this time. So how does the game hold up?\n\nThat first level was not only a nostalgia overload, the control with the mouse, playing this game like a real and true FPS made me want to cry it was so amazing. The game was now fast and fluid, better view distance, no frame drops, a crosshair! It felt good. It felt like a really good classic FPS like Quake. I was having a lot of fun.\n\nAfter those first two levels the nostalgia wore off. It went from childhood memories to totally new memories. Because the combat was now fun and engaging, I was able to just play the game and progress. The levels for the most part are pretty well designed. Platforming sections were no longer nigh impossible for me. Jumping was quick, precise and easy. Although the platforming sections were the weakest part of this game by far, they were pretty intense because you really didn't want to die and lose the Backpack that you have had for almost 2 hours.\n\nThe best part of this game are the guns. I feel like almost every gun has a situational use (except for the pump shotgun after you get the auto shotgun). The guns stand above all else in terms of memoribility. The coolest gun in the game being the Chronoscepter, which has 8 pieces that you have to collect through out the game. It has only 3 shots and you finish putting together before the last boss. This gun made me cream myself when I saw it as a kid. Now its just a bad ass gun with effects that still look cool to me to this day.\n\nDefinitely get this game if you played and loved Turok back in the day and want the real Turok experience.\n\nDon't get this game if all you have played is Call of Duty/Halo\n\nAt 20$ It is definitely overpriced though, which is why I can't recommend this game to everyone.

The main problem is the price, charging twenty dollars does not make sense since A) Night Dive did not make this game, and B) is over fifteen years old.  While it is graphically updated, the textures still look very bit like (walls made of paper and everything else is made of a type of rectangle). They advertise that the game can use a controller; however, the default button to jump on my xbox one controller is LT. using the camera on my controller feels stiff and a bit unresponsive. The game also seems to have some lagging issues which is odd since I can run Half Life 2 with problems only happening when a lot of things are happening at once but I have issues running a game that was invented at a time where circles did not even exist. My biggest issue  though is that there seems to be a problem with my vision; hard to explain but imagine if you were to look through a glass bowl (everything in the middle seems farther than it should be and objects to the side look as if they have been stretched). No one else from what I read seems to have an issue with seeing but I thought I should just point it out (please send a comment to me if you are also having this issue or know how to fix it).  Even if the game costed fifteen dollars, (which would still be a bit pricey) at the condition it is in, I would recommend to save your money.

The outdated graphics may be a turnoff for some players, but Night Dive Studios' optimization of the game for modern PCs has enough options to keep you satisfied.\n\n+ Wide variety of weapons, powerups, and secondary ammo types awarded from exploration.\n\n+ Classic FPS gameplay (Health pickups, strafe-jumping, fast movement, etc.)\n\n+ Large maps with variety in themes and non-linear paths for exploration.\n\n+ Updated visuals such as godrays, water reflections, better draw distance, and support for modern screen resolutions.\n\n+ Controls are responsive and accuracy is better with a mouse than an N64 controller.\n\n+ Blowing a guy up with tek arrows or the grenade launcher feels awesome, and seeing blood squirt from someones throat always feels satisfying. \n\n+ Repetitive but otherwise catchy soundtrack with an electronic-tribal theme.\n\n+ No autosaves, relies on checkpoints and saves like the good ol' days. Dying results in loss of backpack and sets you back a couple minutes of gameplay.\n\n- FPS veterans may finish the game quickly, took me roughly six hours to finish the campaign. Not a huge issue for most players.\n\n- The platforming takes getting used too and precise jumping is required to reach certain areas and make progress. \n\n- The later levels do get confusing to navigate sometimes, and you may have to backtrack to find a level key if you weren't paying attention.\n\n- Minor clipping issues, such as seeing through certain models or going partially into the ground. These are rare instances and never interfere with the gameplay.\n\n- Outdated textures may be off-putting to modern gamers.\n\nSimply put, Turok is worth it for the nostalgia factor and also worth it for newcomers looking for a challenging old-school FPS. Updated controls make it easier to play, and the updated visuals are a nice touch despite the lack of better quality textures. \n\nYou also get to be a shirtless native and fight dinosaurs using alien weaponry.

Well let\u2019s see, they have added graphics options including some FOV options (default is 74), and a much better key binding system than the original pc release which did the key bindings outside of the game although the sub sections might be a little annoying to me but others might like them. There\u2019s also a thing in the graphics options called saturation. Really this is just the brightness slider but there are other sliders there that let you give the game a bit of a colored tint to it. I don\u2019t see much use in it but it seems like a nice little feature if you like to see the game in red or something\n\nAs mentioned before their is a new difficulty level called hardcore. I went straight for it and its kinda like a doom nightmare difficulty for Turok. Enemies do more damage move a helluva lot faster, fire faster and in this games case respawn faster (this they respawn already) although i'm pretty sure it does not affect bosses. Did i rage? A little of course because of the difficulty i chose. Did i still enjoy the game? The answer is hell yes.\n\nThe game runs much smoother than its original counter parts it runs at 60 fps and doesn\u2019t seem to have the slowdown effects that the N64 had when many enemies were on the screen or too much gunfire going round etc. If some people are sticklers for the old fog there is an option ingame under gameplay options called extend draw distance. Turning it off switches the fog back to the classic Turok style.  Turning it on doubles the distance so you see further. Honestly up to you how you play.\n\nTheres a load of enemies to deal with from knife and staff wielding ancient soldiers to dinosaurs with weapons attached to their arms. Dunno what more you could ask for from that!\n\nI did have a crash once in game and once when closing but they seemed to have been fixed extremely quickly.\n\nHonestly if you\u2019re a fan of old shooters especially exploration ones. Pick this game up.  This port is much better than the original, the music doesn\u2019t cut out, increased view distance, much smoother gameplay and a variety of options to edit makes this a great pick up.\n\nNow alot of people are complaining about the price and im pretty sick of this little argument. This wasnt just a remaster of the PC port of Turok. They did this on a new engine, had to change a few things and redo all the stuff from scratch. Its not like they can just copy it over and it works. It takes time and money. Since this game is much more polished than most of todays AAA titles (im looking at BO3  which i played over the free weekend and the latest batman), it crashed less, it runs fine, doesn't need a top of the line system and for 20 USD is an excellent purchase for a single player game.", "timestamp_created": 1450710862, "timestamp_updated": 1450713826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506719", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19823157": {"recommendationid": "19823157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021870818", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489858254}, "language": "english", "review": "I AM TUROK!", "timestamp_created": 1450703723, "timestamp_updated": 1450703723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462431", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19823102": {"recommendationid": "19823102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040909466", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506508227}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 loved it\n\nIm able to change any setting i want, the draw distance is great multiple Fov, can even run it at 4k, 60 fps on a 980 ti, feels just like the old game and i love it. \n\nThe price is high but im willing to pay it to get the developers to release turok 2 and maybe even turok evolution again on steam, i would pay 20$ for those!\n\n7 hour play time- Looks and feel like the old game i would recommend this to anyone!", "timestamp_created": 1450703506, "timestamp_updated": 1450703506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19822343": {"recommendationid": "19822343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067983181", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490591940}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was my childhood.

Bad platforming actions or decissions usually land you a reload or losing a life.\n\nBosses are exceptionally easy if you are used to strafing and shooting. \n\nIf you are looking for a good adventure, first-person shooter and puzzle game, all meshed up into one video game, this is the game for you.

When Turok was a new title I only had access to a Playstation 1. As a result I'm confident that I hold no real nostalgia for the series. The only reason I bought this Steam release of Turok was from the suggestion of a friend and that I like Night Dive Studios who thankfully rescued System Shock 1 and 2 from being abandonware. For me the worst case scenario would be getting my money back through a refund.\n\nI am happy to say that I've enjoyed my first hour and the first level of Turok and I'm certain I'll be coming back for more if not completing the full game. If you're like me and miss the days of FPS being \"Doom-Clones\" I am certain you will like Turok. The weapons are satifying to shoot, the enemies (ranging from Beasts to Humanoids who look like Scarecrows) all have lovely littlle death animations. The level design itself is one of the most interesting features. Whereas Doom and Quake had bitesized levels Turok has 8 levels. If each one is as big as Level 1 this is a fairly large game to explore. Much like Doom you're given a map and I personally find it enjoyable to see a blank map become filled out as you run around and kill everything that moves. I don't think you have to rely on a map much in this version but I'm sure it was a godsend for the console release with incredibly small draw distances the N64 version featured. To break up what could be a very repetitive game you have bits of platforming that I find enjoyable, only once or twice did I fall to my death so far.\n\nThere's some story about your lead character being a Time Traveller who has to stop some weapon from falling into the wrong hands but make no mistake you're just a Doomguy with a Indian Headress on. You're just going to be killing every monster in sight.\n\nLike most action games with simple controls this game has aged very well, the primitive graphics are colorful and the game feels silky smooth in 1080p. The only thing I'm not digging is the music as at least in Level 1 it's just a repetitive jungle beat MIDI playing constantly. Sadly not every game can have a soundtrack composed by Trent Reznor.\n\nThe price is a tad bit steep, I'm used to paying only $10 for rereleases of 5th Gen games but when you consider Night Dive Studios made a brand new engine the extra $5 doesn't seem so bad for the work put into it.

Your movement speed is rather fast, so is some enemies' speed, a lot of them shoot projectiles that are still a challenge to dodge, and most enemies respawn constantly! It's not so quick that clearing areas out loses its purpose, but its quick enough to constantly keep you on your toes.\n\nThere is also a satisfying exploration aspect. There are a lot of secrets which yield useful goodies as well as pieces of the Ultimate Weapon. In every level you don't just have to run to the exit: you need to grab three keys to unlock the next levels (with some minor exceptions). The exploration sometimes verges on overwhelming but as soon as you gather the willpower and start mapping a level out passage by passage, it usually becomes very simple. Heck, the only truly exploratory level is level 5, although there's room to wander around in the other levels too.\n\nThe graphics are really outdated, but you can judge them from the screenshots. I can just say that unless you are really sensitive about amazing graphics (in which case why are you even reading this?) you won't mind because it is perfectly functional and depicts the game's environments adequately.\n\nThe music is nothing special, but it excels at making you feel pumped and ready for action, as well as creating the atmosphere of the Lost Land.\n\nNow, lastly, the port's quaity. The controls are pretty much flawless. There's all sorts of options like head bob, FOV, extended draw distance, crosshair, bindable keys, etc. Apart from a few minor things that might as well end up added after this review is written, I don't know if I can think of anything I would've expected out of this as a port that it doesn't have. It'll also get extensive modding support and level editor, so there's that. If the community engages in making levels, this game's humble length won't matter at all! And someone might make, say, HD textures and models and whatnot. But that's all hypotheticals.\n\nSumming up, if you are at all interested in a good action FPS and aren't afraid of levels that are more open than a narrow corridor, you'd be doing yourself a huge disservise by not getting this game.

It's mostly  unchanged barring optimization and function . It's a wonderful  game.\nIf ya don't  get it.. then quit your bitchin' and go do something positive with your lives.\n\nAnd for those of us  whom really dig it, well Turok 2 will be right around the corner!

I digress, apologies mates.\n\nThe control scheme is much smoother than it's old N64 counterpart. It's much easier to maneuver than it was previously. If any of you remember the small lag it had in certain levels or when you were using explosive shells or tek arrows? SURPRISE! NO MORE LAG! It flows beautifully as it should ahve back then. you can still get through level 1 on normal with jsut the knife, so I think cranknig it up to hard should be your goal, although laterl levels this will prove jsut as difficult as it did when we first played this game. \"secret\" areas now have a map you can view, like level 1 circular type maze near the end of the level. It shows a complete map of the area so you won't miss out on you know what! (hush hush boys!)\n\nFor those that haven't played this game, I suggest you try it out.

regular rotation among my gaming habits back then. about a year or so ago a friend and I played through the entirety of this game on an N64 with no cheats and I was surprised at how well it held up to modern shooters. now that it's been ported to the PC and I've had a chance to blow through the first level, I figure I share some thoughts on the port and the game itself.\n\n\n- looks and feels like the N64 game just with less blurry textures. (personally I love this. I am a huge nostalgia sucker)\n- mouse and keyboard support! gamepad support as well but i'm yet to try it. \n- everything is still where I remember it. i.e., so far it seems like a very faithful recreation of the maps, item/weapon loacations, and enemy locations.\n- Turok plays surprisingly well with a keyboard and mouse. almost like Iguanna studios made the game that way first then stuck it in an N64 back in the 90's\n- the old save/checkpoint system is still in effect. ahhh, the good ol' 90's era of \"save when we tell you it's ok to save\".\n- music and sound are still great as ever.\n- additional fancy lighting and V-sync added. no more crummy framerate. though if they do that for turok 2 as well it will be an instant purchase for me.\n- late game becomes an excercise in ammunition management. \"sure the quad launcher will wreck that group of cyber-raptors.....but then what will I use against the rocket launching triceratops?!\"\n\nbasically if you remember turok for the N64, this should be a must play. $20 may be a bit steep however. so if you see it for no more than $15, I'd pick it up in a heart beat (which i did, and then I did.). \n\nI VERY MUCH look forward to seeing this studio's work on Turok 2. until then, I'm going to battle my way through to the campaigner and chronocepter his face into next week.", "timestamp_created": 1450539390, "timestamp_updated": 1450539390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19783885": {"recommendationid": "19783885", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986152818", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513818212}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Como sou um grande f\u00e3 da saga Turok, estou muito satisfetio com esta remasteriza\u00e7\u00e3o, os controles fluem perfeitamente sendo que voc\u00ea pode configurar todos os comandos de intera\u00e7\u00e3o deis de movimentos, armas e mapa.

This was something I had hoped for a long time but never thought would happen. The original Turok games are some of the most nostalgic games from my childhood and I really couldn\u2019t have asked for a better re-release. I have never played the PC version of this game before, so any comparisons I make will be based on my time with the N64 version.\n\nThere are a multitude of options to choose from ranging from visual to simple convenience options including things you\u2019d usually have to edit an .ini for in almost every other game.\n\nThe game runs smooth and controls amazingly well. I doubt I could go back to playing this game with an N64 controller again after playing the remastered PC version with mouse and keyboard. The platforming and aiming in particular are far improved.\n\nGraphically there are some improvements, though the look of the game is still very much the same. The improved draw distance is definitely one of the better improvements. There is still distance fog but it is nowhere near what it was on the N64. Another one of the more noticeable additions to me was god rays, which were very surprising to see in an old N64 game. They look really nice though. A bloom effect has also been added and it looks nice, and is definitely noticeable. There are some added water effects like reflection and refraction, though the reflection effect looked pretty weird, so I disabled that one. The game comes ready for HD resolutions and automatically detects your display settings. The game immediately started for me in 1920x1080(144hz), though I did have to disable windowed mode.\n\nAnother addition to this release of the game is achievements. Definitely a welcome addition in my book, even if they are rather simple and there are only 8 of them. Hopefully trading cards will be implemented eventually also as a Turok background could be pretty cool.\n\nThere are some small glitches like blood sticking to invisible surfaces, or occasionally being able to see through a wall as you\u2019re falling or moving in a weird way, but these are very minor and for me they don\u2019t detract from the game at all.\n\nThe price tag seems pretty high for an old game like this especially if you\u2019ve never played the game before and it holds no nostalgia value for you. For me this was definitely worth getting though since I have been hoping for this for so long and I\u2019ve always loved the game.\n\n\n\nNow I just wait for Turok 2, and when that releases my life will be complete.", "timestamp_created": 1450536610, "timestamp_updated": 1450536610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705265", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19782771": {"recommendationid": "19782771", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992954289", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485904968}, "language": "german", "review": "It make much fun and its pretty cool\n\n\ni not sure, but cheats not really work that not so nice\n\nand i would love when someone can make a \"Remake\" of this game.\n\nMaybe same gameplay, same items , same enemys, in a better graphic.

Most everything else remains the same blurry texture outside of bloom and a few other options.\n\u25bc The biggest change is the controls \u25bc\n\u2022 Mouse and Keyboard feels best, but even the controller support gets an update with duel joystick.\n\u2022 Platforming is a LOT easier due to the tighter controls.

Before Turok FPS were mostly made of sprites and took place in corridors, Turok took the action outside and let you blow apart fully polygonal enemies with a huge armament. Many people remember Golden Eye as the must play FPS for N64 but Turok was released before bond and was truly the game that broke new grounds.

Beyond reliving a forgotten legend in a land before time I also feel good knowing this game is being taken care of by people with a geniune love for classics such as this.

Featuring over a dozen of high tech awesome weaponry across 8 huge and varied levels battling foes ranging from disposable mercenaries to killer cyborgs it can easily be said that Turok has lost none of its attitude in the decades gone by.\n\nIf you can justify the price, there is no regrets with jumping in.

I keep it on the second-lowest (74 I think) to make things a bit friendlier but any higher than that and it just looks wierd to me. \n-There's no auto-aim. Unless its possibly there on Easy mode, I don't know, haven't tried that...\n-If you draw an arrow you can't switch to another weapon to keep from firing. \n-No option for spring-look joystick - so that exact original feel isn't there if you really wanted it (not a problem for me though).\n-I wish there were achievements for more things, like \"Find a backpack\", \"Beat Game on Hard\", \"Beat in under 10 hours\", and some to make me play through it more than once, like \"kill 10,000 enemies\" or \"Play for 30 hours\"\n\nNothing's really disappointing about it though - if you're like me and loved Turok and just wanted to have Turok with Achievements, here you go.

The just released update of the classic Turok: Dinosaur Hunter gives you the feeling of nostalgia from the classical graphics that the original title had with the added bonus of greatly improved controls.[/b][/h1]\n\n[h1][b]About The Game:[/b][/h1]\nTurok: Dinosaur Hunter was originally released on the Nintendo 64 back in 1997 by Acclaim Studios (R.I.P) and was a staple of FPS & platform gaming. The recently released PC version of Turok has been developed by Night Dive Studios and is pretty much identical to the original version except with updated and better controls & less blocky but still classic 90's visuals.\n\n[h1][b]The Story:[/b][/h1]\nWhat little story there is, Turok is a Cherokee Dinosaur Hunter that goes around and fights Dinosaurs, Mercinaries & Aliens in a somewhat modern era. Not only do you use Bows & Knifes but have access to firearms such as Handguns, Shotguns & even some very futuristic weaponry.\n\nAlong the way Turok has to stop the aliens from attacking and destroying human kind, Aliens have become a real problem, along with the Dinosaurs and it's up to you to save mankind from them.\n\n[h1][b]The Gameplay:[/b][/h1]\nThe game operates mainly as a fast paced FPS with somewhat moderate platforming elements to frustrate and divert your attention. \n\nThe controls are fluent, (especially compaired to the original games) but feel very fast for a game that was designed to be played on about 20FPS, the extra 40 FPS certainly feel very fast for a game of this age and can be somewhat disorienting for lovers of the classic game.\n\nThe gunplay is fun but certainly feels very dated & could have used a bit more attention in the development process, however this certainly does not ruin the experience. (Especially if you're a fan of the originals, you will not be let down).\n\nTurok has certainly stood the test of time, graphics wise this game is certainly nothing special & the developers didn't change any of the visuals except for the addition of standard PC settings such as, resolution, bloom effects and texture smoothing, other than that this is the same game from 1997.\n\n[h1][b]The Verdict:[/b][/h1]\nTurok: Dinosaur Hunter is and always will be, (in my eyes) a classic title and a must own title for those from the Nintendo 64 era of gaming. If you had a Nintendo 64 then you already know exactly why you must own this game, for those who didn't own a Nintendo 64 now you can own Turok right here on Steam.\n\nTurok is a fantastic game & it's certainly a game that if you're a lover of FPS games & platform gaming then this game will certainly tickle your fancy, on the flip side, if you're all about the graphics then this is not a game you're going to enjoy because the textures are very much classic 90's textures, flat and very little detail infact how they made Turok's face look is somewhat laughable, I certainly don't remember him looking like that on the Nintedo 64.\n\n[b]Rating:[/b] 4/5 a pretty flawless game but needed more done to it, like proper graphical overhauls in certain area's and better frame matching on animations for the enemies and AI.\n\n[h1][b]Do I Recommend The Game?:[/b][/h1]\nYes I do recommend the game to fans of the classic 90's games or just fans of the Turok series in general.\n\nThe price may be slightly to steep but this is 2015 not 1997 pricing is always expensive. Could this game have been cheaper? Yeah it probably could've been a more acceptable price of $10 but I'm not complaining as I enjoy the game regardless.\n\nI look forward to getting my hands on Turok 3: Shadows of Oblivion on the PC....

The game would later be ported to PC with some minor changes and a better sounding soundtrack but the game was locked to Voodoo graphics cards; didn't have one? You're screwed. I'm not sure if the game saw the amount of popularity that other shooters on PC saw at the time but the game faded away with time.\n\nUntil now the only way to really play it was on the N64, but Night Dive has revived it for the PC and they did a tremendous job. First off the game controls perfectly but you can change anything to your liking if need be. Visual options allow you to turn on some modern graphical effects (sun shafts, reflects on water) that were absent in the original PC release. You also get an option to increase the draw distance which helps a LOT, the game was damn near known for it's notoriously short draw distance due to \"fog.\" You can even change the FOV if you care to, very nice touch. Overall the game runs perfectly and I haven't had any issues with it in my 5+ hours of playtime. Well done.\n\nHow does the game hold up? Really, really well. Save for the dated visuals the gameplay is really fast-paced and fun. Turok himself moves at a ridiculous speed but it's all for the better, enemies hit hard if you get careless and there's a lot of weapons to toy around with and find out what works best on which enemy. The levels are also nice and varied, starting off quite linear and short and slowly growing into large and complex sprawls with various ways to go. Secret areas are hidden all over and there's some backtracking to do if you didn't get all the keys in your first go. The game always keeps you engaged without feeling unfair or bored. You'll find things to shoot around every corner.\n\nSo what're the down sides? Well, the enemies are only programmed for the aforementioned short draw distance of the original release, so a lot of the times you can just see guys standing around waiting for you to get into sight. Since you can see them, you can free shoot them without any issues and sometimes they won't even become hostile if they're far enough. Night Dive also decided to redo SOME of the graphics, this is minor but things like the font, main title logo and ammo counters are done up nicely; the issue is only SOME of the UI art has been touched up which is a little jarring. Turok's head is the original art but the number next to it (signifying lives left) is nice, crisp and completely redone. Also having the giant stone \"PAUSE\" sign on top of the pause screen looks terrible as it's really low res and muddy.\n\nIf you loved this game as a kid, you'll love it still today, it's still a great title that's aged well. If you've never played Turok this is the best one to start with. Night Dive is working on Turok 2 and I can't wait.\n\nUpdate: With the sequel released, I can say with confidence that Turok 1 is the better game.

No horrid mouse input here.  In addition, there are many new gameplay and input options, the UI has been redesigned slightly, there are new graphics features as the description says, and the levels have been redesigned in a few areas (for better or worse).  The more modern draw distance actually makes some parts much easier, but it's good to have acceptable draw distance.\n\nWidescreen support is fine.  I run it at 2560 x 1440 144 Hz with no issues related to this. \n\nFor those who never played Turok, know that this game is known primarily for two things: setting and weapons.  The setting is distinct; The Lost Land, a place that looks ancient in some areas with its ancient ruins, overgrown jungles and dinosaurs.  Fast forward to levels 7 and 8 which are filled with aliens and massive Sci-Fi constructs.  Like other classic FPS games, Turok is filled with hidden areas so be sure to explore.\n\nAnd the weapons... the Turok franchise has always had some of the coolest weapons you'll find in FPS gaming, although the sequels are better in this regard.\n\nThis remake has some bugs though.  Sound is glitchy like the original PC version and unlike the N64 version, and setting projectile collision to Precise just crashes my game.  It also has only preset FOV values but you can edit them yourself in config.cfg with any text editor.  Likewise an FPS cap is in place (60); you can try removing it but do so at your own risk.

The 15 dollars is the most I am willing to pay for a game made in 1997. It's not a remake, it's a remaster and I feel like the developer is trying to make extra cash over nostalgia. Unless you really like Turok or old school FPS games like me then I highly recommend you wait for a sale to bring it down to $10.

One that was more at home with Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda than Doom and Quake.\n\nTurok bares a lot more qualities reminiscient of Mario than Doom really. The game features an overly cartoony art style with exaggerated proportions, it takes place in a vague indeterminate setting called the \"Lost Land\" reminiscient of Mario's mushroom kingdom. It features player lives and pickups inorder to gain new ones. It has a hub level strictly for warping to new ones ala Super Mario 64. It has platforming sections. And the general objective of the game is to \"gather something from every level in the game and kill the final boss\". It's weird to me coming back to it since, swap the graphics and change the protagonist into a plumber and the enemies into goombas and you have \"Super Mario the FPS\". Just add dinosaurs.\n\nNow this game originally released on the N64 and has been ported to a brand new engine with this release. You have things like a water reflection shader, higher framerate, FOV options and widescreen. The higher framerate causes the game to feel much faster and more akin to Serious Sam.\n\nNow all this being said.

The bad news is the game is ugly as sin by today's standards. But that's okay though. I still like the gameplay. It's hardcore, old school.

I'm playing the game on a Surface Pro 3 with the Steam controller and it runs without any issues. 2160 x 1440 with the extended draw distance turned on. It runs pretty good with all effects turned on at that resolution, between 30-35 FPS  but I wanted the higher framerate (50-60) so I turned a lot of it off. It doesn't make much difference anyway because we're still talking about a N64 game with N64 textures. Bloom lighting on those is doesn't do much. \n\nBut I do recommend the game for anyone that fondly remembers Turok and wouldn't mind playing it again.

So i've never really played the originals, with that being said, i must say that if you're planning to play this game, you really need to get into the mindset of the time, a lot has change ever since then, and despite this being the best Turok  version that you can get, the game definitley shows it's ruff edges, the wonky camera that moves all over the place, the repetitive attacks and looks of different enemies, and the similarities between the atmosfere of certain levels, but it's a game from 1997 so im not really too annoyed by those things, the real annoying things for me when it comes to this version are two, the first one has to do with the relationship that the developer has stablished with the game, the price, the review of a man that has clocked in 160+ hours into the game, it's just sad to do things like that, and the irony it's that the game doesn't need a nice review, they did a good job with what they had, Night Dive studios that is.\n\nI just feel as if the complains that some people have about the graphics are not that reasonable, i get the fact that the game didn't really change that much visually, but what matters it's the fact that the freaking thing works, it's playable. As matter of fact, you can play the game at 4k resolution if you want, with fov support up to 120, so i don't get where the complains lie. If the developers had changed the graphics then you'd probrably had an amass of people complaining about that too.\nIn all in all im just happy, happy that im able to play this game, that there's actual support in the realm of pc gaming for games that i've always wanted to play but couldn't, because of my ignorance, or just simply because i didn't have any opportunity, the game runs, and looks fine for a game of it's time, and there are changes that are implented here, changes that go beyond further how the game superficially looks, or works, the a.i. has been improved, it's vicious in some cases, you can customize the level of difficulty in game options, you can also change other things, heck you can even disable or enable the weapon \"bobbing\", so in my opininon this guys did a neat job, the only problem it's the price, for what i've heard they first were asking for 10$, and now out of nowhere they want 20$, again as i said, that's the only issue that i have, each and every other thing seems fine to me, just rememeber, Turok it's a game about going through levels getting keys, in order to get to other levels, if you miss some the first time you play through a level, then you have to go back and get them, but i can't really blame Night Dive studios for this, as i said...

Lots of secret areas to find ammo and health pickups.  \n-You'll have fun tracking down hidden keys.  This isn't a linear game.\n-Enemy AI is about as retro as it gets.  You can just run past them or waste your ammo if you prefer.\n\nCons:\n\n-MAP COMPLETELY CHANGED- This was the largest surprise for me. Want that secret automatic shotgun near the 2nd key on top of that hidden cliff? They removed it. You're stuck with the regular shotgun for a long time.  The 2nd key isn't even on a cliff. It's now in a completely different area in a stone building, surrounded by raptors and militants.  \n-Fog isn't completely removed. \n-No enemy AI improvemnts.\n\n\nIt's still a fun game but it's not at all the same game.

I would fly down with my family to Florida to spend a few weeks at our condo. I always remember looking forward to seeing my cousin every summer because of the endless nights of gaming on the N64 and PS1 with no bedtime with him. I forgot how many hours we ended up spending on classics like Shadows of the Empire, Goldeneye, Dino Crisis... You name it! The one game that sticks out most to me from this time period is none other than Turok.\n\n18 years later this game is as much of a masterpiece now as it was then, but I would wager that it takes an older breed of gamer to truly appreciate the admittedly clunky mechanics of what made Turok so great in 1997. \n\nThis is a great re-release/remaster of the 1997 Acclaim title done by Night Dive Studios. They are more known for what they have done to the System Shock series, first porting them over to modern PC systems, and then announcing they will be working on a remake of the original. I would say that this is a proper re-release, but I have no doubt that others will clearly disagree with me.\n\nYes, this is a game that begs for nostalgia goggles to be worn-- but then again, this is the game as we imagined it in our young(er) heads after all, is it not? Coming back to play classic titles can sometimes be a depressing experience, as we notice flaws formerly looked over, or things that in general, just don't hold up. This is not the case here.\n\nFor starters, this game got a graphical overhaul. It runs on, reportedly, an entirely new engine. While most of the textures look primarily the same, it is a bit refreshed. Probably the biggest fix is the draw distance fog-- it hardly exists anymore and you can see heaps more of the game as it was intended to be seen. There are tons of graphical options to tinker with in-game, but this is hardly a taxing game by any standards. I am running the game at 1080P and it never dips below 60FPS. The \"enhanced\" graphics might not appeal to some, and may not impress others, but this was one thing the game sorely needed.\n\nAs far as I can recall this is about the same game we got in '97, I don't believe anything was added or removed story-wise. Gameplay however is much smoother. No more fiddling around with an N64 controller anymore, praize da lawd. Platforming is a breeze now.\n\nI would like to say that this game and its playstyle will likely polarize modern gamers. This is probably not something the COD/Rocket League crowd would enjoy. It's a slow burn you have to grind your way through, similar to Dark Souls, but not as difficult, and more rewarding.\n\nThe sound design is notably improved, with a higher fidelity soundtrack, and better quality sound effects.\n\nNative controller support is very comfortable and all the controls are totally mappable to whichever configuration you prefer.\n\nIf you want a great, classic single player FPS game to play, look no further, but just bear in mind this is probably not for everybody!\n\nI would like to express my thanks to Night Dive Studios for not merely pushing out a product that was not touched in 18 years, but instead, putting hard work into bringing back the glory of the 1990s with Turok's remaster. Thank you!\n\nTL;DR Section\n\nPros:\n-Vastly improved graphics and gameplay mechanics\n-Native controller support\n-Well written, self-contained storyline\n-Nice 21st century touches such as updated HUD\n-Difficult, but rewarding and fun gameplay\n-Dinosaurs\n-Huge levels with emphasis on collecting everything\n-Did I mention dinosaurs?\n\nCons:\n-Textures do not hold up well at all. I would have enjoyed some refreshed textures\n-No mod support (yet)\n-No force feedback for controllers\n-AI is hit or miss \n-No online play/co-op\n-High price point probably a turn off to most\n-Difficulty/playstyle not for everyone\n\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1450388533, "timestamp_updated": 1450389415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19753375": {"recommendationid": "19753375", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980047305", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468039043}, "language": "english", "review": "Having played Turok 1 and 2 as a child, I am nothing short of stoked to be able to play this, at a full 3440x1440 resolution, with beautifully enhanced visuals, and right off the bat easy controls.

Turok and Turok 2 were my first FPS games I have ever played, and I played them repeatedly as a child and into adulthood.\nI have every N64 game, PC port, Gameboy game, Turok Evolution, and even the incredibly average Turok 2008 on PS3 and PC. I even dabbled in the comics, toys, and collectables. \n\nYou're, most likely, coming here from the N64 version of Turok, and that's fine. To be honest, there were few differences, even visually, from the original PC port and the N64 port of Turok: The Dinosaur Hunter. On modern systems, there were a few glitches with the PC port, such as the music randomly cutting off entirely, and some visual hiccups.\n\nThis PC version actually has some dramatic differences from the original game. First off, visually, it's certainly improved in most areas, and unnecessary in others.\nThe most important visual difference is the increased draw distance. HOLY CRAP was I surprised to see the game with increased view distance. \nDon't misunderstand, there's still fog, but it's almost doubled in the amount you can see in front of you. There was so much environmental detail obscured by the N64 fog that has now been opened for everyone to see in this PC port. \n\nAs someone who has played Turok more times than I can even hope to remember, for possibly hundreds of hours total, I actually felt like I was playing a different game entirely for a moment. To new players, you won't be at all impressed. In fact, you will for a fact say that the game looks ugly and the level design is terrible. But for long-time fans of the game, this will rebreathe life into the game visually.\n\nThe next major change is the added on visual effects. This was mostly unnecessary, but I don't dislike any of it. There's now God Rays, Bloom, real-time reflections on water, and other visual effects. Sometimes they all clutter together in a bit of a mess, other times it looks rather appealing and colorful. \nLuckily, love it or hate it, these options are toggleable. You can turn off what you want and leave on what you want. You can make the game look as close to the original PC/N64 port as you want, even as far as turning the screen resolution down to good old 1997 graphics.\n\nThe next major change is in gameplay. The original game, on N64 at least, made use of slightly clunky controls that resulted in making it impossible to do any precise aiming. To alleviate this, auto-aim was present, with no on-screen crosshair.\nIn this PC port, there's still auto-aim, but I believe you can turn it off, and even put an on-screen crosshair. Since you'll likely be using a KB+M setup, this means you can finally aim (mostly) accurately with a typical modern FPS WASD setup.\n\nAlso, thanks to the VASTLY improved framerate (as this is on PC), moving, jumping, and shooting all feels responsive, and those first person platforming sections feel more possible than ever!\n\nThere is this horribly exaggerated headbob/sway. I know the original game certainly had headbob, but with the increased control and FOV it makes the sway dizzying to a degree. Strafing left of right has Turok fling his body and perspective by almost 45 degrees. Luckily, NightDive Studios provided and made the ability to turn this option off! Barely a couple days later they released a patch and now the headbob is completely toggleable, making the game much more playable to those who get sick from dramatic perspective shifts.\n\nFinally however, there is the game environment itself. In the first level alone so far, there have been pretty sizable changes to enemy placements, environment positions, and even entire new sections of the level. Seeing these new areas made my head spin. It's [i]mostly[/i] what you might remember, but certainly changed. I can't say if I entirely like this or not. On one hand, it's a nice change of pace, almost like I'm playing the game for the first time again. On the other, it does seem to mean that a lot I thought I knew about Turok is mostly useless. It hasn't been too drastic yet, however, but we will see how that changes as I progress in the game.\n\nThe music is still fantastic, easily my favourite percussion based soundtrack in any game EVER, fitting each level perfectly. Textures and character models are sharper and cleaner, but are exactly the same from 1997. Sound effects are also the same, though the sound design as a whole has been tweaked for the better to be more crisp.\n\nI do have a few nitpicks:\n1. No walk toggle. This was crucial in some of the platforming sections, and it seem Turok's movement speed has been slightly increased otherwise.\n2. The earlier mentioned headbob/sway. \n3. Gamepad controls feel floaty and imprecise.\n4. The map overlay shows in areas that in the previous port didn't. For examples, in the original port there were certain areas where the map did not draw, forcing you to explore, mostly in maze like areas. To 98% of players, this might be a great change, but for the 2% that have brain damage like myself, we might prefer the areas where we couldn't rely on the map.\n\nOverall, this is still Turok, one of the greatest old-school first person shooters I've ever played, and can only be topped by it's sequel, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil (Please be swift Nightdive Studios!!!)\n\nI WANT to recommend this game to newcomers, but I'm afraid most of them will shit all over it for being old and outdated. \nThis is really meant to be a game for the fans and nostalgic players, of which there are many.\n\nEdit about Price (12/17/2015): A friend of mine mentioned about the price. Currently, on release, it's sitting at $16 on sale, and $20 normally.\nPersonally, I find that $15 should be the standard price, and they could have done $10 on sale. Other people would disagree and say $10 should be the base price.\nI feel $15 is fair, for a couple reasons.\n1. The original PC port of Turok is sitting between $20-40 depending on where you look. There are a few areas where it's cheaper, but the only one I found was from Italy.\n2. The original PC port isn't guaranteed to work. I know personally I had issues getting the soundtrack to keep playing during gameplay\n3. This isn't using the original engine, meaning some work had to be put in, especially to slap on those graphical effects and the change things around.

I've always been a Turok 2 fan, and I gotta say, with modern control schemes It's a lot more enjoyable and killing enemies is still really satisfying. Graphically it has aged gracefully. Even the platforming sections are not as annoying as they were before but are still really bad. The keys to unlock new levels are hidden in some sadistic areas at times, and replaying the levels over and over again is frustrating. The difficulty is somewhat lower than the original, mainly because of the modern control scheme. Dying to an enemy is actually really rare and most death will be mainly due to bad platforming sections.\n\nThe pricetag of 14.99 is honest, but when the sales are over, the game will raise it's pricetag to a less honest 19.99. The game is still great, and it definitely deserves 19.99 but it will be hard to convince someone to purchase Turok over, let's say, Resident Evil Rebirth.\n\nThe gameplay shows it's age at times, but when you blast an enemy with the automatic shotgun and seeing him coughing up blood will never get old. The game is gory and it is absolutely satisfying to kill people in this game. Being lost in this huge map, looking for the key that is hidden on a hidden platform can be really frustrating but when you kill enemies, that's where the game really hits the spot.\n\nI recommend this game, but I recommend even more it's sequel, Turok 2. Since it's Turok 1 but better at every point. No more key hunting but objectives to do, you can dismember enemies (which is really awesome), a ridiculous amount of weapons etc...\n\nThe port runs great, has tons of graphical settings and is very nice to look at. \n\nI can't thank enough Kaiser and the guys at Night Dive Studios for what they do.", "timestamp_created": 1450377297, "timestamp_updated": 1450457184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 229, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846480", "comment_count": "23", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19750404": {"recommendationid": "19750404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006213686", "num_games_owned": 946, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489473574}, "language": "english", "review": "ARE YOU A BAD ENOUGH DUDE TO SURVIVE THE LOST LAND AND WRECK THE CAMPAIGNERS SHIT?\nTHE DEFINITIVE VERSION OF TUROK.", "timestamp_created": 1450376626, "timestamp_updated": 1450376626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.306454", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39376707": {"recommendationid": "39376707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001338488", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 307, "last_played": 1516211746}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Fren\u00e9tico, directo y con una gran jugabilidad.

I've been switching between a Logitech Game Pad, Steam Controller and the mouse and Keyboard for controls, and I can't really say that any of those options don't fit this game. If you want a certain feeling when controlling the game I would highly recommend getting in the training level and tweaking all the settings you need before starting the main game. I ended up doing this for the Steam Controller for the look sensitivity. Also, the levels are similar enough to the original that I was running through the first 4 on memory alone. \n\nDislikes: I am sad to say that I noticed that the sounds that certatin objects and enemies make in this game are not the same as the sounds from the original for some reason. The Pur-Linn, Raptors, and Human enemies all make the same sounds, and most of the weapons make the same sounds when firing. The Save Points and the Checkpoints do not make the same noise as the original, particularly when resurrecting Turok after a death.  It's an extremely minor point that I 'm nitpicking on looking for something to complain about. The fact that the main character screams \" I...AM TUROK!!!\" when gaining an extra life was honestly enough for me. \n\nIf you have never played a game from the N64 library, I can't recommend this enough as an \"early\" 64 game. The remaster has made it possible to run this well on modern hardware and with modern settings (no 680X480 CRT's available at my house anymore!) so this is the best way to experience something this old without frustration. \n\nPlay this if you like other FPS games from the era, like Quake(1996), and Unreal (1998).", "timestamp_created": 1515394304, "timestamp_updated": 1515394304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39145885": {"recommendationid": "39145885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022383242", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503918229}, "language": "french", "review": "Un putain de jeu qui a fait mon enfance sur la n64 enfin sur PC. \u00c0 tester les gens", "timestamp_created": 1515317092, "timestamp_updated": 1515317092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39131889": {"recommendationid": "39131889", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967076285", "num_games_owned": 587, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 591, "last_played": 1515273654}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this on the N64 as a kid.

I could never get past level five, though, because I was missing a key in either level four or five. Once I bought it here, I couldn't wait to dive into it, even though my experience was slightly different, because of the mouse and keyboard controls, and I didn't use cheat codes like I always used to.\n\nSo the main objective in this game is to find a bunch of keys to access the different levels in the hub world. There are eight levels altogether, and they all have the exact same mission: Find the keys and leave. The levels aren\u2019t particularly interesting to talk about. You have a jungle, ancient city, ruins, and blah blah blah. The Treetop Village is where I had never gotten to before. You see more cliffs at the start of that level than trees.\n\nEach track from the soundtrack fits perfectly with each level they are in. Some tracks are so upbeat, like in the Jungle level. It actually sounds like a jungle, especially with all the animal sounds. Others can sometimes be quieter, like in a cave. Even going underwater has its own track. 100 gold stars for this composer.\n\nThe way the camera moves when you start can be a little disorienting, but luckily, that can be turned off in the \"Head Bobbing\" options.\n\nIf you pick up enough triangles, which I like to call \"Doritos\", you gain an extra life. You also pick up chronoscepter pieces, weapons, backpacks to carry more ammo, and spiritual invincibility, which is quite useful, since it slows down enemies and makes you invulnerable to their attacks. There is one chronoscepter piece in each level. I won't say much about it, but I will say that if you can get the chronoscepter, good things will happen. I thought the infinity symbols were level 8 keys, but it turns out there aren\u2019t even that many of those keys. Those symbols are actually the chronoscepter pieces. Well, that\u2019s kinda misleading, isn\u2019t it? What is a list of chronoscepter pieces doing in the \u201cKeys\u201d page?\n\nYou have a variety of weapons to choose from. You got your old fashioned weapons, like the knife and bow. You\u2019ve also got your military weapons, like the pistol, shotguns, assault rifle, and so on. Some of these weapons become useless due to other weapons using the same ammo, like the pump action rifle, and the pistol. Just use the auto shotgun and assault rifle, they\u2019re much more superior. But there are also plasma weapons. Such colors! Much power!\n\nThere are many different kinds of enemies in this game. You start off fighting just regular guys with guns, raptors, leaping lizards, and giant mutant gorillas. But the enemies get tougher in each level, the bosses being the hardest. The boss fights mostly consist of running backwards and just unloading everything you\u2019ve got on them. You will have to do a lot of strafing to avoid being hit by their attacks. Some of the bosses have unavoidable attacks, because that\u2019s totally fair. But oddly enough, those do the least amount of damage, as far as I\u2019ve seen, at least.\n\nThere is a lot of puzzle solving you have to do to get goodies. Usually, you will have to look around for a platform to jump from to reach them, or look in all the nooks and crannies for a button, a secret path, a portal, or all of the above to get to those hard to reach places. But there are other secret ways to get goodies too. There are invisible platforms, walls you can walk through, platforms to land on down below, and areas you need to strafe-jump to in order to get to them. There are all sorts of ways to get goodies.\n\nEach level has two bonus areas, in which you have to enter a floating blue portal to get to. You can get some goodies here too, but there is usually an obstacle course or platforming section that you will need to pass in order to get to the good stuff. Each time you enter the portal, it alternates between the two areas. The goodies don\u2019t respawn, so unless you missed some, or you need to regain health or Doritos, there\u2019s really no point in entering them a second time.\n\nApparently, you can unlock cheats in this game. When you get 9 lives and 99 Doritos, you will unlock the \"Infinite Lives\" cheat. That's actually pretty cool. I didn't know cheats could be unlocked like that. Unfortunately, that's the only cheat I was able to unlock.\n\nThat's actually all I am going to say about this game. This was definitely a real nostalgia trip for me. It\u2019s just as much fun as I remember, if not more fun now than it was back then. I am so glad that someone decided to act on bringing this game back to us consumers who loved the original Nintendo 64 version. I could probably give this game a straight up 10 outta 10.

Turok: Dinosaur Hunter nos tra\u00eda todos estos elementos, y lo hac\u00eda utilizando una licencia que probablemente muchos desconocen, pero que tiene un trasfondo bastante curioso.\n\nY es que si queremos conocer el pasado de Turok no debemos y a la d\u00e9cada de los 90', sino a la de los 50', donde se public\u00f3 por primera vez un c\u00f3mic utilizando el personaje de Turok en 1954, y dos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde con su propia historia. Las bases para los juegos ya se hab\u00edan establecido, un mundo de aspecto prehist\u00f3rico mezclado con ciencia ficci\u00f3n y un h\u00e9roe con un at\u00edpico aspecto nativo americano, en este caso llamado Tal'Set y que ser\u00eda nuestro Turok. A pesar de que el videojuego se basa en una novela gr\u00e1fica con d\u00e9cadas s sus espaldas (y que sigue teniendo apariciones hoy en d\u00eda), su plano argumental est\u00e1 tan trabajado como los de un cl\u00e1sico Doom o Quake, es decir, completamente ausente, lo cual puede considerarse por algunos una oportunidad desperdiciada pero que por otro lado asegura una jugabilidad directa y r\u00e1pida en lo que nos interesa: acci\u00f3n, acci\u00f3n y acci\u00f3n.\n\nTurok es completamente Old School y eso se nota desde el principio, con un estilo de juego r\u00e1pido, controles b\u00e1sicos y simples en su ejecuci\u00f3n y decenas de enemigos abord\u00e1ndonos, pero tambi\u00e9n presentaba en su d\u00eda cualidades que le daban una identidad marcada m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de sus enemigos (esa h\u00edbrida fauna que va desde dinosarios a humanos e incluso aliens, robots y otras alima\u00f1as) o sus escenarios se aspecto marcadamente prehist\u00f3rico. La arquitectura de los niveles era enorme y compleja, y encerraba muchos secretos, algunos vitales para avanzar como ser\u00eda la b\u00fasqueda de las llaves, nuestro principal objetivo en cada nivel, o las piezas del Chronoscepter, un arma que, en caso de conseguir ensamblarla, nos ser\u00e1 clave en un momento dado. Para ello el equipo de Iguana Entertainment cre\u00f3 un surtido de 8 niveles que quiz\u00e1s en cantidad pareciese poca cosa para la \u00e9poca, pero cada uno de ellos era largo e intrincado. Por lo general todos ellos pueden durarte m\u00e1s de media hora y no pocas veces menos de la hora de duraci\u00f3n, sobre todo si nos perdemos o nos quedamos absortos explorando, algo nada fuera de lo com\u00fan.\n\nAunque el c\u00f3mputo global del juego puede durar menos de 10 horas sin problemas a poco que sepas orientarte, utilizar el mapa, o simplemente sin entretenerte m\u00e1s de la cuenta, la longitud de los niveles es verdaderamente remarcable, la estructura de algunos era especialmente espectacular, sobre todo en casos como el de The Treetop Village con escenarios con un enorme grado de verticalidad (algo inusual en general) o The Final Confrontation, un aut\u00e9ntico laberinto alien\u00edgena que pondr\u00e1 de los nervios a aquellos que no sepan encontrar la salida. Puede que sea un factor que irrite a algunos, pero un dise\u00f1o de escenarios como este siempre es especial, y adem\u00e1s ser\u00eda la base sobre la que se cimentar\u00eda una saga tan emblem\u00e1tica como es la de Metroid Prime (hecho por Retro Studios, fundada por muchos miembros de Iguana Entertainment). De hecho, Turok tiene especial \u00e9nfasis en aspectos no tan propios de los FPS, como cierta tendencia a las plataformas, algo que normalmente tiene un plus de dificultad cuando no ves claramente por donde pisas, pero que ser\u00eda trasladada a la sub-serie en primera persona de Samus Aran con todas las variantes que ofrece la saga de Nintendo.\n\nOtro de los aspectos destacables es el arsenal del juego, que cuenta con muchas armas, la gran mayor\u00eda de ellas reconocibles y b\u00e1sicas en cualquier FPS que se precie, como pueden ser pistolas, escopetas, rifles o lanzacohetes. Sin embargo Turok tiene algunas particulares como es el caso del arco Tek, el cual contar\u00e1 con flechas normales y flechas explosivas, haciendo de esta \u00faltima variante especialmente eficaz. Otros como el Ca\u00f1\u00f3n de Fusi\u00f3n se siente como una variante propia del BFG de ID Software, y por supuesto est\u00e1 el mencionado Chronoscepter, aunque conseguirla justo en las \u00faltimas secuencuas del juego hace que en general sea un recurso muy desaprovechado y una an\u00e9cdota m\u00e1s que otra cosa. Sin embargo, en el arsenal hay gran variedad y te ser\u00e1 de utilidad frente a oleadas enemigas que no solo son numerosas, sino que adem\u00e1s pueden reaparecer, lo que hace que en el caso de que tengas que hacer Backtracking, no sea un paseo sin m\u00e1s.\n\nLos peores apartados sin duda est\u00e1n en el lado t\u00e9cnico. El audiovisual es el elemento que m\u00e1s tendencia tiene a envejecer, y en el caso de las primeras generaciones de FPS tridimensionales, es much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s notable, no solo por los modelados que se sienten como una masa poligonar que apenas pueden ser capaces de respetar los t\u00e9rminos b\u00e1sicos de la anatom\u00eda humana (o la dinosauria en este caso), sino en general escenarios, texturas, etc... todo se siente como en plena d\u00e9cada de los 90, y el remaster no es que haga grandes cambios y mejoras, se siente una remasterizaci\u00f3n con lo b\u00e1sico y fuera. Peor a\u00fan si pensamos en el hecho de que a veces el rendimiento no es todo lo excelente que deber\u00eda esperarse de un juego que ya tiene sus 20 a\u00f1os en la chepa, y a veces he visto c\u00f3mo los 60Fps ten\u00edan algunas ocasionales bajadas a 50-55 FPS, lo cual no deber\u00eda ser as\u00ed. Por lo dem\u00e1s, tampoco puedo hablar al dedillo de todos los cambios que hay respecto a las versiones originales del juego ya que apenas jugu\u00e9 al original en su d\u00eda, aunque creo que es de caj\u00f3n que han quitado bastante niebla que, en su d\u00eda, se usaba para aliviar la carga gr\u00e1fica del juego y no desplomar el rendimiento de este.\n\nPero m\u00e1s que el visual que hasta cierto punto me parece comprensible, me resulta chocante el sonoro. Especialmente la banda sonora no a envejecido bien, no tiene temas memorables y creo que si lo comparo con el de la secuela palidece por todas partes, pero adem\u00e1s la calidad del audio se siente mala, como \"vieja\", por lo que tampoco parece que se haya hecho un gran trabajo en el remaster de ese aspecto. Los efectos sonoros se sostienen mucho m\u00e1s aunque tambi\u00e9n se sienten desactualizados. \n\nA grandes rasgos Turok es m\u00e1s convincente para aquellos que vivieron la \u00e9poca dorada de los FPS en plena \u00e9poca \"Quake\" con todos los ingredientes de aquellos, y mientras nuevas generaciones encontrar\u00e1n viejo y desfasado m\u00e1s de un aspecto del juego, los nost\u00e1lgicos podr\u00e1n revivir uno de los t\u00edtulos m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la \u00e9poca con todo el sabor de anta\u00f1o. Las nuevas generaciones que se atrevan a explorar estos cl\u00e1sicos tambi\u00e9n encontrar\u00e1n un t\u00edtulo de acci\u00f3n de ritmo r\u00e1pido y con especial \u00e9nfasis en la exploraci\u00f3n e incluso los plataformas, con un gran repertorio de armas y enemigos variados. Si te consigues anteponer a un apartado t\u00e9cnico que caduc\u00f3 hace muuuucho tiempo, es un gran juego que te transportar\u00e1 al pasado (en m\u00e1s de un sentido) sin necesidad de una m\u00e1quina del tiempo.\n\nSi quieres unirte a mi grupo de Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JoshCell\n\nSi quieres seguirme como mentor en Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/29569915-Josh-Cell/", "timestamp_created": 1512219672, "timestamp_updated": 1512327453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39407838": {"recommendationid": "39407838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033654560", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514399665}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate level 5 in this game.", "timestamp_created": 1516174340, "timestamp_updated": 1516174340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39454274": {"recommendationid": "39454274", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976302279", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453649144}, "language": "english", "review": "where is turok 3", "timestamp_created": 1516350836, "timestamp_updated": 1516350836, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39431424": {"recommendationid": "39431424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149100205", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 84, "last_played": 1516263043}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a classic shooter.

Turok (nombre del protagonista) fue un \u00e9xito en Nintendo 64 por su apartado t\u00e9cnico y ambientaci\u00f3n con dinosaurios. Turok proviene del mundo de los comics y quiz\u00e1 por ello el juego va directo a la acci\u00f3n y se ahorra completamente la historia.\n\nEl objetivo es abrir los 8 portales que dan acceso a los niveles y en ellos buscar las piezas de una m\u00e1quina llamada Chronoscepter, por ello la exploraci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 gran parte del juego aunque podemos revisitar los portales ya abiertos cuando queramos. Tiene un estilo muy arcade, no veremos enemigos en gran cantidad pero se regeneran si pasamos rato sin avanzar, la munici\u00f3n es escasa y nos obliga a ir cambiando de arma seg\u00fan el enemigo para ser m\u00e1s efectivos. La m\u00fasica acent\u00faa mucho el estilo arcade con melod\u00edas de r\u00edtmos r\u00e1pidos. Esta versi\u00f3n de Steam permite activar algunas opciones extra, por ejemplo el balanceo del arma mientras caminamos, un punto de mira, hacer que los impactos sean precisos, alterar la saturaci\u00f3n de colores o elegir entre varios idiomas, interesantes mejoras que no estaban en el juego original, solamente se echa en falta recargar las armas manualmente. Incluso hay un apartado especial de trucos en el men\u00fa que se activan con c\u00f3digos, desconozco donde encontrar esos c\u00f3digos pero jugando de forma normal (reuniendo muchas vidas) me han dado el de \"vidas infinitas\".\n\nSu paso al PC hace que el juego sea m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil que como fue concebido con el mando de la consola, no solamente por la facilidad para apuntar sino por tener una tecla disponible para cada arma pudiendo cambiar rapidamente entre ellas, por suerte el sistema de puntos de guardado si hace que la dificultad se mantenga. La niebla densa es una caracter\u00edstica t\u00e9cnica del juego que era la forma de hacer posible sus gr\u00e1ficos 3D en la consola, en PC es algo prescindible pero no se puede desactivar (aunque la distancia de visi\u00f3n es algo mayor que en la versi\u00f3n original), pero sobretodo gr\u00e1ficamente est\u00e1 muy desfasado, se notan los escenarios muy vac\u00edos y los enemigos demasiado simples.\n\nResumiendo, su fuerte era un apartado t\u00e9cnico que no sorprende a estas alturas y si eres aficionado al g\u00e9nero no te aportar\u00e1 nada nuevo, aunque tampoco abundan juegos con esta tem\u00e1tica y entretiene con su combinaci\u00f3n de FPS, plataformas y exploraci\u00f3n.", "timestamp_created": 1520399985, "timestamp_updated": 1520399985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568627", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40600594": {"recommendationid": "40600594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328549813", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520312164}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as I loved playing Turok on N64, I actually had more fun playing this remastered PC release.", "timestamp_created": 1520314181, "timestamp_updated": 1520314181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40580817": {"recommendationid": "40580817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019185176", "num_games_owned": 1248, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520205165}, "language": "german", "review": "Turok, ein Spiel welches viele Erinnerungen weckt.\nDamals zuerst auf dem N64 gespielt und danach folgte die (alte) PC Version.\n\nDie neue Version von Turok unterst\u00fctzt 4K und Widescreen Aufl\u00f6sungen und sieht dadurch gestochen scharf aus.\nEs l\u00e4uft butterweich und ohne jeglichen Probleme.\nEs mach Fun, so wie fr\u00fcher.", "timestamp_created": 1520235465, "timestamp_updated": 1520235465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40562703": {"recommendationid": "40562703", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997553202", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520169851}, "language": "english", "review": "Could not get it to work with my Steam controller.

His mom hadn't noticed the blood coming from Turok and the dinosaur he was strangling on the cover of the box, and he had turned off the blood in-game so she wouldn't see it. We played it for hours, and we forgot all about my Playstation 1 with a variety Disney games, and the copy of Grand Theft Auto that I had hidden inside of a Donald Duck game. \n\nIn short, we spend hours going over every nook and cranny to find every secret and outdo each other as the true dinosaur hunter. And surprisingly that's exactly what I went back to after picking up this remaster, I spend hours running through the same map trying to find keys so I can move to the next level. Not because of achievements, XP points, or skins, but because I wanted to be able to progress. That might sound tedious, but it's actually quite fun, of course there's always the internet for the ones you really can't find, something I wasn't equipped with in the '90s. Turok was a cool character and still is, and it's regretful that the series was never really revived. He doesn't say much besides screaming his name, so there's not much to talk about in that department. Later on I picked up some of the Turok comics and read some of the backstory, and apparently he's trying to stop The Campaigner from removing barrier between the lost lands and earth, so that aliens, baldheaded guys, and dinosaurs can come through.\n\nThe game is punishing as older games tend to be, but it's not impossible, and after getting back into the mindset that older game have, I was back in business. The game throws pickups at you like it's candy, probably because the console version was a lot harder to play. As the game progresses, these pickups become more necessary, and eventually the difficulty is ramped up significantly.\n\nI finished this game in under 10 hours, but I must admit that Ive used a guide to find all the keys that I couldn't find, which was about 5.

Overall my only cons are no multiplayer, so I'm not sure it's worth the 20 dollar price tag, however it's the only game of it's kind so if you can at least grab it on sale I'd highly recommend doing so.", "timestamp_created": 1518451477, "timestamp_updated": 1519016257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569790", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39990103": {"recommendationid": "39990103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054625120", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520441935}, "language": "french", "review": "Turok est un FPS \u00e0 l'ancienne, sorti \u00e0 l'origine en 1997 sur Nintendo 64.

The big bad is known as the Campaigner and he wants to get hold of the Chronoscepter, a weapon so powerful it was broken down into to 8 pieces to stop it falling into the wrong hands. It's your job as Tal'Set to collect the chronoscepter first and put a stop to the Campaigner.  You don't actually need to collect the Chronoscepter pieces but it certainly makes the last boss battle easier. The basic premise is never expanded upon and basically serves as an excuse for blasting a whole lot of enemies, but a good arsenal, some solid gunplay and the fast pace keep things moving along nicely.  I found some of the levels to be a bit too long especially the last one and the over reliance on platforming sections does begin to grate a bit by the end. Saving is done via a combination of checkpoints and save points scattered about the levels and these can be quite far apart meaning one missed platform jump can lead to having to replay a large section of the level over again. The polished up graphics hold up quite well considering this is a game that's over 20 years old and the music and sound effects are pleasing. The basic mechanics of key hunting are systematic of the title's age although i never found this to be problematic.

And, I don't just mean jumping between platforms. There's alot of platforms, and there are quite a few walls. Walls that you have to jump against until you reach the top. Oh, and you can't just mash jump. You have to time it, like you'd have to in a 3rd person platformer. Only, as I mentioned, this game is 1st person.\n\nThe jumping puzzles, especially the ones where you have to jump against a wall for 5 minutes, would be extremely easy if you could see the avatar as a reference. Without that reference, the extremely punishing \"challenge\" comes down entirely to timing when you hit a key for several minutes. It's the Stanley Parable \"Art\" ending drawn out for an entire game. \n\nAnd, falling sometimes kills you instantly. And, there's a lives system. And, maps are mazes filled with too many dead ends, hitscan enemies, and fog.\n\nTurok is not a game that I consider to be fun at all. The lack of a targeting reticle is interesting, and fighting enemies is engaging, but I had to turn \"Fly\" on in order to bypass several extremely frustrating jumping sections. I highly suggest anyone who values their time leave this \"classic\" in the dust.\n\nUnless, of course, the Stanley Parable \"Art\" ending was fun to you.

Well, Turok is just that. And it works!\n\nThe boys at Night Dive have done a fantastic job bringing this game back to life - visually, it's a 90s shooter all the way, for better or for worse. Since this was originally an N64 game, it doesn't quite have the crisp texturework of something like the Build engine games or Quake, but it still has a very appealing and coherent art-style that somehow manages to explore varied environments that never feel out of place. You have your standard jungle complete with volcanic areas, treetop villages and an alien ship final level. Sound design is very solid, the gun sounds are a bit airy but the energy weapons and the bow feel fantastic.\n\nGameplay is also quality stuff. You have your standard keyhunting and exploration of non-linear levels, only Turok takes it up a notch a la HeXen and adds a hub level. The cool thing is that each level requires three keys to unlock, and you can choose which level to play, provided you have the keys to unlock it. This means you can enter and exit levels almost at will (you have to find the exit, but once you do, you can choose another level). Fortunately, the key locations are fairly sequential meaning you won't have level 8 keys in level 2 or level 6 keys in level 3. What this does mean, however, is that resource management and picking your battles is absolutely paramount for success because A) some enemies respawn when you re-enter the level and B) you WILL be revisiting the same level a few times, especially if you want to find all the secrets. Respawning enemies can be annoying, but personally I prefer this mechanic over endless wandering in empty maps. My only complaint in terms of pacing is that the very last level does drag on just a bit too long, which given the game's length makes sense, but after all that keyhunting, the last thing you'd expect is three quite sizeable levels before the final bossfight. Also, there's a save point and checkpoint mechanic (no quicksaves), which might extend the playtime in a way that's not particularly fun, but it does add some tension to the gameplay even if it might feel a bit relentless at times.\n\nThe gunplay is also deep and engaging, the weapons are varied, satisfying and balanced well and ammo/health distribution is masterful. Again, respawning ammo would have been a good idea because if you're not careful, you'll be running around with no ammo really quickly, but this is just a testament to the fact that older games trusted the player to know what the hell they were doing. There are numerous enemy types with various attack patterns and a good mix between projectile, melee and hitscan enemies... I could go on and on, but the bottom line is, the whole thing gels like Jack and Coke and it's a blast to play.\n\nThe only thing I can really complain about is perhaps the price, at 19.99\u20ac it's a bit pricey for an old title, even with the amazing remaster, and it's not really that horribly long at that; achievements and secrets do give it some replay value, but if you're not sure if you want to pull the trigger on this one or not, try waiting for a sale, I think it's definitely worth 10\u20ac, 20\u20ac might be a stretch.\n\nIn short, this game is a fairly unique classic and should not be overlooked by FPS fans and gamers in general.

Throw your digging foxes in the water, they spend 50 turns in there and you unlock the swimming gene. Then you \"Apply\" it to a creature and you've got a 50% chance of the kids having it. There, done.\n\nIf you want to make cute creatures you're kinda limited too. They all end up looking like an eevee evolution. When I played it actually felt harder to breed green eyes than it did claws, so good luck if you're picky. \n\nSo nobody is happy.

It just doesn't live up to its potential. \n\nThe basic idea of adding genetic manipulation to survival is sound, since now one has a reason to mate specific critters. While that is as entertaining as expected when learning the game, once one is able ro establish the titular niche to survive and prosper in, simple math shows the hopelessness of the situation. Like in real life, when a population is too small, genetic doom is guaranteed. Inbreeding causes sickness, and that is great in theory, but is invariably watching your little tribe rot down the drain fun? \n\nOf course, the devs know that, too, so their solution is that from time to time a breedable stranger pops up out of thin air. Looks more like a workaround in absence of a solution, and it poses three integral problems. First, since the stranger is random, there is no guarantee that he or she has the genetic markers to provide healthy offsprings. Second, if the stranger has the necessary markers, now one has to deal with the fact that they have all the genetic defects one just took four generations to hopefully breed out of the tribe. In effect, one is almost guaranteed to lose all the genetic progress in the new offspring. This is a bad flaw, because there is a giant difference between grinding in order to accumulate microscopic advantages and rolling the same big stone up the same big hill time and again. Look at it this way. If a game makes you ask for grinding, it's not possible that the design comes together. Third, since the first two problems are necessary to cope with, what should be pure fun factor, like eye or fur color, is as wasted as the expansive list of purposeful defects. This cannot change with player experience or game progression, because the rhythm of four generations does not change with unlocking traits. \n\nAs a result, when genetics are without consequence in longterm planning, breeding deteriorates to a mere here-and-now attempt to avoid defects. Or in other words, take \"genetic\" out of \"genetic survival\", and all you get is survival. What a shame..\n\nGraphics. The latest iteration of graphics in the game is solid work. Even the purposefully ugly strangers  and their seemingly unavoidably ugly offsprings are totally cute. Where the game falls seriously short is marks. The first time I got infected by a swamp, surprise, surprise, I get it. However, why my ancestral knowledge tells me on one hand, that a hidden creature smells of danger, but on the other hand even my own experience leaves my senses completely impervious to environmental hazatds, is beyond me. It's a survival game? Exactly my point. Niche is nothing more than a survival game.\n\nAlso, is there a good explanation why I hover the mouse over a potential mate and the mating icon doesn't have a yellow or red ring for simple immunity incompatibility? Isn't it bad enough that the info ruins the gameplay? Do I really have to click around to get it?\n\nMap design. While all by its lonesome the map design looks perfectly fine, it is completely ruined by how the game handles sickness. Ok, surprise, surprise, my tribe gets wiped out by the common cold. That happens exactly twice, the first and the last time. From now on, an infected toon is instantly isolated and in case of environmental causes, the infecting environment is off limits. In other words, once having lost a tribe to Ebola camouflaged as the common sniffles, all the random map design does for a player is creating variously large patches of dead space. That starts to sound worse, when you figure out, that three quarters of your island are dead space. Sure, I can just use that one quarter, but shouldn't be the very idea of a genetic game to develop reliable environmental adaptation, that doesn't evaporate every time I am forced by design to hump the most defect-riddled of the species? Is it really necessary to club the devs over the head with the hint that it may make perfect sense to give those annoying strangers dominant location-specific adaptations, since they actually LIVE in the location? I mean, given the fact that I cannot develop the adaptations myself?!? Apparently so. Despite wasting at least one of the two mutation choices on cold resistance on every creature I remember, I never once had an infected next to a healthy without passing on the death sentence. And while we are at it, having at one point an entire tribe of fishers, in nine hours on more than a dozen of maps I was not offered a single fish to catch. Not once. All that ability rewarded me with was three drowned. So, yeah, the map design is fantastic, just not for this game.\n\nTutorial. Yeah, I get it. Tutorials are for losers. Then again, in danger of being flamed by the usual trolls, wouldn't it make sense to make a tutorial, which isn't a waste of time? On which planet do I have to be born to need to actually click on a tile in order to comprehend how to move a toon? And enriched by this newly-found quantum leap of insight, now have to actually click on a bush, in order to comprehend food gathering? This game ails of two bad basic flaws the tutorial does buttkus to alleviate. First, mistake (avoidable, unavoidable, or most annoyingly, randomly punishing) means death (early or instant). Second, hidden contents is dead contents. About the first, I hope, I have used enough words by now in order not to have to repeat why it's a tragedy that the game insists on being nothing more than a mere survival game. As for the second, sure , I can find out by coincidence, that vicinity of packmates raises a newborn's comfort state. Then again, how much of a coincidence is necessary for this to happen? Let's see. Fact 1, my offsprings ignore my constant attempts of steeling them against the common cold. Fact 2, they frequently catch it upon birth in sunny grassland (invariably costing me the mother, who just transformed in the blink of an eye from my best chance of survival to yet anothrer dead end of my fruitless monkeying with genetics). Consequently, the game teaches me the hard way, never ever to have another packmate next to a birth nest. So how did I find out? One of those black thingies popped out of thin air into the middle of my well-manicured stomping grounds, making it necessary to throw everything at it but the kitchen's sink. Good news, I thwarted its evil master plan despite utlizing Critter Beam Technology (TM) - and pulling my tribe into an otherwise suicidal huddle, the baby got cozy. So, now that I learned something, let's be adventurous and actually apply the knowledge. Let's swarm a birth nest in preparation of comfort. Or not. Are you willing to bet the life of your tribe on the chance that the devs DIDN'T leave a rest probability of the little bugger catching a cold no matter what you do? I mean, given the fact that survival games aren't supposed to be fair and similar hogwash?\n\nYeah, I am aware of the fact that the lack of information is not worse than in pretty much every other indy title, but this game has changed from its beginnings. It is almost guaranteed that what little info one can find online is humbug. And sure it is possible to repeat the mistakes of the past and simply add a database. Which means counting on the fact that people know what question to ask AND counting on the fact that they are still reading after two screens of painful explanations, how to move a critter. Here's a better plan for the devs. Read The Sims' approach of concept teaching. Copy it, if you cannot do better. Unlock new concept tutorials via gameplay. Update outdated concept tutorials via in-game alert. If this is too much to ask, just do something, because virtually everything is better than having a \"Help\" button linked to a forum.\n\nIn summation, Niche works hard on being nothing more than a run-off-the-mill survival game.

Weirdly I do not recall ever actually buying it; it would seem to have mysteriously appeared in my Steam library one day. A little while ago I noticed it has finally left Early Access so I thought it would be the perfect time to evolve myself a species of sapient underwater critters of some description. So without even a single look at the Store page or anything else about the game I leap into Niche, expecting a game of great freedom and great change over a long period of time.\n\nThus began the story of Adam, a fox-cat-thing carried off from their tribe by a giant bird as a toddler who grows up on an isolated island with no social contact of any kind, who literally \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s the first \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 he sees and sends all his children to drown in the ocean so he can research the \"swim\" gene, and then dies old age ten minutes later.\n\nIs it my imagination or is something about that scenario pretty messed up?\n\nThis game is bad. If I had done literally any research on this game I would never have purchased it for myself. For a game about genetics there is not a lot of evolution going on here; you are always playing a subspecies of some kind of fox-cat-thing who can all interbreed with each other and every random creature they encounter. Rather than slow changes over time that can be controlled through careful breeding, there are a small handful of very specific genes. You cannot afford to breed carefully because everything in this universe wants to kill you and the lifespan of your foxcats is pathetic. The game has a story mode which doubles as a tutorial, but the story and the tutorial are both pathetic and forget to mention some extremely basic concepts. I understand the basics of genetics and selective breeding and as simplified and shallow as the system is I still could not figure out how it was supposed to work -- except insofar that genes can be unlocked by sending foxcats to die in stupid ways.\n\nI would be less down on this game if it were turn-based. The game [i]looks[/i] turn-based at first glance, with every foxcat getting three actions per turn (less if they're not an adult). But everything else doesn't get a turn; instead they all get actions whenever you take one. So if your foxcat who has managed to mutate the Swim Body (yes, the entire form of your foxcat's body is determined by a single \"body\" gene) who you were hoping to breed with the Swim Tail foxcat happens to be attacked by a predator, they'll be dead by the time you move any tribesmates over to assist. This whole game is littered with bad design decisions. It doesn't just play like \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, it even [i]looks[/i] like \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.\n\nI can't believe I'm saying this, but even Spore did evolution better.", "timestamp_created": 1519738990, "timestamp_updated": 1519743334, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586269", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40436524": {"recommendationid": "40436524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063511538", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519845592}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Does that make it a bad game? Hell no!\n\nSo what is Niche anyway? Niche is a game in which you manage a bunch of creatures. These creatures all have a a full set of \"alleles\". When they breed, they pass on one allele per gene. Depending on the alleles the child gets, they may have properties that neither parent has, simply because they are homozygote for some recessive allele or another. Or because they mutated.\n\nSo what's the goal? The goal is to use intelligent selection (which is different from natural selection) to breed your creatures in such a way that beneficial alleles for a given biome grow more common. For example, creatures that have mutated fins are better suited for biomes with lots of water, so you'll want to breed these creatures to attempt to amplify the allele. However, if a creature has fins in a desert, you'll typically want to avoid breeding with it. Beyond that, it's simply a game about surviving and getting at least a few of your creatures to the next island.\n\nIs this game flawless? Nope, not at all. But does it need to be? I don't think so. It just needs to be good. On top of that, it's an excellent way to teach people the basics of heridity. Evolution, not so much. That has to do with the fact that this game allows the player to choose who breeds with who.

Everything about this game screams something I would absolutely love and play endlessly, but the more I play it, the more I don't see this happening.\n\n1. The game sorely needs a better UI that shows you your creatures' genes/sex/age/health at a glance. Currently, you have to click on each animal one by one, which becomes ridiculous as you breed more and more offspring to complete whatever genetic objectives you've set out for yourself. Every animal has a pair of immunity genes selected from a list of A through K, and having two of the same lettered gene gives an animal an incurable contagious sickness. This is to simulate the risks inherent to inbreeding, but also means that even unrelated animals can produce a sick child if you're not paying attention to their genes. When you're checking 15 or more adults every turn, on top of gathering food and navigating the map, not having at-a-glance information is frustrating.\n\n2. If you have not reviewed this game on Steam, you will get an app-like popup on the menu every time you launch the game begging you to review the game. I'm sure the devs are very nice people, but they can fuck right off with that bullshit.\n\n3. Maps are very feast or famine - you either land on an unforgivable island that is a struggle to survive on with constant sickness/parasites/predators or you get one that's almost boringly simple to colonize. There's no real in between, and a boring map never becomes challenging as time progresses.\n\n4. The tutorial only explains so much. For example, you have limited control over gene mutations in your creatures, but the tutorial doesn't touch on this at all. The menu tells you that you can mutate two genes but gives you such little information that it's unclear as to whether you're selecting existing genes on the animal you would like to mutate into something else or whether you are selecting genes you would like to see mutated to in the animal's offspring.\n\nTL, DR; it takes more than the 2 hours allowed for Steam returns for this game's problems to become entirely evident. I do wish I could get a refund. I'm a bit puzzled as to how this game is rated so positively, but I did really want to love this thing in the way I loved the games it was supposedly inspired by.

If you like genetics, cute animals, and strategy games, this game is for you.\n\nIt takes a while to really get the hang of it. The gameplay is relatively simple turn-based strategy akin to games like Civilization, and for some people it might feel repetitive. But for me, the challenge and repetition is why I enjoy it; it's very meditative. This is definitely not a game where you can sit back and let things run themselves: Niche puts you in the role of selection, and the traits that pass on to the next generations are determined by your choices. You control each animal, and it's up to you to move them around and place them as you see fit. If you let any slip from your attention, it could prove fatal to the pack.\n\nI would definitely recommend Niche to anyone who enjoys genetics and/or turn-based survival/strategy games. The graphics are lovely and charming, and the game runs very smoothly with almost no bugs.\n\nTo the developers, there are a few things I would love to see in future updates or expansions. Here are my suggestions:\n\n- More goals or specific scenarios to complete. A 'scenario' mode that starts you off with certain conditions would be great, in addition to plain sandbox or story mode.\n- A gallery of generations, where you can see all the animals you've bred over time. The family tree cuts off after a few generations which is really too bad.

But, I was hopeful. I opened it again this week because it still called to me despite its unrefined condition. Wow! It still is not nearly on par with any game you'd pay $40 for, but it looks and feels much better than I expected here in version 1.0.4! The camera is a bit of a pain if you don't like using keyboard shortcuts (can I get the screen to scroll when I move my mouse to that side of the screen?) but it's a beautiful and ten times less overwhelming middle ground between what Spore could have been, and Civilizations.\n\nPros: turn-by-turn lets you come and go and take as long as you want to strategize. You get a sense of fulfillment for curating and loving and protecting a little tribe through all the generations. It is fulfilling to the analytical mind: to those that thought about going for a degree in law, then decided you'd rather do something that didn't have real consequences so you browse /r/legaladvice and totally judge people who make bad decisions and tell them how they should fix it, all the while wiping your brow in relief that you're not in their sticky situation nor are legally culpable for any trouble they get in for listening to your half baked advice. Then, you load up steam and play this game, so happy you can have kids after kids without having to worry about everyone you ever meet telling you how you're parenting wrong and totally judging you, man.\n\nCons and suggestions to make even better: I personally felt a tad overwhelmed when trying to choose which of my pack I'd travel to the next island with each time. In part this was resolved when, through some trial and error that actually resulted in some fun inadvertent genetic bottlenecking, I figured out that the \"pad\" (going on memory, might be called something else) that everyone must be on is the flowery spots around the traveling rock, not JUST the spots directly next to that rock - and that water spots next to the rock don't count, either. Anyway, my suggestion would be that maybe in the tutorial you can only see a handful of the genetic traits (even if all of them are in play), so that when you're trying to decide whether to bring Romeo or Mercutio with you, you're not clicking back and fourth between their two genetic profiles for five minutes trying to decide if you value 6 fertility and a recessive swimming tail over a 5 fertility and an ability to crack nuts, and you really want to make sure that you're bringing the one with the most optimal traits for your preferences/plans/goals with you! \n\nIf you're still reading this... you'll probably like the game. Just get it. I mean c'mon didn't you see that quirky trailer video that was not, like, the best thing ever but there's definitely something about it that's very charming, and who knows maybe it'll grow up to be that nerdy ugly duckling kid that turns out, just, the -epitome- of attractive, and humble to boot which none of the kids that were so hot and popular in high school will probably ever attain for the exact reason that they didn't go through that awkward phase (holy run on sentence, batman!): that's also how I'd describe this game.

It's one I've wanted since I saw the very early stages of development. It's really reminicant of early genetic based PS1 games and PC games like Petz, only it's got more of a survival aspect. I enjoy trying to get my animals to have certain genes through breeding- but I had to look up explinations on the DNA user interfaces because the game itself never explains it in full. The tutorial is very lacking. For exampe when I first began I added two mutations to an animal thinking I could change them later, turns out once chosen you can't change them. Thats because the tutorial never explains that function at all, it's really just watered down to something like \"you can give them different genetics through selective breeding\" which is pretty vauge. It also doesn't tell you which genes are recessive or dominant, just which genes are currently active and which are not active (active is highlighted and dim is not- not an indicator of ressive or dom as far as I can tell). \n\nMy other main gripe is that I started the story mode- and have yet to see any actual story since begining. You see the cutscene when it starts... and that's it. I've been playing 6 hours, and nothing else interesting has happened. A bird randomly showed up without warning and ate one of my kids a few hours in and I got an achivement \"Adam's Curse,\" which I GUESS is kinda story? But not very much. To be clear, I am not on the first island, I've travelled at least 6-7 times now and still nothing really new. Grasslands and swamps. I haven't even seen a hot or cold biome yet, so I'm assuming those are rare?\n\nThe game is fun as a basic survival/strategy game and if you're like me and adore genetic based games. The genetic system is proably one of my fav features, even if I don't fully understand it. Seeing all the outcomes of selective breeding is really fun. If you don't like repeatativeness, be warned. There are bits and pieces to keep it fresh, but you will be doing a lot of the same thing over and over again.\n\nI'm going to keep playing cause 6 hours in and I still personally find it entertaining, but I can't stress enough how much I hope there is some actual story soon.

While the trailer makes it look fun, and the live streamers make it look fun, this game is so incredibly boring and seems pointless. The UI is among the worst I have ever used, and doesn't give you tool tips or any useful information. Gameplay is similar to playing checkers combined with playing poker for pretzels in both excitement and depth.\n\nIf you like watching paint dry or watching the grass grow in winter, pick this game up. Maybe you had too much coffee, and need some assistance getting to sleep. This game will remedy that. If you think shoots and ladders or candyland are the most intense strategy games you can handle, dive right in.\n\nSeriously. This game is as exciting as watching old people fornicate.\n\n***added due to fan boy comments***\n\nPerspective buyers should also be aware that you will be insulted and nit picked on by fans of this game for saying you don't like this game.\n\nPeople that respond to a game in a negative fashion has a right to express their disatisfaction, especially on steam because a great majority of reviews are not informative at all.\n\nOne suggestion I got was to play on a harder difficulty so it wouldn't be as boring before I complained. Making the game more or less difficult has nothing to do with the fact it's still boring no matter what.\n\nI also do not request refunds as someone else suggested before I wrote a negative review.  Clear evidence of fan boy attitude because then I could not write a veview as a warning to other people not to waste their money on this.\n\nPeople are sometimes most offended by the truth, and don't like it when they hear it.

The graphic style of it is very unique and colorful, and it gives you a vibe of happy and cheerful game, which I think fits this very well. But, of course you can change that. You can make a tribe full of gothic-like creatures, that live in the swamp. You can make a tribe where everyone lives in the water. You can basically do anything. You can shape your story however you like.\nThese are just a few examples of how many options there are.\nThere is no goal in this game, only to survive. You can do many challenges in this game, which makes it even more interesting. Talking about challenges, the game is not going to be easy all way.  Sometimes it can get hard trying to unlock the genes, to make a specific tribe, but thats part of th fun! There are also rouge males, predators, nicheling-eating plant, you need to keep an eye on, and many more obstacles. And then of course there are genes. Probably the most important part of all. \nNow, I have a few cons about this game. First, sometimes it can get repetetive. When you have raised species you wanted, and they are healthy, there is not much to do then. I tried unlocking all genes, exploring, raising a new species....it still makes it broing after time.\nSecond, when a female is pregnant, you can put her onto a nest, and she will give birth over night, just like that. When she gives birth, she can just go away from the baby and breed again or do something else. I know not many games are realistic, but when I first played the full release version, I hoped they would make the mom stay with her baby and maybe somehow feed it with milk, as a maternity instinct to protect it, and care for it.\nThird and final con is that you cant see the whole family tree. When you move to the next island, there are only the creatures that you brought to the next island, and their parents/kids. It is then very hard to remember who had who, if he \nis related to her, especially for story-tellers like me.\nThats all I have to say. Overall, the game is beatyfuly made, and it lags very rarely, I dont see any bugs at all.\nI sure recommend you to try it you. :)", "timestamp_created": 1515076747, "timestamp_updated": 1515076747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39049628": {"recommendationid": "39049628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081748521", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481378390}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game if you are into genetics and survival.

First off, as far as I've seen, there are almost no bugs and the game has never crashed for me. It's also very rarely laggy.\nThe graphics are clean, simple, and colorful, which is a plus, but sometimes they're too simple. Like another review I read, I believe adding small animations to the nichelings would be endearing, whether they're idle animations or even just paw movements when actions are done.\nYou start off with five empty save slots that you can create worlds in. There are two modes, Story and Sandbox, with Story mode having more of a preset endgame goal and Sandbox being for more experienced players to make their own goals, while they can choose their own islands.\nIf you've never played before, definitely start off in story because sandbox doesn't have a tutorial. While Story does have one, it's rather lacking and I'd recommend reading the community guides to help you out because the game has many unexplained aspects. The tutorial is getting an update, though.\nYou start off with 1/2 nichelings, depending on your mode. In Story, the main goal they give you is to reach the main character (Adam)'s home island and meet the other nichelings that live there, his family. Once again, for a better explanatioin look for a community guide. In Sandbox people create their own goals- there are many challenges you can make and give yourself, along with trying to obtain certain genes. Genes are one of the defining factors of Niche, with a wide selection that can give you completely different nichelings if you carry the right genetics. However, the genes and breeding are not explained very well so if you don't understand it, find a community guide.\nThe game itself is not packed with action or tension. There is combat against predators, but it's mostly swiping against the enemy, breeding for higher strength, and then swiping again. Some are way tougher than others, but the combat process is the same. Don't buy the game if you're expecting a fast-paced combat simulator.\nIt can also be rather bland at times, and repetitive, but there are many biomes and islands to explore and every new world is different.\nHowever, the game has high potential for storytelling, and is like it states: a genetics survival game. You collect food, breed, and fight to survive, all the while trying to breed out bad genes and keep the good, helpful genes. There are a wide  variety of nichelings possible, and you can tell stories and give each nicheling their own character and personality. Want your leader to be strict, cruel, and harsh? You can have them banish the rogue children, or even feed them to the birds. Want an ultimate fighter with genes of a predator? Go ahead, but it'll take quite some time. It all pays off when you see that 12 strength, though (haha). Over half the genes are locked when you start off, but there are different ways to unlock them all and different islands you have to explore. There's a whole system of dominant/recessive and each gene benefits/harms your nicheling's chance of survival.\nThere are also many things that can harm your tribe- freezing, overheating, starvation, predators, and leeches are only a few. A part of the game is based on luck, since you could begin the game and run into a predator immediately, while others might find a whole bunch of healthy wanderers with great genes. You can't always be sure what's going to happen, especially when moving from island to island, wihch is another reason I love the game.\nThe cores and basics of the game are very solid, however there are many small things that could be added that would improve a player's experience. The in-game messages don't tell you much- for example, some genes simply say \"Travel to new islands\" to unlock them, which can be confusing.  \n\nHope the review explained enough for you to form a basic opinion on the game, but you'll understand it much better if you play it! Overall, it's a definite recommend, and you should get the game if it's within your price range, and you think you'd be interested in it.", "timestamp_created": 1514871254, "timestamp_updated": 1515022414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794630", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38955960": {"recommendationid": "38955960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450189757", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514945775}, "language": "english", "review": "i like this game a lot its tons of fun but kind of hard at the same time\n", "timestamp_created": 1514852767, "timestamp_updated": 1514852767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38949423": {"recommendationid": "38949423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037623547", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519177594}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a bad game but it has a little less to offer than a 18 dollar price tag would suggest. I was not suprised to learn it was Kickstarted and made by a small team. I think they did well with their means.\n\nThe gameplay feels more like a board game than a simulation, with action points, hex-grid movement, and sightlines. Reproduction is key as the longest lived animal only lasts 2 dozen turns, which naturally introduces the dilemma of who do you breed? Which traits do you want? Which don\u2019t you want? Do you want to risk the chance of inbreeding to propagate a good trait? Do you cast out those with bad traits you want to weed out? The system is natural and intuitive and is even better that it well mimics the natural processes it\u2019s based on. \n\nOverall however, I feel this game could have used more effort put into it, not that I\u2019m saying that that they didn\u2019t put in enough. What is there is clearly put into the most important areas. The creatures are adorable and diverse, the genetics system is extensive and well designed. Those two things are the most important parts of the game and are well done. \n\nMy biggest problems with the game are the simplistic graphics, the lack of animations, and the clunky user interface. \n\nI really expected more based upon the screen shots and the price tag but most of the environments felt bland, uniform, and tame from a graphical perspective. I got used to it but it was still a bit jarring. I\u2019m not expecting physics and total realism, but a little more detail would have gone a long way towards making me feel like I\u2019m exploring a wild and uncharted archipelago. \n\nThe animals lack nearly all animation which makes them feel more like board game pieces than animals, which is a real missed opportunity to further endear these cute animals to the player.\n\nThe interface was another missed opportunity which would truly benefit from some extra spit and polish. I found myself misclicking during actions in attempt to unselect or select different creatures but it wasn\u2019t terrible. The notifications were not as helpful as they could be and should have taken a page from other games. Mousing over them should display their text and each\u2019s text should have (where appropriate) the name of the creature, cause of death, damage values, etc, instead of showing a generic \u2018a creature has died\u2019 message. Clicking it should center on the area of interest and/or highlight the area/individual instead of opening a pop-up which must then be clicked.\n\nAlso with the interface, the thing I wanted the most was help managing my creatures\u2019 genetics. While I like how the family tree graph and gene layout is displayed I want more. It is easy to forget who is related to who, who has too similar genes, which pups I wanted to \u2018betroth\u2019, which animals have and haven\u2019t been bread. Since they have such short life spans it\u2019s a lot of work to keep everything organized. I\u2019d kill to be able to look and see [b]\u201cOh this new guy I can recruit has unique immunity genes which would be great for our genetic diversity! Get him!\u201d[/b] or [b]\u201cUgh, this guy has the same stuff as everyone else and no cool traits, shoo!\u201d[/b] without having to write down his letters and compare them against all the other animals I have individually. Being able to tell who was male and female at a glance would have made mating a lot easier. At the very least a risk indicator of inbreeding chance before mating would help. If there is one aspect of the game to improve (in my opinion) it would be this. It would make things so much more enjoyable.\n\nAll that being said while I hope they update the game to make it better I would totally buy a $10 or more expansion that remedies these issues. This game has all it\u2019s core mechanics nailed down and would really shine with more TLC with improvements and elaborations.", "timestamp_created": 1514838571, "timestamp_updated": 1515009987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612990", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38946154": {"recommendationid": "38946154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408168532", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517936464}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been bumbling around on this game for the past few days, and I have to say, it's pretty darn cool.

Allerdings gibt es eine Menge, das ich daran zu bem\u00e4ngeln habe, weshalb ich lieber Punkte vergeben h\u00e4tte, als eine klare Empfehlung.\n\nDie Kritikpunkte beziehen sich vor Allem auf die mangelnden Einstellungsm\u00f6glichkeiten. Man kann entweder Story oder Sandbox spielen, wobei man sich bei Sandbox offenbar nur aussuchen kann auf welcher Insel man startet. Es gibt also 2 grundlegende Spielmodi: Einfach (Story) und Schwer (Sandbox).\nDie Story ist nur deshalb einfacher, weil das Startpaar durchaus schon ein paar n\u00fctliche F\u00e4higkeiten hat, die einen eine Weile \u00fcberleben lassen, wobei Evas Gene vollkommen willk\u00fcrlich sind und man, wenn sie einem nicht gefallen, im Grunde noch mal anfangen kann, bis man eine Eva mit guten Genen bekommt.\n\nWas ich schade finde ist, dass man sich bei der Sandbox nicht auch die Gene des Startpaares aussuchen kann.\nIch vermisse irgendwie auch einen gesamt Stammbaum, nicht nur von aktuell \"enthaltenen\" Tieren oder einer Anzeige wie lange man denn jetzt schon \u00fcberlebt hat.\nAuch der Tageswechsel \u00fcberst\u00fcrzt leider v\u00f6llig. Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass es l\u00e4ngere Spieler nerven w\u00fcrde, aber ich f\u00e4nde ein Popup ob man den Tag denn wirklich beenden m\u00f6chte wahnsinnig hilfreich, erst recht wenn noch Tierchen Z\u00fcge \u00fcbrig haben. Leider schon mehr als ein mal ist es mir passiert, dass ich versehentlich auf \"Tag beenden\" geklickt habe statt die Sicht umzustellen, was ich eigentlich vor hatte. Bisher hatte ich lediglich Gl\u00fcck, dass ich dann noch immer genug Futter hatte. Auch hab ich wegen eines unfreiwilligen Fingerzuckens schon mal einen Doppelklick auf den \"Tag beenden\" gemacht und es sind tats\u00e4chlich 2 Tage umgegangen!! Vielleicht bin ich beim Klicken manchmal etwas hastig, denn eigentlich hat man keine Eile, aber nerven tut es mich schon.\nMan kann zwar die Kamera wie gew\u00fcnscht bewegen, aber manchmal verstecken sich einzelne Jungtiere dann doch hinter irgendwelchen H\u00fcgeln oder man l\u00e4sst sie versehentlich ins Wasser laufen, weil man nicht richtig gesehen hat auf welches Feld sich die Pfotenabdr\u00fccke bezogen haben.\n\nAllgemein vermisse ich vor Allem eine \"R\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig\" funktion. Nicht nur wegen der versehentlich verschwendeten Tage, auch laufen sich manchmal auf die falschen Felder, weil da so viel los ist, dass man die falschen Tatzen sieht, oder andere Buttens im Weg sind. So haben auch schon manche Weobchen dummerweise das Nest auf dem sie sa\u00dfen wieder abgebaut anstatt das Gras des nachberfeldes zu m\u00e4hen.\n\nAuch, dass man nicht zwischenspeichern oder einen Spielstand kopieren kann, finde ich \u00e4u\u00dferst schade. Wenn man durch ne Menge Pech eine tolle Kolonie in den Sand gesetzt hat, ist das einfach sehr frustrierend. Auch zu sehen wie sich eine tolle Kolonie in einem kopierten Spielstand verschiedene Richtungen entwickeln kann, w\u00e4re toll zu entdecken gewesen.\n\nKlar, das sind alles Dinge, die das Spiel gewisserma\u00dfen \"einfacher\" machen w\u00fcrden, aber Ich finde das Spiel in der Hinsicht einfach etwas unausgereift. Es gibt eine Menge, dass man an Funktionen besser machen k\u00f6nnte ohne an der Spielmechanik irgendwas zu \u00e4ndern, nur um dem Spieler selbst mehr Entscheidung zu lassen, wie schwer man es haben m\u00f6chte. So h\u00e4tten auch eher Menschen mit einem sehr niedrigen Frustrationslevel (wie ich) mehr Spa\u00df an den Spiel.\n\nFazit: Ich gebe eine Spielempfehlung, weil es mir durchaus bisher spa\u00df gemacht habe, auch wenn ich sehr vieles vermisse, was an Einstellungen (nicht an der Spielmechanik) h\u00e4tte besser gemacht werden k\u00f6nnen.\nDie Tiere sind niedlich und das Z\u00fcchten mit R\u00fccksicht auf die Gene ist sehr interessant, aber ich w\u00fcrde mir wirklich w\u00fcnschen, dass es mehr Funktionen gibt.", "timestamp_created": 1514552963, "timestamp_updated": 1514552963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38797803": {"recommendationid": "38797803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280600615", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515879710}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful!

I played around version 0.1.5, and the game has improved in some ways since then -- but it also has gotten a LOT more complicated. I'm going to attempt to tackle each issue with thought and give credit where it is due. Thank you for taking the time to read this.\n\nFirst thing's first, back in 0.1.5, for those who did not play back then, I'll simplify it for you. Back in the day, each action consumed your \"berries\" or \"food source.\" It was extremely tedious work, and I'm very glad that the development team found a way around this -- so now your food source is diminished by how many pack members you have each day that passes. Not only is this more logical when it comes to how often food is consumed by animals in real life, it makes surviving a bit more enjoyable when it comes to collecting food.\n\nHowever, the new user interface ( UI ) has gotten much more complex. Where you could once easily check your nichelings dominant and recessive genes, it has now become an entangled mess. While I get why they wanted to make it look more appealing with a DNA strand design, it is very confusing to the eye. I liked having one column for dominant genes, and yet another for recessive. For new players, some may be unable to identify what is even recessive, and what is dominant when it comes to their nichelings genetics.\n\nAs for the new genes, I am very excited and in-love with all of them. I think maybe there should be a help guide to explain a bit more in-depth about the genes, as it is difficult to look at a giant board of them. When chosing what genetics you'd like to have in place for breeding, it is very confusing to look at. They should atleast be divided into seperate locations such as -- mutations for ears, mutations for color, mutations for the body shape, etc. etc.\n\nEvenstill, there are lots more that the game could improve on -- but those were the main topics. I really do love this game with its adorable design, unique play-style, and much more. I'm glad that they've tried to make genetics into a fun topic to enjoy and indulge in, but until some of these changes are made -- I, personally, am still going to struggle with liking the game as a whole.\n\nThanks yet again for reading! ~Shalefoot", "timestamp_created": 1514500493, "timestamp_updated": 1514500493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38786021": {"recommendationid": "38786021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198795623975", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 247, "last_played": 1521134144}, "language": "english", "review": "I love everything about this game.

It's slow paced sometimes and may be tedious, but its a good game.\nThe goal is to survive in an unforgiving wilderness, with only your wits and whatever Nichelings you find, but how?\nIn Niche, you can mold and bend your little creature's genetic material to an extent, though it doesn't give you complete freedom. Each Nicheling is different in one way or another, whether its physical capability or appearance.\nBreeding combines the genetics of the parents, sometimes you may just end up with a clone of a parent.\nOver a hundreds of different combinations allows for breeding to be a wildcard. With certain match ups, you could breed complete trash, or a force to reckon with.\nYou also have to worry about feeding this niche of creatures. Each consumes 1 food per day, which is not as bad as back in the earlier versions. Foods sources you can use are berry bushes, trees (nuts,) fish, AI critters that can stumble upon your pack, and more!\n\nWith careful managing, your niche can thrive. Just watch out for those Rogue Males, who'll seek any females of your pack and mate with them. As you progress, you may start getting bored of your island, or you've cleared it off. When you do, you can send 7-8 Nichelings to the next island, who knows where you'll end up. Theres the forbidding jungle, where apes of different senses can wipe out the weakest of the pack. Large, predatory carnivores that are more of a nuisance than a real predator sometimes. Then theres the mountains, an unwelcoming place with dangerous creatures, and not much food to go with it too.\n\nNiche is visually appealing, with nice graphics to go along with the great gameplay. The music is lovely too, and I have no complaints here.\n\nOverral, Niche can be difficult, or easy, depending on how you'd like to play it.

I've had times where I just get screwed by RNG and that's where the fun is. You'll get rogue males impregnating your best girl with the inferior derp nose and deformed paw. (In my opinion the devs should introduce more bad traits. Cause Derp nose has the same stats as short nose, and it also makes the ears not match in size, or the eyes. This kind of breaks my immersion cause the ears will look the same no matter what.) Also (I forget the name) so I'm just gonna call them werebears. Will come out of no where forcing you to make a decision of throwing all your aminals at it or suffering a huge hit to the colony. I doubt this is a challenge later on in the game as when I surround it I can usually kill it quite easily. This is a foundation for a game, there just needs to be more variety. I wanna fuck a werebear. I also came across a mechanic where certain berry plants have toxic elements that can just wipe your colony.

If you have a large clan, pack , tribe or whatever, you spend most of your turn collecting food. The exploration isn't too exciting either as you come across the same types of landscape all the time.\n\n2:Gameplay(2/5)\nAs mentioned  in the Genre-Section, this game consists mostly of collecting food. And because you spend most of the time doing that, you may lose track of your animals and what you wanted to do with them. \nThe most fun part is of course the procreation and trying to create a healthy and good looking pack , but in order to do so, you have to create very many other animals, who then just stand in the way or use up all your foodsupplies. And maybe I'm just unlucky, but i always have the problem that i have 10 females and 1 male in a pack, or the other way around, and you are scared all the time of your last male or female dying.\nThey have tried to improve the information-section on genes and inheritance, but i think something could be done to make finding good pairings more simple, i.e. being able to filter the family tree.\nA point that looks really interesting when reading the game description are the biomes, but there is not a very strong connection yet between biomes and animals and how a different space changes the appearance of the animals.\n\n3:Story(1/5)\nRecently they have added a \"Storymode\" which is a very missleading name, because all it is so far is an inadequate tutorial and a \"mission\" given at the beginning of the game.\n\n4:Playtime(3/5)\nIt is possible to play this game for 20+ hours maybe, which is an ok time for the price, but while and after playing it, i would consider it more like a time-wasting activity.\n\n5:Graphics&Sound (3/5)\nNothing special or memorable concerning sound, but the graphics in general are quite nice and fitting for the game, and it is possible to make pretty nice creatures, the world around could use some work on the uniqueness-factor.\n\nOverall: (2,2/5)\nI am sorry that I don't know what is missing in the game, but something is missing to make it truly fun.\n\nWhat I have to add to the review, though is : I really love the detail they put into the DNA and how the different genes are passed on. That is a nice treat for people who like biology and being able to use what they have learned in school.", "timestamp_created": 1513345969, "timestamp_updated": 1513345969, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38322871": {"recommendationid": "38322871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300106103", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517677937}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Ele n roda bem, e fecha do nada D<\n", "timestamp_created": 1513340132, "timestamp_updated": 1513340132, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38289781": {"recommendationid": "38289781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320491092", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513317251}, "language": "english", "review": "Really engaging and fun from what I have played so far.

Something that I would like to add as far as game mechanics would be an alert system that notifies the player if an enemy comes within hearing distance of a predator. I feel like as an animal one would hear enemies nearby especially if that certain breed has amazing hearing capability. And as a player it's a little inconvenient and time consuming in the smallest way to have to toggle the hearing function every turn. Also, this might be a long shot but a function where we could select to not have our animals die out due to old age (hunger would be different.) I know that is kind of backwards as far as the learning curve of how animals are born and then die, but this way we could have some fun really restricting the species we want to create and be able to build defenses via our animals and create kingdoms of our best species creations. I would also really like to be able to look at my entire family tree, not just the bloodlines that still exist. These are my own thoughts. I just want to throw them out there because I really want to like this game more than I do. The automatic hearing is huge for me. I hate getting ransacked because my animals can't hear on their own.

This is an odd one - I've got a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game, but ultimately I keep coming back to it. Why? Well, to explain that, I've gotta tell you a little story.\n\nIt starts out innocent enough. You've got your little fledgling tribe living happily on a paradise island: plenty of food, minimal predators, temperate climate. You could keep your tribe there forever and never have a problem.\n\nBut the young ones start getting restless. They see other islands on the horizon, and are itching to explore them.\n\nSo a few of them just set off one day. They end up somewhere new, with new dangers and new challenges. Odds are, they're not prepared for it. Food supplies run low. The predators close in. Some of your tribe die, and the others are weak and desperate.\n\nThere's food on this island, but it's hard to get; the plants poison you or injure you, and the prey fights back.\n\nThe old pack members make a sacrifice to preserve the young. They take a one-way journey to hunt or gather, and the rest of your pack survives with a few less mouths to feed.\n\nIt becomes a tradition. Once they're old and weak, they go off to find food and die in the process.\n\nThen the imperfect and ugly offspring, those not fit to breed, are subjected to the same fate. It's all for the good of the pack, after all.\n\nIt's a ritual. It's an honour.\n\nAnd just like that, your innocent little pack has turned into a clan of ruthless death cultists... and you never even saw it happening until it was too late.\n\nSo, yes, the criticisms of this game are valid. If you play it just as a strategy game, after a while it starts to feel directionless, unrewarding and ultimately pointless. There's no solid goal or checklist to tick off. Survival is easy enough for the most part and there's no real motive to explore except for an additional challenge, but that's circular logic. You want to survive, so you move to a harder island? Eh... what?\n\nBut the fun starts when - instead of seeing it as a strategy game with you moving a few dumb pawns around to accomplish... well, nothing much - you start seeing it as a story. Because that's the strength of this game, and it's a damn strong one.\n\nConclusion, then: if you're just in it for the strategy, give this a pass for now. But if you're in it for the animals, or the genetics, or the stories your pack will tell you, then buy this game.

If you like turn-based strategy games, then this is for you. It reminds me a bit of the board game Small World, as well as the video game Don't Starve (which you can also get on steam).  While the game is fairly easy to learn, it can take a while to really master it. \nPROS:\n-adorable\n-great art\n-easy to learn\n-sandbox and story mode options\n-real genetics!\n-great music\n-runs well even on weaker computers\nCONS:\n-can get boring if you aren't a very goal-oriented person. There is only one goal: survive. Once you get the hang of game play, this task is extremely easy. There are achievements and the main \"story line\" that can be accomplished, but the feeling of having a specific goal to work towards is lacking. Additionally, the story line is simple: you got separated from your tribe and need to go back home. There is no marker on how far along you are towards getting home, and no way to really track your progress. You are either on your home island or not. I would appreciate the game more if there was at least a bar at the top of the screen that showed what percentage of islands you have explored, genes unlocked, and other small goals. A few more larger goals or different story lines would be interesting as well.\n-\"feminine\" game. I wouldn't go so far as to call it girly, but Niche's cuteness is a huge part of the game. Although I'm a girl and happen to love this kind of stuff, some people may be embarrassed to play a \"girly\" game. \n-no multiplayer options, as of yet. It would be nice to play a multiplayer map, where the goal would be to outlast the other player(s). Maybe they could even work together as a tribe.\n-It would also be neat if there was a spore-like create-a-creature option, especially since sandbox mode is hardly a \"sandbox\" version - it is almost the exact same as story mode, but without the goal of getting home. \n\nConclusion:\nCute, simple, and addicting. Overall I would give the game an 8/10 for the average player, or a 9/10 if you enjoy games like Spore, Small World, and Don't Starve. The use of realistic genetics gives Niche a significant amount of depth to it, although the story is weak and the lack of difficult, obvious goals can make the game boring for those who don't enjoy sandbox style games. Kids could play too, although they will need to be able to read and work out a simple strategy. My guess for a minimum age (based on difficulty of the game rather than content) would be 8. I would highly recommend this game to those who like cute, strategy/puzzle, genetic, or survival games.

The way the game plays out is rather simple; you play as a \"tribe\" or pack of animals who through breeding can combine their genes with other animals to gain or lose different traits (be that cosmetic or an actual ability). Through selective breeding (or cold hard luck) you can make your species flourish or parish, however, the best part about Niche is that in almost all cases no matter your creature's \"stats\" (unless they are complete shit and the creature is a complete genetic deformity) you can still survive very long and have fun in varying different ways depending on the way your creature has evolved (water or land?) and how you yourself can adapt and change your playstyle depending on the environment in game, which I found to be very intuitive. One of the things I really hate about other games is how if you are some how out of the \"meta\" (a certain path the game wants you to take in your playstyle.) the game punishes you. In Niche, that is just not a thing. Keep in mind, though, that if you do act stupid your species will go extinct, which I think is absolutely perfect because the game doesn't exactly hold your hand but still allows for any amount of freedom you'd like in your decisions and choices.\n\nHowever, like any other game or gene pool, it's not completely perfect. some of the mechanics in the game felt rather annoying or offputting. Disease has to be one of my main gripes. In-game, if one of the members of your pack gets infected with even the common cold, expect it to spread like wildfire. It seems kind of silly to me how fast disease can spread in this game, especially since it can be so lethal. On top of that there is no real way to quarantine anyone away from your main herd or to banish them without risking other pack member's lives in the process. Currently, the only really effective ways I've found of \"quarantining\" or culling members who are sickly off of my pack are either commanding them to stand in water untill they die of oxygen starvation or just shoving them some random place wayyyy far off in a forest or jungle untill they die from whatever disease they have. This combined with the fact that animals in this game don't live that long anyway and the fact that diseases slowly take away how long animals can survive really drains from the main gameplay. On top of this, some of the traits animals can have are quite annoying to deal with but absolutely avoidable, so just don't breed with freaks and you should be good.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 8/10.

Breed male and female and as long as the female is in a nest the next morning she will give birth. Throw in some aggressive creatures roaming about, a few stray animals looking to implant their genes into your pool, the hunt for food, and a bit of island hopping/adventure. That's what you will find in Niche\n\n It seemed like a no brainer for me when I purchased the game. I had a bit of an impression the game was about cross breeding species, manipulating DNA and having your creatures coexist amongst each other. That is not at all what this game is. The game is about a pack of animals that \"struggle\" to survive in any given habitat where you breed/manipulate the gene pool to where you feel your pack is evolving.\n\nThe main issue I had with the game is the 14ish day/turn life cycle. I found it all too common that once you establish an Alpha (your favorite gene combination) and start to breed it the timer is ticking WAY too fast. I wasn't a fan of the randomness or forever losing the option to breed your alpha again after those 14 days. You get a set amount of rounds to enhance your gene pool and during that time the parents of that animal have died off. If all your attempts don't leave you with a sense of progression towards an ideal combination of genes then you lost your opportunity. You will then have to begin an entire new cycle of mediocre breeding cycles in an attempt to get what you want. \n\nThe RNG is extremely heavy in this game. In the end I am left with a feeling that there isn't any real goal to obtain or any direction to take outside of just finding a solid food source of bushes that respawn food. Establish a renewable food source and the game leaves you with nothing more than breeding for that optimal pack. It is far too easy to lose genes in this process, so that ruined the game for me. I don't want to breed 4 different +1 armor and +4 claws animals with each other and not obtain a single birth that has +1 armor without remapping half of the other genes, while at the same time creating new borns that are by far inferior to their parents. 2 male, 2 female, about 16 children and not a single child I didn't banish from the pack. \n\nI guess the real issue here is the lack of information or understanding of which genes are dominant and such. It felt awfully random to me and for that reason I am not a fan. For $18.00 idk what I was expecting, but I sure wasn't expecting a game that felt so lacking of content.

One of my main complaints is the bearyenas only having 2 attack, I know the game is difficult without this being more difficult, but hear me out. When you breed with Bearyenas you get their claws and such on some of your creatures, as many niche players know. Once you have their genetics you find that they are super strong, but Bearyenas only do 2 attack. I would at least like them to get half on the attack you can get from having these genes. You could balance that out by adding smaller predators on easier islands with only 2 attack instead of Bearyenas, and also having big and armored body have more protection. Maybe the developers can add levels of difficulty that simply mean how hard certain predators attack?

If you aren't following a user-created guide after the tutorial, you're still going to have hours of learning ahead of you, and quite some time before you master it.\n\nThe rules of this game are all fairly simple and logical; you rarely sit around trying to remember how exactly a system works, because things generally work as you'd expect them to. I think the creators of this game have an incredibly solid base from which to further build this game, which brings up my one complaint.\n\nThis game is not done. The game's website acknowledges that \"releasing\" was just an attempt to raise attention and funds to continue development. The features are all there, the basis for the game is there, it just needs some expansion. It boasts over 100 genes to develop your species, but that really isn't as many as it sounds, especially when you include things like colorings, patterns, immunity genes, et cetera. Adding just a few more possibilities for the more functional features like jaws, horns, paws, bodies, tails, et cetera would go a LONG way in expanding this game.\n\nThe islands also need to be expanded, or better yet, reworked. The islands essentially serve as levels, the features of the island shaping the difficulty and ideal traits for that playthrough. Adding new island types would be cool, but this game really begs for sliders. Let us pick the climate, the scarcity of food, how hard it is to gather, how heavy on predators it will be, how strong they will be, what types we want to deal with, how many wild animals there are to recruit, et cetera.

Wir \u00fcbernehmen hierbei die Rolle der Erhaltung einer Art, sowie deren Vermehrung, aber auch was noch interessanter ist, deren DNA Verbesserung. Kurz gesagt: Das \u00dcberleben und Weiterentwickeln der Spezies. \n\nGrafisch ist das Game wirklich eine Augenweide und man merkt defenitiv, das die Entwickler sich hierbei M\u00fche gegeben haben. Es macht auf jeden Fall Spass mit den Charakteren zu interagieren, die sogar ihre K\u00f6pfe nach dem Mauszeiger ausrichten. \n\nInsgesamt betrachtet, ein Game das sich etwas, von den bereits gewohnten rundbasierten Games, positiv unterscheidet. Es bietet diverse M\u00f6glichkeiten seine Art genetisch weiter voran zutreiben, aber ich muss auch fairerweise hinzuf\u00fcgen, ist das Game nicht so einfach wie es am Anfang erscheinen mag. \n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad von Niche ist eher auf schwer einzuordnen. Ohne einen vorrausplanenden \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Fortplanzung und Weiterentwicklung, kann euere Spezies bald die Radieschen von unten betrachten (sprich sie sterben aus). \n\nFazit: Ungeachtet des Schwierigkeitgrads, ein wirklich lohnendes rundenbasiertes Strategiegame.

I don't usually write reviews but this game really struck me the wrong way just because of how excited I was for it and how disappointed I was once I started playing, so here I am. I like to give games a chance before I make a judgement but this just starts off wrong.\n\nThe game is tedious, with the gameplay revolving around moving a small selection of spaces and looking for food, or trying to get nesting material, which is slow. The need for food means you'll probably have the majority of your creatures sitting by a bush, using each of their three turns to collect berries.\n\nYour animals die too fast for you to really get a good grasp of the genes, the functionality of them, or make any attachment. I find in games that getting attached to a character or an aspect of gameplay is the best way to really love something and get involved. The breeding system seems to be nothing more than a gimmick to get you to play the game, while the turn system is horribly, terribly bad and doesn't instill a use of strategy, but rather imposes a limit on playability.\n\nThe strategy of the game seems to revolve around sitting characters in front of foods and doing nothing with them except gathering, or occassionally moving a group towards a predator and then picking up the food they drop if they die, and then breeding while working still not moving the creatures you have gathering. You'll also battle grass that regrows in a couple of days and hinders your gameplay, while really not granting any substance to the game as a whole. Disease and illness are another thing you'll probably run into, but it doesn't have enough substance (notice a theme yet?) to make gameplay interesting.\n\nThe game is not worth $18, its more worth $10, or even $5, considering the content. There is more variety in some mobile games and I feel like this is the type of game you'd find on the app store for $0.99 rather than $18 on Steam. This is probably a good childs education game, if you have an instuctor going over it with them to teach them how genes work at a purely base level, thats about all its good for and thats even a stretch.\n\nSave your money, the combination of a bad breeding system, a gene system where variety comes from a majority of cosmetic changes, and the shortness of not only each creatures turn, but also shortness of your creatures lives, makes this game a hard pass.\n\nRemember the No Man's Sky release and its lack of content?

It's enjoyable, and I put entirely too much time into it and realised far too often that it was suddenly 2am when I had to be awake for something in five hours.\n\nI have to stress that this is a casual game. There's no real hard-core survival mechanics built into it, it's not \"if you don't do everything EXACTLY CORRECT your chances to live are slim\". You can build up food very quickly if you gene right for it, and I often had populations of creatures on an island in the 30-60 range. Once you have the set-up for an island and the genes unlocked, surviving is rather simple (barring some of the harder islands). If you're looking for something with a lot of challenge consistently through the game, this is probably not for you.\n\nThat said, the learning curve can be high if you decide to start on a medium or higher island - without the genes you normally need to survive those islands, you can very, very easily end up going extinct.\n\nThe real draw is the genetics manipulation. I liken this game to a builder in that aspect - I'm not trying to survive (that's an initial goal that becomes less important the more you're succeeding), I'm trying to create a creature that looks a certain way or is prepared for a certain kind of island. Or I'm just breeding in random genes to see what the resulting creature ends up looking like! It's all about what you want to do.\n\nWhich is my next point: there isn't really a 'goal' in Niche. The story mode gives you an option to try and strive for, as you start as Adam who's been taken from his home and you can try and get your creatures to get back there over the generations. But the game doesn't end there, and you don't even have to do it if you don't want to. Niche is a game that lets you decide what you want to do. It's open-ended, and that's usually the reason so many of the major Let's Players of this game are storytellers - they're creating more depth to a game that's allowing for inspiration to be taken and run with into whatever you want it to. You can make it easier or harder on yourself with your own rules - think Pokemon Nuzlock challenges. You can do similar challenges here.\n\nThere are some issues that still need resolving, I won't pretend that there isn't. The tutorial isn't that great, it's extremely basic and doesn't go into the genetics, which are the core of the game. There are bugs here and there, but to the dev team's credit, they're doing their best to try and fix them as they show up. Achievements in particular are bugged as of my posting this. The challenge of the game does diminish as you get better genes, and it turns from survival into whatever you want to do, which isn't bad but having something that remains tricky to deal with throughout the game would be nice. The music is also very repetitive the longer you spend on an island. I don't dislike it, but when I can spend 3-5 hours session on one island, it's incredibly boring after the first half hour.\n\nAll in all, it's a very enjoyable game in my opinion, and I whole-heartedly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1508289279, "timestamp_updated": 1508289279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35806833": {"recommendationid": "35806833", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999823984", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508282174}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate to leave a review like this but this is a new level of wtf.

You learn by trial and error. )\n- Tutorial a bit unclear ( I didn't mind the tutorial not showing you exactly how the genes work, but it doesn't really show you any of the mechanics of the game expect for how to move the camera )\n\nPros:\n- Original idea ( Mix of genetics and survival, I've never played anything like this before, even Spore )\n- Great replay value ( Every game starts with different islands, different nichligs you ecounter, no 2 games are exactly the same)\n- Not too easy ( After 8 hours of game time, it gets easier but there's definitely still challenge in figuring out your moves )\n- Very relaxing, good soundtrack\n- Looks good but still runs like a charm on my old computer", "timestamp_created": 1508201929, "timestamp_updated": 1508201929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35756162": {"recommendationid": "35756162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084974111", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518232691}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been enjoying this game a lot!

I reluctantly began a new save, which I didn't play in the save slot where my previous save had suddenly dissapeared.

The concept is good, overall. Strategy is involved, but nothing new really seems to happen. Considering it's out of early access stages, I'm assuming the game won't be getting anything new anytime soon, such as new events, etc. The one thing that kills this game for me is that everything's repetitive. I seem to start with the same basic creatures with the same basic traits. No matter what I did, I always seemed to die off relatively early.

Most people probably will find this game boring or repetitive, and at times, it is. It's a game I like to play when my friends are telling stories or I'm listening to a podcast. It doesn't take much concentration, but still just enough overall to keep me playing.\n\nI have still yet to beat story mode, as the game can be surprisingly difficult at times. Mostly it's slowly moving your way through an area and just collecting food or trying to survive, but every now and then there is that panic and rush for more food or a suffient mate to carry on your tribe's legacy. This game is right about making it hard to survive very long, because it's a genetics game. Lots of things don't work. I LIKE that about the game. It makes it feel very important to pay attention to little things in your tribe's gene pool, and you have to consider what needs to change to improve survival. But usually, things aren't that easy. You'll come across a lot of weird future mates in the wild, and have no choice but to try your luck with them. Usually, it ends up in more oddities that need to be fixed in future generations. And don't even get me started on Rogue Males. Please, guys. Leave my females alone. We don't have enough food for more babies that will end up being made Omegas.\n\nWhen I first saw this game my instant thought was \"huh, so this is a furry game, right?\" and yeah. I kinda is. If that is something you refuse to deal with, then I guess this game isn't for you. The way the animals look all together is just very, uh, furry-ish? But I've come to think it very charming, and start to understand why some people who play the game like to add their own lore / story to their tribes.\n\nOn the topic of adding your own lore, sometimes I wonder if that's how the game is meant to be played. The gameplay is repetitive and kind of dull after a few hours, which makes sense being a genetics game where your goal is to simply survive, but it gets a little stale. I think people add stuff to their playthroughs to spice it up, and that's cool! I'm not so good at assigning random lore to my tribes, personally. Because that one Rogue Male will come up and breed with all of my females, and I'll be at kind of a loss for how I can make that a cool part of my story.\n\nThis game is, hmm, it's hard to say if I actually recommend it. Since it gets stale and the entire game is VERY much for a niche market (which consists of furries, people who played spore as kids, or a combination of both). For people who are PART of that market, go buck-wild, my friends. It leaves some stuff to be desired, but it's a solid enough game in itself for me to not regret getting it. But I know A LOT of my friends would really not find any fun in the game, and that's important to keep in mind before making the purchase.\n\nAll in all, it's good enough to keep my attention. I'm looking forward to possble future updates that will spice up the gameplay a bit more. The art and music is fine the way it is, so gameplay is all I'm looking forward to being improved, even if just a little. I think the game would benefit from random events, even if its extreme stuff like \"oh hey look at that, a meteor. Have fun trying to survive that!\". I think the game would be a lot more appealing with that kind of thing added!

It blew me away. I was expecting some low quality SPORE ripoff, and what I found was an incredibly deep hex grid survival RPG hybrid. My goal going in was to create some kind of cute fox creature and scavenge corpses to survive. I had no idea that I would be evolving my cute little foxes into gill-necked sharkfoxes with raccoon hands for opening shellfish on the ocean floor, with hooked tails suited to catching fish and webbed feet for faster swimming. Likewise, I had no idea that an hour later I would be scrambling to splice in fennec fox style giant ears to survive a savannah archipelago that was being rapidly consumed by cleansing fire. I played this game until my computer melted, and was hyped the whole time. My 20 day lifespan foxes struggled constantly on the razor's edge of the knife which is extinction, and I learned how to handle new threats just to allow defenses against old threats to be lost to the generations. It was amazing.\n\nMy only complaint: The tutorial is mostly nonexistent, making your first playthrough basically a forfeit dash towards extinction. I was about 4 hours in before I started to understand the mutation/heredity system, which wasn't explained at all.

However, the game's tutorial is lackluster beyond that. The game really throws you to the wolves with some mechanics that you learn by trial and error. Each creature is given several traits and genes and it shows you can mate to pass them on, yet it doesn't fully break it down.

The Adam story is mostly a brief tutorial, which would be fine if there was a more substantial tool tip system or Help menu that didn't open up to a webpage.\n- There is a mysterious absence of hotkeys, other than the map modes.\n\nBad\n\n- You know how there's a column of all your household Sims on the left of the Sims screen? This game doesn't have that. Finding a lost/forgotten animal requires actual searching (damn you, tall grass!) or cycling through with tab. It is infuriatingly slow and a Sims-like display (menu?) of all your living tribe members would be awesome. There's plenty of room on the screen!\n- I mentioned the Adam story mode previous as a Meh, but I really, really want more objectives outside of Steam achievements. I'm at a loss for ideas though so I can't blame the developers...\n", "timestamp_created": 1506552398, "timestamp_updated": 1506552398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35250159": {"recommendationid": "35250159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066833374", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515727090}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are looking for a very challenging strategy game, you've found it.

I simply can't recommend this game as it is. I would love to see the developers continue to work on this game, or produce a vastly more complex version.\n\nThe core theme of the game is fantastic, and I believe that the developers are truly onto something, but as it currently is It feels much more like a demonstration on genetics, or educational game for young kids rather than a complete game. If you are buying it for these purposes then its definitely suitable. As someone looking for a complete game with objective, progression, complexity, \"win condition\", challenge, sense of accomplishment, or possibly even limitless creativity the game is not fulfilling. Despite these flaws I maintain a positive outlook on the game, because I can imagine that in the right hands this game could be incredible. With that said I am not going to pull any punches, and I want to address the things this game lacks, which would otherwise make it a 10/10 title in my opinion. \n\n[b]Automation[/b]: One of my biggest complaints is that every single turn I need to perform the exact same collection actions to harvest nuts and berries. This task is tremendously mundane when you have fully a colonized island. Hundreds of turns of harvesting berries and nuts over and over is super boring. Automatically performing collection duties eliminates this unreasonably tedious chore, and allows the player to focus on the genetics aspect of the game. \n\n[b]Specialization[/b]: There is very little demand for specialization. \n-Going beyond +2 collecting is more of a mechanical luxury because you get to click less. \n-Basically no advantage to going beyond +1 cracking, because it's sufficient to break acorns. \n-Fishing is a terrible and poorly balanced mechanic, which probably results in net food loss anyways. \n-The only DEMAND for specialization is in temperature resistance, which I'll say in some ways is decently balanced.\n-Although there is a lot of opportunity to specialize in combat strength, it's much easier to just poison something or avoid it entirely.\n\n[b]Mutation[/b]: The mutation menu should be removed from the game. All genetics should be worked toward as a product of random mutations and cross breeding with foreign nichelings. The mutation menu is a lame mechanic that encourages stockpiling of food on noob islands, while still getting any genetics you want. It eliminates the need for travel, exploration, and adaptation to unfavorable environments. Similarly the idea of being able to bring as much food as you want to the next island is ridiculous. Food reserve should have a hard cap upon traveling based on difficulty or something. \n\n[b]Advancement[/b]: There is no actual advancement of genes. Evolution of genetics often occurs as a product of internal competition of a species. The fastest, strongest, and smartest animals are the ones that continue to reproduce. There should be traits that are OBJECTIVELY superior to others. For example, consider a claw hierarchy of Super Sharp Claws > Sharp Claws > Claws > Dull Claws. This gives players incentive to continue to push forward, and to temporarily find value in a terrible attribute like Dull Claws since it takes a large number of generations to get a lucky mutation toward regular Claws. To elaborate I think the 'ancient' genetics should have to be worked toward, and should be monumentally more rewarding. \n\n[b]Variation[/b]: Barring aesthetics the amount of genetic diversity is fairly trivial in my opinion. I would love to see this game implemented with 10+ viable traits per gene, with tiers of functionality, as explained in the last point. Instead most traits are relatively binary in the sense that the trait is either good or crippling. For example, there are only 3 eye traits in the game, and in no circumstance would I suggest making your nichelings blind or short sighted, thus regular eyesight is the only reasonable choice, and since it's unlocked at the start of the game it is quite easy to eradicate these undesirable genes.\n\n[b]Objective[/b]: There should be certain challenges that require you to make very 'niche' nichelings. For example maybe a mega predator, that will reward your nichelings if defeated, but cannot be damaged by any nichelings that lack maximum physical strength. Similarly challenges like a part of the map that is so cold that a nicheling will immediately die if they lack capped cold resistance, but huge rewards for accomplishing this tremendous feat.\n\n[b]Win Condition/Sense of Accomplishment[/b]: At the end of the day it's nice to complete a game. This game seems to drag on forever with no true purpose. A purpose doesn't have to be grandiose, but even something like unlocking improved aesthetics or additional customization for completing many objectives would be great.\n\n\nTL;DR : This game is a good choice if you want a short demo of genetics, or a game for an infant child to play. The lack of many quintessential mechanisms of evolution, combined with the highly tedious chore of turn based collection take a huge chunk out of the enjoyment of what this game could be. $17 price point is high, I would suggest buying in the $9-$13 range.", "timestamp_created": 1506384882, "timestamp_updated": 1506399516, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706139", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35212245": {"recommendationid": "35212245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093999699", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 267, "last_played": 1521493604}, "language": "english", "review": "This is great game.

And if you travel to an island unprepared (because how can you know at your first try what kind of dangers you are going to face?) your tribe can be extinct really quickly and the hours you have put into your game are gone. There is no \"load game\" option and there is really not enough time to adapt your tribe to the new \u201cdangers\u201d of the island.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like this game. But there is still a lot of work to do and right now I don't think it deserves a \"recommended\" review, because I would recommend to wait and see if the developers are going to make the game more interesting and make a real story mode.\n\nIf a relaxing sandbox game with no real challenges and not much depth is all you are looking for, then I would say go for it. And if you don't mind putting hours into playing and then loose it all in a couple of minutes.\n", "timestamp_created": 1506379768, "timestamp_updated": 1506379768, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35211499": {"recommendationid": "35211499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040781575", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506377447}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very average, low quality game.

Es steht dem Spieler dabei frei ob seine Tiere sich zu J\u00e4gern oder Sammlern entwickeln. Die Entwicklung vollzieht sich \u00fcber verschiedene Generationen. Mit jeder neuen Generation geben die Eltern ihre Gene in zuf\u00e4lliger Kombination an die Folgegeneration weiter.

Jede neue Insel bietet andere Bedingungen und neue Herausvorderungen. Durch wiederholtes Ausf\u00fchren von Aktionen wie nach Nahrung graben, Fr\u00fcchte sammeln, Schwimmen oder Fische fangen werden neue genetische Merkmale freigeschaltet, die eine optimalere Anpassung an die Gegebenheiten der Inseln erm\u00f6glichen.\nManche Merkmale wie zum Beispiel eine Resistenz gegen Gift k\u00f6nnen nur erlangt werden, wenn sich die Heerde in Gefahr begibt und giftige Planzen oder Tiere verzehrt.

One place is that it's a generally fun casual game, the other place is that I kind of went in expecting an evolution simulator and was a bit disapointed. So here's my review from both ends:\n\n[h1] As a game: [/h1]\n+Fun to play\n+I like planning a perfect strain of these guys to go hide out and interbreed start a master race of rabbit things\n+Pretty to look at \n+Nice music \n+I grow attached to these guys and then they die on me but I can't hold a funeral or eat their rotting corpse. \n\n-Could use a lot more variety with genes and islands.\n-There's a tutorial but doesn't really go into the nitty-gritty of breeding and evolving, which is is aggravating because that's the reason I picked up this game\n-Islands don't make any sense because you can just keep hopping until you find a new one you like, there's no real pressure to stay on an island that you don't like\n-Maybe I need to get further into the game, but there doesn't seem to be too many predators and when there are combat is basically chase someone and click to attack \n\n[h1] The Biology[/h1]\n+Heard that the Dev wanted to study biology or game design. Happy they kind of got to do both. \n+Holy fuck. Breeding 10000x better than Spore's dig-up-genes-and-use-them-whenever-you-want system\n+Overall pretty good model of how basic genetics works (half genes from mom, half from dad, one is expressed, etc.) \n   Nothing like epigenetics, or codominant traits, but I wouldn't expect that from a AAA team\n\n-Biggest complaint about the game is the fact that food is communal. Eliminates like half the selective pressures on the creatures. I'd really love to see personal food stocks implimented for each animal, that way you actually can weed out the weak quickly. \n-Not really a negativve but I'd love to see more gene variety.

It looks and feels very much like a board game at times, with as much strategy involved as you feel like having. It can be a casual breeding game or an intense battle for survival (if you decide to play on one of the more difficult islands), all depending on how deeply/seriously you want to get into it. \nThe game is basically about keeping your family of creatures alive and well by helping them get food, protect themselves from predators and survive the various natural hazards of their environment, mostly by breeding for different features and genes that allow you to shape your creatures any way you like. The gameworld consists of \"islands\" that have different bioms (savannah, jungle, mountain, grassland, etc.). Your animals can travel to different islands if you wish, but keep in mind that each one has its own challenges based on its bioms. \n[spoiler]At the moment Savannah tops my list as the most difficult island to thrive on due to many predators and natural hazards.[/spoiler]\nThe game offers two types of play. You can play the Story mode which starts you off with a creature named Adam and includes a simple tutorial that helps you get started (good for beginners). After the tutorial you are free to play as you like. The other option is the Sandbox mode which allows you to set your own difficulty from the get-go by letting you choose any island you want to start on (good for advance players). \nYou start off with two creatures and with them create a tribe which you will expand with further breeding. Periodically you will encounter stray creatures which you can invite into your clan, thus expanding the gene pool. \nMovement is turn based. Each creature has three moves per game day (when adults) and two or one move when they are babies. You can use their free moves to forage for food, breed, explore (by moving from tile to tile), and do some other actions/interactions. When you have used up all the moves of all the animals you can end the day to progress to the next one/trigger aging, giving birth to cubs etc. \nYou can collect different types of food like berries, digging up roots, cracking nuts, or hunting for rabbits, moles, fish, etc., or even collect meat from enemies that you defeat. Each creature will consume food at the end of the day. If you lack the food, they will starve and slowly die with each passing turn.\nThe core of the game is breeding for specific genes. There are many genes available, and hidden ones that you unlock by inviting animals with given genes into your tribes, or by performing actions (for example, trying to dig up roots will eventually unlock/strengthen your digging paw gene). Combine animals with traits you like to produce animals with desired characteristics while avoiding defects, doubled up immunity etc. By having different physical characteristics, some creatures will be better for hunting, defending, fishing, digging, foraging, etc. For more difficult bioms you might need certain creature features to help you survive. There is also the ability to mutate genes into your creatures if you wish and much more. The possibilities are endless and each time you breed, you will get a slightly different creature. \nThe game is well done, works very well (though it's not very graphic intensive), doesn't have that many bugs/glitches, so kudos to the dev team. There are also planned expansions for the game if they get enough funding through sales here on Steam. \nAll in all, the game is a fantastic choice for anyone interested in genetics, biology, strategy, survival, etc. There is so much more I could talk about here, but Steam has its limits. It's great to play with kids and other family members as it does a very good job of teaching the basics of genetics.

You can look at it as a game that you play to achieve a specific goal, and you can look at it as a sandbox simulation of genetics.  As such, I've split my review into two parts, based on which perspective you're going for.\n\nThere's also a five-second TL;DR at the bottom if you REALLY want it, but I advise looking over the details before deciding on a purchase.\n\n--------------------------\n\n[b][u]AS A GAME:[/u][/b]\n\nIf you ask me to pick what this game's [i]primary[/i] genre is, it's definitely survival.  There is no goal in this game save surviving as long as possible, which is accomplished by wandering the wilds looking for food and fighting or avoiding hostile creatures.  Death not only comes easily, it is inevitable, since every creature has its own designated time-based lifespan which is visible on their HUD.  You have to be okay with dying.\n\nHowever, in addition to survival, there's a fairly strong presence of the strategy genre here as well, and it's the main genre informing the game mechanics that make this game different from other survival games.  First, it's turn-based--time won't pass until you tell it to, so no quick reactions are required, you can take your time planning.  To compensate, though, resources deplete much more quickly than most survival games in terms of how long it takes your characters to actually reach resources.  So you don't have to plan quickly, but you do have to plan WELL.\n\nThe other new mechanic introduced by the strategy aspect is that you're controlling an entire tribe of creatures rather than just a single creature.  The more creatures you have, the more you can accomplish in any given day.  This allows you to multitask.  The idea is that you can have a few creatures focused on gathering resources to outpace/match the rate that those resources are being depleted by the tribe as a whole, and if you can accomplish that, then you're free to send a spare creature or two to go exploring or doing something else entirely.  This is why resources deplete as quickly as they do, and it's why the game can get away with allowing creatures to die of old age--your goal isn't the survival of any individual creature, it's to keep a family going for as many generations as you can.\n\nI feel like the game's also a bit like a roguelike in the sense that there is no way you can prepare for every situation the first time you play the game.  Other reviews have mentioned that the tutorial doesn't really explain very much, but I feel like that's intentional--part of the fun in roguelikes is dying in new and unexpected ways, so you know to plan for that your next time through, which allows you to last long enough to see a new enemy and die in ANOTHER new way you didn't expect.  Gradually, you organically develop your own personal strategies to account for all the different possible ways you can die.  You do it on your own, not because the game explained how to do it.\n\n--------------------------\n\n[b][u]AS A SANDBOX:[/u][/b]\n\nIf you are totally okay with your creatures dying, then technically this game doesn't have any specific goals at all, at which point the \"genetics\" aspect becomes the central focus of the game.  Congratulations, you now have an edutainment title on your hands!\n\nExcept it's not really an edutainment title, because it's not meant to be 1-for-1 accurate to how genetics work in real life.  It's more meant to provide a big-picture simulation of how genetics influences survival, reproduction, and consequently evolution and/or death in real-world environments.  The genetics in this game are more about phenotypes than genotypes--and if you understood that statement without needing to look up the words, you probably understand genetics well enough that the way they work in the game will make sense to you.\n\nIf you DON'T know what genotypes are, then too bad, because the other reason this game isn't really an edutainment title is because it doesn't actually EXPLAIN any of this stuff to you.  If you're planning on interfacing with the genetics in this game in any meaningful way, you will need to come into this game with your own knowledge of certain concepts related to genetics, including (but perhaps not limited to):\n\n1. How inheritance works\n2. How mutations work\n3. The difference between dominant and recessive genes\n4. Why males have only one of a certain gene and females have two\n\nIf you don't know/care about any of these concepts, that's okay, you can probably still play this game as well as anyone else.  The reason for this is because, like in real life, you don't really have a whole lot of [i]control[/i] over what the genetic makeup of your tribe is.  You can lean in certain directions, but ultimately you're limited to what's available.  The most effective way to introduce new genes to the pool is to look for creatures to mate with outside of your own tribe, and sometimes you have to take what you can get.  Otherwise, you're limited to sporadic (semi-controlled) mutations and inbreeding--which is a totally viable option if you don't mind halving your creatures' lifespans through autoimmune deficiencies.\n\nAll this is why I think the game doesn't totally work as a sandbox, though, because the game is too [i]restricted[/i] to be a sandbox.  In something like the Sims, you have total control over what your character looks like, what their house looks like, who their parents, are, etc.  There is currently no game mode in Niche that lets you do that, and as far as I know, they're not planning to introduce one.  So there's no REAL way to play around and experiment to see the direct correlation between genetics and body makeup.  Instead, you're limited to the other half of the Sims, which poking around to get food, getting bored, and then goading your characters into dying in a variety of creative and horrible ways.\n\n--------------------------\n\nTL;DR: You may like this game if you are:\n\n1. A gamer interested in survival and/or strategy games, and want to see a game that blends the two genres together.\n2. A science-oriented person who already knows basically how genetics work, but wants to see how it practically functions and influences survival in nature.\n\nIdeally, both of the above will apply to you to some extent.  If neither of these things appeals to you, you should probably give the game a pass.", "timestamp_created": 1506256661, "timestamp_updated": 1506256661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35179635": {"recommendationid": "35179635", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994807505", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506553414}, "language": "english", "review": "This game impressed the hell out of me. Though I'll admit, looking at the screenshots I was a little put off since it looks a bit cartoony. So pleased I decided to pull the trigger and buy it! There's actually a real challenge to trying to balance survival and continuation of your species with \"good\" genes. \n\nThe concept is rather simple on the surface: Reproduce and attempt to get the best genetic combinations possible through breeding without producing sickly offspring (deformed, inadaquate immune systems, etc) all while trying to find enough food to keep the herd going. There is definitely a taste of Spore involved, but unlike Spore where you do all the creating, Niche is almost like playing a cute virtual game of Gregor Mendel where instead of peas you're breeding (possibly) deadly creatures. Taking a page from Don't Starve, you do keep some of your genetic bloodline if your herd dies and you have to start over which allows you to have a bit of a headstart on subsequent playthroughs. Additionally, Each playthrough islands are precedurally generated so things stay interesting.

The creatures are completely shrouded in grass! Can't see them or anything in the grass for that matter. Different view modes don't help and seem unecessery. It really takes away from the point of the game, which is to breed little critters for different traits, if you can't see the results without wasting turns to clear brush.\n\n2) Camera views - see above. I'm constantly trying to manuever the camera to see where / how many little beasties I even have. You can tab over to your next critter, which you will need to do b/c you'll never find it by just looking. In the end though, the control of the cameras is wasted b/c I have to keep the camera in a very small window above the map just to see stuff. Zooming in to see the critters up close only shows you how much more annoying the grass is. Zoom out enough and you'll see a tree. Cool. Except that the clipping plane on the camera cuts out the top of the tree when you're in the \"sweet spot\" so you can actually tell what you're doing.\n\n3) You'll end up playing the game by solely looking at icons (move, collect, etc) because you'll have no idea what is on an adjacent tile just by looking - due to the bad grass component of this game.  Seriously, the grass is making this nearly unplayable. If you must keep it, give the user an option to reduce opacity or something. The game doesn't need grass to obscure the map. Ever heard of Fog of War? Look at ANY other turn-based strategy. Just cloud the areas out of the creature's \"sight\". Right now, the damn beast could have sight +100 and it wouldn't matter b/c YOU THE USER can't tell grass from a critter. Bushes once they are found - can't actually see them. or know they are there. I need to use icons to tell what is on a tile that is not in the fog and is right next to my creature. \n\n4) What is with the bird constantly blocking the camera? Bad. The bis shows up and now I have to move the camera to see the board. \n\nI wish I could post a screen shot so you can see the grass covering everythng. So bad.\n\nOther than that, I like the game.

I have been following the game for a while and was waiting on it exiting EA to get the full experience. After the long wait, I was pretty disappointed. The tutorial was abyssmal, you learn nothing but the absolute basics, it doesn't teach you what any icons mean or do, it doesn't teach you how to manipulate the genes besides \"Mate these two\". \n\nYou have an entire dna helix representing the presumably predisposed genes the animal has but with no background on what they mean or how to manipulate them, short of seeing that you are likely to have offspring with bad or slightly less bad eyesight/hearing/smell/strength/etc and if its +0, +1, or +2 to an attribute.\n\nUltimately the gene choices mean nothing, they make VERY little impact on the actual game. It is incredibly slow paced and boring. You can decide to fight, forrage etc. but, they are all literally the same. Wanna be warriors? Try to manipulate genes to give you attack power, click on an enemy and that's it. Forrage? Exact same thing, find a nut/berry bush/clam/etc. click on the icon and that's it. \n\nTake the term strategy VERY lightly, as there is very little. You just blindly wander through a map looking for other npcs to mate or kill and that's about it. There is no strategy to speak of, find someone that you will get killed by, run away. Find something you can kill but, can't offer to join your tribe, kill it. The game lacks depth.\n\nOne of the very interesting ideas the game put forth was senses, you can choose to perceive your surroundings using sight, hearing, and smell. They allow you too \"see\" different things. Sight will let you see things like acorns on the ground, smell and hearing let you see other animals in the bushes, and so on. The downside however, the is virtually no reason to use sight, tall grass renders it pretty useless and it's way easier to just use sound or hearing as not only does it let you \"see\" through things like grass, it by default gives you a larger range to \"see\". Which is unfortunate as the game is actually quite nice to look at when you can see the vibrant colors and details, all of which you miss in the superior hearing/smelling modes.\n\nThere are not a lot of genetic mutations to unlock, and a vast majority of them are strictly cosmetic and add nothing to the game.\n\nThis could have been a much better and deeper game and might very well be with updates but, as it stands now fully released with very little depth, an atrocious tutorial for a game with very unobvious mechanics, and generally boring gameplay I cannot recommend buying this game.\n\nTake the vast amount of positive reviews with a grain of salt, as the majority of them are staunch Niche supporters and have been playing well into EA and are pretty biased. It won't break the bank to buy, or try by any means but, there are much better games to shell your money out for.", "timestamp_created": 1506183624, "timestamp_updated": 1506183624, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 134, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759516", "comment_count": "23", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35157045": {"recommendationid": "35157045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135517799", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1521680920}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Niche \u00e9 um jogo mais casual, sobre criar uma tribo de criaturas atrav\u00e9s de cruzamento e misturar as gen\u00e9ticas uns dos outros, para assim criar criaturas mais fortes e aptas \u00e0 sobreviver em diferentes ilhas e regi\u00f5es - cada uma com seus perigos e dificuldades.

The different patterns are absolutely beautiful and the bearyena breeding is so cool!! I would suggest more interspecies breeding too thou, like breeding with dodomingos and getting wings and beaks for going on top of trees, and you can use the leaves from the trees that you collect on the top as nesting material and make nest on the trees and if the creature isnt born with wings and it gets off the tree it injures itself from fall damage like when a creature without any underwater breathing can drown when born underwater (or in water in general) and it can either be feather body with little wings or the feet can be wings and I think other body parts should be like beak that disables ears and the head is all feathery, a long feathered tail that drags behind it or like fisher tail that instead of fur on the tip the tail is line on the sides with feathers, the hind legs should be like bird feet too!

It's a great turn-based strategy game and, although it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I recommend buying it. \n\n Pros:\n\n1: You can replay it as much as you want without getting bored with the game. Every time you start a new game, it's different. You can give your creatures personalities and a story, unlock achievements (some of them are really hard, for those of you looking for a challenge!!), get the weirdest genes possible, or you can see how long you can survive in a world that is constantly changing. \n\n2: It has an amazing, supportive, and extremely helpful community. Not only that, but the developers are incredibly helpful and invested in what their community has to say: It really is a wonderful thing to see developers working with their community to improve the game. \n\n3: There are tons of genes you can unlock for your creatures! From prehistoric genes to underwater breathing abilities, there's a type of animal for every person waiting to be created. (you can even make hybrids!) \n\n4: There are countless islands of varying difficulties and sizes to explore, and hidden creatures in them waiting to be invited into your pack. Once you start a game in one of the islands, you can still move to another island with travel ports. (but be warned!! if you make creatures suited for the snow and go to a savanna, chances are you won't last very long. thankfully, the ports have different colors and designs so you can tell which one you're about to go to.) \n\n5: There's a sandbox mode and a storymode, both of which have tons to explore. In sandbox mode, you can choose which island you want to start off on and you have randomized creatures. In storymode, you start with Adam, who is lost and looking to come back to his old home. Storymode is recommended for new players because it's also the tutorial. I would go into greater detail, but then it'd spoil the story for you, and I'm not going to do that. ;) \n\nCons:\n\n1: There are very short lifespans. While the short lifespans (only around 20 in game turns) provide more of a challenge and can be exciting, it also makes it harder to get attached to certain creatures before they die. You can still get attached (and then it's heartbreaking when they die!!) but you don't miss the creature as much when you lose them as you might if you had more time with them. \n\n2: At the beginning of each game, you have two starter creatures: One male and one female. (used to be called Adam and Eve but now have randomly generated names.) When you start a game, you have to cross your fingers because you have no idea how your starters will be. They could have extremely bad genetics, or incredibly good ones. It's all about luck, and I only consider it a con because it can create an unexpected challenge. \n\n\n\nAll in all, I think it's a great game and recommend it to anyone who likes strategy, genetics, and cute animals. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1506173211, "timestamp_updated": 1506173211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35152068": {"recommendationid": "35152068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093726039", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 181, "playtime_forever": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509197771}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc790\uccb4\ub294 \uc81c \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub807\uac8c \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc544\uc694. \ubaa9\ud45c\ub77c\ub294 \uac83 \uc790\uccb4\uac00 \ub108\ubb34 \ub9c9\uc5f0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5c5\uc801 \uac19\uc740 \uac70 \uc81c\uc678\ud558\uba74 \ub0b4\uac00 \uc9c0\uae08 \uc65c \uc12c\uc744 \ub098\uac00\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ub098\uac04\ub2e4\uc74c \uc5b4\ub290 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc57c\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc54c\ub824\uc8fc\ub294 \uac8c \uc544\ubb34 \uac83\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc138\uc774\ube0c \ub85c\ub4dc \uac19\uc740 \uac83\ub3c4 \ub2f9\uc5f0\ud788 \uc5c6\uace0\uc694.\n\n\uac70\uae30\ub2e4\uac00 \ucd5c\uc885 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc9c4\uc9dc..... \uc9c4\uc2e4\uc744 \uc54c\uac8c \ub41c \ub2e4\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \uc548\ud558\uba74 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uc5c5\uc801\uc774 \ub450 \uac1c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5c5\uc801\ub3c4 \uc548 \ub418\ub294 \uac70 \ud55c \ubb34\ub354\uae30\ub77c \ud328\uce58\ub97c 3,4 \ubc88 \ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c\uc5d0\uc57c \ubaa8\ub450 \uace0\uccd0\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uadf8\ub798\ud53d\ub3c4 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc774\ub294 \uac70 \ubcf4\uba74 \ubcc4\ub85c \uc88b\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc54a\uc544\uc694. \uac78\uc5b4\uc11c \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc774\ub294\uac8c \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uccb4\uc2a4\ub9d0\ucc98\ub7fc \uadf8\ub0e5 \uc26d\ud558\uace0 \uc704\uce58\ub9cc \uc774\ub3d9. \uac00\ub3c5\uc131\ub3c4 \ubcc4\ub85c \uc548 \uc88b\uc544\uc11c \uc598\uac00 \uac70\uba38\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubb3c\ub824\ub3c4 \ucd9c\ud608\ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \uac78\ub824\ub3c4 \ud074\ub9ad\ud574\uc11c \uc77c\uc77c\ud788 \ucc3d\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0 \ud655\uc778\uc744 \ud574\uc57c\uc9c0 \uac89\ud45c\uba74\uc758 \uc77c\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9cc \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \ud655\uc778\uc740 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\n\uac70\uae30\ub2e4\uac00 \ub178\uac00\ub2e4\ub3c4 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc774\ub77c \uc12c \ub118\uc5b4\uac00\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc758\ubbf8\uc5c6\uc774 \uc2dd\ub7c9\uc744 \ube44\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uc80a\uace0 \uc2f1\uc2f1\ud55c \uba74\uc5ed\ub825 \uac15\ud55c \uc560\ub4e4\ub9cc \ub370\ub824\uac00\ub294 \ub4f1 \uc758\ubbf8\uc5c6\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf4\ub0b4\uae30 \ubc0f \ud074\ub9ad\uc9c8\uc744 \ub108\ubb34 \ub9ce\uc774 \ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\n\n\ub2e8, \uc5b4\ub9b0 \uc560\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc720\uc804\uc744 \uac00\ub974\uce58\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc88b\ub2e4\uace0 \ubd05\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc644\ubcbd\ud558\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc6b0\uc131 \uc5f4\uc131\uacfc \ub3cc\uc5f0\ubcc0\uc774\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc138\ub300\ub97c \uac70\uccd0 \ub0b4\ub824\uac00 \uc21c\uc2dd\uac04\uc5d0 \uc885 \uc804\uccb4\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0, \uadfc\uce5c\uad50\ubc30\uac00 \uc65c \uc704\ud5d8\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc120\ud0dd\uc124\uc774 \ubb54\uc9c0 \uae68\ub2eb\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc544\uc8fc \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub9b0 \uc560\ub4e4\uc774 \ud558\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uac00 \uac81\ub098 \ub192\ub2e4\ub294 \uac70\uc9c0\ub9cc\uc694.-_-\n\n\uc544, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc774\ub984\uc9d3\ub294 \uc5c5\uc801 \uc601\uc5b4 \ub85c\ucf08\ub85c \ubc14\uafd4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub098\uc05c \ub188\ub4e4.", "timestamp_created": 1506169174, "timestamp_updated": 1509982082, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507542", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35151728": {"recommendationid": "35151728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248484326", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506341261}, "language": "english", "review": "I would definitly buy this game.

The developers have created an amazingly inclusive community. They've demonstrated in multiple ways their willingness to cater to their players and their sincerity in accomplishing their promises to the best of their abilities.\n\nIn regards to the gameplay itself: personally, I adore it. The general breakdown of the game is that you start with two randomly generated adorable little Nichelings on a small island with very few dangers and plenty of food. \nYou breed your founders to grow your group, and sometimes find random wanderers to join you. Meanwhile you're deciding which members to breed together, what kind of nose is the best (or the cutest) what kind of feet you want, what kind of tail, what color, what pattern.\nDo you want them to crack nuts? Do you want them to catch fish? Or do you want it to be so beefy they can smash rocks? \nThen you eventually move on to another island to try and adapt and survive there, constantly evolving to new enviorments. \n\nThe freedom you have in creating a genetically unique and intricate tribe is so much fun.  \n(Currently my group of little dudes are rainbow colored with skunk tails and snake fangs)\n\nAll that being said, the game is quite slow-paced and intricate, with a considerable learning curve on the UI. \nThere's a good tutorial storymode available though, and it's pretty efficient for how much information you're given, and how much control you have over your group's genetics. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game ^.^", "timestamp_created": 1506112410, "timestamp_updated": 1506202318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35136191": {"recommendationid": "35136191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295369455", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519861503}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the game exept for give 3 days to feed our spieces before they die and easier to find food.", "timestamp_created": 1506109897, "timestamp_updated": 1506109897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447085", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35135360": {"recommendationid": "35135360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030737359", "num_games_owned": 1086, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506119343}, "language": "english", "review": "This game obviously has a lot of promise, so please take this as a very tentative \"thumbs down\". The game just feels too.. small, or bare-boned at the moment to be a full release at 17$.\n\n[b]First Impressions:[/b]\nWhen you start a new game, you have either the option of playing \"story\" or \"sandbox\" mode. I highly recommend playing story mode if you are new to the game, because it's actually more of a tutorial than a story mode (almost should be labeled \"tutorial\" instead of \"story), which leaves sandbox mode as the main focus of the game. The tutorial does seem fairly lacking in explaining many of the game functions as well, which I believe should be addressed at some point. An example of this is how to pass on dominant/recessive genes, or how to use mutations, I have not seen anywhere in-game where this is explained.\n\nThe sandbox mode allows you to choose from among a fairly large amount of maps, which is great. However, it does not give you an option to pre-set any of your starting creature attributes, which are instead decided through sheer RNG (randomly). This feels like a HUGE feature to be left out. You can just restart over and over until you get a specific starting attribute that you were hoping for (I.E. horns, digging claw, etc.). It would also be great if there were at least 1-2 more body types to choose between, maybe something bipedal, or the option to begin in the sea and evolve legs eventually. Something to hope for in the future, I suppose.\n\nAnother feature that I feel should have been included is a difficulty setting for younger, or less experienced players. Something requiring less food per turn, less predators or longer creature life. Any custom settings at all would have been nice, in fact. I realize that the map you choose does this to some degree, but it's not enough at the moment.\n\nThe sight/smell/hearing toggle is a great concept, but I find that there is very little practical use for sight in general due to the tall grass that is prevalent on every map. This leaves me playing the game in black and white, which detracts from it to a degree. I wish that the \"senses\" could have been implemented in a way that caused items or creatures detected by scent or hearing to just appear in a color that signified what sense it was detected with. For example, items detected by scent could show with a yellow silhouette, hearing could be blue. Something to that effect, rather than a full toggle.\n\nThose are my only complaints about the game currently. I do not plan to refund it, as I can see Niche becoming a truly great game with several updates. The developers have been responsive and friendly in the forums and when replying to reviews, and that gives me a lot of hope for the future of this game.\n\nQuestion to devs - Why does attacking a rogue male with a female creature get her pregnant?", "timestamp_created": 1506107247, "timestamp_updated": 1506450186, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541724", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35135297": {"recommendationid": "35135297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079351783", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519669146}, "language": "german", "review": "wirklich absolut bezauberndes rundenbasiertes Juwelchen, dass das ganze Thema mal v\u00f6llig anders angeht... ich habe zwar selbst erst an der Oberfl\u00e4che gekratzt, aber freue mich schon drauf, noch viel weiter zu kratzen :P\n\nVielen Dank an die Entwickler, die mir freundlicherweise diesen Key f\u00fcr meinen kleinen Youtube-Kanal zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt haben. =)\n\nwer sich mal \u00b4ne Runde Niche in Bewegung anschauen m\u00f6chte, der kann das hier gerne tun... die Serie wird nach und nach dementsprechend erweitert :P\n\nhttps://youtu.be/gz2KqqYjbyU\n\nviel Spa\u00df", "timestamp_created": 1506107094, "timestamp_updated": 1507662568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506849", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35134613": {"recommendationid": "35134613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071860461", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506065165}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u770b\u5230niche\u5c31\u51b3\u5b9a\u8981\u4e70\u4e86\u3002\u7136\u800c\u6e38\u620f\u611f\u89c9\u8ddf\u751f\u6001\u4f4dniche\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u4e0d\u5927\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8bf4\u5e94\u8be5\u53eb\u6a21\u62df\u72d0\u72f8\u9057\u4f20\u3002\u3002\n\u597d\u5bb9\u6613\u751f\u75c5\uff0c\u6297\u75c5\u4e5f\u662f\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6027\u72b6\u90fd\u662f\u4e00\u5bf9\u7b49\u4f4d\u57fa\u56e0\u63a7\u5236\u6211\u5c31\u4e0d\u670d\u4e86\u3002\u597d\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u628a\u4e00\u4ee3\u90fd\u6574\u6210\u4e86\u6709\u5404\u79cd\u4f18\u826f\u6027\u72b6\u7684\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u548c\u5c0f\u718a\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u4e2d\u90fd\u6162\u6162\u75c5\u6b7b\u4e86\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u611f\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u632b\u8d25\u611f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c31\u5f88\u5c34\u5c2c\u4e86\u3002\n\u6c49\u5316\u673a\u7ffb\u3002\n\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u597d\u8bc4\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u8fdb\u5316\u9898\u6750\u7684\u73cd\u60dc\u3002\u6bd5\u7adf\u6211\u81ea\u5df1\u5c31\u60f3\u505a\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1506104942, "timestamp_updated": 1506104942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721001", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35133529": {"recommendationid": "35133529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247361390", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515592503}, "language": "english", "review": "It got so much better than in the beginning.

None of the stats are explained in the tutorial, nor is the mutation mechanic, the action count, or many of the other important features.  \n\nIt gets even worse once you leave the tutorial and puts you on an \"easy\" island.  I don't dislike hard games, I love a challenge.  But there's a difference between something being hard because it requires skill and something being hard because you can't win if the game decides to throw the wrong thing at you.  Here's the setup for this problem:  All of your animals have a limited lifespan and can take a maximum of three actions per day, two or even one if they're not fully grown.  Those actions include moving, collecting food, cutting grass, attacking things, mating, everything.  Each of your animals also require one unit of food every day which must be located and collected.  Movement actions are limited to one space at a time if there's tall grass in the way and almost every space starts off with tall grass.  That, in and of itself, was frustrating enough.  All three actions in a day would be spent cutting grass and moving to find food while the food meter slowly goes to zero.  And then just when you think you've got all your space cleared up for easy movement and your food sources located and you might actually be able to start playing the game, the grass starts growing back.  It doesn't even grow back in the order you removed it, it's as though every space has a percent chance of just spawning new grass every day.  If you do manage to secure enough food sources to keep your animals fed, some bigger creature shows up and starts systematically killing them off.  In my first game some huge black thing showed up and started attacking my animals one at a time and it took three days of all three animals attacking it with every action to kill it and by that time it had killed two of them and the last one was starving.  This is the easy island right out of the tutorial and it didn't get any better in subsequent games.\n\nSo no, I don't recommend anyone buy this game.

This game is amazing. If your into survival games, if you like turn based games, if you love animals and like a challenge (especially when it comes to breeding a creature you like) this is the game for you.\n\nI've only ot 12 hours on this account but I originally logged about 40 hours on my sisters before buying it myself. I think I started playing back on 0.3.0 and the game has come on leaps and bounds since then. I originally saw this game and knew I would love it just because of the art. Its such a cute game with amazing artwork that has inspired allot of beautiful fan art in return. I've also always loved games that involve breeding animals, it fascinates me and this game takes it that one step further by making genes that your survival depends on.\n\nCons: \n-If you don't like micro mangment your not going to like this game. You have to micro manage every move and action your creature makes. You have to choose specific genes you want to try and breed into your tribe for EVERY creature.\n\nPros (AKA why I love the game)\n-If you like micro managment see above, I like micro managment, at the very least it dosnt bother me!\n-With a diverse gene pool of colours, patterns, claws, eyes, horns and special ancient genes (plus many more) you end up with a diverse and intresting tribe of creatures. Its can be a fun challenge to try and breed a creature that can not only survive and thrive, but look exactly how you want.\n-Challenging terrain makes for intresting game play as your forced to adapt to your enviroment. From growing gills to deal with water and posion fangs to help you harvest poisnous berries your forced to hunt for the perfect mate to join your tribe.\n-The danger doesn't just lie in what is under your feet but what lurks around you. Rouge males with negative genes stalk you through the grass waiting for a lone female to stray from the tribe, leeches lurk at the water's edge waiting to grab onto a passing baby (or even worse a bird swooping down and grabbing your baby!) and the big bearyenas roam around. These threats force you to keep on your toes and depending on what genes you have in your tribe you can try to fight or run. A fun update before launch added the possibility of bearyena hybrids that can introduce important genes into your tribe and I hope to see more hybrids introduced in the future!\n\nTo sum it up it's a cute entertaining game. If your unsure watch some of the many youtube videos that are already out about previous releases.

There are two modes: sandbox and story. In story mode, you start with Adam losing his family and go on the quest to find them with his new mate, eve, whose descendants search for the fabled adam's island where Adam's family resides. You can go full or do-or-die in sandbox, facing harsh climates and deadly predators completely unprepared, or you can travel around the peaceful islands, experimenting with the random genes you received and telling story's. \n\nI have found that most (correct me if I am wrong)of the negative reviews on niche are made by people who have p,Syed under an hour, and they complain about the fact that the game seems \"boring\", \"confusing\", \"repetitive\", and that's true, at the start, but as you advance to new islands and survive, your tribe's story's become more complex and interesting. The only way for it to be boring is if a) you spend only 30 mins on it like most of the negative reviewers did and then just drop it, or you have no creativity at all.\n Niche allows you to build your own culture and traditions. You shape the feel of your world, choose the colors and landscapes.\nThe unlocking system for niche genes is quite clever, based on real genetics but a little more loosey goosey so you don't have to wait billions of generations like in real life. You can completely change the genetic make up of a tribe in 3 generations!\nAlthough the island unlocking system in Storymode is a bit tedious, you can just switch to a Sandbox game and BOOM you are on the island you wanted to be on.\nNiche is an overall great game!\nMy only critique: (take note these are minor things, not that important. I like to nit-pick :P)\nis that there should be a creature creator that lets you see what combinations would look like and what they would do.\nis that there should be more uses for digger paw\nIs that fully-hybridized nichelings should have better movement, although it is true that it would be a little op. But still, I would like the movement to be at least 2, maybe even 3, but not one!\n(This is only if you want more than 5 games or you want to play older versions but still have room to make new games on the other versions)Is that there should be a way to get the save file of a game without having to dig through your folders (and the folder it's in does not appear on some platforms) like maybe a small button on the screen next to your worlds that will open up the folder automatically.", "timestamp_created": 1505794210, "timestamp_updated": 1505794210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35046190": {"recommendationid": "35046190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085291097", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508591929}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game and I play it often.

Aber kommen wir erstmal zum zweiten: Lob und Dank\n\nIch empfehle das Spiel auf jeden Fall. Ich mag es sehr gerne, da ich mich f\u00fcr Biologie und Genetik interessiere. Die Grafik ist h\u00fcbsch und es ist liebevoll gestaltet (Die Tiere sind total knuffig 0.o). Mit dem neuen Update sehen die Inseln viel besser aus. Es gibt viele Eigenschaften, die man den Tieren anz\u00fcchten kann, die einem helfen in der Umgebung zurecht zu kommen und besser Nahrung zu finden. Auch das Tutorial mit der kleinen Geschichte hat mir sehr gefallen. Gut und realistisch ist auch, dass man versuchen kann N\u00fcsse aufzuknacken, auch wenn die F\u00e4higkeit N\u00fcsse aufzuknacken nicht sehr ausgepr\u00e4gt ist. Es gibt eine geringe Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass man es dennoch schafft. Es gibt noch viele andere Sachen die mir gefallen, aber das k\u00fcrze ich einfach mal etwas ab.\nVielen Dank an die Entwickler. Ein \"genetics survival game\" hab ich mir ehrlich gesagt schon lange gew\u00fcnscht. Es macht wirklich Spa\u00df Auszuprobieren und sp\u00e4ter \u00fcber den Stammbaum nachzuvollziehen welche Eigenschaft von wem vererbt wurde. Vielleicht geht es nur mir so, aber das ist besonders als Biologe interessant. Das Spiel w\u00e4re meiner Meinung auch gut, um Vererbung anderen beizubringen, da man die Vorg\u00e4nge wirklich sehen kann. Super, dass dieses Projekt wirklich was geworden ist. Ich verfolge die Entwicklung seit der Alpha und muss sagen, dass es sich gut entwickelt hat. Hoffendlich folgen nach dem Release noch Verbesserungen und Updates, die das Spiel erweitern. Wie w\u00e4re es mit einer Campaign?\n\nNun zu den Verbesserungsvorschl\u00e4gen:\nTut mir wirklich leid das zu sagen, aber es ist etwas falsch dargestellt. In dem Men\u00fc, wo die genetischen Eigenschaften eines Tieres gezeigt werden, wird eine DNA-Doppelhelix dargestellt. Dabei wird jede Eigenschaft in eine Base gesetzt. Ein Basepaar fungieren als Allele. Das stimmt fachlich wirklich nicht und wenn ihr es \u00e4ndern k\u00f6nnt, bitte tut es. Informiert euch nochmal (ich m\u00f6chte diesen Review kurz halten und erkl\u00e4re deshalb nicht). Auch wenn es h\u00fcbsch aussieht, vielleicht w\u00e4re eine Darstellung mit verschiedenen Chromosomenpaaren auch geeignet.\n\nDas w\u00e4re es auch schon.

It is amazing to see how recessive traits that were carried for generations can just pop up with the right pairing. Most of the time when you least expect it and it is so cool to just look at it and think \"where on earth did that trait come from?\" then go the the genetics and see what caused it.\nIt's even better when you can challenge yourself to breed the \"perfect\" nicheling for the island you are on. It is quite the challenge too.\nOne thing that I really love is that you can play many different ways. Causually just wondering and gathering food or trying to discover everything that is in the islands and hopping from place to place.\nI have been fallowing this game since before it was on steam when it was just starting out on kickstarter(I think anyway) and goodness has it improved. \nThe graphics are beautiful without being heavy on you're computer, I run my game on my 2012ish laptop and it runs smoothing with only minor bumps if my laptop gets to hot.\nThere are so many many different kinds of markings and colors. The markings/colors even effect how you can hide, stripes give you camaflouge so you can sneak up on prey. There is more to it too that makes the game so realistic and I just love it all.\nThere are cons to it though too:\nthe strength mechanics make it rather difficult to hunt in the begining of the game, a nicheling needs 2-3+ strength to kill a rabbit which can be frustrating when you only have 3 moves and you still need to chase the rabbit down.(though in the next generation this can be fixed by breeding specific traits and hunting isn't your only source of food)\nImmunity genes can quickly become a problem if you can't find any new members to add to your tribe or you have many nichelings.\nRouge males are very persistant and it can be a struggle to decide to chase them off or not since in my experience many have back spines which will hurt your nicheling if they attact him.\nThe hard islands are rather difficult(though that would be obvious by the name) and if you just want to explore this can cause a issue with a causual game.\n\nThats all the cons that I have and despite them I still love this game and cannot wait to see what improvements lay ahead for it, I hope some of you found this helpful and have a wonderful experience if you decide to buy it ^-^\nAlso the achievments are cool and some are amusing(to me)", "timestamp_created": 1505498755, "timestamp_updated": 1505498755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34975814": {"recommendationid": "34975814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338140283", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "last_played": 1520793483}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played this game for over 200 hours!

When I was a little girl, I was fascinated with genetics and heredity.  I used to make up games where you could see the genes of imaginary creatures, then breed them and see how those genes were passed on to their children.  I fervently wished that someone would make that game for real.  20 years later, I got my wish. :) \n\nNiche is full of adorable creatures whose genes have a real impact on not only their appearance, but the ways they can interact with the world around them.  Your job is to take control of a tribe, helping them to explore and ensuring their survival as they move from island to island.  Each island has different challenges for the Nichelings to overcome, and the abilities they get from their genotypes will determine how well they can gather food and deal with predators in each environment.  \n\nThere are many, many different ways to survive, so you're not locked into keeping a specific set of genes.  Nichelings use real genetics (including mutations!) and you can use this to guide the direction of your tribe.  Will you breed a tribe of mighty hunters?  Efficient gatherers?  Or maybe you just want your Nichelings to have adorable tiger stripes?  It's up to you!  You can even ignore the mutation system entirely and see what nature gives you.  An individual Nicheling's lifespan is relatively short, so making sure there are children who can carry on the tribe's legacy is an important part of the game.  My favorite part is just watching how the tribe evolves over time and seeing all the changes and mutations that my choices have introduced.\n\nIf you have even a passing interest in genetics, cute creatures, and survival games, I highly recommend Niche.", "timestamp_created": 1505482317, "timestamp_updated": 1505482317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34965958": {"recommendationid": "34965958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157411218", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 522, "last_played": 1521535566}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely recommend this game. \nits lots of fun to play, creating your own little clans, and lots of fun colors on your creatures!\n", "timestamp_created": 1505459405, "timestamp_updated": 1505459405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34947136": {"recommendationid": "34947136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098069291", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519390516}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game I've bought since the Sims series.

Finances didn't allow me to buy the game despite me being in absolute awe for it - but as luck would have it, I recently won this in a giveaway. Needles to say, I was super excited to try it out myself!\nWith the current update of 0.9, a lot of changes have happened, but in all honesty I don't think describing what used to be, and what will be for the official release, does not benefit anyone. Let me just tell you that Niche has come a long way and constantly improved, making it a lovely enjoyable game! I am therefore sure that the final version is going to be just as adorable as the previous builds :)\nNiche is all about surviving. Starting out with Adam and Eve, your task is to breed the most adapted animals to ensure survival. There is a great variety of genes varying from fur color and pattern (influencing camouflage) to which limbs they possess (digging paw? Nimble fingers? Runner's leg? Claws? That's just a few of the options!). Big ears or small ears; Cracker jaw or Poison fangs; a dozen different immunity genes; ram horns or antlers - Niche gives you a great amount of genes to play around with! Or do the genes play with you? That is the feeling you sometimes get when you're desperately trying to breed a creature with poison fangs and 5 children later you still don't have them, or breeding a couple that have blind eyes in their recessives with normal eyes in the mutation menu and yet all 3 children end up blind.\nBreeding isn't as easy as it sounds at first because some genes really just don't want to play along! The mutation menu can help greatly with this. Each creature has two slots in which the player can place certain genes to make them more likely. However, be prepared that this isn't always going to work ;)\nMoreover there are multiple biomes and difficulties that your creatures can adapt to. Want to live a peaceful life on a lush green island, or do you prefer the hardships of the snowy mountains? Do you wish to live an easy life, or are you seeking the thrill of multiple bearyenas at once? No matter which one is for you, the Sandbox mode has you covered.\nBreeding the \"perfect\" creatures can be quite a challenge, but it definitely is a fun one! And the feeling of joy when you finally manage to get that double-clawed, poison fangs and ramhorns creature that you've been trying for for the past 10 turns is more than rewarding.\nNiche is a great game, and I am excited to see what's next :)", "timestamp_created": 1505379760, "timestamp_updated": 1505379760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34944631": {"recommendationid": "34944631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115688282", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506106248}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u98df\u4e4b\u65e0\u5473\uff0c\u5f03\u4e4b\u53ef\u60dc\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1505378234, "timestamp_updated": 1505378234, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524385", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34941444": {"recommendationid": "34941444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043920994", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516332724}, "language": "english", "review": "it's difficult but addictive. hopefully i can figure out a decent strategy", "timestamp_created": 1505359008, "timestamp_updated": 1505359008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34941198": {"recommendationid": "34941198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072939291", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484303319}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has no goal in mind its just breed a generic looking thing into another generic looking thing that looks exactly the same as it did before.

If you like the idea and believe you'd enjoy it, yes, I was never disappointed with Niche. Check out some gameplay videos of it if you aren't sure. Should you buy it as a present for someone? Maybe, you really need to know if they would enjoy it.\nNever played \"these kinds of games\" before? Then I'd say this is a good way to dive in, the community is filled with different aged players who ended up enjoying this game, and play it with their own styles.\n\nCommunity - It's good there, people share ideas, challenges and suggestions. I don't spend a lot of time in the discussions.\n\nThe game will be released next week, and I write this review to support the game and its developers, who really deserve it! Five stars out of five from me, I truly enjoy this game.\n\nNow I'm off to play some Niche, to finally conquer the island I struggled to live in (it was the most epic struggle though!).", "timestamp_created": 1505325413, "timestamp_updated": 1505325413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461538", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34923537": {"recommendationid": "34923537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393085855", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520452204}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Yes\"\n\nI've seen that simple word in many reviews of different games, and I thought it was kind of funny, but now I understand the meaning behind \"yes.\"\n\nNiche is a \"yes\" game. One simple word could describe a game in many ways, and yes is one of them. When I first started playing this game, I'll admit it, it was a bit difficult to get used to, but I wasn't a hardcore gamer back in those days so I wasn't really a pro in playing games (Not that I am, I just never played a lot of games on a laptop or computer). I've seen reviews where people say that it gets boring, and that it's not entertaining. When I first started, it was different for me. There were so many things I could do, and I wanted to try them all. My tribe ended up almost starving to death and I gave up on them. Yup. They starved. Yay. It was my first tribe, so it was to be expected. However, I learned a lot from playing on that tribe. One of them being that crippled paws are cute and sad and all, but this game is about \"survival,\" so it doesn't really help. You can choose what you want your creatures to be in this game, and it doesn't always have to be about surviving, sometimes you just want to test things out and kill off a tribe, I've done that before. \n\nYour creatures can fish, hunt, or just eat from a tree and berry bush. All the patterns create such interesting and beautiful creatures, and you can make up your own story with their genes and what they do in the Tribe. I always have something to do in this game, and I'm always scared that my tribes will die because I get so attached. A simple creature that has, let's see, crippled paws, derp snout, doubled up immunity, would make me fall in love with them. I do love how all the beautiful and \"perfect\" creatures look, but.. There's just something about those creatures that don't have those \"beautiful\" and \"perfect\" genes that make them so... beautiful.\n\nRogue children are mostly disliked and fed to the birds. which is kind of how some humans don't like how their child looks and they leave them alone or give them to someone else or an orphanage. It's sad, and I pity them. I have a soft spot for them, and I never just let them die. I always try to find them a mate, and a purpose in the tribe.\n\nOverall, this seemingly simple game has so much potential, and I absolutely love it. From the \"ugly\" creatures to the \"perfect\" creatures, everything in this game has a story. I can't wait for the future of this game, and I hope the community keeps growing. I also hope my friend gets it soon, because I'm already addicted, and I want to have an in real life buddy play it with me.\n\n\nA feature I would really love to be added or maybe a website someone can do is where we can make a creature to see how the genes (that you have maybe unlocked) and patterns look like so you can know what you wnat the creatures to be in your tribe. It would also help with making stories (if you like to write stories, this would be very helpful) Maybe like a button somewhere or something like that? It's just an idea.\n\n\nI really do love this game, and I hope it keeps growing.

I genuinly enjoy the game, the design of the creatures and how they have develpoed it so far. However, like every game there are pros and cons:\n\nPros\n- The game is nice and relaxing and depending on the person you can play it for hours.\n- It has the choice to play a easy, medium, and hard modes so players can challenge themselves.\n- The art style is cute. \n- It is nice to breed new babies, while you can control their genetics you never know what they are going to look like so it's exciting to find out. \n- It is challenging and it really pushes you sometimes, especially when facing a drought.\n\ncons/ contructive critisism\n- In the new update when all of your turns are used up the sun or next day button no longer flashes, this means when you have larger tribes of 20-30 creatures, you may waste turns by going on to the next day without noticing. \n- I feel there aren't very many goals in the game, while I can play it for hours and feel entertained, I do feel there is a lack of purpose in the game. Even in story mode this is an issue, it is basically the same as sandbox mode except you get an achievement for finding adams family. The only thing that makes you feel like you accomplished something is when new genes are unlocked and even with that when you click to see which gene is unlocked it is no longer highlighted like it used to be. With that said, without having goals players are able to do what they want but there should be an option for those who want more of a drive to play the game. \n- While the art is nice the animation of the game is rather simple, though that is understandable due to the type of game it is though mnore animation would be cool or different stances for the creatures maybe. \n- SOME OF THE BOSSES ARE INSANELY HARD. Okay, so i mistakenly went into the jungle way too early when migrating to a new island and it was all good and fine until the poison ape thing came and wiped out my tribe and if you have under 5 attack you can't do anything about it!! I know that breeding to be scentless, or distasteful or be really strong are part of avoiding these things but even on the MEDIUM islands it is difficult to fight the larger bosses/ predators. \n- Nichelings with two of the same immunity genes are sick for their whole life now, while it does say they are more prone to getting sick, it isn't as realistic to have them sick throughout their whole life, there should be a plant that serves as a medecine, not to heal them but to stop them from being sick, even if it is temporary. In addition to this, I feel that the creatures around this sick animal should be less likely to get sick from them because they hhave immunity genes to prevent that, I feel it should only apply if a creature has the same immunity gene as the one who has double. Although this problem can be easily avoided by isolating the creature. While many may deem it useless when it is sick, it is still beneficial to use them because you can breed it without fear of one of the immunity genes being the same and use it to collect food far away. \n\nIn conclusion, I love this game  and while I have made a lot of critisisms, it is just me rambling about some things and commenting on how some parts of the game were changed that were helpful and beneficial.

I LOVE breeding/genetics games and the nichelings are ADORABLE.

I had to quarantine a sick wanderer, but managed to get a new gene on her two babies, although they took some sickness damage because they caught a cold from their mother.

In order to keep track of my genetics/breed some distinct lines, I've been giving my creatures last names based on their roles. I haven't had enough time in this new save file to breed for anything other than immunity genes, but I've been naming them with roles at birth, for example, Laisi Digger, Tama Hunter, and Taro Gatherer, and I plan to breed together Gatherers and Hunters and Diggers to make special lines, adjusting the immunity genes for each line!

Which is a shame, since I'd wanted it since I first heard of it's EA launch. The whole premise is to basically go from similar island to island gathering food, nesting material and mating with others of your species to make a bigger tribe. Sounds good right? Well it would be if there wasn't bugs and a lack of content. I'll tell you of my first impressions as a new player.\n\n[list]\n[*] The game has no working save option in the build for full release. Exiting to menu doesn't save either. Past versions do have this function, but they [b]ARE[/b] outdated.\n[*] No movement animations for your animals. You don't see them dig, eat, walk or anything. They just glide from one spot to another. Animation is limited to neck bone rotation and the occasional blink of the eyes. \n[*] The tutorial does a poor job at explaining anything above the bare basics. \n[*] There is a bug I encountered where my tribe went extinct dispite being 5 members and having plenty of food. I can see this annoying a lot of people when you can't go back to a previous save due to the function not working.\n[*] \"The Port\" is never actually explained. But it's the bit with flowers near the migratory stone. Due to this lack of information you can lose almost your entire tribe.\n[*] Genes have been greatly simplified. In this, simply collecting/eating something that should kill you is enough to give you full immunity and give you a gene that you'll pass down to your offspring (in the case of the Toxic Body gene). This isn't how immunity genes work in real life, and I understand that it's been simplified because this is entertainment, but if people are getting into to Biology because they find the idea of dominant and recessives interesting then they'll have already been fed false information.\n[*] The developers aren't opposed to nepotism, and it's relevant just by looking at the achievements list. \n[*] Storymode has no real story that I can see other than [spoiler]you've been taken for lunch by a bird from your island, fight back, are dropped, somehow survive a huge fall and then make your own tribe. [/spoiler].\n[/list]\n\nNow I'll talk about the aspects of the game I enjoy.\n\n[list]\n[*] There is a great variety of genes that your animals can have and most have their proper benefits. For example, an animal being really big will also be gigantothermic. So he/she retains body heat just by being so large.\n[*] The art style is really nice. The short cinimatic introduction shed a bit of story on how you got to where you are.\n[*] Fertility is an issue ingame, which is something that is a must within a genetic simulation game.\n[*] I can see the title being really good when it gets past it's first stable launch and has a few more updates to expand the genes, animation and other lackluster features.\n[*] There are multiple different island sorts from what I've read/seen.\n[/list]\n\nTo conclude, you may enjoy it, but it is really barebones so far for a stable launch. I'd recommend you wait maybe 6 months, and then see what's been added. In all likelyhood it'll be 10 times the game it is now within the distant future. All it needs is more love from the devs.\n", "timestamp_created": 1504358541, "timestamp_updated": 1504358572, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566210", "comment_count": "22", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34676233": {"recommendationid": "34676233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385259135", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511852822}, "language": "english", "review": "GREAT GAME \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "timestamp_created": 1504327731, "timestamp_updated": 1504327731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34675519": {"recommendationid": "34675519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357247532", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "last_played": 1521315577}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the game!!!

It has more than a few clunky parts to it, but I can tell that there's been a lot of thought that's gone into this. From what I am seeing there is likely a dominant and recessive style to things, I only say this because I had a random mutation where my creatures developed gills and all living members with gills died in rapid succession and the offspring of one pairing of their living gill-less children produced an individual with gills. Maybe this was just an example of random chance striking twice, but the system is more complex than one would initially surmise based off of the graphics. The interface of the game is pretty simple, get food, isolate and develop the traits you desire, establish hierarchies so the most important animals get fed first. You have to think long term, but it's a nice game to play and it's easy to interface with while at the same time requiring some planning.

Clearly I wasn't that smart. I had one breeding pair left in a situation with no food. Carnivore waltzed in like he owned the place.

From earlier versions i'm glad it was simple at first because it's easier to survive. But Because of the new updates with the new islands and mutation menu (i like the latest 5.0 beta dayum) Even cross-breeding with a Bearyeana is a suprising and cool addition, it be awesome to cross with the other beasts, but you need to level the playing field if that becomes a thing right?  But here are some small things that can be improved.\n\n- Family tree : I'd like to see a clearer branching and easier tracking of individuals.\n  And what i mean by that is, If i click a creature in the play field and then click on the family tree, the tree will zone in on the specific individual i had originally clicked. That would be so much easier play experience.\n\nAs for tree branching, Is it possible to Have numbers to be alongside a generation to indicate which generation is it? , or say we can assign family rank like cousins, uncles, half- siblings. Or add our own Family description somewhere on the Tree.  Or somehow have a system that auto-matically assigns these titles. Also adding Seperate parties in the same clan. Just my 2 cents.\n\nother thoughts:  Maybe tree climbing genes?  To get at those bird nests muahhaha. or those falling fruit.\na new predator like monkeys stealing youngest babies or nest material  . \n\nWe can have a fruit pile , for drawing in prey, i know it works that way for meat. or a fruit bush already draws in prey. but how bout we can manually place one .\n\nIsland hop: maybe encountering other clans.. or small rougue bands, new communication system , friend or foe,\nwandering males are either heaven sent or a nuisance depending on a situation but if we meet a clan they might not easilly just mate with every female in our clan. unless its a rogue band of males. 8((((  another 2 cents 8)", "timestamp_created": 1500610376, "timestamp_updated": 1500610376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33663882": {"recommendationid": "33663882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388798622", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506637300}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Ok, so this game is about taking care of a pack of animals. They are your species, the only ones in the world.

Like, really. You get a total brain fog.\n\nMy pack usually gets wiped out after there is no females/males left. You then go out and try to find a stray animal, hope it's whatever gender you need, invite it to your pack for 5 food, then find a nest and mate with it.\nIt's really a tiring cycle. Yes, it's a cycle. You will probably run out of the OTHER gender this time, then try and find a stray, etc.\n\nAnyway, the game is not super-fun at all but it IS addicting for the first hours.\nDefinately not for everyone, it personally wasn't for me.\nIt really, really could use a lot more to do, more gamemodes, etc.\nFor me, the weather is always the same.\n'Warm Weather-\nA Warm Breeze Blows'\n\nAlso, when I move islands I only see 2 biomes- a wetlands biome, and the forest-plains biome of the starter island. I move from starter island to wetlands, then off of wetlands to a starter island. All the islands look the same for me pretty much.\n\nEvery time you have to (or just do) make a new world, it is just ALWAYS THE SAME THING!\nSure, genes are differant, but gameplay? Nope.\n\nAnyway, this was fun and addicting at FIRST but NOW I can not bring myself to play it.\n\nI wish I could say something that sounded good about this game, but unfortunately I can not think of much. This is what I CAN recommend\n-Fun at first, addicting at first & interesting at first\n-Cute animals\n-Great potential and game idea, I have to give so much credit to how it is so unique, there is no game like it.\n\nWith the potential thing, the developers really are only using just a tiny, tiny bit of this game's [b]real[/b] potential. That actually makes me sad, this could be a great game.\n\nI think it is still should be Early Acess, its missing something huge that I can't put my finger on. The game just feels a little.. hollow after a while and really is just missing something, but I don't know what.\nI guess that's what you get for buying a game inspired off.. ew..

I find the new patterning system fairly interesting, as I have gotten several same-coloured patterns and furred creatures!( this made me per say a little mad, but only because they all had patterns I hadn't seen yet!)  About half an hour into the game the white and light brown (white being base fur and the light brown being the pattern) ended up being the norm of my mall tribe (which consisted of around 20 creatures) I especially enjoyed the new thrill of encountering a new stranger, because now all of them are more unique! I mean, they were all great before this update but- I'll be honest- their base fur usually impacted what they looked like. Majority of the white strangers had the swimming set, brown creatures usually had stinky tail, fang or spiky body ect. But now, with the exception of a few base things,  their patterns vary, their fur colour is rarely repeated per island ( because I usually see combinations, like white + brown = light brown, white + black = gray so they usually dont ever have any repeats! I have to come back to the graphics - they are utterly flawless! Like always, though these ones just strike me as more interesting- more realistic per say- and the art of all of the mutations, sight, sniffing, gathering ect. is amazing! I love the thicker buttons too- it is so much easier to see them. And the crossbreeding! I havent yet come across the bearyena and I dont really want to until I have a few females / males, sturdy food, a good nest area, maybe a few acorn trees- but it excites me to know that it's now a possibility! Now, before I bore you (which I probably already have done- sorry!) I'll finish it off here. The mutations! putting it at 50% each, I found I could ensure with 100% to have a specific gene (such as blue eyes, or a certain feature like normal eyesight, cracker jaw, digging paw, ect.) and I am not sure whether this is a glitch or put intentionally through the game. But the mutations are in a much better placement too, and to have it not ensured to all creatures, but one, adds in for so much variety. And I lied. One last topic will be adressed. The healing plants! Now, I find this especially interesting. I haven't come across one yet, nor have I come across the sickness, same gene or anything.( I am especially interested to find if the sickness of same gene mutation can be cured ) though I think this addition has been long awaited.It somehow annoys me that (1) Only creatures with claws can use the powers, which, from all I can guess only heals them, (2) It isn't found in the snowy mountaints - where sickness is most common and (3) that I probably can't farm it. I've read an article and apparently I cannot have my creatures in vision of the plant which will cause a drama of not seeing a small area and getting paranoid some predator will come by and eat all my creatures xD.\nBut yes, great job on the update and keep it up!", "timestamp_created": 1500153866, "timestamp_updated": 1500153866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33525587": {"recommendationid": "33525587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356181003", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501530222}, "language": "english", "review": "I have not had any new creatures come in leaving it hard for me to breed because of genetics i wish more would pop up", "timestamp_created": 1499994961, "timestamp_updated": 1499994961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33494913": {"recommendationid": "33494913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162481327", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518581736}, "language": "english", "review": "Niche: A game about making sure those goddamned carnivores don't eat all ur animals dicks off.", "timestamp_created": 1499918767, "timestamp_updated": 1500232590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33467426": {"recommendationid": "33467426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374455987", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 464, "last_played": 1521069718}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was amazing!

I've played for 10 hours and feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the available content. Trying to breed for specific genes while avoiding the complications that come with inbreeding and mutations makes for interesting gameplay. \n\nI really like the direction the development seems to be headed. I've spent most of my time playing on the experimental mutations development branch and I've really enjoyed the new gameplay features that they're building towards. \n\nOverall, the game seems to be really stable. I didn't experience any game breaking bugs or glitches. There are a few minor annoyances that don't seem like much, but add up over time. \n\nThe biggest annoyance, for me, is that you can navigate using WASD or the Arrow keys. I prefer WASD but if I press more than one key at a time (which frequently happens when switching from one direction to another) it immediately begins renaming the currently selected creature. Because of this, I have quite a few creatures named \"sssssss\" and \"asa.\" There's already a mechanic in game where you click on the name and can type in a new one so I'm not sure if this is a feature or a glitch. If a glitch, then I hope it's fixed. If it's a feature then...I really hope it gets fixed. \n\nAnother annoyance is that, as your pack grows, it becomes more difficult to manage each individual creature. While that is as it should be, the problem arises when creatures die and I have no idea why. I think they're dying of old age, but sometimes it might be because they were sick, or wounded, or they starved to death. There is a notifications panel that informs you that a creature died, and you can zoom to the skeleton, but it doesn't tell you who it was or how they died. It's not until two or three turns later that I realize that the creature I was planning a breeding program around was the one that kicked the bucket. \n\nThe other issue is the notification window itself. You get a notification for each sick creature, for when it rains, for when a creature gets a parasite, when they die, and I think several others. The problem with this is that you have to go through and clear each individual notification by hand. I often find myself just closing and ignoring the window altogether because I can't be bothered to clear all of the warnings manually every single turn. \n\nReally though, these complaints are just annoyances. The game itself is adorable, challenging, and a lot of fun. The thing to remember though is that it is a Sandbox. Meaning there are no goals save the ones you set for yourself. There is nothing to tell you what to do or where to go. You learn by experimenting and figuring things out. You learn from your mistakes and you make mental notes for next time. You start to plan ahead and come up with strategies for how to tackle specific goals. The longer you play, the more you learn.\n\nIf you're the type of person that likes sandboxes, setting your own goals, experimentation, and playing god then you'll probably enjoy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1499267567, "timestamp_updated": 1499267567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33272127": {"recommendationid": "33272127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339222785", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 90, "last_played": 1521730816}, "language": "english", "review": "i enjoy that there are different maps and that you always start with a random adam and eve so it is not limited to the same gene zone in every game, different predator and prey in every location and( spoiler) you can unlock a frozen creature from the ice with random traits.\ni enjoy the little details that go into the game such as the mole moving around every turn looking for creature that can harm it or that there are bunny burrows so you can let a creature hide in the grass there instead of random spawning and that you can put in two traits that could pop up in the mutation bar.\nmy friend and i both have it and enjoy playing it (we even share screens over skype to help in hard situations) 10/10 would play again (or even buy it again)", "timestamp_created": 1499256159, "timestamp_updated": 1499256159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33217087": {"recommendationid": "33217087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245873326", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 291, "last_played": 1520930070}, "language": "english", "review": "It's cute and I enjoy seeing how my animals look.", "timestamp_created": 1499148527, "timestamp_updated": 1499148527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33208082": {"recommendationid": "33208082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085045064", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519763879}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not this in depth review writer or anything, so in short this game is a lot of fun to play.

It revolves around these creatures, which aren\u2019t anything specific. Many people describe them as cats and bunnies combined, with plenty more. You start off with Adam and Eve, and must breed them, occasionally using the Mutation Menu in hopes of getting specific or better genetics for your creatures. As you go on you must strategically pick each creature you mate together in order to get the most optimal genetics. There are many islands to go to and fro. During your adventure you\u2019ll come across many challenges, of course. This includes carnivores, who come to of course eat your creatures (or, really, just to kill them), or going into harder islands you\u2019ll encounter birds, who will eat your babies if they\u2019re not within a hexagon (or square, step, spot) of the baby. There\u2019s also Dodomingos who will take every chance they get to steal a nest, and if you attack it, it\u2019ll attract more Dodomingos, and perhaps even carnivores. Perhaps you\u2019ll encounter a Rogue Male (previously Horny Male) who will breed with your females if you\u2019re not watching. There\u2019s also leeches who will attach to unsuspecting creatures, even if they\u2019re on the shore. There are also a few biome specific creatures, such as the different (Hearing, Seeing, and Smelling) Apes, who you\u2019re suppose to run from rather than fight. Or the Mountain Biome creatures, such as Walrus Deer (Who I believe is prey) Arctic Ramfox, who is also like the carnivore, and will steal meat you haven\u2019t picked up, or the infamous Balance Bear. The Balance Bear is the Apes of the Mountain biome. You\u2019re suppose to run from it, rather than fight it, and it only appears during snow.\n\nThere\u2019s also many prey. Your creatures are omnivores, and will probably mainly be eating berries, which you of course get from berry bushes. You\u2019ll find them quite commonly in grass biomes. There\u2019s also trees which drop acorns. To collect them you need a creature with the cracking abilities, so you must have Cracker Jaw. Using the Cracker Jaw you are also able to get Clams, which will be just barely in the water. In the water there is also fish, which creatures with Fishing Tail, and I believe Claw can fish out for some extra food. On land there are Bunnies, which spawn from Bunny Holes, or Stagmoles, which come up from holes naturally spawned, which will hide underneath the surface if they see one of your creatures.\n\nThere is a lot of strategy to Niche. Food, as I have previously mentioned, is a must. If you have too little food your creatures will starve, taking a day off there lifespan. On the note of lifespan, your creatures live 25 days, I believe, and 5 of those days are spent being a child (one without a gem, two with one gem, two with two gems, or something like that) There is also a lot of strategy to breeding creatures. You need to make sure they don\u2019t have any Immunity Genes that are the same, otherwise they\u2019ll be sick their whole life, and they can spread it. Every creature has two Immunity Genes. Some tend to be passed down more often than others.  You also want the most optimal genes. Many people dislike Spiky Body, and you definitely don\u2019t want Crippled Paw (previously No Paw), nor do you want Blindness, or Short-sighted Eyes for that matter. Hemophilia is another thing you don\u2019t want, as it makes it so creatures bleed more often when attacked.\n\nNow onto more opinionated subjects. Niche was previously almost unplayable due to how laggy it was. Luckily they\u2019ve optimized it much more, and it runs smoother. (Until the Mountain Update, which they\u2019re currently fixing. Tip: It\u2019s a lot less laggy when you make the camera look down at the creatures. It won\u2019t go completely above them, just angle it as bird\u2019s eye view as possible, if that makes sense.) Though note, I have a \u201cpotato\u201d computer, or an old/bad computer. Even with that in mind, though, others have been having the same problem as me with the recent update. Other than that, the main things I find to be laggy is the Mutation Menu and Family Tree, which I hope they fix, and it has been a problem for quite some time.\n\nPersonally I think Niche becomes boring very quickly. As in, I don\u2019t stay with one world very long. Not everyone is like this, but I find that many people agree with me. I\u2019m sure as the updates come, giving us new opponents, biomes, and genetics this will decrease, but it is noticeable. I generally only stay with a world for 2 hours. Though I don\u2019t play the game enough inbetween updates, so that doesn\u2019t help. With each new update you usually have to delete any old worlds you had in the previous update. Though this should be expected from an early access game. On that note, you can only have three saves/worlds at a time. It doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but personally I\u2019ve never found this to be a problem. It\u2019s hard to keep track of multiple worlds.\n\nI also want to mention that this game will tend to be boring if you think of it super strategically. I mean, you still want to, especially if you want to get to the harder worlds. Sometimes, though, to spice things up try to add some roleplay in. It\u2019s been very entertaining. (Currently I have a world, and on the small island that you start on I had twins. One was dark, I named him Moon, and the other was light/cream, and I named her Sun. Basically she had an affair with a rogue, and when they went to the new island they separated, since Moon was mad about the affair, leaving the rest of the pack to choose between them. I now have Sun Pack and Moon Pack (It was also really convenient since a river splits the island in half)) It\u2019s because of my roleplays that have kept me going. Sometimes I\u2019m unoriginal, copying a few ideas (Such as gods and goddesses) from Jessimew, a Youtuber I enjoy watching. Overall, though, most of these ideas transform and become my own. Anyway, I just want you all to realize how fun it can be to add elements of story to your game.\n\nNow onto some glitches. There are two main ones I have found, which have been there since I started playing. I cannot stress how game breaking (or at least cheap) these two things are, and honestly makes me want to stop playing a certain world some times. So, gender generation. This is the most annoying thing. I tend to get only females (yet for humans, males are born more often, and generally it\u2019s supposed to be 50-50) This might just be bad luck, but it happens all the time. Either that, or I get only males. I\u2019ve noticed this with a few other people as well. Currently I have two new generations in a world, there are 30 creatures. Out of all of those, nine of them are male. (Also unluckily born with terrible traits, such as blindness, but of course that\u2019s on me.) While it\u2019s possible, one of my females had 8 children, only two of them were males, and similar patterns such as these. Once again, they might simply be me being unlucky, but it\u2019s happened to often for me to ignore. I\u2019d appreciate it if they fixed the random gender generation or whatever. My other complaint, however, is that when you log out and log back in it\u2019s generally raining. Especially if your bushes were just about to dry out. Honestly, I tend to log out when the bushes dry out (Not to take advantage of the glitch, but because it\u2019s been enough turns to where I\u2019ve gotten bored) and of course, to my dismay, it\u2019s raining, getting rid of any sort of challenge of food. I\u2019ve noticed this happen to some Youtubers as well, this is another glitch I would appreciate if it was fixed.\n\nOverall, even with the few glitches and lag that Niche \u2013 a genetics survival game contains, it is still wonderful. Especially recently I\u2019ve been interested in the ecosystem/genetics and this game is perfect. I have very few complaints, and the complaints I do have should be fixed in future updates, I expect. Anyway, this has been a long review.

The many different genetic challenges the game presents keeps you on your toes as well as an almost constant food problem as your clan grows. I love the challenges but there are somethings that bother me. If one baby is born sick it infects both parents usually and then at least half the clan, i get the illness idea, and find it authentic but i don't like having all these creatures become useless as they get sick and it doesn't go away in a couple turns. The first time i accidentally bred a creature with two of the same immune types and it got sick, it wiped out half my clan, including my two new fabulous twins that I needed. The added rank system for each creature is useful, but i don't like not being able to simply scare away those you've casted out and you don't want, like maybe we should be able to mark territory or something as to not lose any berries to them without killing them. There is so much good about this game so far and i'm excited to see what else is added! it might be cool if at some point there could be an online feature to meet other clans and mingle.

While lacking a tutorial, the game is straightforward enough to figure out the basics on your own. I was worried the player would need a working knowledge of mendelian inheritance to play the game, thankfully I've discovered its just a nice perk. In fact, this is probably as straightforward as a breeding game is ever going to get in the modern era. That does not mean you will last long without a considerable amount of effort and some quick thinking, because it doen't. I especially like that you can mutate in traits, quite a useful starting point in a game where the situation is often unclear at first. I especially like the subtle differences between each biome and the things that you can find by exploring the map, including weird hybrid animals you can have your creatures hunt. The fact that I've not been able to make it far in some habitats just yet is proof that there is a lot to learn about this game in the best sense of the word. \n\nA bit of constructive critisism, however: The hex-based movement is a bit hard to figure out at first, and its a bit TOO easy to do some things like breeding or attacking, such that you sometimes do them by accident. Disease is also just slightly OP in how fast it spreads. The starting island is also a little short on resources, I find myself feeling the urge to leave it by the time the second generation reaches adulthood. I also think the player's creatures in the game could use a few more 'extreme' traits, its just an easy way to increase the fun factor. \n\nOther than these various minor problems, you have a delightfully addictive little thing that allows you to gently tweak a bunch of squirrel/cat/fox creatures into all sorts of forms and see what works in what habitat. Its all too easy to lose, but the surprising diffuculty is excactly what keeps the game from getting old quick.

I think negatives should come first. Let's start with the cutscene at the very beginning of the story mode. That was new to this version and i was pretty excited to see some plot...but it never played properly. In fact it didn't play at all for me and jumped straight to the starting island with Adam and the tutorial. The first few seconds of the animation looked nice at least? I hope you guys get to look into it so it plays completely. I love the soft water and oil paint artstyle you guys settled for so i'm really hoping. The first thing I noticed when the isalnd spawned in with everything was how much lower poly and unstable everything looked. All prior versions had much higher detail in all models and textures. The grass had sharper and more realistic shading, there were trees to break up the landscape(which didn't interrupt play very much to be honest) and the ground no longer looks like a glossy surface playing board like it used to. The ground is an especially disturbing change. It now looks like a series of janky green models stuck together and was labeled the floor. the edges of many of the hexegon tiles have white seam lines that show tiny bits of white space poking through from somewherer. presumably unused space underneath the stage model. This problem also applies to some creature models. I only noticed it in fully black or nearly black creatures so far. Next I'd like to talk about the \"passing day\" animation.  it's very jumpy and takes a few seconds to figure out what everything should be doing. Especially when on rainy days. It's like the game traded in it's polish for a pretty title screen and non-functioning cutscene:p \nOn the positive side, the breeding has gotten much more satisfying. Identical creature occur much less frequently and random mutations are slightly rarer and more isolated, making it more managable to get a strong dominant trait going. Plus lots more gorgeous patterns and colors beyond natural fur colors. Story was a nice addition even if I only got like 2% of it from the broken cut scene. I'd like to see that developed beyond the tutorial, please. Maybe missions or something? \nI get the feeling something went wrong with development shortly before it's full release, so i'm willing to give it the benifit of the doubt that it will improve with further updates soon.

So, basically, you control a tribe of creatures. I'll measure their intelligence on three levels: Brainless, moronic, and just plain dumb.\n\n\nACTUALLY BEING SERIOUS\n The genetics aspect keeps the game diverse, with many combinations of creatures. The immunity genes keep players from having a slide through the game(where two similar genes cause instant sickness, preventing siblings from mating. That's gross, anyway. Who does that? Greek gods, I guess...). However, I do have a bit o' criticisms for Niche. First, wild creatures can be sick or completely infertile(For little two year olds who are somehow using this platform, infertility is where reproduction is impossible). Because of immunity genes, total infertility of wild creatures can cause fertility to burn out, killing off an entire tribe. Not fun. When wild animals are sick, a tribe member finding one can result in a requirement to quarentine both animals.\nRest in pepperonis, Evola. 2017-2017. You probably will be forgotten within two days.\n  If team Niche could modify wild spawning, this could prevent fertility burning out in tribes. Just a note: I lost two tribes to infertility. Other than that, great game, with plenty of genetic combinations to keep the game from becoming more boring than fidget spinners(I'm sorry, I'm a fidget hater, this review is dragging on, I'm done.

Also I think that the fertility addition could have a small chance like 5 in 1000 chance of letting females mate with other females.

Difficulty is controlled by the player based on which habitats you choose to migrate your creatures to from the relatively safe meadows to mountain tops full of predators waiting to eat those who avoid freezing to death. \n\nWhere Niche really shines in the \"realistic\" genetics system which controls the abilities your animals have to help them survive - such as the ability to crack open shellfish or dig for food - and includes various genetic defects and penalties for inbreeding. Combined with the migration system which limits you to a small number of creatures migrating to each new world it forces you to plan ahead. In addition, many abilities are mutually exclusive forcing you to choose which niche your particular creature is going to fill.  \n\nOne draw-back at the point of writing is that some abilities/resources are unbalanced. I've managed many successful cautious berry-picking species and some omnivorous coastal creatures but I've yet to make fishing be worth the effort. \n\nOverall Niche is an enjoyable relaxed game, with adorable art and sound effects.

You can't have a genetic survival game with out predators, sickness, temerature, and disabilities. Not many games have all of those. The constant updates are annoying but more importantly needed. Without updates every little bug would be there forever.\n\nOfcorse, not every game is flawless, Niche does have it's downsides. For instance, the game can be verry challenging, wich is good if you're the type of person who likes challenges. There are many predators of all kinds but they tend to surround your creatures all at once. Maybe they are pack predators, but if so it is difficult to fight them all off. Personaly, having only two DNA slots to put traits in is annoying. I had a lot of blind creatures that also were limbless so I had to keep  the clear eye trail and long legs trait in the slots and not something cool like gills or poisonous teeth.

Pressing 'Play' the UI now presents you with two different game modes which are 'Story' and 'Sandbox'.\n\n'Story' mode is like a beginners tutorial. It tells a little story about the first two Niche creatures on the island while teaching you to work the game.Much of the in-game UI has changed since Early Access and the tutorial now goes over where most things are located and what things are. \n\nI made mention of a few things missing in my last review which are still missing in this version of the official release of the tutorial.\n- no explanation of gene menu\n- no explanation of mutation menu or using it\n- it points out nest and food, but somehow forgets and important point of pointing out population?\n\nadditionally i feel like it should have mentioned RANK (alpha, beta, omega) as it plays an important role. it doesn't mention this even briefly.\n\n'Sandbox' mode is what you would expect it to be. It is what most people who have played the game before, or have done the tutorial already, would play. It now allows for MANY different starting settings compared to what was just a one size approach in Early Access. For example if you chose 'Easy Islands' and 'Tiny Green' it would give you smaller size islands that are grassy at the start of your game. There are Easy/Medium/Hard/Killer settings for different island difficulties as well as different biome types.\n\nFortunately now that niche has reached a more 'stable' state information about what the tutorial leaves out can be found if there are questions about it.

It will possibly lower in price at full release, but it may increase as well.

They're pretty annoying and very much in the way.\nThe other glitch is that I have two big tree trunks but no trees. Acorns are falling and one of the trees did fully appear for 0.5 second once, I do have another tree that I can fully see all the time though.\nThe suggestion to making the game better is that if an animal gets infected with a common cold from another animal, if you then separate them, the one that got infected should get healthy again after a while (maybe a night or two?). If an animal is born with it because of similar immunity genes, of course it can't get healthy; I just mean the ones that are born healthy and then get infected.\nI hope you will read and take my suggestion into consideration :)\nApart from that I love the game! The crab things and the big eared apes are a cool part of the game (the one ape that I encountered has been living for ages though, maybe shorten down the life span/defence a little?) in addition to the carnivores.

A Sandbox Mode\nPros :\nYou could plan a genetic code for those other non-sandbox tribes \nThis could be used for people who arn't the best at surviving ( Like me )\nYou could experiment with different fur and mane color combinations that are nearly impossible to get in the game.\nCons : \nIt could get boring really fast\nIt could take up a whole save slot ;-;\nHow it could work :\nInstead of making a whole savefile needed, you could make it more of a trophy ( maybe for beating an end goal >30 )\nYou could make it more of an CAS like in TS3, or any DollDivine game. Or make it where you customize Adam and Eve and go from there. focusing more on breeding with unlimited food. ( Maybe even customizing the kiddos too!)\n\n2.  The End Goal ( I'm aware they have one planned, but heres an idea ; No pro-con system for this one :P just ideas)\n- make the end goal clearing every island\n- Unlocking all the mutation board genes\n- getting to the SPECIAL island ( by reaching one of these other goals. )\n- Getting a certain creature ( randomized )\n\n\nThose are just a few things!

If you have played the original Kickstarter demo, a lot of features were added, but somehow the game feels pretty much the same.\n\nPlayed the Kickstarter Demo, and also most recently at Quo Vadis 2017, and on the day of this review, and it doesn't make a polished or even sophisticated impression. After so much time and money invested, especially the UX could be a lot better. Even with a person explaining the newest additions to the game to me, I felt myself lost in the game. The menus are highly static, and the camera controls are so basic, it's not enjoyable to navigate the game.\n\nArtistically, the game has a long way to go - the creatures are not animated in any real sense, and face the player as billboards (I don't quite understand this design decision). They have some faint breathing animation, but other than that all they do is follow the mouse cursor with their heads, which are on a ball joint (not actual IK targets or anything). You can actually turn their heads 360\u00b0 and more by circling them with the mouse.\n\nCopious amounts of grass can often make the gameplay very obscure, because it occludes UI and other important elements on the screen.\n\nWhen you drop a creature into the water, the game makes no effort to explain what happened. They'll drown in a real awkward position way below the map, even though you could just move them out of the water again.\n\nThe game mechanics are interesting enough, but obscured by a very unwieldy UI. Especially combat is plain awful and could use several iterations of revision. :) There are some moments when the game is really interesting, usually when you need to bootstrap your tribe after a mishap.\n\nI chose to not recommend this game because it's simply not moving anywhere fast, and is technically and design-wise still lacking in a lot of places. Gameplay is generally bland and repetitive, and UX is poor. The graphics are subpar and animations basically nonexistent.\n\nI'll update this review for the release version which is slated for August.

I say this in a good way. All the creatures -- well most of them -- are adorable and cute and as you're playing this game, trying to get and mutate and breed the perfect survival genes, and making sure they have plenty of food for the growing pack, you grow attached to the nichelings and when you lose one or all of the pack members, it becomes devastating. It's easy to get attached to the creatures in this game, especially when you've watched them be born, grow up, give birth then die of old age. It takes a lot of practice and determination to get these creatures to survive through many generations and to mutate and come up with the perfect genes that helps them survive in each of the biomes or \"islands\" but you won't be dissappointed when you play this game because it teaches that for every action, there are consequences, whether you're trying to sneak up on one of the mole creatures or use your creatures' last move to move them into a pool of water (even though they have no gills or their swimming skill's very low).

Niche, a Genetics Survival Game is wholy unique in its gameplay, with new features added every month. In no way, shape, or form are you meant to grow bored with the absolute variety of genetics to pick over and mutate: Genes for underwater survival, genes for the cold, snowy climates, genes meant for stealth and warding off predator, genes meant for the fastest of creatures, and genes you avoid at all costs yet still manage to keep them in your pack anyway. This game can be hours of fun and sometimes it can be minutes of frustration, but this is all due to the game's random generation and luck aspect. When you have a child, you have no idea which genes they will inherit from their parents, and there is only so much you can put in the mutation menu before you just have to cross your fingers and pray. \n\nIt is very easy to grow attached to a certain creature in your group, even when they may not have the best genetics. When food is short you struggle on who to keep and who to banish, who collects food in the face of a carnivore attack and who risks their lives. It's not very simple to make a perfect tribe, and more than once I have been forced to sacrifice a baby to a bird or move a dying elder into the waiting jaws of a carnivore, just because they were sick and I lacked strong creatures who could protect them. Several times I have grown teary eyed when my favorite creature dies or I am forced to leave behind reliable creatures because they aren't prime genetic material. \n\nOverall, this game is made to challenge you with its multiple avenues of genetic exploration and completely random world generation and infuriating obstacles. Some may view it as a casual time waster, and some may view it as a chance to weave a story. I will be honest when I have viewed it as one or the other on several different occasions. The fact of the matter is that, if you let it, this game will worm its way into your heart, make a nest, and have a ton of nichelings. \n\nAs a player, I have invested over 60 hours into this game, and every time there is a new update I willingly make myself comfortable and invest another good chunk of time in a single sitting. Whenever I am bored, I can easily open up this game and either start where I left off or begin a completely new save.  Thank you guys for making a game I can casually enjoy yet invest myself so deeply that I cannot untangle myself from the web of genetics.

I eagerly await updates and all of the amazing content available. I highly recommend this game for animal lovers and strategists who don't mind a creative twist on games.

I have installed both the windows and mac versions of this game. Both have beautiful graphics, designs and music. \n\nHowever, there is very obvious lacking in the mac version when I move the camera, moving across the island or zooming in and out to view the island. It does not really affect the game progress but does annoy me when I have to wait a few seconds to make the next move. On the other hand, the windows version has been very smooth with minimum lacking, although the game recently froze while I was playing. Thankfully, the game progress was unaffected, and I could continue the game after waiting for a few seconds. \n\nOverall, I find that the windows version is slightly better than the mac version. But both were enjoyable enough to play for long periods of time nonetheless. Please do note that what I typed above is only about the sandbox mode in the game, as I have yet to play the story mode on both versions.\n\nOld review:\nThis version of niche, 0.3.3 has been very smooth and so far the most enjoyable version. However, there are still some slight lacking and i seem to be unable to unlock the berry paw despite collecting a lot of berries.

I know that it's an Early Access game, that's why I added \u201cin its current state\u201d.\n\nAnd here the long version:\nI bought this game yesterday, thanks to all the positive reviews and the promising \u201cLet's Play\u201d on YouTube.\nI started the game, read the tutorial, started to explore the first island and make babies.\nI never had a food problem, since I used most of my pack to hunt and gather food, while 3-4 members explored and cut grass. After 30 minutes I had explored the island, killed all hostile mobs and accepted everyone into my pack. The hostile mobs were no problem to my exploring members, they simply ganged up on the enemy.\nSo, with the new blood from the few new members I was in the third generation and to prevent insect I decided to move immediately to the next island. Sadly, I approached the relocate point only with one member of my pack and it was the only one I had on the new island. I thought my entire pack will be relocated, but what ever. Luckily, on my second island, I met a partner pretty fast and started the same routine: make babies collect food, explore and kill hostiles.\n\nBut after I had explored a bit, I asked myself: \u201cWhat now?\u201d.\nYes, you can explore 10 islands and collect all different genes, but for me this is like walking through 10 identical rooms and only the colors change. And since there is nothing else to do, no goal and no achievements (yet) \u2013 I simply got bored.\n\nAnd there you have it:\nA game for 18\u20ac that gets boring after only an hour \u2013 that's what I mean with \u201clittle content for it's price\u201d.\n\nPlease comment, if missed something interesting I can do in the game.\nI also have no intention to refund the game and hope that future content makes me change this review.", "timestamp_created": 1494085739, "timestamp_updated": 1494139833, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657474", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31556012": {"recommendationid": "31556012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369258797", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517842415}, "language": "english", "review": "i love niche the buggy mountain update is awesome i love it sooo much but.....\nthe only thing i dont like is that if an animal dies or didnt travel with the rest dissapears i would like it if you can make the family tree members stay like if the first one like adam dies he is still in the family tree and the more animals in the tribe than the family tree gets longer and has a scroll bar \n\nthank you", "timestamp_created": 1493978041, "timestamp_updated": 1493978041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31509854": {"recommendationid": "31509854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341383551", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 817, "last_played": 1521687173}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the hell out of this game!

I personally like my Adam and Eve bloodline to be carried down to my main group. I might have mutiple breeders who I deam as Alphas, but if I have blind, faulty, or genetically poor to bee lookouts and those are the omegas. My 'Food Takers' are beta along with the 'Scouts' who also might stumble accross food. Whoever my Alphas are, they also usually are my favorites.

Simple, and super addictive! It's so much fun to micro-manage your little guys while bearing in mind that they only have so many \"moves\" per day. The in-game mechanics are a little tough to pick up at first, as it's a very new and as-yet-unfinished game. The team is still actively making updates and restructuring, so there are some small glitches here and there (although, in the hours I've put in, I really didn't notice very many at all). They are still working on a full tutorial, but anyone dedicated enough to put in like a half hour to learn the controls is in for a major treat. Bottom line, I am so thrilled. There has been a hole in the market just waiting to be filled by a game like this for years, and the attention to detail that the team who is creating Niche are putting into this makes it charming and engaging.

But really, the game couldn't be simpler; can you live to survive another day with whatever genetics you can manage to pull together?\n\nTo anyone who is considering getting this game, I most definatly recommend. However, I will give some ups and downs for you to consider.\n\nThis game is perfect for biology nerds (like myself) who love random chance with genetics. There is always a small possiblity that things can go, A: How you want them, B: Okay, yet not exactly choice, or C: Horribly wrong. In a way, this game gambles, but nothing more than the survival of fictional characters who's lives you can really develop through story of your own imagination.\nI know many times with my own tribe, I end up breeding two creatures who are not going to be able to provide healthy children for my group of nichelings at all, simply because 'Hey, these two both lost their parents when they were young; they might bond over that and could be in grief when their child might end up dying from bad genes.'\nIn that way, you can create a connection with this game that is so much more complex than the game itself really is. You can see that with many YouTubers who create videos of this game. After a while, it does get a bit boring breeding generation after generation, but you can play around with chance and develop stories from it, even if you wont be sharing them with anyone but yourself.\nNot only that, but the sheer diversity that is in this game, even in it's Alpha stage is amazing. You can go from having a creature who cannot do anything to contribute to keeping your tribe alive, as they have no paws and maybe some genes that might shorten their life span. Or, you could have creatures who specialize in berry picking and have beautiful cosmetic genes. The options are limitless. There's always that constant drive to try and get your creatures just the way you like them, and there are many things to keep you on your toes, from predators, to birds who steal your nests, and even different islands that pose different challenges in themselves.\n\nAs I said above, the game can get quite repetitve if all you're doing is breeding non-stop without any story line. Without that small bit of 'Hey, let's just try this out, and see what happens', it gets dull and a bit boring. There are other times where I find myself quiting the game for a few days, because no matter who I breed the genetics seem to come out horribly wrong. That said, usually I come back with a positive outlook and new hope that my tribe will be alright, and try not to let myself get upset by the random chances that can indeed occur.\nThere's also the fact that this is (as of now, 4/10/17, and probably a few months after that) an alpha game. There is bound to be a lot of changes, and sometimes bugs that we just have to work through. If you don't think that an alpha game is for you, I garuntee, once this game is released fully, there will be no doubts in my mind that it is fully worth the 18 dollars to which it's currently priced.\nThere is so much potential for this game, and I really can't wait to see how amazing it is finsihed when right now it still has me in awe.", "timestamp_created": 1491883073, "timestamp_updated": 1491883073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31070834": {"recommendationid": "31070834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063839285", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506562412}, "language": "english", "review": "This game's style is cute and the gameplay is fun.

It was the first one and so far only game I've found that makes a genetics game really enjoyable! So I put it on my wishlist for about a month but then I couldn't stand it anymore I had to buy it! And since then I've not been disappointed! The game has developed into a joy to play. The controls and even the complexities of the game really are not hard to figure out once you've been at it a bit. The genes are amazing too! I simply can't get over how complex your breeding choices are to make! \n\nOne thing I think would really make the game really realistic but also be challenging is if there was a genetic problem that showed up if you began to breed family members within 4 generations...maybe 3 to make it easier for players. I know something like that does exist within the immunity genes but if you have two siblings that have completely opposite immunities then it can work out in your favor. But I think it would really interesting if a genetic problem showed up if you bred family together...maybe they were born with a special body that you only get with interbreeding. Like a deformed/tiny body. (Note not lean like there already is but tiny...smaller than the lean would it.) This body would probably be as small as a teenager normally would be. Maybe even make it more likely for that baby to have double immunity babies if bred with someone. Even if who they bred with had completely different immunities. Just a thought. :)\n\nCan't wait to see what other updates are in store! I hope you reach your goal Stray Fawn Studio!

It is strategic, but at the same time very open. The game allows you to play around with genetics and you get to decide what you're trying to achieve. The ultimate goal of the game is to survive though, which can be difficult at times, but never frustratingly so. As of every update, I feel like the game is becoming more balanced. The graphics in this game are simple, unique and cute. The creatures change in appearance as the player breeds them with each other and this is one of the things that are very fun to play around with! You never know quite what to expect, which is fun! You also get to explore and as you unveil tiles, you find resorces that will help you survive. This part can be fun when you find new things, but a lot of times you sadly don't find very much. The drawbacks this games has is that it can become repetitive and too easy if you play it for a long time. When the goal of surviving is reached there's not really anything else to strive for.

Easy gives maybe one bad gene of the pairing, Medium would have 2, and Hard have 3 to 4.\n\nSecond on the genes, venomous fangs, why is it like the hardest 'head' to get?  Even with Adam having it all the time, full set on his genes, and Eve having two different face genes, hers ALWAYS overpowers the venomous fangs.

Wie wir wissen, gibt es dominante und rezessive Gene, die im Spiel, bestimmten Eigenschaften zugeordnet sind und von denen wir, jederzeit, Einblick haben bei unseren erwachsenen Tieren. Am Anfang k\u00f6nnen wir also schon erahnen: Wir m\u00fcssen viel Nachwuchs generieren, damit die genetische Vielfalt zunimmt und wir f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chste Generation versuchen k\u00f6nnen, die besseren Eigenschaften, den n\u00e4chsten Kindern weiterzugeben, damit diese noch \u00fcberlebensf\u00e4higer werden. Mehr Nachwuchs bedeute aber wiederum auch, mehr Nahrungsbedarf und auf Nahrung k\u00f6nnen wir auf keinen Fall verzichten. Doch haben wir schlau unsere Tierchen verpaart, k\u00f6nnte der n\u00e4chste Nachwuchs vielleicht viel effizienter Nahrung sammeln, als es die Eltern-Tiere noch konnten. Genauso handelt es sich um die Gefahren. Wilde Tiere k\u00f6nnen wir zu Anfang nur schwer bek\u00e4mpfen. Zudem reduziert jede Verletzung die maximale Lebensspanne eines Tiers (und ja..auch in diesem Spiel sterben leider unsere Tierchen fr\u00fcher oder sp\u00e4ter) Doch auch hier, k\u00f6nnte uns das clevere Genetik-System helfen. Vielleicht schaffen wir es, eine genetische Eigenschaft, unseren Tierchen zu vererben, damit die n\u00e4chste Generation effizienter gegen wilde Tiere k\u00e4mpfen kann. Z.b. hat unser Nachwuchs zu Beginn ein Horn, das in der n\u00e4chsten Generation voll ausgepr\u00e4gt ist. Vielleicht haben sie sogar schon ein zweites? Viele genetische Kombinationen sind m\u00f6glich und helfen unseren Tierchen, sich der Umwelt anzupassen. So ist es auch m\u00f6glich, dass unsere Tierchen evolution\u00e4r, gr\u00f6\u00dfer oder kleiner werden, was alles wiederum Vor und Nachteile hat. Vielleicht werden sie besser schwimmen k\u00f6nnen? So k\u00f6nnen auch Fell und Fellmuster vererbt werden oder durch genetische Mutation, entstehen ganz neue Kombinationen. Viele k\u00f6rperliche Elemente spielen eine Rolle. \n\nWie im echten Leben, in denen sich \u00fcber tausende Jahren Tiere und auch wir Menschen, uns evolution\u00e4r angepasst haben auf unsere Umwelt, so geschieht dies auch in diesem Spiel. Im Gegensatz zu Spore, haben wir nicht die volle Kontrolle, welche Eigenschaften oder K\u00f6rperteile unsere Tierchen bekommen, sondern m\u00fcssen erst das System der Genetik verstehen, um einen gewissen Einfluss darauf zu haben. Einen Baukasten findet man hier nicht. Wir k\u00f6nnen innerhalb einer Generation darauf hinarbeiten, wie die Nachfahren unserer Tierchen werden k\u00f6nnten. Das alles macht das ganze extrem reizvoll und hat einen hohen Wiederspielwert.\n\nUnsere Tierchen sind auch nicht gezwungen, auf der Insel zu bleiben. Es besteht die M\u00f6glichkeit, mit unserer Meute auch ein neues Gebiet zu suchen, um neue Ortschaften zu entdecken. Damit erweitert sich der Spielumfang nochmal deutlich.\n\nZu der Grafik kann man als erstes sagen: Wie s\u00fc\u00df sind diese Wesen gestaltet? Ich muss sagen, seit Ori and the blind forest, haben ich kein s\u00fc\u00dfer gestaltetes Wesen gesehen. Sehr liebevoll detailliert und was mir sehr gut gef\u00e4llt, sind die Tierchen, die den Kopf immer mit dem Mauszeiger bewegen. \nDie Umgebung ist auch recht h\u00fcbsch gestaltet aber mehr zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig. Da k\u00f6nnte man mehr Details und Lebendigkeit einbauen. Der Stil allgemein ist mehr Comichaft Allerdings. nicht zu bunt, sondern auch etwas ernster. Das Spiel ist nun mal auch nicht ganz so fr\u00f6hlich, wie es den Anschein hat. Es besch\u00e4ftigt sich mit dem leben aber auch mit dem Tod und das auf einer doch rationalen Art und wei\u00dfe aber wer behauptete auch, das die Natur immer fr\u00f6hlich ist und keine Schattenseite hat?\n\nUntermalt wird das Ganze, mit der immerzu laufenden, ruhigen aber wie ich finde auch irgendwie traurig, klingenden Melodie. Eine entspannte Melodie, die mich aber auch auf eine gewisse Art und wei\u00dfe ber\u00fchrt und mich irgendwie einach traurig stimmen l\u00e4sst. Vielleicht aus der Tatsache heraus, das meine s\u00fc\u00dfen Tierchen irgendwann auch sterben werden und deren Nachwuchs ebenfalls. Das nicht f\u00fcr ewig bleibt. Es ist schwer zu beschreiben. Vielleicht um das Ganze ein bisschen..wirklich nur ein bisschen, aufzulockern, w\u00e4re eine Idee, noch andere Melodiest\u00fccke einzubauen, die auch ein wenig fr\u00f6hlicher klingen. Das ist aber auch ein ganz eigener pers\u00f6nlicher Wunsch und f\u00e4llt nicht in meine allgemeine Kritikliste.\n\nDas Interface ist nett aber sehr zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig und wirkt noch unausgereift. Es ist schwer sich trotz Hilfen am Anfang zurechtzufinden. Tooltipps fehlen und die Symbole erkl\u00e4ren sich auch nicht gleich von selbst. Da muss man auf jedenfalls noch was machen.\nAuch ein deutlich umfangreicheres Tutorial ist Pflicht, da das Thema der Genetik, viel zu komplex ist, um es mit einfachen Bildchen zu erkl\u00e4ren.\n\nZusammenfassung: \nNiche - a genetics survival game ist ein sehr sch\u00f6nes, liebevoll gestaltetes Spiel, das sehr gut, wie ich finde, das System der Genetik auch wiedergibt. Eine sehr gute Simulation der Evolution und der eigentlichen Natur in einer rationalen Art und wei\u00dfe. Leben entsteht und passt sich der Umwelt an, in dem die daf\u00fcr n\u00f6tigen Eigenschaften, durch Vererbung, den Nachkommen weitergegeben werden. Und leben vergeht. Die alte Generation, die naturgem\u00e4\u00df ausgedient hat.  Ein nie endender Prozess. Der Kreislauf des Lebens. Dieses Spiel simuliert die Natur, so wie sie ist, gepaart aber mit auflockernden Comicstil, s\u00fc\u00dfen Tierchen, sch\u00f6ner Umgebung und mit Survival-Elementen. \nDas Interface und Tutorial, sind gef\u00fchlt die gr\u00f6\u00dften Baustellen und damit auch f\u00fcr mich die gr\u00f6\u00dften Kritikpunkte, die aber dem Early Acces Status, h\u00f6chst wahrscheinlich zu verschulden sind und damit absolut verschmerzbar. \nDie Updates scheinen etwas zu brachen, ver\u00e4ndern aber das Spiel recht umfangreich. \nNoch ein wunsch, w\u00e4re nat\u00fcrlich mehr content, wenn es irgendwie in das Spiele-Schema passen w\u00fcrde.\n\nSchlussendlich zeigt aber Niche sehr gut, was ewiges Leben wirklich bedeutet. Das ein Teil unseren Eltern und deren Eltern aber auch ein Teil von uns, in unseren Kindern und deren Kindern, immer weiter existieren wird. Somit sind wir alle, auf eine anderen nat\u00fcrlichen wei\u00dfe, unsterblich.\n\nEdit 22.02.2017\nTja wie es der Zufall so will, kam praktisch am gleichen Tag meiner Review, das versprochene Februar Update. Neue Landschaft (Dschungel) und Umstrukturierung des Interface. Das geht auf jedenfall in die richtige Richtung. Auch wird ein umfangreicheres Tutorial versprochen. Ebenfalls positiv! Man kann nun auch Nester selber bauen. Mein lieblings Feature ist aber ganz klar, die M\u00f6glichkeit, zwischen  visueller, akustischer ud olfaktorischer (Geruchsinn) wahrnehmung hin und her zu wechseln um Nahrungsquellen und gefahren von weiter weg wahrzunehmen. Ein tolles Update. Bitte weiter so!\n\nEdit: 16.05.2017\nUnd wieder ein neuer Patch und extrem erfreulich finde ich, dass es das Spiel nun auch auf deutsch gibt! Spitze! \nZudem gibt es nun ein Temparatur-Feature mit passenden resistenzen und \u00fcberarbeitete Inseln. Gef\u00e4llt mir sehr gut.

Niche is a genetics manager game- where you must manage your tribe's food, amount of nesting material you have to be able to have children, and your population as well as their genes. \n\nYou must learn to balance out food for each tribe members. This can be a rough task at first, but as you pla the game more, you will realize how simple it is to get food, and how abundant the food in Niche really can be. Depending on your tribe's genetics, you may be able to quickly gain food by fishing, collecting berries, and collecting meat from crabs, rabbits, and other prey.\n\nYou must learn to gather nesting material or find a nest already placed on your island. Nests can be quite abundant as well, but it is nice having a nest you built yourself, because you can choose it's location. It can be placed next to a large amount of food. If you pick a pre-built nest it can be rough starting out depending on how close you are to your food sources. Building nests costs nesting material, and you get this from grass.\n\nLike every ecosystem, there are predators. Depending on which habitat you choose to reside in, you will have different predators. These predators will easily kill you, unless you have the proper genetics to fend for yourself. There are many different genes you can use to protect yourself. All of these look different, and have different stats. The stronger genes you choose, the easier it will be to defend yourself.\n\nThese genes come from breeding your creatures together. Just like in the wild, the strongest nichelings will survive. If they are sickly, they will die quickly.\n\nThis game is a very relaxing game, and is playable for hours.

The only real things I would recommend would be to allow the player to be able to select the individual creatures through the family tree, or be able to mark them somehow. (Basically I keep planning out breeding schedules and then forgetting who I was going to breed with who...)\n\nA slight warning for sexual abuse victims, however, there is a mechanic that could be triggering, which involves an unknown 'horny male' randomly appearing and mating with females in your population.

Also I'm gonna do a new pro-con format inspired by a shelter 2 review. Forgot the user but you can find them)\nEdit: hours spent on splatoon 2: 140+\n\nSo many of you have probably seen Seri's gameplay of Niche (including me, I'm guilty) and decided to give it a go. You don't even need to read this, you can tell I enjoyed this by looking at how many hours I spent on it... which strangely beated how much I spent on Splatoon 2, even though I enjoy that more than Niche... but I'm getting off topic.\n\nBrief summary before I get into this: Niche is a genetics survival-and-strategy game. You can make your tribe desert nomads, exclusive berry-pickers, or just mess around in the console until you get the genetics you want. In my experiences, if you really want a sucessful tribe, stay on an island you're happy on (with lots of food) and DON'T move elsewhere. \n\nSince this is a new format, let's answer some questions... \n\n[b] Should I buy this?  [/b]\nX No! \nX No, even if there is a sale!\n\u2713 Yes, if there is a sale!\nX Yes!\n\nLet's just say the obvious: this game is NOT cheap. As of writing this, it is currently 18.99 USD. If the developers ever decide to release a sale, then that's the only time that I recommend buying it. \n\n[b] What are the graphics like? [/b]\nX Looks like a cheap iPhone app!\nX Low-Quality\n\u2713 Okay\nX Good-Quality\nX IT'S SO GOOD MY EYES ARE CRYING TEARS OF BEAUTY!\n\nI feel like this is a good time to address something; do NOT play this if you have a crappy computer. I have one, and this game lags HARD, even on the lowest possible settings. \n\n[b] What about gameplay? [/b]\nX TERRIBLE!\n\u2713 At least it's playable!\nX Okay\nX Good\nX BEST GAMEPLAY EVER!\n\nThe gameplay is kinda sucky, but fairly simple. Only way you control your creatures: your mouse. No external costs (like controllers) are needed, you just need a mouse! And once you figure out a strategy, it becomes SUPER easy.\n\n[b] Okay... story-mode? If there is any? [/b]\nX Terrible and underwritten! (or there is none)\n\u2713 Underwritten, but I can still understand what's happening.\nX Okay\nX Good\nX MY GOD IT'S THE BEST STORY!\n\nLet me get this straight: story mode is for NEW players. It's basically like assistance mode in Super Mario Odyssey, but a bit more vague. Even though the opening animation for it is gorgeous [strike] and better than I could ever do, [/strike] it doesn't contribute much to the story later, except when you find your way back [spoiler] to Adam's tribe. [/spoiler] Maybe when going to new islands, the tribe can get visions of [spoiler] the history of Adam's tribe? [/spoiler]\n\n[b] Final and most important question: memes? [/b]\nX NO MEMES!\n\u2713 Memes, but not relevant.\nX MEMES!\n\nThere is ONE in-game meme (otherwise I accidentally spawned the other,) and it's the title of a gene called 'derp snout.' Heh heh... these are times like this I missed 'spit-snout'\n\nOverall, should you buy this game? If you are getting into genetics, like animals, or just want to play it because Seri played it, buy it! No one's stopping you.

The other way is looking at the genetics and trying to create the strongest animals depending on your gene pool. Both ways provide interesting and unique gameplay, I didn't even see the genetics part of the game at first, and after I did the game was better as I tried to abolish bad genetics and keep the better ones alive. It gives the game a good aspect of strategy, and the scattered nests around each island gives the player a chance to have multiple different tribes of animals with different genes.

From the artstyle, to the gamestyle, to the way every move kind of mattered. I loved the idea of being able to breed my own animals and shape them in any way and form I wanted to - And with every update, the possibilities get bigger and better.\n\nThis isn't the game for you, if you need specific goals and achievements - At least not in its present form. However, it's very peaceful, it's engaging and with the ability to name your creatures, you can now bond further with them. Coming up with elaborate stories, personalities, etc. for each of them is a fun little pasttime. There's also always the chance of a mutation popping up at random. With some work though, you can completely costumize your creatures. I've become quite addicted to that.\n\nWith Early-Access games I never expect too much, because I know how much they can change. I've been so pleasantly surprised by this game however, that it's prompted me to write my first review. \n\nAnother big thumbs up goes to the developers. I brought the game, and only recently became part of the Facebook Group that's devoted to talk about the game, report bugs quick and easily and share the enthusiasm of the game. The developers of the game is active in the group as well, and takes suggestions and engages with the core-group of the game. They also provide quick and effecient support, and they appear incredibly friendly and invested in making the game the best it possibly can be.\n\nI'd recommend (And already have) to everyone with a little bit of patience.

I think with the smaller area it is easier to extend the life of your animals. However if you want to migrate, then you have to move all of the animals you want to keep around a certain tile and interact with that tile. I like that idea. Only the strongest make it to the next area. The only problem is making sure that whole new pack is well enough on food to make the journey. So you sacrifice a few of your gatherers to make sure the new pack will come out with enough food to start anew. The new \"marking\" is great though. Now you can change the colors of the animals' AP (R,G,B) so you can distinguish between them at a quick glance. Randoms still are garbage though. I know they're RNG but I ran into 3 in my recent play through. 2 were blind and all 3 were about 5 turns from death. I found them within 15 turns.\n\nAt first I didn't recommend the game and honestly I still think it needs work but I think that the developers love their game and it shows in even just one update. Keep it up guys.\n\nI bought this game because it looked interesting and new. The only problem was that your animals just die off too quickly. Genetically altering your future brood to what you want is next to impossible because you end up just breeding to keep players on the field. The randoms you run into only make it worse for you because they are never worth it and so you use them to find more sources of food but in turn they eat your stash right to nothing. I suppose you could just have them not move and just eventually die off because they also are usually right next to death when you find them as well.\n\nMaybe you can add something that tells you who the parents are of the kids? If you're going to make it to where incest can ruin your stats, then why not make it so you know what family that animal is in.

Oh look two babies! \u00ac_\u00ac\n-4 carnivores and the death of Adam and Eve later\n-Well I've got 4 nests, 4 breeding females and some berries. I'm forced to grab cactus berries whenevera carnivoreome along. \n-How am I managing to keep the immunity genes alive? breeding the hell out of everyone!  I manage to keep hold of both = genes, the triangle, circle and + one. with 5 genes, I had a choice of pack mates.  I nevr saw any other gene and honstly, the way the first 4 carnivores tore through my pack at the start, I on't think I really had time to consider things.\n-All I have is spitsnot and claws. \n-next thing I know... 6 nests and 30+ members.\n\nOkay so I learn early on the secret was to focus less on keeping traits I wanted and more about breeding for the sake of immunity genes. There were times I took inbreeding risks for the sake of maintaing a circle or + sign one. I had female constantly in the nest breeding.  \n\nSo I also took some notes from nature and how animals behave.  I kept the young in the centre of the pack protected by the adults and slowly moved the access adults out.  By keepingthe young in the centre not only did I have a circle of protection to them, but I also had a breeding stock at hand near nests.  As one partner died I moved a baby with a gene the other partner didn't hve into breed. I never had less then 12 babies in the centre at all times.  I always took breeding from them and pushed out the unwanted members to keep the gene pool fresh.\n\nAs I said, the big weakness was genetics for survival... I lost the berry paw really fast, and the big nose. I had a rams hend but lost it within 1 generation.  The poison fangs, however, survived because of Eve and Adam's soul off spring survived.  Otherwise I had a army of spitsnouts.  I managed to load up a berry paw and bring it back into the mix later but tht was when I had 20 individuals. \n\nI know some advise making paths in the grass but I foun it stronger as a move to slowly expand the terroritory one bit at a time.  This meant the carnivores and bunnies had nowhere to hide and made sur the back areas of area arond nests was safely exposed. I also made sure no one in the outter areas of the pack was alone without at lest 2 back up pack members.\n\nI do like the random nature of the breeding and exploring... Even my best plans had flaws.  I nearly lost a immunity gene.  But once you have 4 nests down and a decent amount of pack members and berries to pick, the game becomes easier even if you mess up.\n\nEdit:\nThe island migration update changed a lot of things, but there are some conclusions I've come to. \n\n1- Eventually you'll come to an island where instead of the carnivores hunting you, you hunt them.  They produce 10 food and there are few bushes to raid and sometimes trees.  So you need to turn focus away from running and berry collecting and towards double claws and ram horms/antlers.\n2-At this point, I realised you can only have x amount of females on nest, so taking a note out of Lions I sent the etra females off to scout.  Yes, horny males were a problem, but I wasn't breeding from the ones sent off. \n3-I surrounded each nest with a harem of males.  The males gave a genetic selection for the nest sitting female.  They doubled as shielding the females on nests from horny males. \n4-hunting females went out solo, they were often fresh out of the nest with ram or antlers and double claws. They scout slowly the island and found and killed carnivores while slowly unveiling the grasses.\n5-expansion was slow, I could only breed when a carnivore was downed.  At this point the spawn rate was high on them so they were appearing almost every other turn.  Later on as the double claw and antlers became common, I was able to slowly push out, get to other nests, hunt down the carnivores more effectly and things sped up.  \n6-The trick on slow epansionw as to never have more then one or two scouts, even if they were slow double claws, they could slowly cut way the map.  Patience was rewarding. \n7-Trees were often more valuable then bushes.  while I would sit one female gathering the acorns, bushes were just cut down while the girls were hunting. \n8-If your lucky, you may get a double bush near a nest.  Carnivore high spawn rates means even then a double berry paw is dangerous.  Your creature is vunerable.  It becomes a high risk, especially as often its not worth it unless it rains.\n9-So about the females who are moved away from the nests.  Okay so there was always 4-6 females not breeding I could not do anything with.  Occasionally a horny male would come along and a baby would result.  This is a gamble.  I clustered them together to ATTRACT the males. Sometimes the males gave a hidden trait among their rubbish genetics, like a immunity gene.  I know some hate these guys, but often their a blessing in disguise.  Early on, when you move onto a new island sometimes things are cruel.  I traveled to island 3 with 8 young and strong individuals but their numbers fell.  I was lucky to find 3 nests within a few squares of each other.  But I ran out of food looking for food.  So I ended up with a shallow gene pool in immunity genes - until a horny male blessed one female with both toxic body AND a new immunity gene.  I had to breed out their crap genetics, but I think thats the idea.  \n10- about 50% of the island unveiled leaves a lot of dark areas for carnivores to spawn.  cut that grass ASAP to get finding them easy to do.  Without grass they lack the element of surprise and can't ambush you.  By 100% of the map unveiled, they are exposed, weak and this makes them just sitting ducks even for slow double claw paws.  \n11-you don't always have to have plenty of food to migrate if you've made the right breeding.  The first migration to island 3 I had 24 food.  The result was I bred rarely.  5 of my guys had to be sacrficed for the greater good of the pack.  They were the first scouts. Their efforts unveiled the areas that made carnivores easy to find.  Their deaths weren't in vein.  Sometimes, you have to choose between the death of a few pack members like this.  But neverless, it is possible to get migration through on less then 40 food and prosper.  \n\nBasically, the game pushes you more and more to become less \"hunter/gather\" and more \"hunter\" it seems later on in the current migration update.  The most valuable traits right now are toxic body, poison fang, ram horns, antlers, double claw paws, Lean body (edit; sorryI left this one out).  Speed and gather paws are almost useless. You have to bait and wait for the right things to come to the nests, be it prey or mates.", "timestamp_created": 1477357156, "timestamp_updated": 1481625417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26194513": {"recommendationid": "26194513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026706052", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506060232}, "language": "english", "review": "\"I just spent $18 for about 20 hours of gameplay.

If one animal has one blind gene and another doesn't have any - there's 75% possibility that their descendant doesn't have the blind gene and with mutations you can affect to that possibility. But if the both animals have one blind gene - the possibility is 50%. But even if the descendant isn't blind - it still can carry the blind gene. And this logic should stand for the another genes as well.\n\nDon't chase rabbits - wait them to jump next to you and then attack. It's a good idea to keep one animal next to berry bush so you can collect food when ever you need it - and do not destroy the bushes because they won't grow back then.

Maybe we could have the small chance of getting a secret gene mutation if we combine two gene types (Example: claw paws+runner leg = Digging paws)\n\nAnother idea would be to have different levels of skills based on how much of a gene a creature has. For example, one berry paw gives you the ability to pick lots of berries off bushes, but TWO berry paws give you the ability to pick berries safely off cacti.\n\nI do hate the fact that we can destroy our food source bushes.

The graphics are gorgeous and the game runs smoothly for me.  This is a game about expanding your territory, finding food to keep your tribe fed, and protecting your tribe from carnivores.  Rustling grass might be a bunny that you so desperately need for food, or it could be a carnivore who wants YOU for food.  Take him down and get a nice amount of food for your tribe.  You also need to keep an eye on your creatures dominant and recessive genes when breeding.  If you don't, your creatures could be born with genes that cause them to get sick easier, be born blind, or have other weaknesses.  Will you breed a tribe of hunters? Will you breed a tribe of berry gatheres?  Maybe explorers?  Or maybe a tribe full of all types!  It's up to you!  \n\nWhat I do feel is needed in the game is some sort of tutorial to get you started, especially with understanding the genes and how they figure into breeding.  I was a bit lost at first, and although I did eventually start figuring things out, a tutorial would have definitley been welcome.  \n\nThat said, the game is still in early access.  There are a lot more genes planned and what sounds like more biomes to explore, and I am really looking forward to seeing and playing with those!  Overall, this is a fun, relaxing game that does require some strategy to grow your tribe by breeding for strong, healthy members, expanding your territory, and protecting your tribe from carnivores all while trying to gather enough food to not starve!

And games like Spore or Black and White were something that I was obsessed at some point. So when I got my hands on game Niche I was soooo freaking exited. Granted the game is still early access so not all things are already implemented but even at this stage I found myself lost in the game to the point. Where I just wanted to to test recording and ended up playing for like an hour not even realizing it :D So if anyone is interested in the game where you can play with genetics, create species, modify and evolve them so they would survive in better climate would be amazing hunters or maybe cute gatherers this freaking game is for you! (I know I sound like and advertisement but I was genuinely very surprised by how much it captured my attention). \n\nNow pros: \n1) Interesting evolution system (so many things needs to be taken into account, the environment, the size of the group and what resources you need more, are you safe? what parents genes are and most likely will be carried by a child and what genes needs to be added into a mix to make next generation better).\n2) One generation survival is easy, but developing thriving and stable long term line is freaking difficult. You need to take into consideration sooo many things. Including limited age span of every individual animal. \n3) There is certain amount of luck that is involved which makes the game more realistic (in the wild luck plays a big role). \n4) The game is just cute!\n\nCons:\n1) It's early access so it's still not fully finished. \n2) It lacks long term complexity and depth (granted as mentioned before it is early access).\n\nI would absolutely suggest this game to those who love survival games that makes you think beyond the food and safety. It can be as complex or as easy as you want. And I am 100 percent sure it is absolutely suitable for all ages. And I am sure that once it will be fully developed it will be one of those games that will stand out even more. \n\nIf you like to see my game play you can check it down bellow. First part is me just playing and towards the end I show other (test game play) that I did and how differently it ended up looking just because I was smarter about developing genes, and picking better place to live and so on.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcMub5SoUrA", "timestamp_created": 1474314657, "timestamp_updated": 1474314657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25590999": {"recommendationid": "25590999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154628252", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474112804}, "language": "dutch", "review": "What happened if 1996's epic game The Creatures and Spore had a baby?

However, this is an Early Access after all, and I'm hoping to see great improvements and updates in the future. \n\nI'd recommend buying the game once they have included more features if you're not sure about purchasing it at such an early stage. I hope developers will see how enthusiastic people are about their game and that they'll work really hard to bring us exciting, new content! It'd be awesome it they introduced different species that can coexist with each other helping and everything. \n\nAbout the game itself, I like how everything seems to blend so well with the rest of the elements. The mechanics are quite simple, so the player can concentrate on other things such as genes, mutation and food gathering, which are the main and vital aspects to bear in mind. The fact that one single bad move can mark the difference between thriving or daying, makes it really thrilling as well. \n\nOverall, it's a game that it's different from many others regarding genes manipulation, not to mention that the creatures are really, really cute!

This game feels like a turn based style with charming graphics & adds a good concept, Genetics! Something we all should of learned in biology class.\nYou start next to a bush, a nest & 2 animals. The interface is easy. Click on the animal. It tells you what its name is, its gender, its abilities & its genes. These genes will help you when breeding. If you'd want to name them, you can't! Some of the names I've come across are dumb. VanVanVan is one of them. The white line that's above your animals name is their LIFEBAR. If your animal gets sick, gets attacked, you starve it or your animal eats berries from a thorn bush, you'll shorten your animals life & the damage shows up as a red bar. \nThe game gives you an unfinished tutorial  that doesn't include the controls. Took me 5 hours to discover how to turn the camera Q & E. Zoom is R & F. On the bottom right side of your screen you'll see a DNA icon. This was never explained but i call it PLAYING GOD. You get a chance to add 2 genes to your animals & put them on the 10% & 30%. If you mix & match some genes, a green color will appear saying you can unlock a new gene. Eventually one of your offspring will make a new gene. \nThe animals have action pendants on their chests. You can preform 3 actions per day for each. Each stage of life is different. Babies only have 1 action, teens have 2 & adults have 3. There are 4 different actions you can preform. Gathering, Moving, Making Love & Attacking. You need to spend FOOD POINTS for each action. These are located at the bottom right of your screen with a apple icon. You will also find new animals to breed within the bushes that will generate in Niche so your tribe can avoid having incest.  For the actions, you can attack a carnivore to shorten its life & try to kill it for its meat before it kills you, gather the meat afterwords from your kill (you can kill bunnies too), you can gather berries, you can attack the bush for more berries but the bush never regenerates, you can make love & move your animal. The next day button is located on the bottom right side. \nIn the Ability section of each animal, there will be different abilities. The ones to note are Speed, Strength & Collecting. The number next to the ability will determine how much you can move, how much attack power you'll do & how much food you can collect. Not every animal will have speed, strength or collecting. If your animal only has collecting & not strength, that means it can only collect berries. It can't attack. Attackers can't gather either. Some of your animals will be able to have both of these abilities.\nGENES! Please take the time to look at each one of your animals genes. I found out if your animal has white eyes, they're blind & will not be able to go out & explore on their own. If there are no other animals around them, the spaces will begin to go dark the further out your blind animal goes, preventing it from traveling to spaces you've previously discovered or want to discover. \nOverall this game is great to play & they'll be adding new features like a water feature where you can probably swim in the future to different islands but developers please take notes. If you can't have a decent tutorial explaining the gameplay, the controls, how genes work, then your players will find this game too difficult to understand & stop without seeing its full potential.

A very cool concept. You start with 2 creatures with a series of special traits between them and you begin creating offspring. You need to gather food to allow you to explore the map, find food, find more creatures to potentially breed desired traits with and also protect yourself from predators. Each creature has a limited life span effected by time, illness and damage. Better breeding by avoiding incest and pairing good traits will limit your chances of breeding sickly or likely to become ill offspring.\nIts a game of incredibly careful balance, you have to monitor the size of your group as food is shared but also keep numbers high enough to you don't run out of males or females with desired traits to ensure your survival. \nIt's a cool game with a great concept.

It's up to you to maintain the population, make sure you don't breed in genetical flaws that hinder your creatures (usualy caused by inbreeding) and make sure your creatures don't starve in the process.\n\nThe mechanics are simple. Adult creatures get 3 actions every day. These actions require food points. In order to act, you need food, in order to find food, you need to explore. Things like movement, attacking, harvesting, exploring and mating all take up an action. its up to the player to balance this and not to have their population starve.\n\nMY 5 CENTS\n\nI enjoy this game and I think it has a lot of potential for growth as more mechanics get added to it. While I've done everything that is to be done in about 3 to 5 hours of gameplay it has been a fun experience. Though I will probably wait untill the next update to play more of it. At this point it starts to feel a little same-ish and repetative, but thats to be expected with the limitted amount of features.\n\nThere's currently some issues with starting in the savanah area as most berry bushes have thorns making it rather hard to gather enough food to do much. But I've found it can be somewhat mittigated by finding prey warrens to harvest.\n\nAlso my pets freak out over the sounds and get all excited, thats really entertaining too.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIf you want to support the developer then feel free to buy the game at full price. It certainly has potential. \n\nRight now the game feels a little bare bones and at its current price I really can't reconmend it to players who are looking for a more full experience. Maybe the finished product will be worth it in the end, but as it stands it almost feels like I'm playing the demo to a larger game.", "timestamp_created": 1474021869, "timestamp_updated": 1474525487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520224", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25523675": {"recommendationid": "25523675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074393916", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506499222}, "language": "english", "review": "I just missed out on the kick starter and now own the game.

Although Niche is amazing, it's one of those games. It relies heavily on thinking and concentration, not very easy to make videos of. So smaller Youtubers, be aware of this.

In order to do that you will have to find foods, breed your colony, protect your pack from carnivors, explore the island. While the gameplay looks simple, however there is more indepth gameplay you will eventually learn by yourself as you are playing, and it is not that hard to learn the game.\n\nIf you are new to the game, look at the right bottom and click the \"?\" mark to have a quick start.\n\n-THE PACK-\nWith 2 starter of animal (Adam and Eve), you should get them married and get a new pup to expand the pack. When expanding the pack you could later on find new species which gives better features to you (more eye sight, more attack power, more movement, more food gathering ability, etc). By finding these animals with new genes you could get better features for each animal in which will help further in your gameplay.\n\n-THE FOOD-\nFor every action of each animal (move, gather food, attack), you will need one food. If you make action without having food you will deplete your health (in which will shorten your animal lifespan). You can collect foods by: finding bushes (1 to 6 berries), killing rabbits (2 foods), or killing carnivores (10 foods). Beware that some bushes has torn and would hurt your animal if you collect it. As foods are scarce, sometimes you will need to move around to find new bushes. Rain will refill all bushes again.\n\n-AGE-\nThe animals have 4 stage. Newborn (no action), kid (1 actions), teens (2 actions), adult (3 actions). I am not sure how many nights for each animal to reach adult stage. However once you reach adult stage, each animal would get old and died eventually once the age meter has been full. Every time you hurt your animal, you will shorten the lifespan. Finding animals in the wild would have random stage of age, which sometimes they are already too old and will die in a couple nights.\n\n-EXPLORE-\nYou will eventually have to explore the island. By exploring you could find new food source, new nest, new animals, rabbit holes, rabbit, somekind of stone (i dunno what the stone for. prob just blocking the way), and eventually a carnivores. When exploring, keep your eyes on the moving grasses. If there is moving grass, you could find new pack, rabbit (foods), and carnivore (uh oh, nightmare).\n\n-MOVEMENT-\nAnimals with higher movement points could move further. Be aware animals with low eye sight would be trouble some to move around by itself (you have to clear the path before moving). It is best to stay with animals with lower eye sight to help them moving around. Moving in pack would also help for faster movement, you could create some kind of movement chain for further movement. Clearing the path will help movement for your animals.\n\n-SURVIVING-\nSurvival is not easy. Sometimes it is better to sacrifice some animals in order to survive the whole pack from danger. I sometimes leave 1 animal near food resource while moving the others. Sometimes when carnivore come I would use 1 animal for lure and run away. For thorny bushes, I use the old animals to collect them. Be aware that some animals could get sick, make sure to seperate them from pack or it will spread.\n\n-LAST WORDS-\nAs i mentioned above, i really enjoy the game. Survival is hard. Yes, sometimes you will find it very hard to find food source. I even sacrifices 9 out of 10 animals to find another food source, in the end with this 1 last animal I could find another new pack and food sources.\n\nShould you buy this game?\nIf you like to play survival game, with management style, yes you should buy it. It is fun. It is challenging. Is it hard? Depends, but the hardship what makes the game fun.

As you progress through the game and explore different areas, you pick up other animals with different traits that you can breed into your family in order to increase their chances of survival. However, the game is way more complex than it comes off; you can mutate genes into your family, and you can choose to focus on either berry collection, or combat, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. \n\nBerry bushes (and cacti) contain berries that your tribe will eat, and each time you perform an action, you eat one unit of food. Occassionally rabbits will pop out (don't even bother chasing them, wait for them to come to you), and you can kill those for food. Rustling bushes will alert you to either a rabbit, another animal to add to your tribe, or a carnivore, which basically looks like some terrifying were-bear (let me tell you, when these things pop out of the bushes and scare the sh** outta you, you're gonna hate them too). \n\nOverall, I like the game. It's addictive, and it's challenging without being stressful. I have yet to discover a way to rename my animals, which would really help in distinguishing who is from what family to avoid inbreeding (which creates sickness).

I Also have 15 or more additonal hours of playtime from demos and kicstarter betas. With that said I shall now say I defitely recomend the game and encourage those intersted in it to get it to help the devlopment team. This game has tons of potential and the dev team defitely is attentive to the community and encourages us to provide some ideas to further with its devlopment. The base work which we get to play now is defitely playable and entertaining there is still some UI problems but I am sure that will be addressed sooner or latter. Then the list of things to come is defitely exciting. The game may seem hard at first and seem impossible to get your group to survive but once you get the hang of it soon you can start selective breeding and trying to mutate genes so you can get desired looks and attributes. With selective breeding after getting the few you want you can choose new ones to mutate in another group this way you can make different groups that specialize at berry picking, fighting or hunting, and exploring great distances to expand your visible territory. As it develops I be sure to update this review with more info.\n\nThe creatures have four stages of life infant (1 day without parent sitting in nest), kid (3 days), teen (5 days), and adult (20 something days) If they get hurt while still newborns they die instantly otherwise they get one day taken off life span for everytime they get hurt. Right now there is no way to heal the damage but a couple of future genes healing spit and healing purr may be able to remove some red so they can last a little longer if they were hurt. Things that can hurt is moving or performing any action unless it is gathering food without any food availble in your storage. Picking berries off a cactus no gene exist yet that protects you from the thorns nor can you even get strong enough yet to cut it down. Then getting attack by a carnivore can also cause damage although you can breed for fighters that can basically one shot the carnivores so eventually they are no longer a threat. When it comes to food you can get berries from bushes which repleshies once a day if there is no drought going on and fully restorses when it first rains after it has not been raining. The bushes have 4 - 6 berries each and depending on your creatures paw traits they can collect either none to up to 4 berries per action. Carnivors that you kill then when you gther their meat don't need berry collecting paws to gather meat will give you 10 food while rabbits give you 3 food. Fishing and moles will be options in the near future as additonal sources of food. Other things that are incoming are aquatic genes which will let you travel to little islands and fish, able to make sterile hybrids with the carnivores, and a family tree as well as additonal things to look forward to.\n\nFor additional information this is a good place to look and reading updates there is also helpful\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/80250451/niche-a-genetics-survival-game/description", "timestamp_created": 1473954928, "timestamp_updated": 1473998944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589450", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1413, "total_negative": 152, "total_reviews": 1565}}

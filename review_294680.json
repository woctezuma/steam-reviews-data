I was truly impressed by the way the cursor changes to elucidate the direction in which Put-Put will go if one were to hover over a given path. Point-and-click franchise contenders such as [i]Diablo[/i] have yet to implement a feature like this. Further, Put-Put's telekinetic power is a great complement to this control system wherein he can manipulate almost any part of any scene by summoning wild animals with seeming druidic magicks. Note, however, that there is another disturbing way in which Put-Put and other automobiles manipulate the environment as discussed later under [i]The Absurd[/i].\n\nAs for the graphics, the anti-aliasing and static shadows are on par with that of any [i]Bethesda[/i] title. Also, the gritty, high-contrast delivery, while not cell-shaded, offers up [i]Put-Put Enters the Race[/i] as a starkly obvious precursor to the [i]Borderlands[/i] style of not trying, but making stuff look cool through the overuse of persistent Photoshop-esque filters. All in all, my best guess is that the graphic artists behind this game went on to work for and inspire many AAA game companies.\n\nIn a similar line of thought, the narrative is ambiguously revealing of Put-Put's inner quest. To the point, much of Put-Put's world is implied rather than directly told to the player, hence the lack of cutscenes. Thus, [i]Put-Put Enters the Race[/i] is clearly the spiritual predecessor to [i]Demon's Souls[/i], which eventually led to [i]Dark Souls[/i], and later to [i]Bloodborne[/i]. There is no doubt to me that [i]From Software[/i] reverse engineered the storytelling acumen of this game to go on to create the greatest non-stories in video games of all time, minimalism at its best.\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of musicianship in the game detracts from the immersion big time, especially considering the use of the many royalty-free sound effects. As any professional gamer knows, the audio is what ties a game together at the end of the day. The developers could have taken a hint from [i]Nintendo[/i] here, who, just through leveraging MIDI music, mind-controlled several generations of Americans. What young adult hasn't dreamed in the [i]Mario[/i] or [i]Pokemon[/i] theme? But, rather than getting too upset about this, I elected to replace the default music and sound effects with that of [i]Tyler the Creator[/i], whose style happened to somehow perfectly mesh with this game.\n\nAnd, no DualShock support? What's with that?\n\n[b]The Absurd[/b]\n\nFor whatever reason, all of the automobiles have tentacles that emerge from their undercarriage. What's more, Redline Rick is ... how do I put this? He's \"grabby\" around Put-Put.... Take that for what you will. Piling up in the bizarre category, high-octane gasoline is free and available at any gas station. Put-Put seems compulsive and frantic about this stuff, uncontrollably shaking after consumption. When I noticed that Put-Put stores his canine companion in his glove compartment, along with batteries and a ladder, I realized what was really going on.\n\nPut-Put is a hallucinatory addict, and most of what he experiences is probably not real due to his overconsumption of high-octane gasoline. This implication is strongly hinted when Put-Put begins finding empty bottles everywhere that he wishes to take a recycling center. The bottles represent his unspoken habit, and the recycling center represents his yearning to break free from his wrongdoings. Ultimately, upon proper reflection, the absurdity of the game is revealed as a masquerade for a deep life lesson otherwise kept away from children. Ultimately, the developers of [i]Put-Put Enters the Race[/i] introduce the harsh realities of life to youth by subverting first-glance parental supervision in the same vein as [i]SpongeBob SquarePants[/i].\n\n[b]8/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1434298148, "timestamp_updated": 1434330070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601525", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16378917": {"recommendationid": "16378917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008098290", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434263246}, "language": "english", "review": "masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1434263298, "timestamp_updated": 1434263298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16338210": {"recommendationid": "16338210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048193675", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506714250}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever 10/0", "timestamp_created": 1434140493, "timestamp_updated": 1434140493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16089081": {"recommendationid": "16089081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075953210", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428433634}, "language": "german", "review": "Dieses Spiel weckt Kindheitserinerungen in mir!", "timestamp_created": 1433035325, "timestamp_updated": 1439089176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15407489": {"recommendationid": "15407489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066994093", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422921110}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10 it's about cars.", "timestamp_created": 1429226569, "timestamp_updated": 1429226569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501544", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15162923": {"recommendationid": "15162923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054593434", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430133044}, "language": "german", "review": "Dieses Spiel war der Anfang von von vielen anderen.

However, I'm splitting hairs between my favorites.\n\nAs Putt-Putt is playing with his pet dog, Pep, he receives a letter from Redline Rick - an invitation to compete in the Cartown 500. Excited, our little friend goes to the track, where Redline Rick tells him a few things are needed before he is allowed to enter the race. And so, we must help Putt-Putt collect the items to race.\n\nMan, so many good things stood out. There's too many to list, but I figured I name a few.\n-Probably what grabbed my attention the most was the soundtrack. I ardently feel the music in any game is a critical aspect to deliver, and this game did deliver. There was something about this game that stole my heart, and I loved every minute listening to nostalgic tunes. \n-Recycling. Not only is this game fun and education, this game is also teaching us a valuable lesson: and that is to help our planet in cleaner ways. Glass bottles are scattered throughout the journey. Collect enough to earn some coins. And with the coins, Putt-Putt can do two activities. (Explained in the next two thoughts).\n-One of my favorite things to do in the Putt-Putt world is the paint job. That's right. In every game, you can color Putt-Putt in a variety of colors, and this game is no different. (I always color him blue). One feature different in this game is that the dashboard is painted now. It's not much, but it makes a huge difference in my eyes. \n-The car wash is back. Remember the first game? One thing you could do included a car wash. Well, folks, it's back in style in this installment. I don't know why, but I always enjoyed scrubbing Putt-Putt with bubbles, washing the doors, drying the car as a child. I still do today.\n-Giving Putt-Putt a new coat of color as well as a clean bath is not part of the main storyline, but it is a nice addition to the game. It just goes to show how much effort was put forth in such a phenomenal game.\n-Next to the recycling machine, there's this game Putt-Putt encounters, where he must put toys back in the proper position. For some reason, I always loved this part. Now, it's been quite a number of years since I revisited this game, but when the scene played, I nearly jumped out of my seat with sheer joy. I'm practically an adult, and cleaning up toys still excites me.\n-Some characters make a reappearance! Outback Al, our Australian partner, makes a visit. Rover, the vehicle abandoned on the moon, also returns. Mr. Baldini, our Italian moustache pal, is back. And much, much more. \n-There's a theme that finally makes sense. Joining the parade, going to the moon, saving the zoo, and traveling through time all made for fun adventures, but entering the race is something that sounds like a car would actually do. \n-One of the coolest features happens when Putt-Putt finally acquires the required.

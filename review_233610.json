It gets so many things right and feels like it's a game designed by gamers for gamers. \n\n- It runs silky smoothe on my gtx 970 at a consistent 60 fps.\n- SPLITSCREEN MULTIPLAYER!\n- If you're racing solo it will put you up against the ghosts of other players.\n- The community is fantastic and many player made levels are just as good if not better than default levels.\n- The car handles very well.\n- This game can challenge even the most hardcore racing fans and still be fun for beginners. \n\nI only have three critisms of this game.\n1- The music is great but there's not that many songs, give us more.\n2- There's only one vehicle. A bike would be a perfect addition to this game.\n3- The only customization available is for changinging the colors. Let us change the model, let us change our stats, let us design our cars to look and handle like we want it to.\n\nFinally, I have to say thank you to the devs. Thank you for making such an incredible and unique game and I hope you make it better so it can be as popular as it deserves to be.", "timestamp_created": 1515447766, "timestamp_updated": 1515447894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39188478": {"recommendationid": "39188478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066418303", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1515436461}, "language": "german", "review": "Great! 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1515436492, "timestamp_updated": 1515436492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39131755": {"recommendationid": "39131755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147058819", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514436297}, "language": "english", "review": "Great fun, great visuals, great sound.

Well, technically it's not a racer, it's more of a survival time attack, similar to games like Trackmania. \n\nDistance's objective is to avoid obstacles and navigate towards the finish as fast as possible, which isn't entirely unique. What DOES make Distance unique, however, is the abilities the car (called the Refractor in-game) has for the player to take advantage of. The Refractor can jump, fly, and use thrusters on it's top to spin in air, help with turning sharp turns, and grip the track. Because of this, levels can have you jumping from wall to wall, performing tricks to regain boost, and finding shortcuts to jump/fly to. The best part about this though, as advertised on Distance's store page, is that you don't even need to stick to the intended path. If you find a shortcut by flying between two buildings or cutting off an entire section of the level, then you're free to do so. So many players have gotten incredible times on various levels by going off the path and finding possible shortcuts to use. These shortcuts can be easy to do sometimes, but most of the time it takes skill to pull them off, making it that much more rewarding when you get a better time because of it.\n\nThe levels are the best part of Distance. There aren't many official levels to choose from, but the real content comes from the players. Because of how much you can do with the level editor, there's a huge amount of player-made content to play through and experience. You can have levels that are story-based, horror-themed or just fun and challenging. The game's developers have even said themselves that they simply cannot do better than the community at creating levels. That isn't to say they won't still make levels, but the user-made levels are what most people are going to be playing at this point because of it.\n\nHere are my pros and cons for this game:\n\nPros:\n- Tight controls\n- Gorgeous visuals\n- Very high replayability\n- Nice soundtrack\n- One of the best level editors out there\n- An endless stream of community levels that are often better than the official levels\n- An active and friendly Discord community that holds events for the game on Saturdays (called \"Speedy Saturday\")\n- high skill ceiling\n\nCons:\n- No dedicated servers so port forwarding is needed if you want to host one\n- Little activity outside of the Discord community\n- Can be hard to get better at (I still have trouble with advance techniques like grip flying and I play this fairly frequently)\n- Controls can become hard to use on harder levels (I recommend either using a keyboard or a controller with flipper buttons like the Xbox One Elite controller. Otherwise you'll have to look for a guide for the best way to setup a normal 360/Xbox One controller to get the most out of the controls)\n\nTL;DR If you like arcade racers, then get this game and join the Discord community. Maybe find a controller with flipper buttons or stick to the keyboard if you really want to get good at it.", "timestamp_created": 1513124974, "timestamp_updated": 1513124974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38205626": {"recommendationid": "38205626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011747888", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514192950}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't know why there are ANY negative reviews.\n\nHIGHLY recommended. \n\nLOVE The Manor.", "timestamp_created": 1512900307, "timestamp_updated": 1512900307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38192893": {"recommendationid": "38192893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039189755", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512868506}, "language": "english", "review": "What are you waiting for, BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1512857000, "timestamp_updated": 1512857000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484698", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38161110": {"recommendationid": "38161110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171745946", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507629912}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5927\u54e5\uff0c\u5feb\u4e24\u5e74\u4e86\uff0c\u4f60\u6709\u66f4\u65b0\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e1c\u897f\u5417", "timestamp_created": 1512762191, "timestamp_updated": 1512762191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38150874": {"recommendationid": "38150874", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970935961", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513922392}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like both Tron Legacy and automobiles even a teeny tiny bit, you [i]need[/i] to play this game.\nAnd the music...

The basic premise is that you are a futuristic rocket car that needs to traverse a glowing cyberpunk city filled with deadly traps and obstacles. You must utilize your car's unique abilities like flying to cross large gaps, and boost jumping to vault over obstacles or even leave the road completely. You can even drive on walls and ceilings!\n\nThere's a short story mode that drops hints at the city's myterious past; as of this writing, it's really just an extended tutorial, but the developers are working hard on a much longer and improved version. Thankfully, this isn't all there is to do; there is a robust level editor that allows things like animated scenery and importing custom models and a Workshop with thousands of player made levels already availiable or you can leave things to chance and use the procedural track generator. There are leaderboards for every track (even the fan made ones), so you can always go back and try to get the best time. The game also has both online and local multiplayer for racing and special modes like Stunt (perform tricks to earn the most points) and Reverse Tag (one player is \"it\" and has to avoid everyone else).\n\nVisually the game is [i] amazing. [/i] Having most of the graphical settings on high makes almost everything look like it came straight out of a big budget sci-fi movie, but you can keep things on lower settings and the game will still look really nice. The soundtrack is another high point with pulsing electronic beats that fit the setting well and sync up with the visuals with flashing lights, but if it somehow isn't to your liking you can use your own music during regular gameplay and the visuals will sync with that as well.\n\nThere's really not any bad things I can say about this game. The developers have done a good job of updating the game since release and have been very engaged with the community. Though there isn't a lot of \"official\" content avaliable right now, there's definitley enough to get your money's worth.

Spectacle: This is a very stylish game.  Reminiscent of the movie Tron, it has appealing geometric designs as well as neon lights that come together to form a sleek and eye-catching look.  This combined with the blur as you hit the boosters on your car gives you a good sense of speed, which is a must in a racing game.  Though under some circumstances the flashy lights can be a little overwhelming, that\u2019s something more limited to some questionably designed custom maps, and I didn\u2019t find that to be the case for the default tracks.\n2. Variety: As mentioned before, there are custom tracks shared through the workshop, meaning that there\u2019s a ton of free content beyond what you get from just downloading the game.  From my experience, if there\u2019s a kind of track you want, it more than likely exists in some form on the workshop.  Worst comes to worst, you can make it yourself through the editor.\n3. Complexity: Complexity is tough.  Too much, and a game can implode by overly dividing the player\u2019s attention.  Too little, a game becomes simplistic enough not to warrant more than a few playthroughs. Distance does a pretty good job using its complexity to add variety to its gameplay.  You drive a car.  Though unlike your traditional car, it can boost, jump, wall ride, and fly.  These abilities all lead to  an array of possibilities for drivers to tackle obstacles and hazards, making Distance an interesting platformer-racing hybrid.\n\nCons-\n\n1. Keyboard Controls: Distance can require you to go pretty fast.  Add to that the fact that obstacles can spawn out of nowhere and tracks can have crazy turns, a higher steering sensitivity is necessary at times.  However, due to the nature of keys, being either on or off, any precision steering can be extremely difficult.  So, either you have low steering sensitivity, where you\u2019ll crash into objects you can\u2019t dodge effectively, or you have high steering sensitivity where you overcorrect and crash into something else.  Perhaps there could be a key that you could hold for a lower steering sensitivity and release to return to high?  Sure, you could buy a controler, but for those of us short on cash, it'd be nice.", "timestamp_created": 1511827260, "timestamp_updated": 1511827260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37816405": {"recommendationid": "37816405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154575623", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511811380}, "language": "english", "review": "how 2 play Distance\n\n1.

There's a robust track editor as well as a random seed generator to make tracks to share. The community content is amazing, so you'll never have a shortage of levels. The devs have continuously added content; since the time I initially purchased it, the 'cling' feature and race vs. replay ghosts have been added.

Currently it has maybe a few hours of actual content, if hurtling through neon sci-fi tracks in your car to a pounding retro-techno-minimal beat is your thing, not including workshop map content (this is massive for the game to have, a great addition). I don't personally think it's currently worth the $20 asking price ($10 would be the maximum I'd pay for something like this) especially since I can complete the whole game in under the refund limit, and refund it, coming back to it when it's more fleshed-out. But for what it CAN be, it's worth every dollar. If they add some solid AI, extend some of the levels to make them longer, and flesh out the game some more while it's still in beta and before a final release, it's going to be a hell of a game. But for what it is, in early access, it's still a solid pickup. Perhaps when on sale.\nGameplay: 9/10\n(Non-workshop) Content: 6/10\nSoundtrack: 9.5/10\nReplayability: 8/10 (this would be improved with the addition of AI, and a more lively MP scene)\n\nPros:\n- Soundtrack (every track is great, and the ability for the game to work with existing songs I already have is icing on the cake)\n- Level design\n- Core gameplay is down pat, as it should be for a beta\n- Soundtrack (yes it's that good)\n- Low system requirements\n\nCons:\n- Content (this needs to be massively expanded in the beta phase. Not just for the \"Campaign\" mode, but in general)\n- No AI (this should also be added before final release. At the moment, the best part of each level is the bouncing visuals, and the soundtrack. The game needs to feel more lively. They should also be present for workshop maps, using things like upcoming collision detection, proper navigation, etc. to ensure they can work on any track.)\n- (some) Levels are overly short.

Should you run out of tracks to race on , there are always comunity made tracks which you can download for free and believe me there are a lot of these.\n It's trippy colours and fastpaced reflex based gameplay make for an adrenaline rush of the best kind.

Allerdings nur im Sale!\nEs wirkt schon so in sich geschlossen und abgestimmt, dass man den early access daran lediglich im noch etwas geringen Umfang des Spiels merkt. Es ist kein single player in dem Sinn, als dass man eine Kampagne durchspielt. Das Spiel ist darauf ausgelegt online gegen andere, bzw. deren Bestzeit, anzutreten. Dar\u00fcber sollte man sich klar sein, wenn man den Titel kauft.\n\nPositiv:\n- Die Spielmechanik. Das Auto l\u00e4sst sich wunderbar direkt steuern, auch bei hohen Geschwindigkeiten.\n- Das Leveldesign. Die Strecken sehen wirklich unfassabr gut aus\n- Der Soundtrack. Die elektronischen Beats passen perfekt ins Spiel\n- Die Lichteffekte. Wenn der Beat richtig dr\u00fcckt und die Lichter der Strecke im Takt pulsieren, dann ist die Atmosph\u00e4re der \nWahnsinn und es hyped einen ungemein!\n\nNeutral:\nDie Bestzeiten sind nicht mal ansatzweise zu knacken, da solche Zeiten nicht auf der Strecke gefahren/erreicht werden, sondern durch skipping der Streckenumgebung. (Wen das interessiert kann mal bei youtube nach \"distance track skips\" schauen). Das f\u00fchrt meiner Meinung nach das Spielprinzip ad absurdum... aber ist ja noch early access ;)  \n\nNegativ:\nDie Entwickler spielen stark mit Gravitation: Man muss regelm\u00e4\u00dfig an W\u00e4nde und Decken springen, streckenweise auch fliegen. An sich ist die Idee echt super und passt auch in die Spielwelt! Aber die Steuerung in der Luft und bei Spr\u00fcngen ist derma\u00dfen schwammig, dass sie f\u00fcr h\u00e4ufige Frustmomente sorgt. Dadurch wird bei manchen Strecken der Schwierigkeitsgrad automatisch angehoben, und zwar nicht durch ihr Design (das w\u00e4re ja absolut in Ordnung und auch gewollt), sondern durch die Steuerung. Echt \u00e4rgerlich dieser Mechanismus, aber auch der einzige Kritikpunkt, der mir aufgefallen ist.\n\nEs \u00fcberwiegt somit eindeutig das Positive an dem Spiel und deshalb kann ich es auch getrost weiter empfehlen!\nGr\u00fc\u00dfe", "timestamp_created": 1509454493, "timestamp_updated": 1510386572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36157146": {"recommendationid": "36157146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260047381", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511250900}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e16\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e14\u0e35\u0e04\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e04\u0e27\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e38\u0e21\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e23\u0e16\u0e01\u0e47\u0e42\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e04 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e04\u0e38\u0e21\u0e23\u0e16\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e21\u0e36\u0e19\u0e46\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\n\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e14\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e19\u0e34\u0e14 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e21\u0e35\u0e41\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e42\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e14\u0e43\u0e19 Workshop \u0e01\u0e47\u0e42\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\n\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e23\u0e27\u0e21\u0e16\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e14\u0e35 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e04\u0e27\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e38\u0e21\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\n\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49 8/10 \u0e42\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e04\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\n\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e01 1 \u0e2a\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e04\u0e38\u0e21\u0e23\u0e16\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e19 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e01 1 \u0e2a\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e07\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e16\u0e36\u0e07\u0e08\u0e30\u0e25\u0e14 50% \u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e47\u0e40\u0e16\u0e2d\u0e30\n\u0e1b\u0e25.

\ndon't expect to play with anyone random, only if you have some friends who play this.\n\n- This isn't much of a con but some feedback and an idea, the sound effects are very minimal which could be considered a good thing because all you hear really is the music but I'd like to hear some nice heavy engine pumping, just as much as the music. it would blend nicelly together thanks to the sound mixer in the game. \nIn real life for example i just love the rising sound of the formula one engine! and this is a futuristic game! come on you can do better than some generic subtle wubwubwubwubwubwub. get creative :D", "timestamp_created": 1509381582, "timestamp_updated": 1509381582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36142528": {"recommendationid": "36142528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122181041", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514206802}, "language": "french", "review": "Un excellent jeu.\nLes graphismes sont bien fait et la soundtrack de base (car on peut aussi mettre nos propres musiques) est sympathique et colle \u00e0 l'ambience de jeu.\nMais le plus important dans un jeu de course (dans cela ce n'est clairement pas le r\u00e9alisme), c'est le gameplay, qui est extr\u00e8mement bien r\u00e9alis\u00e9, une difficult\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9e mais sans \u00eatre un Dark Souls, un m\u00e9lange de passages a\u00e9riens/terrestres, \u00e0 une vitesse d\u00e9coiffante.\nDommage que les updates se font rares car du coup il n'y a que peu de circuits officiels mais l'\u00e9diteur de niveaux permet de voir un contenu workshop de tr\u00e8s haute qualit\u00e9.\nIl y a aussi la pr\u00e9sence d'un mode multijoueur local/online, que je n'ai pas encore test\u00e9 mais qui semble prometteur\nBref pour r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je ne peux que conseill\u00e9 ce jeu, c'est le meilleur jeu de courses ind\u00e9pendant que je connaisse, et l'un de mes meilleurs jeux ind\u00e9pendants.\nIl m\u00e9rite un 9/10 !", "timestamp_created": 1509375021, "timestamp_updated": 1509375021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36139024": {"recommendationid": "36139024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288766923", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511638321}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome graphic's\nAwesome sound track's\nAwesome vehicle destroction (You can cut your car in half by saw's and laser's\nAnd if you back into a wall you can see a dent on the car)\nVery fast\nVery well optimised\n\n100% one of my favorite game's ever :3\nI got no complaint's of this game...

It perfectly brings high speed, gravity, obstacles, atmosphere, sounds and graphics together!! This game just looks awesome, especially the blurry effects, the high speed concept uses this advantage perfectly and one of the best things is that you never get bored! The adventure mode is, sadly, pretty short, but it's been so much fun to play it! But this game is still a beta game, and more content is to come.\nThis is one of the best high speed racers I've ever seen, and when you, even just a bit, like racers, get this shit, you'll love it!\nTrackmogrify isn't that precise and doesn't know them all ( it didn't manage to return me love or hearts, just red ). But this doesn't make the game any worse since it still knows enough keywords that there are thousands of possibilities, even though these tracks are really short.\nI'm playing with a keyboard and my problem at first was to get a keybinding that makes sense. I'm still not too happy about it, but maybe it's just the amount of car abilities that makes it.\nWhat I really have to mention here are the gameplay elements... You're not dead when you drive through a laser. You're not dead when you fall of the track. You may lose some time, but that's the awesome thing about this game, you can just play and drive, jump and fly around and all this, and this is really really fun. You fall off the track, activate your wings and fly up to the track right in Batman-style. This is just epic! When you run through a laser, you'll lose a part of your vehicle, but at long as you don't lose wheels, you're just fine! This differs this game from others, because they are really frustrating by punishing EVERYTHING with a total failure. This game doesn't.\n( > Beta! )\nGraphics: 9/10\nThe best thing to mention is the blurring effect and the powerful neon colors. Some parts of the HUD overlap others, for example the replay controllers in the finish screen. The on-car info-screen just looks awesome and is very innovative.\nSounds: 9/10\nAwesome beats which perfectly support the atmosphere of the game. Still, not everyone has to like this genre. Sound effects are awesome.\nControls: 8/10\nAwesome on the gamepad, not really nice on the keyboard.

Keyboard controls are sorta mushy until you turn off digital input smoothing and ramp up control sensitivity, menu animations just need to stay turned off for everything ever made at all times THANK YOU, and for whatever reason they changed the key for wing deployment.  While we're at it let's just turn off \"Flight Landing Assist\" because autopilot is for the weak.  After that, you're back in control, and the game becomes super fun.  \n\nThe game is still fun with all of this stuff stuck at default, but it WILL screw you over in tight, technical strings of precise maneuvers.\n\nIt is an indisputable step forward for the franchise.  Everything is more polished.  Everything is smoother.  Meaningful features have been added and implemented thoughtfully.  Meaningless features are nowhere to be found.  This is how sequels are DONE.\n\nSo what if you haven't played Nitronic Rush?  The music and sound design are superb, and it has very good, and fairly challenging track layouts.  The tracks are a good deal denser and more furious than just about any racing game I've played, F-Zero GX notwithstanding.\n\nIt falls squarely into a difficulty I like to call meditative.  Nitronic rush was similar in this regard.  It's not insufferably boring everywhere but the corners like Gran Turismo, and it isn't way up there in the unbridled and unrelenting insanity that F-Zero GX revels in.  It chooses a path where you must always remain focused, but never trespasses into mental fatigue.\n\nThe best advice I can give for you to determine whether or not you like it is for you to play Nitronic Rush all the way through, once, then peruse the hardcore levels a few times.

[i]Distance[/i] requires that the player holds the boost button at all times. The only time the player ever lets go of the boost button is when the car is about to blow up. This only ever occurs in the short moments before reaching the next checkpoint.\nVery little thought goes into using boost, the player rarely has to manage the mechanic in a smart way and it's mandatory to use boost at all times. It also feels boring to drive without boost. Furthermore, you're only ever going to drive around without boost if you've collided and had to restart at the most recent checkpoint, as the game doesn't refill boost completely after a reset. Boost feels mostly meaningless and really only serves to make the player hold down another button.\n\n2. [i]Distance[/i] does a poor job of indicating when certain mechanics are not available for use. There are segments where you might like to fly, only to discover that flying is disabled for that segment. Not being able to fly when you think you are usually leads to crashing the car, which leads to having to reset which gives you a good reason to just restart the entire race. The only time you're not going to restart a race is when you're initially learning the layout of a track.\n\n3. The single player levels do a great job of making you play with all of the various mechanics that the game offers, such as wall riding, driving upside down, jumping over obstacles and so on. However, the developer created levels are mostly completely linear and don't really offer a very exciting racing experience. [i]Distance[/i] does a great job of challenging the player from a mechanical standpoint, but the level design never branches out beyond the linear design of straight-forward on-rails driving. In [i]Distance[/i] the variety in levels comes from rearranging the mechanics that [i]Distance[/i] offers such as flying, jumping, riding walls and so on rather than offering track layouts and design that vary greatly. It's like the levels are a deck of cards that are endlessly shuffled around. But it's still the same deck of cards.\n\n4. Visibility issues place emphasis on memorizing certain track segments. The roads are see through and often end in such a way that you're caught unaware and drive straight off a ledge. The first time you drive off a ledge you reset and push through to plot out the rest of the level. Now that you know the layout you restart the entire race for the gold medal.\n\n[i]Distance[/i] is a pretty game, but also suffers from poor visibility. When you can't see what's coming up ahead you often crash. On the first playthrough of a level you spend your time memorizing the layout. Once that's done you then go back to get the gold medal. I didn't find much challenge in this. Rather I felt like a rat in a maze.\n\n\nThere are some pros to [i]Distance[/i].\nThe controls are highly precise and the game runs well. The game handles well and at no times did the game feel unresponsive or sluggish. The racing elements are well done but end up being restricted by other elements of the game's design.\n[i]Distance[/i] did succeed in entertaining me for about an hour, but ultimately feels like a high end usermade modification that I'd expect to play for free inside another title rather than a standalone title going for the current asking price of US $20.", "timestamp_created": 1504693824, "timestamp_updated": 1504694668, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514315", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34748352": {"recommendationid": "34748352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144730760", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509229427}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Great game!

From looking at the screenshots one could think of it as a racing game, and they would be right... for about 20%. Distance is much more of a platformer/flight simulator than it is a racing game. It's not really about getting to the finish line as fast as possible, it's more often than not about getting there _at all_.\n\nThe narrative of the game alludes to the game world being a virtual one, being corrupted by the virus, and our car, being an antivirus algorithm of sorts, has to get to the core of it to restore it (or at least, it was this way in its Nitronic Rush days). The virus, naturally, tries to prevent itself from being deleted, and sends obstacles our way which just so happen to look like lasers, saws and other pointy things capable of slicing our car in half. Literally. And the best thing is, this doesn't mean \"game over\" - you still can control what's left of your car and, if you're lucky enough to make it to the checkpoint, your car will be restored. Good luck with it while airborne though - cars with one wing sliced off usually don't make it very far...\n\nApart from official maps and ones made by fans in Workshop (which are great as usual) there is a cool feature named Trackmogrify, where you can ask for a specific track (e.g. \"long tricky green track with lasers\"), and the game will generate such a track for you.

The game play particularly reminds me of Wipeout with tracks that are all twisty and bendy that if you're not careful can really disorient you. Tracks can have alternative routes though there is something within this community that annoys me in that all the top leaderboard players skipped entire levels by flying off the track and skipping straight to the end.\n\nOne of my favorite features is Trackmorgify which generates semi-random tracks based on the seed you enter. Later I discovered that unlike most games which just hash an entire string and stuff it into a random number generator this one seems to break up your seed into parts and looks for certain keywords to guide the generator. That being said I double dog dare you to beat TeslasExtremeLongMarathonDoubleHelixCorkscrewDescentDownIntoScaryElectricShardDoom from beginning to end without skipping to the end.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but extreme and reminds me of classic arcade games.\n\nI definately recommend this game!", "timestamp_created": 1501244882, "timestamp_updated": 1501244882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33849910": {"recommendationid": "33849910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136385342", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489266184}, "language": "french", "review": " bon jeu \n", "timestamp_created": 1501225670, "timestamp_updated": 1501225670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33822450": {"recommendationid": "33822450", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996606909", "num_games_owned": 1289, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512241846}, "language": "english", "review": "Review after playing only single player mode!!\n\n\n- VR support (very nice cockpit view!);\n- Graphics;\n- Cyberpunk style maps;\n- Feel of speed;\n- Awesome soundtrack;\n- Optimization - even use 4k in vr it have stable fps;\n- Crazy traps on maps and very satisfactory driving model;\n- Many ways to do awesome tricks!\n- Price even without discount;\n- Easy to play hard to master.\n\nCons:\n- Early acces.\n\nMy note:\n8/10 \n\nThis is a solid piece of final game.

The flying is simple and you won't take more than a few seconds to adapt to the transition. The in-air thruster corrections are a bit more fiddely but that is largely due to the 12+ hours spent playing on the old model versus the newer version in the game.\n\nMusic - Dark, heavy, electronic, syncs well with enviroment, what more could you ask for?\n\nLooks - Running at max settings this game is a cyperpunk's wet dream. The vibrant contrast of colors in the accents against the industrial/sci-fi backdrop really make you feel like you are the only thing alive in the universe-until you aren't.\n\nStory - A story mode in a racing game? Sounds odd, and given the recent games with garbage stories [spoiler] like The Crew [/spoiler] I can't blame you for being hesitant. But don't even let that sway you, this one is fantastic. I've always been a fan of storytelling through enviroments and this is among the best in that regard. You can comletely ignore it or for the more eagle-eyed you can see the story woven into each and every level.\n\nCustomization - Change the colors of your car or start making a level from the in-game editor. Too lazy to build a level? There are tons of workshop levels that are on-par or even better than the in-game ones. Still to lazy to download? Use the Trackmogrifier to make a level from a seed word or number and enjoy a randomly generated level that you can race on.\n\nMultiplayer - Fast matchmaking and good stability. Play against others and show off how good (or bad) you are.\n\n\nDistance is a blast. Hardcore racers will enjoy the effort put into the game and the satisfaction of mastering it, and even the non-hardcores will find their fun in the arcade styled handling.

Despite being under the dreaded Early Access label, what we have here is already a consistent and comprehensive enough experience that should give you a fairly clear image of what to expect from the final release, whenever that is supposed to come out.\n\nThe game consists in surviving several gauntlets by jumping, flying and weaving around obstacles such as laser beams, rotating saw blades, walls that pop out of the ground, among other traps, as well as maneuvering your way through the gravity-defying twists and turns of the track itself. The car handles pretty well, with just the right amount of oversteering you'd expect from an arcade racer to support last-second reactions. Maneuvering on vertical surfaces and transfering from wall to wall may feel very awkward (frustrating even) to a certain extent, which will make some of the stages look very intimidating. Once you get the hang of the controls, however, it all should come through fairly naturally.\n\nAmong the game modes at your disposal, you have: Adventure, which is (for now) still pretty short and puts you through a series of increasingly difficult tracks and also gives you a rundown on the game's mechanics; Arcade, which includes Sprint (racing to the end as fast as possible), Stunt (scoring as many points as possible within a set amount of time by tricking your way around a \"rink\"), Challenge (very brief but intense obstacle courses), and Trackmogrify (where the game randomly generates a track based on the provided seed); and Multiplayer, which still boasts a small yet dedicated online playerbase.\n\nYou're also given a very flexible level editor that allows you to come up with complex tracks that can include triggered events and custom props, among other things. The creative community for this game is great, regularly submitting new tracks to the Workshop. Most of their levels are pretty clever and elaborate, and can range from races with emphasis on speed to insane hair-pulling trial-and-error challenges, encompassing most if not all skill levels and play styles.\n\nPresentation is somewhat reminiscent to that of \"Tron\" and \"Neon Drive\" in its neo-futuristic approach. The game makes extensive use of HDR and bloom, along with shiny, reflective surfaces and stark contrasts of color put against a predominantly black background, achieving this atmospheric, sort-of night drive feel \u2014 that is, if the whole city was a huge nightclub with all the lights pulsating to the blasting house music. Generally, the game is very upbeat, but it can also get pretty dark and moody, eerie even.\n\nIn conclusion, it's safe to say that \"Distance\" is going in the right way. Of course, there's still a lot of room for improvement that hopefully the developers will wisely make use of with the next updates. Right now, however, we have a product that does what it sets out to do pretty decently, which is to offer a fun, laid-back racing experience that, even though it won't change your life or the way you think about arcade racers, is surely to keep you entertained, even if just for a while.", "timestamp_created": 1500823966, "timestamp_updated": 1513484882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609944", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33729700": {"recommendationid": "33729700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113767299", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503408089}, "language": "english", "review": "Really worth buying this game also if it's a beta\nThe game is interesting, funny, well realized and the ambientation is incredible\nAlso developers are doing a great job with the updates", "timestamp_created": 1500757070, "timestamp_updated": 1500757070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33729321": {"recommendationid": "33729321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202186841", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1516334437}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely enjoyable game.

In other words, this game is a speed-based trick game that will have you flying and parkour-ing (is that a word) off walls. For early-access it feels like its on the right path, but checking some comments, users have been mentioning this game hasn't been fully released for a few years. I would say make sure to do your homework on this one before you decide to buy it.\n\nDistance can be considered a racing game. It takes a lot of elements not traditionally found in racing games and really uses the environment to amplify the danger of racing. I'm not talking about taking tight corners or overtaking on a turn, I'm talking about avoiding lasers, random blocks that will appear, flying objects that will plant themselves in front of you and tracks that will assemble as you drive. The game feels familiar as the driving scheme is effective and simple, but the abilities the car used in conjunction with the amazing environment makes for some solid [b]gameplay[/b]. The control scheme of the car is more tight than loose. For the theme of the game it works really well - otherwise I would be complaining if this was Dirt 3 or Shift 2. I like the rigid turning style only in certain games that rely on tricks. The car has a visual bar at the back to notify the player if they are over-using boost. If you over use boost, your car will blow up. Jump is another feature in the game that can be used at any time. This feature will be needed when you need to wall or roof ride. The car can also fly when required. Flying is relatively easy and the player can literally go anywhere when they are in the air. Be careful though, the flying scheme uses boost as well and can heat up the car pretty quick. \n\nThe [b]visuals[/b] are pretty rock solid and follow a neon sort of Tron glow. The effects in the level are pretty intense especially at high speeds. The scene is sort of like a picture when you're speeding along dodging lasers shooting from the sky and giant saws ripping through the floor back and forth. The graphics are sharp and the levels feel decently full of effects and animations. The [b]sounds[/b] were done pretty well. There are levels where you will be rocking out to the music and other times where you will be a little afraid because the level, the animations and sounds are all eery. The game does a decent job immersing the player in this random neon-Tron universe. \n\nOverall, the game is good - but there is still a lot of work to be done. The adventure mode, arcade mode and split screen is fun, but I feel more needs to be added to make it a well rounded game. I see potential for mini-games and other online/local modes. One can only hope as an early access back-er. Again, I liked it - I felt like I paid a little too much - so definitely wait for a good sale and definitely do your homework. My advice to the dev would be to continue to add different environmental effects (track appearing as you drive sort of stuff) and maybe battle elements the car can do against other cars ? \n\n\nRATING : 6.9/10\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n    [td]Gameplay[/td]\n    [td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n    [td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n    [td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n    [td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Replay-ability[/td]\n    [td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Overall [/td]\n    [td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1499280758, "timestamp_updated": 1499280860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563417", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33276337": {"recommendationid": "33276337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083342721", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511578291}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most enjoyable racing experience I've ever felt.

First off by itself I'd say it's an above average racing game. It has enough base mechanics with the thrusters and jump. Which by themselves are simple concepts but the creativity put into the dev made maps make all the levels feel unique and fresh. But creative is a word that needs to be saved for the community made maps. This game has easily the best set of available community features since forge in halo. Most of the time you spend in this game will be constantly trying out new community made maps that range from recreations of iconic race tracks from other games to things seen in film and tv series. Not to mention this games soundtrack is stellar. While not effecting gameplay to an extreme it adds an atmosphere not felt in many other racing games. There are not a ton of games that impress me with their score ad this is definitely one of them. Only downside to this game that I see is the the graphics aren't very clear at points and the gameplay can be a little repetitive if your only playing on similar dev maps or player made maps. This game is decently more of a game to sit a relax to. The intense hard levels can be interesting but a lot of times it can just feel frustrating due to the sheer amount of controls for your vehicle which makes deaths unsatisfying a lot of the time. This game has a rhythm to it that I like in the well made levels, but you will definitely waste your time on some bad levels.

Ein lange bei mir belieb\u00e4ugeltes Spiel, welches ich jetzt im Sale erworben habe. Da ich total kein PC-Snob bin, habe ich dieses Spiel getestet, angespielt und gebe meinen Senf dazu. Ich will noch anmerken, das diese Review sich in 2 Teile teilt: Das normale Gameplay und einmal das Gameplay mit einem VR Headset (in diesem Fall eine Oculus Rift CV1).\n\nKommen wir zum Speck der Geschichte.\n\nPart 1: Das normale Gameplay\n\nGameplay: Das Gameplay in diesem Spiel ist echt in Ordnung, gerade f\u00fcr einen Early Access Titel. Das Spiel l\u00e4sst viele Man\u00f6ver zu, man ist nicht auf die Strecke an sich beschr\u00e4nkt, es ist sehr schnell und hektisch. Das Spiel ist fordernd, belohnt einen aber auch f\u00fcr so manch eine riskante Aktion. Die Checkpoints sind sehr fair gesetzt, sodass man permanent boosten kann und so ein sehr sch\u00f6nes Gef\u00fchl von Geschwindigkeit aufkommt. Das Gimmick, dass die Strecke einen versucht aktiv zu behindern, ist mit Nitronic Rush und \u00e4hnlichen jetzt nichts neues, aber immer noch sehr willkommen.\n\nSteuerung: Die Steuerung ist zweischneidig. F\u00fcr jeden, der ernsthaft spielen m\u00f6chte, w\u00fcrde ich empfehlen einen Controller zu benutzen, da dies die beste Art der Steuerung ist. Auch nur auf diese will ich ier eingehen. Die Steuerung ist sehr Arcade-lastig, da man Kurven sehr haftig annimmt, Aktionen sofort eine Reaktion erzeugen. Die Steuerung ist aber sehr solide, und die Buttonbelegung ist jetzt nichts schlechtes. Das einzig gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftige w\u00e4re hier das ausrichten in der Luft, welches ein wenig \u00dcbung erfordert.\n\nGrafik: Ja, das ist f\u00fcr manche auch ein Punkt, also erw\u00e4hne ich diese hier. Die Grafik in diesem Spiel ist recht gut, Modelle sehen sehr sch\u00f6n aus, die Effekte, vor allem die Lichteffekte, sehen super aus und passen perfekt zu diesem Spiel. Die Lampen des Levels blinken im Takt der Musik, die S\u00e4gen sehen immer noch bedrohlich aus und man hat eine sch\u00f6ne Weitsicht, welche in diesem Spiel auch vonn\u00f6ten ist. Das ganze l\u00e4uft bei mir in h\u00f6chten Einstellungen extrem fl\u00fcssig und ruckelt auch nicht. Aber dies kommt auf das jeweilige System an.\n\nMusik: Ja, dies Musik ist auch was. Es gibt Songs welche eher in die Richtung \"Naja\" gehen, w\u00e4hrend andere einen sehr sch\u00f6nen Takt haben und auch einen dazu antreiben, noch schneller zu sein. Die Musik passt sich aber nicht um den Spieler herum an wie z.B. in Nitronic Rush, sondern sind an das Level gebunden. Wem die Musik nicht gef\u00e4llt, der kann auch eigene Tracks in das Spiel einbauen.\n\nSo, kommen wir zur K\u00f6nigsklasse.\n\nPart 2: VR Gameplay\n\nIn diesem Part liste ich nur das reine Gameplay auf, da Steuerung und Musik gleich sind. Okay, ich hab gelogen, ein wenig zu Grafik werde ich auch sagen. Fangen wir an.\n\nGameplay: Das Kern-Gameplay ist identisch mit dem des Normalen, nur das man anstatt au\u00dferhalb des Wagens in dem Wagen sitzt. Dadurch hat man dann einen First Person Racer. An sich ist die Idee super, nur kommt hier der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Kritikpunkt: Das Spiel ist extrem unangenehm zu spielen in VR. Es ist viel zu viel an pl\u00f6tzlicher Bewegung, viel zu viele Dimensionen und extrem un\u00fcbersichtlich, da man extrem schwer was voraussehen kann. \nIch bin kein unerfahrener VR Spieler, und spiele EVE Valkyrie im PvP, ja ab und an sogar War Thunder in VR. Bei diesen Spielen merkt man aber weniger, dass man in einen solchem Gef\u00e4hrt sitzt, noch haben Aktionen wie Loopings etc. gr\u00f6\u00dfere Auswirkungen auf einen. Distance hat aber zu viele feste Punkte welche an einem Vorbeirrauchen, man sich aber selbst nicht bewegt. Dies f\u00fchrt zu einem \u00e4hnlichen Effekt als wenn man r\u00fcckw\u00e4rtig in einem Auto sitzt. Es wird einem extrem \u00fcbel. Also, wer sich dieses Spiel f\u00fcr den VR Teil holt, sollte einen sehr sturmfesten Magen mitbringen oder am besten gleich kein Gleichgewichtsorgan haben. Auch hier wird ein Controller empfohlen.\n\nGrafik: Die Grafik ist gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils die selbe, nur hier ist der Cockpit Part wichtig. Dieser sieht relativ gut aus, auch wenn ich bei einem EVE doch was besseres kenne. Dies ist aber Geschmack, und es ist ja noch ein Early Access Spiel. Aber das HUD an sich ist sehr nett und \u00fcbersichtlich in das Fahrzeug integriert, und bei mir lief es auch extrem fl\u00fcssig.\n\n\nAlles in allem ist Distance ein sehr gutes Rennspiel gegen die Strecke, welches viel Spa\u00df macht und eines der besten Early Access Spiele ist, im Gameplay, in der Grafik und der Musik. VR Spieler sollten sich eine wenig zur\u00fcckhalten, aber jeder, der solche Spiele mag, sollte zugreifen.", "timestamp_created": 1498426077, "timestamp_updated": 1498426077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32784920": {"recommendationid": "32784920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139790387", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494560162}, "language": "english", "review": "- deleted the old achievements\n\n- dead/dysfunctional multiplayer\n\n- game trailer content is nowhere to be seen in the actual game\n\n- it's just a bad early access title\n\n- also overpriced, $20 is ludicrous\n\n- This game could pass for either a highly detailed mini-game or as a good $2 arcade game\n\n3/10 would return if I still could", "timestamp_created": 1498418231, "timestamp_updated": 1499394955, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32774752": {"recommendationid": "32774752", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992174881", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453070486}, "language": "english", "review": "Multiplayer is dead.

When you jump, you can't hold forwards because you will faceplant your car, if you hold backwards you do a half backflip landing on your back, it feels annoying.\nThe visuals. Yes I did say that the visuals were good in this game, that's because they are. But it's a trainwreck when you're driving; there's so many things happening around you that you don't know where to go. I often asked myself if I was about to drive into a wall or not. There's also no useful visual assist in the game. Whenever you learn to do a new shiny thing in the adventure mode, it tells you that you can do that thing, but that's also the only thing it really tells you. It doesn't show where you have to go, there was a point where the track split in two and of course, I drove in one of the directions (they connected at the end), but it told me I was driving the wrong direction. Apparently you had to jump up, and fly upwards, in the middle of where the track split.\n\n\nI asked myself \"What the -profanity- is going on in this game\" about every 30 seconds, because it felt like that.\nWill I recommend it to a friend?

And you can implement your own music very easily in the options.\n[*] The game is very much in active development, no worries that this will stick in Early Access forever. Apart from the missing campaign this game does feel quite polished and finished already, if development would cease right now I'd still be happy with the game I got.\n[/list]\nThe meh:\n[list]\n[*] The sense of speed is there but sometimes the game doesn't feel very fast. This varies greatly from level to level and some community tracks can feel really fast, others really slow. \n[*] Can be a bit hard to find online matches, even though there is a community racing event every saturday and you can play this game solo.\n[*] Solo Campaign is not yet finished and will be released when the game is done. For an idea of what to maybe expect from the story mode, try Nitronic Rush linked above.\n[*] Performance is mostly good but can be a bit shaky, especially as some community levels are not optimised.

If, like me, you like the design and atmosphere, and sound design of Thumper but you don't have the reflexes of a robot, this might be the game you were looking for. Not that it has no challenge - it actually gets pretty hardcore on the latest track now available - but its driving game mechanics is by nature more forgiving than Drool's core gameplay based on pure rythm.\n\nThe game's motto and description describe it quite well : it's a survival racing game. All you have to do is get from point A to point B, but many traps will be laying around on your path. Lazers, saws, grinders and walls popping up 10 meters from you are the most obvious, but the track itself gets pretty tricky. The road suddenly stops ? Well, might as well ride a wall or even the ceiling, the gameplay allowing jumps and various methods for controlling the car mid-air and even flying on some portions.\n\nBut what impressed me most is how deeply the music fits what happens on screen. Unlike Thumper, Distance is not a rythm game and as such music doesn't directly come from your actions - though sound effects are really well integrated. But it is still highly dynamic with music dynamically changing to fit the atmosphere of the track, getting more violent as things get tricky or more minimalistic and strange when the track allows for contemplation.\n\nNote : the game is currently in early access, but the gameplay is already perfectly balanced and probably matches the final product. Developpers are now adding tracks to make the campaign slightly longer, but a track editor is available as well as steam workshop, meaning the content is already almost infinite.

The vehicle you race in is massively maneuverable, with jump jets and extendable wings, that allow you to race on tracks that break appart, shatter, do 360 loops, go upside down and back up again, demand clinging to walls and ceilings, barrel rolls, and all sorts of other intense maneuvers that slowly become second nature as you play the game. The tracks also boast lasers and traps dedicated to shredding your car apart - and interestingly, if a laser cuts your car in half, you're free to keep zooming along with half a car, hoping to make it to a checkpoint which will put you back tgether. The game's frantic pacing and trap layout means this happens more often than not, and you can actually be rewarded for cutting it altogether too close - a great and satisfying feeling.\n\nThe music is pulse pounding and goes along with the game great. Big dropping beats keep yoyu in the action and on the edge of your seat. Not much else to say here.\n\nA level editor and a seed generator give you procedural tracks to race on, and levels made by other players to grab on and take, with a system for voting for your favorite ones, so the cream of the crop rises to th top. This ensures that new content is constantly being created and found for you to do. you can also always Time Attack your favorite tracks, trying to get better and better times and breaking the tracks with new shortcuts.\n\nFinally, the game boasts multiplayer in various game modes, allowing you to play with friends, race with friends, blow friends up, and maybe (?) cooperate with them but you'll probably be too busy leaving them in your dust to bother with that.\n\nThe game is still Early Access, but there's plenty of content here for people who like to go real fast and fly real fast and dodge lasers.

It is the spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush, a game that you can download for free on the Digipen website.  Distance was designed to continue where Nitronic Rush left off.  Unfortunately, Nitronic Rush was so amazing that Distance had little room to improve on the mechanics of gameplay.  This is offputting for some people because Distance only adds a small amount of depth of play compared to Nitronic Rush.\n\nSome people might expect a long campaign from this game.  Don't.  This game is very community oriented.  If you are not willing to play other people's tracks or to make your own, then this game is probably not for you.  However, because of the reasonably easy to use editor, you may be inclined to make tracks more than play them.  \n\nPersonally, I have spent most of my time on Distance making tracks.  Were they all good?  No.  Were they fun to make? Yes.  Track making is the main reason I play Distance, and it is something that I will always enjoy doing.  If you want a community oriented game or just want to make crazy tracks, then this game is probably for you.\n\nI hope this review helps you!", "timestamp_created": 1488063311, "timestamp_updated": 1488063311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30179792": {"recommendationid": "30179792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202004218", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448109564}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr geiles Spiel.

Robot Car was speed through the city, avoiding danger, harrowing death traps, hostile defense systems, and a strange alien entity hell bent on destroying Robot Car.\nSo it's basically Brave Little Toaster, only faster. \n\nDistance is a driving game where your main objective is to reach the end of the map as fast as possible without crashing or slowing down, the faster you go, the better your time ends up being. There is also a story mode where you have to go through a long gauntlet of tracks, but as of writing this review, the story mode isn't 100% completed.\n\nEach track takes the form of a long street filled with twists, turns, loops, and traps, and your car has all of the abilities necessary to reach the finish line without turning into that strange red substance I find on my mattress. You have turbo, jump, flight mode, the ability to descend quicker, and wall/ceiling riding. \n\nMuch like the clothing I steal from the back of goodwill trucks, the controls in this game are tight. Taking corners, drifting, flight, and jumps all feel satisfying and easy to pull off. There's nothing more satisfying than going full speed from wall to cieling to floor to wall to floor without slipping or crashing into the wall like a drunk suburban girl who can totally hold on to that mechanical bull. \n\nDistance's biggest bonus is it's multiplayer. Not only can you race others for best time, but there's a workshop in place where other players can upload the maps they made. These maps range from stinky maps that suck to maps that put all the tracks in the main game to shame. Some times you're tested to the limits of your skill as the creator throws everything he can think of at you without making it impossible. \n\nShould you play Distance?\n\nYeah, probably, do what you want, I'm not your dad. Distance is fun, fast, thrilling, and basically everything I want in my outrageous action games.

The game is absolutely insane, never in game have i had so many moments that make you want to clutch your heart after a near miss of a saw blade or the gut wrenching feeling of taking a jump to just to realize you didn't take gravity into account and are now falling from the track. Even better yet tho is the feeling of making these mistakes and then through quick and crafty maneuvers recovering from your mess up without simply resetting to the last checkpoint. \n\nNow it seems that 3 of the main reasons people down rate this game are as follows. either they think the story is far to short and not worth the money, the online community is to small and have little servers running, or that they cant stand the music. Well let me explain why these should not effect your opinion. Firstly the story mode, Obviously its still incomplete. what they have is nice and when i first got the game a played it a bit and only did the story mode. after about 2 or 3 hours i finished it up and i to had the feeling that it was ok but may not of really been worth the money. However the Story mode is essentially just a tutorial to get you ready for the really great stuff. You see distance has and absolutely insane editor and some of the maps you play will feel worlds different from anything you've play previously. Many of the community levels have a higher difficulty level than the story mode the process of learning and attempting to play these levels are the best. What you play from the community levels will make your opinion of the game jump exponentially high. Now yes the community is small but its a strong community. I've rarely got to the server list and not had 2 to 3 games to join. Its not the kind of game that needs tons of servers. sure it could be a bonus if they had more but everyone is just playing a bunch of maps generally ranging from 5 to 15 mins levels and then rotating to a new level. Finally the music, personally i like it but more then a few people complain that they just cant stand it. Thing is the dev has an option to point the game to your own music library to play in game. With this enabled you'll get all the flashy effects of having the background lights of certain levels sync to your music or if you chose to enable it you can have music bars on your car window that move to the beat of the music. All In all its a great game, keep in mind theres a reason most of the bad reviews have such low gamplay hours. They didn't play the community levels, they didn't bother to learn how to play the game, or they didn't bother play online after seeing so little servers etc. Theres a reason the fanbase of this game while small is so strong and a reason for its 94% positive rating. \n\nThe developers continually update it and what they have currently is just amazing. I believe the story mode is the last major thing that they will be adding to the game although i could be wrong as they my have even more up they're sleeve. They have many modes Sprint being the most prominent. \n\nThe Sprint mode is Simply get from point A to point B. generally they'res a clear path and checkpoints to take however if you have the skill, knowledge, or luck you can take your car off track in an attempt to find a shortcut. \n\ntrackmogrify - This mode lets you input any seed and it will randomly generate a track using it. It actually works surprisingly well\n\nChallenge - a mode where you have nor resets, checkpoints and only one life on small tracks\n\nStunt - do tons of tricks to get the most points\n\ntag - get the tag for as long as possible\n\nspeed and style - do the track as quickly as possible with lots of trick points \n\n\nAll in all its a great game with tons of replay ability and i highly recommend it to anyone who wants a new racing experience unlike any they've had before.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1484785084, "timestamp_updated": 1484785084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29329197": {"recommendationid": "29329197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297995050", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484696609}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is not what it looks like at all.

Besides frame rate, the only other concern I had is some issues with input lag but as far as I know, those are tied to the frame rate.\n", "timestamp_created": 1484425742, "timestamp_updated": 1484425742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29252270": {"recommendationid": "29252270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351021689", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507518286}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0420\u0435\u0431\u044f\u0442\u0430, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f, \u0441 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439, \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e 10 \u0438\u0437 10, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433", "timestamp_created": 1484414005, "timestamp_updated": 1484414005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29238106": {"recommendationid": "29238106", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970529465", "num_games_owned": 923, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514403606}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty great racing game.

There are a few settings in this game that could cause sickness with artificial movement, however these can be turned off.

I'm digging the concept thus far, but am kind of bummed on some of the supposed, what the community calls, \"skips.\"  Yeah, yeah...I've read the arguments for them, and I don't completely disagree with the reasoning.  I get it - you're supposed to be able to explore a bit, climb buildings, etc. But when it defeats the purpose of having the tracks in the first place, then something needs to be done with the levels to make the tracks mean something.  I'm not suggesting getting rid of the abilities of the vehicle, but merely for the \"official\" tracks to be better designed so that everybody is not racing on who can skip the most.  A possible solution would be to make certain checkpoints required, and to map additional required checkpoints onto already known \"skips,\" thus making them more of a \"shortcut\" that happens to raise the difficulty level to shave off some seconds.  That's my opinion, anyway. \nFurthermore, I very much miss the couch sessions I would have in College playing 4 player battle mode on Rush.  I realize this probably isn't in the plans, but it would be hella cool if this game had something like it.\nOverall, for the discounted price of $10, I'm sure I'll get my money's worth.

In these modes you will have different ways to play like SPRINT, Speed and Style, etc. I\u00b4m not going into details but those are different ways to get score in the tracks. There is another mode that is really crazy, you could type a word or a phrase and the game will create a track based on that! hahahha amazing.\n\nThe Workshop is another STRONG FEATURE here. The game has a very good community that is not only following the game but also providing quality content. The tracks are organized by Difficulty, the play modes and explained a little by the creators. The result is....A LARGE QUANTITY OF VERY GOOD TRACKS TO DOWNLOAD AND ENJOY.\n\nVR Review:\n\nRegarding VR FACTOR. \nThe game is very well prepared for VR.\nYou have the PoV from the cockpit and you can select a 3rd person cam that could be adjusted freely.\nYou could adjust the VR SS directly from the game, the resolution, each of the effects, texture quality, etc.\nBesides all those factors...the game FEELS very smooth and fast.\n\nRegarding the speed on VR: this game is REALLY FAST. \nStill REDOUT is a faster game than this, but the reflexes and reactions that you will make here are unique, and you won\u00b4t find them in any other VR game.\nI\u00b4m explaining you this so you could think about your SICK factor. In my case at this point I could say I\u00b4m immune.\nIf you can tolerate it, I REALLY RECOMMEND IT for VR. There is nothing like this in VR.\nIf you tried it, and got sick, remember that you could still play the game without VR. So in the end you could still enjoy it and maybe try small VR sessions to train and improve your resistance. ;)\n\nThe only complain that I could mention at this point regarding the game is that it still being developed, and the stock content like adventure is not yet complete. But really after the first time you enter the workshop and start downloading tracks...you will not care at all. \n\n9/10\n\nTOTALLY RECOMMENDED.\nThese kind of games are the good INDIE examples that bring hope to gamers and fresh new IDEAS to the scene. \n\nAnd this is even much better for Virtual Reality gaming!!\n\nHere is a video to show gameplay with a friend of mine, playing 3 different tracks, so you could see the variety of them:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_LiwPhozV8", "timestamp_created": 1482859739, "timestamp_updated": 1511463571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28717808": {"recommendationid": "28717808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137687224", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499092957}, "language": "schinese", "review": "       666\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u867d\u7136\u4e0a\u624b\u96be\u4e86\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u719f\u7ec3\u4e4b\u540e\u771f\u662f\u723d\u5230\u98de\u8d77\u554a\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u73a9\u8fd9\u79cd\u79d1\u5e7b\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u7ade\u901f\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u952e\u63a7\u98de\u884c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u624b\u611f\u7565\u4e3a\u522b\u626d\uff0c\u6574\u8f86\u8f66\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u6709\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u778ej8\u4e71\u98de2333\uff0c\u83ab\u540d\u5fc3\u75bc\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u98de\u884c\u5458\u4eec\u2026\u2026\u603b\u4e4b\u76ee\u524d\u51ac\u5b63\u7279\u60e0\u534a\u4ef7\uff0c\u56fd\u533a\u5185\u53ea\u9700\u82b134\u5757\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u5165\u624b\u5982\u6b64\u9ad8\u7aef\u5927\u6c14\u4e0a\u6863\u6b21\u7684\u6b21\u65f6\u4ee3\u7ade\u901f\u4f73\u4f5c\uff0c\u7edd\u5bf9\u7269\u8d85\u6240\u503c\u3002\n       \u89c2\u4f17\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\uff0c\u673a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5931\u65f6\u4e0d\u518d\u6765\uff0c\u60a8\u8fd8\u5728\u72b9\u8c6b\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u8d76\u5feb\u5145\u503cSteam\u94b1\u5305\u8ba2\u8d2d\u5427\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1482856291, "timestamp_updated": 1482856291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28700448": {"recommendationid": "28700448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049901488", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503122014}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate racing games.\nI love this game.\nIt took me 10 minutes to love this game.\nI wish i hadn't waited so long.\nIf you want this definitely get it, especially if it is ever on sale", "timestamp_created": 1482818402, "timestamp_updated": 1482818402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28698084": {"recommendationid": "28698084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087333851", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493849231}, "language": "english", "review": "Forgive my lack of hours, I thought I would give my opinion on this game after being blown away by how amazing this game is.

If there was one thing I didn't love about Nitronic Rush, it was how masochistic some of its tracks could get, requiring an insane, expert-level mastery of the game's control systems far beyond what Nitronic Rush's singleplayer campaign normally required. Thankfully, the truly difficult stuff was pushed off to the side, in a special category that straight up warned you how unfair they were going to get.\n\nDistance isn't so kind. Though it shares a lot of DNA with Nitronic Rush, it bills itself less as a TRON-styled \"Rush 2049\" tribute and has rebranded itself as a \"Racing Survival\" game. What this means is that Distance has no qualms throwing you in to the meat grinder (sometimes quite literally), demanding you get your sea legs in the middle of a raging storm. Often, the game will start teaching you one technique, and before you've gotten a handle on what to do, it'll start teaching you the next thing, requiring you to juggle multiple lessons in a way that I thought felt overwhelming and more than a little frustrating. It's not that they're bad ideas, it's just paced a little too aggressively, even for a game billing itself as \"racing survival\". You always have your hands full in the worst definition of the term.\n\nUnfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) the campaign isn't done as of this writing. After around an hour (give or take), you're abruptly hit with a \"To Be Continued...\" screen. Thankfully, there's an easy cure for both the current crummy singleplayer campaign AND the fact it's not finished: the Steam Workshop. There are HUNDREDS of user-made tracks to play on the Steam Workshop and it's incredibly easy to cherry pick the highest-rated tracks and spend hours racing through endless neon wonderlands. This, if you ask me, is where Distance truly shines, as many of the best community-created tracks are significantly better than the official Distance content. The only complaint I have there is that I wish there was a little more visual variety -- after you've played 200-300 community-created tracks, everything starts to blur together because the majority of them use the same glowing-computer-city assets. \n\nIf it wasn't for Steam Workshop support, I would have a hard time recommending Distance. The game as it stands right now has pacing and difficulty balancing problems and is incredibly short. But it's those user-generated tracks that really come through in the end, not only filling in the gaps, but basically making up the entirety of everything fun about this game.

These levels, in my opinion are what is causeing this game to live and thrive within its own community.\n\nNow, I will admit the game has its small bugs, I have encountered latency issues when racing others, the game only has one achievment, and the UI could be improved some. But I'm not worried about these things not getting fixed, because after playing this game for so long, I can see that this is a soul project. That these developers arn't just making this game to make some cash, they [i] CARE [/i], and they [i] LISTEN [i/].

Where do I even begin with this review...\n\nGameplay, It's phenomenal. Driving the car feels extremely smooth, and doing tricks to dodge the obstacles is great. Playing the game on adventure mode presents all commands slowly enough to learn things on the go, while each track gets more insanely twisted as the game progresses (currently unfinished as of the time of this review). If you want more challenge, go for the arcade mode, and race against the time to get yourself on the global rankings.\n\nMusic and graphics, also great. It's an athmospheric futuristc setting full of neon and style, that will keep you pumped for action all the way.

I can't say too much about it as I haven't played a lot, but from the time I have played, I've really enjoyed it. Here are some pros and cons to the game:\n\nPros: \n\n - The music is really nice. If you're into any sort of electronic music, the game has some decent songs in store. If you don't enjoy the songs the game provides, it's simple to choose your own songs from your computer\n - Good levels. The levels are fun, fast-paced and keep you on the ball constantly. It's easy to get caught up playing many different levels without realising where the time has gone\n - Fast-paced. This game is incredibly fast-paced. Every single second counts and misjudging a jump, a turn or an obstacle can be very problematic. This makes it very fun as the level of focus required is great.\n - The community. The community is constantly creating new levels and this provides all kinds of fun, with new designs constantly coming out\n - You can create your own levels. If you want a break from the action, you can create your own levels to submit to the steam workshop for you and other people to play. \n\nCons:\n\n - The design capabilties of the cars isn't too expansive, but the design of the car doesn't really matter, but for those who like cosmetics, this may be somewhat annoying\n\n\nOverall, this game is really good, and I'd recommend buying it in a sale as the price is a little much. But regardless, this game is fantastic, intriuging and fun to play always.\n\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1479510517, "timestamp_updated": 1479510517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26676688": {"recommendationid": "26676688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093338574", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514740462}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Espero que esto os sirva como an\u00e1lisis :) .\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgd0Rrtt8B8", "timestamp_created": 1479494158, "timestamp_updated": 1480284833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26649590": {"recommendationid": "26649590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289927250", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "last_played": 1516473353}, "language": "english", "review": "its good", "timestamp_created": 1479411391, "timestamp_updated": 1491768044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458015", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26645600": {"recommendationid": "26645600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266183114", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509465753}, "language": "english", "review": "bad", "timestamp_created": 1479397995, "timestamp_updated": 1479397995, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.218530", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26634692": {"recommendationid": "26634692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047618078", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "last_played": 1515701126}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a pleasure for the senses, and it is very addictive.

l'un de ces jeux en Early Acces ou l'on pourrait presque croire qu'il est un produit fini si les devs ne l'avaient pas dit, dans la pile les Early Acces, c'est un bon jeu \u00e0 avoir.\n\nBon, maintenant concernant le jeu : Distance est un jeu de course (probablement inspir\u00e9 par Nitronic rush) qui se d\u00e9roule dans un environnement extr\u00eamement futuriste ou vous devez amener votre voiture (DU FUTUR) d'un point A au point B le plus vite possible en \u00e9vitant les multiples lasers, scies, et murs sur votre chemin.\nSachez qu'en plus du chemin propos\u00e9, vous avez une grande libert\u00e9 de mouvement, vous pouvez prendre des chemins alternatifs ou vous pouvez carr\u00e9ment partir dans le d\u00e9cor, sur les immeubles et les structures (qui peuvent dans certains cas vous sauver la vie si vous vous \u00eates fait vir\u00e9 du droit chemin).\n\nVotre v\u00e9hicule est compos\u00e9 d'un moteur \u00e0 fusion qui vous permettra d'avancer, en option est inclus un boost (ATTENTION A LA SURCHAUFFE), des propulseurs lat\u00e9raux (pour vous la raconter en effectuant des figures styl\u00e9s), ainsi que des ailes pour vous d\u00e9placer dans les airs (ATTENTION \u00c9GALEMENT A LA SURCHAUFFE).\n\nNiveau gameplay : Je recommande fortement un contr\u00f4leur pour ce jeu m\u00eame si on peut se d\u00e9brouiller avec un clavier (comme je le fait moi)\nvous avez la possibilit\u00e9 de choisir entre plusieurs mode de vues : 3\u00e9me personne, 3\u00e9me personne \u00e9loign\u00e9, vue au cap\u00f4t, vue \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re personne (dans la voiture).\nperso j'utilise principalement la 3\u00e9me personne \u00e9loign\u00e9 et la 1\u00e9re personne quand je me d\u00e9brouille bien sur un circuit.\n\nModes de jeu :\nAventure (en d\u00e9veloppement) : ce mode de jeu vous apprendra les bases du jeux suivis par des niveaux plus compliqu\u00e9s pour vous tester, une histoire est plus ou moins en place mais... c'est pas encore tout \u00e0 fait complet.\n\u00e0 suivre dans les prochaines mise a jours?\n\nArcade : diff\u00e9rents petit modes de jeux pour s'amuser tranquillement, sprint \u00e9tant le mode par d\u00e9faut, il y a un mode multijoueur assez sympa malgr\u00e9 le manque de serveur (c'est un petit jeu)\nArcade est \u00e9galement l'endroit ou vous pourrez acc\u00e9der aux niveau cr\u00e9es par la communaut\u00e9 sur le workshop, en parlant de \u00e7a les devs du jeux ont fait un petite collection de leurs niveaux favoris cr\u00e9e par la communaut\u00e9, \u00e0 vous d'aller la consulter.\n\nGraphismes : c'est joli, ensuite cela d\u00e9pend de la map mais m\u00eame avec des textures et effets simples on peut faire un beau jeu.\n\nPerformances : il fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien sur des ordinateurs de faible calibre comme le mien m\u00eame si j'ai, sur certaines maps cr\u00e9e par la communaut\u00e9 des lags d\u00fb au niveau de d\u00e9tails mis par les cr\u00e9ateurs.\n\n\u00c9diteur de maps : sans cela et les cr\u00e9ateurs du workshop, la dur\u00e9e de vie du jeu aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien faible mais heureusement qu'il y en \u00e0 un. un peu difficile a prendre en main malgr\u00e9 tout.\n\nSoundtrack : HMMPH I LOVE IT <3\n\nCONCLUSION : un jeu de course sympa et color\u00e9 (selon la map) qui va vous scotcher, pr\u00e9parez vous \u00e0 foncer pour d\u00e9fier la gravit\u00e9 dans ce jeu qui va vous mettre la t\u00eate \u00e0 l'envers, je lui donne un solide 9/10 :)", "timestamp_created": 1478011412, "timestamp_updated": 1478011412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4,

Let's list the awesome points :\n- Excellent EDM music that puts you into the action and the race like nothing can do. (Unlike in the previous game, Nitronic Rush (which I recommend too), you don't have the \"interactive\" music where it does some more sounds & notes when you jump : I personnaly liked that a lot but I can understand that it's not added in this game)\n- Intense speed sensation when in fullscreen and with the right setup.\n- A tight gameplay that will challenge your skills and reflexes, I think that's one of the most interesting gameplays I had on a race game. You get the fiber really fast and once you have it : badass race at every corner.\n- The decor (mostly in space) really matches with the music and the speed : combining colors and speed brings you into a psychedelic experience that is really enjoyable and made me feel a bit of that 90s vibe I got in Nitronic Rush.\n\nEDM, Speed and Space what can we ask more to have a badass experience ?\n\nNow let's list some of the bad points that could be improved : \n- More content (like the story). But you know that's the principle of a game where you put passion : forever getting better. And I don't doubt they put passion in it.\n\nI sincerely don't have anything bad to say about it because I know that with time things that are missing will get implemented.

In the game you play a digitized car, zooming around death-dealing obstacles. My favorite part is when I careen into a laser; it cuts my car in half, but I manage to skid my way into the next checkpoint, regenerate, and continue to finish the race.\n\nI hope when the game has its official release I'll be able to recommend it, but I can't yet. That's because of the mechanic of track transfers.\n\nIn most levels of Distance you're asked to leap from the horizontal track to a perpendicular or parallel one. This action feels rewarding when successful, but the trouble is twofold. First, these track transfers are hard to see coming. In some of the community-made levels, signs near and on the track make them clear. However, in many cases they just look like a simple jump or flight is required, and by the time you realize what the game wanted it's too late. \n\nSecond, gravitational disparity makes the jump feel wonky, and it's extremely hostile to beginners. In Distance, sometimes you're racing straight downward in relationship to ground. Othertimes, you're perpendicular to it, and you're spiraling around so much that the only way to be certain of your position in space it to look down at a compass graphic on your car.

Here is my review of Distance\n\nDistance is being developed by Refract Studio which also made Nitronic Rush ( a free game ) when they we're in DigiPen as Student, so Distance is a sequel of Nitronic Rush.\n\nDistance have in content \n\n- A short adventure mode who learn you the basics tricks of the game\n\n- A Arcade mode with others mode of racing, Like Sprint, Stunt and others.\n\n- A Level Editor where you can create your owns track and share it on the steam workshop\n\n- Like i said above you can download tracks from others user on the Steam Workshop, you have more than 1600 tracks on it, all i can say these track are really nice and some are hard but can be done by using what you learn in the short adventure mode.\n\nAbout the adventure mode which can be completed in 30-45 minutes, but this one have some decent tracks with decent music. I really liked it. the difficulty is not hard and you learn all the tricks you can use in others levels. My favorite adventure mode tracks is the Monolith one. When you completed this mode, you can go in Arcade mode than sprint, to re do them and get medals, and unlock 3 more levels ( depend of the medals you get )\n\nThe game is using the Unity engine, which run pretty nice on lower end pc or laptop. If you plan to buy it, i suggest you for the moment, to use the Experimental Build which run better on low end pc.\n\nAbout the Level Editor, this one is really complete you can use the music you want on your tracks, and others cool feature :).\n\nI hope you liked my review, and then probably you will buy it. The game is still in Beta ( Early Access & soon in stable build ) but the developers always listen their community, even on twitter and steam forums.\n\nThe game cost 20\u20ac or 20$ depend of your country, but you won't be disappointed of Distance.", "timestamp_created": 1476028263, "timestamp_updated": 1480169917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25917264": {"recommendationid": "25917264", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983874667", "num_games_owned": 724, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500816594}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever.

Das letzte Update war ein sehr wichtiges und f\u00fcr mich entscheidend das Spiel zu kaufen. Generell hat dieses Spiel allerhand guter Ideen, mit Gravitation, Effekten und Musik. Die Atmosph\u00e4re kommt an und macht Lust noch weiter zu kommen. Doch dann endet es mit der Bemerkung, dass es noch nicht fertig sei und weiterer Inhalt folgen wird.\n\n[h1]Inhalt[/h1]\nNun gut... Immerhin gibt es einen Workshop und einige sehr kreative Maps. Also einmal ein paar heruntergeladen und bei sp\u00e4testens in der Map \"Particle Cannon\" war klar, was alles m\u00f6glich war. Also vor Enthusiasmus gleich mal den neuen Map Editor ausprobiert. Die Ern\u00fcchterung war, dass dieser nicht so einfach zu bedienen war, wie man das gerne h\u00e4tte, bzw. einiges an Zeit Investieren m\u00fcsste um mit diesen brauchbar Maps zu kreieren. Daf\u00fcr ist dieser aber ziemlich m\u00e4chtig und es gibt von den Entwicklern ein Tutorial:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb9JYeYjtI\n\nAber man muss sich nicht zwingend mit dem Map Editor befassen, da mittlerweile schon eine Menge Maps von der Community existieren. Au\u00dferdem hat man noch die M\u00f6glichkeit zufallsgenerierte Welten erstellen zu lassen. Dieser Modus nennt sich TRACKMOGRIFY. Hier ein paar Seeds von mir:\n\n[list]\n[*]thefuture\n[*]backtothefuture\n[*]psychedelic\n[*]fasterthenlight\n[*]1337 (Sehr witzig, da die Map wie ein Easteregg wirkt)\n[*]FutureCity\n[*]dr0n3w4r\n[*]perfectblue\n[*]yellowandorange\n[*]stellarcollision\n[*]cybertr0n\n[/list]\n\n\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nAlso mein Fazit nach 2 Stunden Spielzeit, es macht Spass und stellt mit seinen unterschiedlichen Mechaniken den Spieler immer wieder vor neue Herausforderungen. Damit aber dieses Spiel leben kann, braucht es eine aktive Community die Spieler mit Maps versorgen. Die kreativen Standardkarten sind leider zu wenig, um ein Spiel f\u00fcr 20 Euro zu rechtfertigen. Im Sale kann man sich das Spiel aber schon holen. Sollte sich allerdings im Jahr 2017, noch immer diesbez\u00fcglich nichts getan haben, w\u00fcrde ich davon abraten, dass Spiel zu erwerben, da es sich dann lediglich um eines der vielen Early Access Titeln handelt, bei denen die Programmierer kein Interesse mehr besitzen es fertig zu stellen.", "timestamp_created": 1475590390, "timestamp_updated": 1475788457, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25831184": {"recommendationid": "25831184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179356697", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500166885}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, amazing music, amazing levels.

A driving/platforming/flying/puzzle game in a beautiful (and at times dystopian), TRON-like world.\n\nThe game is mostly about driving and jumping over or dodging road hazards, but with touches of flying. The puzzle element comes into play on rare occasions where it is not obvious where you are supposed to go.  You can use your set of driving/hopping/flying moves to find the level's exit portal.  You can also sometimes jump on the sides of walls and grip to them.  It can leave you not knowhing which way is up.  That is what the 3D compass display is for.\n\nThe level aesthetics, atmosphere and music are all excellent.  It can be very trippy.  Not in a psychadelic way but more of a zooming through a chill, digital soundscape kind of way.\n\nThe only negative I can think of is in terms of it's control configuration system.  The game works great with the Steam controller's trackpad for steering.  Turn the steering sensitivity all the way up so it does not dampen your trackpad input.\n\nThe problem is the game wants to use only your keyboard or only your game controller.   While editing your profile you can not mix and match Xinput controls and keyboard controls.  And the game has a bunch of controls to assign.\n\nThe game does respond to both Xinput and keyboard inputs.  But pressing something on the keyboard disables the right trigger until you move the analog stick (via the track pad in my case).  So it only listens to one at a time.  It is still early access so I hope the devs can make this more flexible.\n\nControl weirdness aside, I highly recommend!", "timestamp_created": 1472758913, "timestamp_updated": 1473994083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562427", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25279477": {"recommendationid": "25279477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075916327", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506138881}, "language": "english", "review": "Joyful game.\n\nBoom box mode is really nice!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1472700322, "timestamp_updated": 1472700322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25272166": {"recommendationid": "25272166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299780501", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514148716}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game, beautiful visuals, beautiful car.\nThis game is just so fun in how challenging it can be that you'll pass hour after hour, playing the same routes without getting bored for days, then when you get bored there's still the community maps for it, some of them having beautiful visuals, others being minimalistic but focusing on the difficulty.

It feels like Wipeout 2048, Burnout, and Trackmania had a strange love child. Yet somehow, Distance manages to be something all it's own.\n\nIf you're a fan of over the top racing games or the arcade racers of the early 2000's, you'll absolutely love this game. The levels created by the developer are well thought out and look incredible, and the large number of fan made levels are quality from what I've played thus far. Refract does a great job integrating fan made levels into the different online and offline modes. Distance nails that neo techno vibe that looks equal parts Tron and Amplitude. The levels also pulse along with the music, which is a nice touch.\n\nThere is something viscerally satisfying about the controls. A huge component of Distance is mastering how to \"jump\" from one piece of track to the next. Tilting the car, and learning how to work the controls is a fun uphill battle. I've played many games in this genre, and none of them handle the way Distance does. There is also the way the car starts to fall apart in between checkpoints. The sense of speed gives me flashbacks of F Zero, but the arcade style controls are much more remeniscent of Trackmania and Wipeout.\n\nIf there was one criticism to be had for Distance's controls, it's that the drifting mechanic doesn't feel right. You don't really need to drift because of how the game works, but my brain is so programmed to from years of playing racing games. It feels like the game registers any attempt to drift at any speed as the same thing, which is a little frustrating. Also, I think Distance would really benefit from a \"bump left\" and \"bump right\" function. The game feels a lot like Wipeout to me, and without the ability to double tap to move out of the way of an obstacle, something just feels a little off.\n\nThis is all nitpicking though. Distance is a phenomanal game. If you love time attack or arcade racers, I highly recommend picking this up.

Even better than Motorstorm.\n\nThe first thing that struck out to me was, before I even realized how tight the jumping was, that I could even jump at all; I'm not used to that! Yet here I am now wishing that almost every arcade racer took advantage of this mechanic. \n\nAnother thing I love is how Refract makes great use of Motorstorm-style boost mechanics rather than standard nitrous, where instead of running out of extra speed, you keep going and going until you overheat and blow up; sure, it's not realistic, but hey, it's much more fun and superb this way as it is.\n\nAnd finally, the sheer intensity and awe you generally feel as your vehicle strolls down the levels are a sight that I honestly cannot match with any other game within this genre, or any game ever for that matter. I mean, your car keeps going even when sliced in half by lasers! Not even Wipeout could match this.\n\nI doubt I said anything somebody hasn't already brought up, but it feels great being able to express how amazing this game is. Definitely worth full price.

my opinion is not the most nuanced on the topic. \nThat said, to me, Distance is a fabulous and inventive game. The movement mechanics of the car are actually suprisingly intuitive after the first few times that you use them, and these enable really cool tracks. Seriously, the tracks in this game are tons of fun to race on, even if you die a lot. \nAnd that's another thing: dying. Dying is quick and easy and can be self-triggered if you find yourself in a bad situation. I don't know how common that is in racing games, but it was quick enough that it didn't kill the pacing as long as I didn't screw the pooch on driving too hard. You'll lose SOME time, obviously, but it still feels really quick and easy.\nAt this point, the story is barely developed, but that's not a huge problem. The game tends to tell its story through the environments anyway, and it's amazing to me how well it manages to convey unease or awe through the use of music, noises, and visual effects. \nGetting new tracks off Steam workshop is really quick and easy as well; you can even do it from the Steam browser in-game, the game will check for new levels, and you can play pretty much instantly.\nIf there's any complaint I could make about the game, it's that the developer's levels (the official levels) are a bit too easy overall, and there's not that many of them. To get a real challenge I had to look to the Steam levels, but the community is really pretty good, so you can find a lot of difficult and inventive levels on the Workshop.\nSo, in short, if you like racing games, I would say Distance is good value right now even in its unfinished state; it's a barrel of fun and provides enough content (by way of the Steam Workshop) to keep you entertained for hours.", "timestamp_created": 1472088591, "timestamp_updated": 1472088591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25104722": {"recommendationid": "25104722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060453613", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472009756}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing game I can play once more due to amazingly helpful and fast developers.\n\nHIghly reccomended to just about anyone.", "timestamp_created": 1472006872, "timestamp_updated": 1472007979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25104280": {"recommendationid": "25104280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058908852", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486092631}, "language": "english", "review": "A fast-paced racer that finds a way to present itself in a very easygoing manner while still maintaining interesting gameplay mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1472004697, "timestamp_updated": 1472004697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25102526": {"recommendationid": "25102526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063797940", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500360751}, "language": "english", "review": "Distance, This game has that Hot Wheels/Tron kinda feel to it and I love it so much.\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[b] BoomBox Mode [/b] - Syncs with games soundtracks and your own music to like flash aall in game lights and give an earthquake/'boom' effect each time the bass hits.\n[b] Stunning Graphics [/b] - Ultra Quality Textures look absolutely awesome, Relfections work great and it's not as performance heavy with everything set to Ultra as you'd think.\n[b] Fairly Easy Controls [/b] - I play with a keyboard and It works great, supports controllers which in my opinion might be harder to master than the keyboard with Distance.\n[b] Variety in Tracks [/b] - Offical tracks and story mode + Community made tracks\n[b] Level Editor [/b] - MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN TRACKS!!\n[b] Game Modes [/b] - There's a variety of game modes which I'm yet to actually use.\n[b] Split Screen!

The only thing is... its still early access...  Yea, think about that for a second...  How many games (ever created) can claim something like that.  \n\nMy PC hasnt had an upgrade in a few years and it still runs this flawlessly.  \n\nGraphics: kicks ass.  Music: kicks ass.  Every track I've played kicks ass.  Loading Time:  Shorter than an ADD kids attention span.  Race track?  Screw that, I'm going to outer space.  See you at the finish line whenever the hell I feel like!\n\nAlso, Im not sure why, but I *really* like the way the items on the course blink with the sound tracks.  And the very nice transitioning of music between segments and courses (and when you crash and burn).\n\nSo far I have only downloaded one community track but it was just as good as the ones that came with the game originally.  I tried the map editor for only a few minutes so far just to see what it was like.  Honetly, it's going to take a lot more time to get comfortable with the massive amounts of tools at your disposal in there.  But that is a good thing, I think.\n\nIm not completely sure at this time, but I think I read someone else mention there are only 6 people making this game or something.  If that number is even close, I have to salute these guys.  Amazing quality!\n\nIm not just giving this a thumbs up, Im recommending it to anyone I know that likes racing games and will be gifting it to a few people for Christmas for sure.  I am definitely looking forward to where this game is headed and I am glad to have been an early supporter.

Can't wait to see what comes next!\n\n+Great soundtrack! The music fits perfectly with the atmosphere. \n+Huge variety of levels. You definitely will not be just driving around in a circle.\n+Local Multiplayer! Great to play with friends!\n+There's one level that feels like a driving horror game. It's the coolest thing I've seen in a racing game in a long time.\n\n-Difficult sections.

So i would expect further updates.\n\n(Quick side note, it has virtual reality support so you can go first person in the car while you drive which is cool AF lol, like driving a futuristic car in a hotwheels crazy world. You can also drive in first person mode while not having any virtual reality equipment but i dont think it would be as cool) \n\nIf you have ever seen the TV/Movie series \"Hot Wheels Highway 35\" and \"Hot Wheels The Acceleracers movies 1-4\" .

Driving at breakneck speeds as you jump from wall to wall, dodging obstacles and lasers as they appear in front of you, Distance is amasing.  The only bad part of the game (at present, dont know how it will change in the future) is the flying.  It lacks the speed and tension of the driving with few obstacles and no real precision required.  Put in some tight corridors and im sure thatll change, but for now its a bit lackluster.  These sections are, however, few and far between generally so they dont really hurt the game.\n\nBe warned, the keyboard controls are a bit nuts (ya, im the guy that trys to play driving games with a keyboard) with way too many inputs to mange.  Fortunately, this is easily solved with a controller (havent felt a difference that big since Dark Souls).\n\nEDIT: I think ive figured out why i like this game so much.

It isn't like your normal racing game, of course, you do have a track... because no shit sherelock, ya gotta drive on something, but the track isn't empty. It isn't a cart racing game either, as there are no weapons except for smashing your opponents into obstacles. What makes this game \"survival racing\" is the fact that the obstacles don't merely make you \"crash\" (which they can do if you hit them at light speed), they can chip away at your vehicle as well. If you cruze through a vertical laser, you're gonna get cut in half. Of course, you can still drive this way, but it isn't exactly a comfortable way to drive, as you've lost all of your previous control. \n\nNOW TO THE PROS AND CONS\n\nPROS:\n1. Getting cut up instead of insta death\n2. Flight, it adds a different dimension to racing\n3. It tends to run well, and if you're having trouble, just mess around with the settings, and it'll still look beautiful with lower quality graphics.\n4. THE COMMUNITY TRACKS! Some of them are outstanding, and really fun to mess around in, and the community for this game is amazing. \n5. CAR CUSTOMIZATION! Stand out from the croud with your garish Pink and lime green car.\n\nCONS:\n1. The car is a bit, floaty sometimes... maybe a drift mechanic is in order.\n2. Going quickly can feel a bit... slow, IDK why, but... maybe that's just me. \n3. MORE DEV MADE TRACKS PLEASE! The custom bits in them are uniquely awesome.\n\n\nALL IN ALL\n\nYou should get this game. Scroll back up. And hit that button.

There's a difference. The base levels are excellent, the learning curve is easy, and the community made levels range from terrible to amazing with the majority (in my opinion) being amazing. More often than not, you'll be driving through these levels and resetting the entire race from the beginning if you die once, as most high score badges involve perfect runs. Oddly enough, I found this game almost as relaxing as Euro Truck Simulator. Almost.\n\nVisually, this game is very appealing to me. Think Tron. There's an in-game option of adding your own playlist which literally involves just linking a folder on your C:/ drive so the game can access the path, which I think is priceless. The base story mode can be done in an hour, so if  you want to get the most out of this game, check out the community made levels and the soundtrack the level-makers provide. Aside from that, the sandbox level editor is confusing to me (as all level editors are, I'm just not of the right mind for them) but it seems easy enough for other people to make some really beautiful levels.\n\nImprovements? I think this game has an excellent concept and would love to see up to 4-person local co-op, but I can only dream of a day there were more mass local co-op in many other games. I think the online servers could be improved by establishing P2P servers instead of player hostings for the sake of consistency and ease of use. Last, I think there should be a lap-based mode for legitimate racing as it would draw a more competitive crowd to this game, would mitigate the severity of dying, and would further promote the use of the car tricks to get ahead of other players via boosting (because I get the feeling items, like in Kart racing games, will not be added at this stage of development).\n\nCome to think of it, if this game had a mode that functioned like a Mario Kart game for the sake of lap or single stretch racing, but kept the gameplay mechanics and visuals as-is, I'd shit my pants and proceed to buy a 4-pack.", "timestamp_created": 1467269876, "timestamp_updated": 1467269876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23942705": {"recommendationid": "23942705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145260138", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467743093}, "language": "french", "review": "Un tr\u00e8s bon jeux, les graphics sont digne de ce prix.

The only actual goal is to finish the map in the fastest way.\n\nSince it's still not complete there are of course things you could still add, like achievements or something else to unlock, custom vehicles, tuning parts or a money system to buy these cars (which don't exist, yet). So far, you have 1 car model which you can't modify except some color options and ranking lists (Current Party, local, friends, global).\nBeside this, the music fits in really well and isn't getting boring after a few hours of playing. But if it does so, you still have to possibility to add your personal music straight into the game.\n\nThe price of 20\u20ac is very okey, too but for 10\u20ac on sales it's definitely worth it! The game may still be in progress but you can play it already perfectly fine with nearly no bugs at all.\n\n/Edit: One negative thing is, that there don't really come updates...", "timestamp_created": 1467217053, "timestamp_updated": 1479933388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619071", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23926168": {"recommendationid": "23926168", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964623999", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508694254}, "language": "english", "review": "It is very challanging.

But in distance everything is just to easy, and it takes forever to find a hard track on the steam workshop, i miss the challange that NR offered me, i miss those tracks like loopy, kill it with fire or insanity rings (just to name a few).\n\nIn short, distance is way better than nitronic rush in general, but i just that this game would be even better with those things NR did better", "timestamp_created": 1467073882, "timestamp_updated": 1467073882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23877826": {"recommendationid": "23877826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006179229", "num_games_owned": 624, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467071642}, "language": "english", "review": "Tron meets Trackmania with great music and tricky courses.

This game will grow on you. It for sure did grow on me.\n\nThis game has a dev team that listens a great community and is just plain fun. It also has some more advanced skill stuff that allows you to progress to tougher tracks and gives it more longevity. Compared to your average racing game it is much more action packed and is far more innovative. I for sure recommend this game.\n\nOne of the main things that turned me off early on was the Adventure mode... It seems to be meant as a tutorial, however it quickly becomes too difficult for a newb and starts to feel like some frustrating puzzle game. I began to think the whole game was like that. Thankfully it's definitely not. I had simply strayed into a more advanced skill section than I was ready for.\n\nMy recommendation for players is to play adventure mode to get the hang of the controls, but as soon as it starts to feel hard switch to Arcade -> Solo -> Sprint or Transmogrify. For the devs, might want to separate the tougher stuff from the tutorial, IMO. And maybe make a skills challenge mode to practice more advanced skills.\n\nAnother big reason I changed my vote is that the devs and community are very responsive. When I asked for more settings for the Transmogrify random tracks I was sent this address: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19FYXnXRm9SWmzm-KjSx3dThvDLn2rYktWRbaz_Ugu6k\nIt gives seed words to give me some control over the random tracks.\n\nI was also told that I could just leave the seed line completely blank and the game would provide some seeds. I think that is now my favorite way to play. I can even look for seeds that I happened to especially like, or maybe dislike, for future reference.\n\nAnyway, I would still like some in game transmogrify settings, and for sure a favorites list for transmogrify tracks... \n\nBut the main thing I want to say is that the more I play this game and the more my skill improves, the more I really enjoy it.", "timestamp_created": 1467042767, "timestamp_updated": 1467297358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23864960": {"recommendationid": "23864960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103660627", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498270448}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u73a9\u8d5b\u8f66\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5f88\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u5c31\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57\uff1a\u723d\uff01\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5c31\u76ee\u524d\u6765\u8bf4\u5730\u56fe\u6709\u70b9\u5c11\uff0c\u8f66\u8c8c\u4f3c\u5c31\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u8f86\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\nDifferent types of cars are needed.", "timestamp_created": 1467042424, "timestamp_updated": 1467042424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23859202": {"recommendationid": "23859202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001048974", "num_games_owned": 615, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473580925}, "language": "english", "review": "alright so i havn't got alot of time (as you can see) HOWEVER i think i can put in some good notes\nits a time trial type game there is other modes but thats what adventure mode feels like. it introduces to to diffrent moves slowly through the game. there is a story beleive it or not (but ill leave it for you to find)\ni do feel like the flight/space controls need a little tweaking but its also cause i just hold A and D to long i think. overall i think this is an awesome driving game with a bitching soundtrack", "timestamp_created": 1467028428, "timestamp_updated": 1467028428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23851593": {"recommendationid": "23851593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092183855", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463374213}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u9762\u5f88\u9177\u70ab \u64cd\u4f5c\u624b\u611f\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9519 \u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u9177\u70ab", "timestamp_created": 1467004311, "timestamp_updated": 1467004311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23849531": {"recommendationid": "23849531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072798772", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503537751}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome.

These may sound like standard sci-fi and horror film props, but would you be surprised to find them in a racing title?\n\nOne that pits you against the hazards of the track in addition to the traditional clock. There are no laps, nor items. It\u2019s you, and the track. The aforementioned hazards are all standard obstacles that will stand in your way, minus Pumpkins. They\u2019re ready to slice, dice and completely destroy your car. However, you have the advantage of a rocket-boosting-self-repairing car. That last part can only be done at specific Checkpoint/regeneration rings however. As long as you have at least one wheel you can keep going. So, yes, driving half of a car (or even less) is a mechanic in this.\n\nDid I mention this car has the ability to jump, and take flight as well?\n\nThe controls are simple and easy to grasp. Although, I can say from experience that Rocket League did somewhat mess me up. The Boost option is normally where Jump would be. Although remapping the controls is easy.\n\nThe HUD is, rather cleverly, displayed on the back of the car itself. Every now and then a trick notification will show up, but this is only for a moment. Boost and flight are tied together. The engine can, and will overheat if left to run for too long. Pulling off tricks, or going through rings will cool down your engine, keeping you from exploding.\n\nIn terms of the car itself, it handles incredibly well. Not just on the track, but in the air. This thing may as well be a spacecraft. With not just a rocket motor on the back, but rotational thrusters as well. They\u2019re not just for show though. The road at some points may quite literally flip out.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t already sold on this car, its colors can be customized as well.\n\nAs seen above, the game itself is set within a rather mysterious floating city. There\u2019s really no sign of human life other than large propaganda-esque signs reading things \u201cSalvation in Science\u201d or \u201cTogether We Progress.\u201d\n\nWithout giving away too much, whatever it was that caused everyone to leave appears to still be out there. One of the first things noted is that an \u201cAnomaly\u201d had been detected in Sector 11.\nIt\u2019s your job to find it.\n\nYou\u2019ll be travelling through a world with design inspiration from things like TRON. If the Wipeout games sound familiar, this visual and musical style should be of no surprise. It\u2019s electronic, but not harsh dubstep. It\u2019s more in the ballpark of the Rocket League soundtrack. The world will also illuminate and pulsate according to the music. All music is also able to be replaced with custom tracks.\n\nSo, I could be barrelling down a course to F-Zero\u2019s Mute City theme.\n\nCurrently the Adventure mode mentioned with the vague plotline above is incomplete. However, an extremely robust Level Editor and Automatic generator both exist to allow for completely new races. The community has created some excellent levels. Some are obviously better than others, but in my experience one has to work in order to find the more iffy levels.\n\nThere are also a few other additional modes. A One-Life run through a small course, a \u201cReverse Tag\u201d that acts like keep-away and finally, Soccer. So, Rocket League without Boost and flips if you will. These are fun little additions, but they are just that. Additions.\n\nAlthough, if you search \u201cHorror Racing Game\u201d an article about this game is the first result. The developers have noted that they do intend for it to be somewhat frightening. Now, I\u2019m no fan of the horror genre, unless you consider the Ghostbuster-esque title Luigi\u2019s Mansion a horror game. Either way I\u2019m oddly excited for this.\n\nIn terms of non-horror Spooky things, the sole achievement available for this game is called \u201cPumpkin King.\u201d You have to smash every pumpkin on the Spooky Town Reverse Tag Map.\n\nIn its current state, Distance has a heavy focus on gameplay, rather than plotline. Because of this the rating itself will be given on the core gameplay and visual/audio design rather than level structure or plot.\n\nDistance earns a Good rating, with a score of 9/10. Easy to grasp gameplay along with a great visual and audio style lead to something I desperately want to see brought to Arcades. The sole reason I can\u2019t give this a full 10 is due to it currently being in beta.\n\n \n\nPS: Distance is the spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush.

Distance has more polish to it now than most Triple A games out nowadays, and it's very impressive considering it's not even done! Best and most functional Early Access game I've owned or seen on Steam.\n\nWith Distance, the main game mode is getting to the end of a track as fast as possible. Some levels can be scenic, and others can be a ride through hell, but it's insanely fun regardless. Slick visuals, tight controls, and metric butt tons of community content to go through and download (I have 500+ levels downloaded so far!). The level editor is incredibly deep and allows for tons of creative levels to be made.\n\nAs it is Early Access, the adventure mode isn't complete but will be when the full game comes out sometime soon.\n\nI don't regret grabbing this at all since it's been basically fully functional for over a year!

Neon colors, high speed, pulsating soundtrack. All of these look cool. Couple of Steam reviews were curious though. As if the writers didn't want to spoil something. I mean, what is there to spoil in a racing game? \n\nStarting the game on arcade mode solidified first impressions about graphics and music. Looks and sounds great! Runs well too, so techically no complaints. Driving seemed a bit weightless and floaty which was a bit of a letdown. Surely the devs know about this? First few levels seemed ok but made me question about the challenge and longevity. \"It's a cool little idea i guess\", i thought. Fifth level was a little different. Some new mechanics came to play and suddenly it wasn't such a simple ride anymore. Sixth level came and oh-my-god this is awesome! Now i see! This is great and it has to handle exactly like this! So it wasn't about spoiling, instead it's just hard to put all of this into words. Distance has a lot of cool details and mechanics that fit together really well. It has to be experienced to fully understand.\n\nTracks are like rollercoasters with roads going sideways, loops and upside down parts. The sense of speed is great. Tracks have obstacles like lasers that will cut your car in half and it looks really cool. Your car can even fly for long periods and some tracks are more about flying than driving. Switching between driving and flying is fluid and suprisingly easy to handle. Atleast with xbox360 controller. I didn't try with keyboard. The game does such a good job of subtly teaching how to handle obstacles. It made me feel smart. At the same time the speed seems faster and faster, soundtrack more and more intense. It's a trance-like state that is great to be in!\n\nThere are some stuff missing in the current version but Distance feels like a complete game. Great concept. Plenty of game modes. Technically solid. The game is still in development so there aren't that many players on multiplayer. Atleast on those times that i checked. There is plenty to enjoy in single player anyway. Distance comes with a track editor, random track generator and steamworks support so it's easy to find more tracks to play.\n\nI have burned with early access games before so for me its not easy to recommend unfinished games. Distance is the exeption and i thoroughly enjoy the game and got my moneys worth. Whatever will be added i think as a free bonus.

Hat man Distance eine Weile gespielt, kommt einem NR schon ganz komisch vor!\nMan muss dazu sagen, dass die doch komplexe Steuerung mit den enorm vielen Tasten vorerst total abschreckt und auch ich habe oft meine Probleme mit der Jet-Man\u00f6vrierung und bin allgemein kein Profi, aber habe dennoch meinen Spa\u00df damit.\n\nIst man auf der Strecke, bietet diese wieder viel sch\u00f6ne Hindernisse, Wandspr\u00fcnge und eine tolle \"Kulisse\". Man sieht Orte mit allerlei Farbvarianten und Layouts, zur Musik pulsierende Lichter und mehr. Dabei neu sind die fiesen Laser-Hindernisse, die nun das Auto durchschneiden, sollte man durch diese hindurchfahren! Das bringt nat\u00fcrlich gleich viel mehr Spa\u00df mit sich und ist manchmal auch eine nette Spielerei. :)\n\nAuch wenn die Story bisher nicht viel bietet, kann man sich mit den vielen erstellten Strecken der Spieler begn\u00fcgen oder sich selbst am Kreieren neuer Kurse im Level-Editor versuchen. Dieser kann zwar auch erstmal einen Schock bereiten, ist aber nach weiniger Eingew\u00f6hnungszeit ein tolles und m\u00e4chtiges Tool. Man kann seiner Kreativit\u00e4t freien Lauf lassen! (Ich habe auch ein paar Level erstellt! ^^)\n\nF\u00fchlt man sich oft einsam, kann man mittels Multiplayer-Modus sowie Splitscreen-Modus(!!) mit Freunden und Fremden spielen. Gerade im Multiplayer-Modus trifft man meist auf neue Spieler, sobald man einen Server ge\u00f6ffnet hat. Auch das regul\u00e4re Event \"Speedy Saturday\" tr\u00e4gt dazu bei, welches (sogut wie) jeden Samstag durchgef\u00fchrt wird.\n\nIch denke, dass ich den Review hier erstmal abrunde. Allgemein gesehen kann ich dir das Spiel nur empfehlen! Die Entscheidung liegt nat\u00fcrlich allein bei dir.\nFalls du interessiert bist, aber noch keine konkrete Meinung dazu hast, lad dir doch \"Nitronic Rush\" runter - es ist kostenlos!

Sometimes they don't spawn where you put the cursor if you build too high, other times it just takes years to position them right. Just like the teleporters - it took me ages to understand how they work, and how to position them right.\n\nRefract studios, you have an incredible game and an amazing idea, but you have to help us keep expanding it.

The mechanics are pretty much completely solid for a modern and physics-driven, yet arcade-y car game, a lot like Rush. Especially Rush 2049. You guys remember that, right? Well, that's immediately what the wings reminded me of, although you have a Spy Hunter-esque turbo which doubles as a jet engine in Wing mode.\n\nThe other amzing thing was the procedural damage to your vehicle's model.I don't know if it's really being torn in half or if it's just for looks, and the whole model is still there, but the fact it even knows what part of the car to disapear is still fantastic. You also regenerate less serious damage like having a laser graze the side or top of your car. And even if you take serious damage, you can still go for a regen checkpoint. I've survived with like a third of a car left. IDK how, but okay. Typically crashing will kill you faster than lasers, but it they do destroy your ability to move, and then you'll probably crash into something, like a grinder.\n[b]EDIT:[/b] Lasers generate heat and can kill you with that. Also, Torcht (composer and dev) demonstrated that you can survive with a sliver of your car left as long as its got wheels.\n\nI also like the mix of predictability and unpredictablity of various hazards, including non-static hazards that follow you before deploying. Protip: you can cheese them by slowing down.\n\n\nThe campaign pulls off proper progression of both difficulty and music in spades. The first time you encounter the anomaly  it comes all sudden, the music is fuckin creepy, and there's not much change in diffiuclty but still leaves you like \"OHHHH SHIT,\" but then when you encounter it again, the music is more rhythmic, like \"I've dealt with this before come at me, scrub,\" while the maps are much harder.\nAnd the ending you get because the adventure mode is incomplete was incredible. I've never seen anything like it, and mostly because at first I thought it was actually part of the game, and something crazy was about to go down. Hopefully this same, crazy bug-out becomes a part of the story at some point, a lot like how the anomalies work.\n\nbtw, what the FUCK was that detour? That was a wild experience.\nSilence. No gravity. No heat buildup. Bruh.\n\nI would love to see more of these mindfuckeries in the campaign, and be a part of the story somehow as well.\nIf you need any pointers, I'm sure Ransom Arceihn would know what to do.\n\n\nNo, I'm not even going to comment on the graphics because they speak for themselves, although I will say it's fantastically optimized, and I get ~60 frames running FXAA3, medium reflection, full anastropic, and medium shadows, all on an old, 2010 video card from when DX11 was first supported.

In meist sehr  dunklen, aber bunt beleuchteten Strecken fahrt ihr durch allerlei Hindernisse. Hierbei spielt Gravitation keine Rolle. Egal wie ihr euch grade an eine Wand gepackt habt, unten ist wo eure Reifen sind. \nDie angesprochenen Hindernissee k\u00f6nnen euch entweder komplett oder zum Teil zerst\u00f6ren. Seid ihr nur zum Teil zerst\u00f6rt (z.B in der Mitte zers\u00e4gt) k\u00f6nnt ihr euch bis zum n\u00e4chsten Checkpoint durchschlagen und werden dann wieder aufgebaut. \n\nAm meisten Spa\u00df mach Distance mit den von den Spielern erstellten Karten im Online Modus. Diese gehen von sehr machbar bis abgedreht schwer. Allerdings wird aufgrund der vielen n\u00f6tigen Funktionen des Autos ein Spiel mit der Tastatur doch sehr schwer und \u00fcberfordert sehr schnell. \n\nDistance zeichnet sich durch einen tollen Soundtrack aus, der das Fahren sehr passend unterstreicht. \n\nIch habe Distance seid dem Jahre 2015 auf dem Schirm und bereits seid der GamesCom des selben Jahres in meiner Bibliothek. Einer der Entwickler sagte an seinem Stand damals, dass das Spiel nahezu fertig sei und nicht mehr lang als Early Acess, sondern als \"fertiges\" Spiel zu erhalten sei.

Not because anyone recommended it to me, but i stumbled upon it and thought. \"hey. what the heck. looks cool\". I couldn't have been more wrong.\nThis game is more than good. It's Absolutely Outstanding.\n\nFrom the moment I started the game I was greeted by disclaimers saying it was an early access game and may change. and to report bugs if I saw any. Off to the main menu I went and by goodness was I surprised on all the features it has!\nYou can change the graphics to black light, film grain. shell shaded. <- (which is my personal favorite) and you have a feature to pretty much bass boost your game into completely shaking the maps. which is. Let me tell you. Just the best.\n\nMy first few tries at racing were. pitiful to say the least. But wait.. racing would mean you have competition? In this game really the only competition is you. and multiplayer have you, but you feel so compelled to do better. to get gold.. (i've seen diamond but i'm just not that good yet) and I have to say that even though it's been years since i've played a racing game. I find this game to be one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had. There is so much fluidity with all the functions of your car. and learning about them and hell. even mastering them makes you feel like a badass.\n\nThis game's artstyle is to die for. but the best part about this is that the music. dynamically changes the maps. not in obstacles or things it throws at you. but Interacting with certain colors. pulsing. and it's mesmerizing to say the least and albeit very distracting that it becomes an obstacle some in itself (not a bad thing mind you) and to top it all off it has VR support and you can add custom music, user made tracks. and even play splitscreen. all in an early access game.\n\nTL:DR Please buy this game. You will not regret it.

This isn't a racing game, it's a platformer. It can be great, I sometimes like it, but most of the time this platformer idea is beaten to the ground by some level creators, and people who choose to host lobbies. (Normal, public, racing lobbies are like rare af). I guess I'm an old school racer kinda guy but don't get me wrong I *can* enjoy platforming, when its done properly. However when it becomes 120% parkour, where the track forces you to take short-cuts only a selective few know, because they dedicate their time looking for it, it honestly becomes tiring. It really does.\n\nThe visuals are amazing, there are spectactcular things to be said about this game but I find this parkour thing really changing my view towards this game.\n\nI find this isnt a game where you can sit and play for hours on end unless you're creating a level yourself. You will also find some hidden and not so hidden gems created by talented members of the community... and you will find levels where you will question if they even bothered to play test the level before publishing.\n\nI'm a verteran racer from WipEout so my views are biased.

The game is pretty stable despite the fact it's in beta, and I haven't really found that many bugs, which is good. Adventure mode isn't complete yet, though, and there's still some refinement of the core gameplay mechancis that needs to be done - but other than that, the game's pretty much complete.\n\nThere's two main game modes available - Adventure and Arcade.\n\nAdventure mode is meant to be a short story mode that also works as a tutorial for the basic game mechanics. It's currently incomplete, but the devs are hard at work on it. They don't want to spoil the full story, so they're keeping their progress on Adventure in their private internal build, and they'll release it to the public in one big update close to launch.\n\nArcade is essentially a collection of different modes. Sprint is the main mode, where you have to get from the start to the end of the level in the quickest time possible. Speed & Style is pretty much the same as Sprint, but doing tricks to earn points will give you a faster time. Then you have Stunt, where you have to do tricks and get the highest score; Challenge, where if you die, you're out; and Trackmogrify, where you enter in a seed and the game generates a track out of that. There's also Reverse Tag in multiplayer (more on that later), which is a free-for-all battle mode where you're fighting for control of a sphere that gradually gets larger over time.\n\nWhile most of the game modes are fun, Stunt mode is pretty dull right now. All you really do is 1) fly in the air 2) do a bunch of spins and flips 3) land to score points 4) GOTO 1 until time runs out. The devs were planning to improve this mode AFAIK but unfortunately it might be scrapped for launch as they don't have a lot of time left now to work on stuff like this. Fortunately, they don't plan on stopping updates after launch, so this mode may return in an improved state afterwards.\n\nOne thing that's pretty cool about Distance is that this isn't your traditional racer where you're restricted to the track -  this is more of a parkour/platforming game than a driving game. There's no invisible walls blocking you from skipping the track, allowing you to come up with potentionally faster routes. The road is really just a basic guide to the map layout, and being able to deviate from that route and come up with your own is pretty much the entire point. It's not covered well in the tutorial or in the videos above, which is why many players seem to miss this. I like this part of the game a lot, though, so I hope it's covered better in the full release (Actually, in the alpha, which I sadly wasn't a part of, they had tips in the loading screens, one of which was \"Feel free to drive on buildings and walls, the roads aren't always the quickest path\" - something like that needs to be re-implemented IMO) so more people are aware it and also that newbies won't call out the speedrunners for \"cheating\" when they're using a skip route.\n\nI mostly play Sprint mode, where playing the game itself is really enjoyable. I don't really know how to explain it, though - Jumping between ceilings and floors while dogding giant saws of doom and destruction at high speeds is just a lot of fun for me. I've found the game to be even more enjoyable now that I've learned the skip routes, but I still don't really know how to descibe my enjoyment or why I find it enjoyable. It's just fun.\n\nAlso included in Distance is a powerful level editor with Steam Workshop support. It's a little tricky to get the hang of, but once you do you can make some really cool stuff. Want to see for yourself? Just check out the workshop. There's a ton of excellent community made levels, so if you get tired of the official levels, check 'em out. Even if you're not tired of the officials, check 'em out. There's some great stuff that's been made, and because of that it's pretty much impossible to run out of content.\n\nAs I mentioned a bit earlier, this game has a multiplayer mode. You can play splitscreen with friends, or you can join online servers hosted by other players, and even host your own. I haven't personally tried the splitscreen mode, but I have played online. When it comes to the multiplayer in Sprint/Speed&Style/Challenge/Trackmogrify, you're not really racing against the other players - it's basically the same as if you were playing solo, there's just other peole there. Stunt is a bit more competitive as you're trying to get the highest score, and Reverse Tag is only available in multiplayer, because it's basically a battle mode. There's no collision with the other players in online, but there is in splitscreen. To be honest, I like the no collision - it's nice that you can't be knocked out the way by other players. It just fits this game's style of gameplay more, where you're really racing against time rather than other players.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game if you want it soley for the multiplayer, though. It's more of a singleplayer game - plus, the servers are player hosted, and that added with the fact the community is kinda small right now, there tends not to be many servers most of the time. Playing solo is still a blast though, so it's not all bad. At the very least, the small community means that it's unlikely to find someone being a total asshole, and from what I've experienced the community is generally positive and helpful.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice, but some of the settings can be really intensitive. If you're experiencing low framerates, be sure to turn off realtime reflections, as that's a pretty big performance hog. There's a few bonus effects, like a stylised outlines option that increases saturation and adds an outline to everything, giving the game a slightly more cartoony look. There's also a film noir effect that makes everything black and white, and a cinematic letterbox option that adds black bars to the top and bottom of the screen to give the game a more, well, cinematic feel.\n\nThe music is awesome, in my opinion. I don't really know much else to say about it as music is entirely subjective, but I just really like it. I'm a fan of electronic stuff, so it's definitely nice to me. It's also catchy and memorable (to me). As I just mentioned, though, music is entirely subjective, so your mileage may vary.\n\nThere's also VR support, but I haven't tried that myself. I don't own a VR headset.\n\nPros:\n[+] Very stable for a beta game\n[+] The game is just really fun, for me at least\n[+] There's no invisible walls, allowing you to come up with faster routes\n[+] Powerful level editor\n[+] Loads of community-made tracks, meaning it's basically impossible to run out of content\n[+] Splitscreen and online multiplayer\n[+] VR support\n[+] Graphics are good\n[+] Music is great\n\nCons:\n[-] Stunt mode is kinda boring\n[-] The level editor is a little difficult to get the hang of at first\n[-] A small community and player-hosted servers means that there usually isn't many online games available\n[-] Some graphic settings significantly reduce performance\n\nSo, yeah. I've spent the past ~2 hours on this review, and it's really long, and probably sucks. But still.\nI also recommend Distance's spiritual predecessor, [url=http://nitronic-rush.com/]Nitronic Rush[/url], which is free and was developed by the same team, among others, as a student project at DigiPen. It's slightly different, but the core mechanics are the same, and it's also pretty fun (though I have not played NR as much as Distance).", "timestamp_created": 1462392220, "timestamp_updated": 1462392220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464602", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22792265": {"recommendationid": "22792265", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993473943", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498079852}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, good looking and challenging, but extremely short for the time being, very few official tracks, and slow early access development.

Time to change that and get you invested into this wonderful game, I have tried to explain every aspect of the game after playing for 90hrs;\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]\n\nDistance is a survival racing game, it combines the intense action gameplay into an arcade racing experience, speeding through a futuristic world. You have tight control of a speedy car that allows you to, boost, jump, rotate, fly and avoid obstacles through intense levels. An extensive level editor allows you to create any track you want to make and there are dozens of high quality tracks to choose from in the workshop that are all playable in multiplayer and local (split-screen) co-op.  \n\nWhile you may find yourself exhausted by Distance's mechanics, there are different game-modes, sprint, speed and tricks, 'catch me if you can' and even a soccer game mode to play. The many different tracks will surprise you time and time again and challenge you to race on until you complete the track successfully. Currently 20$ is more than fair and you'll certainly not be bored quickly by DISTANCE.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Diverse tracks to play in the base game, bundled together in 'campaign' mode that'll teach you the mechanics of the game, serves as an  introduction to the game\n\n    [*] Extensive and tight controls; offer a complete and very responsive control over your car (all controls are completely re-bindable to your liking)\n\n    [*]Nimble and flexible gameplay mechanics; not a typical stale A to B racer; obstacles, short cuts, loopings, riding on walls, skidding and jumping off walls, jumping from one platform to the next, rolling, traps and even flying!\n\n    [*]Multiplayer; with a fairly crowded community, at least 5-10 players online when I've tried, local [b]![/b] split-screen multiplayer (whens the last time you've seen that?) \n\n    [*]Extensive level editor; to make your own levels for the game, you can create pretty much any kind of level you want, all the tools are there to be used, tracks, traps, decorations, lots of assets. All of them can be played in multiplayer.\n    \n    [*] Learn from the workshop; there are already dozens of fun tracks to downloaded live (no need to restart your game) into your game and play. - See what mechanics will work for your own levels.\n\n    [*] Mechanics react to your actions; sprinting heats up your car and you will explode if you use it for too long, 'cool-down' gates reset your heat, car reacts to damage taken meaning half your car can get chopped off, still you'll be able to get to the next gate, perhaps with greater difficulty\n\n   [*] All the HUD, is on the back of your car, your screen remains largely uncluttered\n\n   [*] Neat futuristic sound track\n\n   [*] Ability to add your own music\n   \n   [*] Tense atmosphere; neat effects, futuristic surroundings, and diverse assets\n\n   [*] Control over many gfx settings, AA, shadows, film grain, borderless fullscreen... it's all there\n\n   [*] Leaderboards and scores, not really a pro but ups the replayability per level slightly- trust me you will want to replay a level and improve your score \n\n[/list]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*] The level editor; it is a bit of a hassle to get started with and the few tutorials are a good start but it will all be overwhelming to start with, I suggest taking a look at [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3a_a5lbQsM&list=PLrYP6KbfUR-XLtTh1XMzzUJM9NgVlDvBo]Niven511's detailed start on building levels [/url]\n    \n    [*]The main campaign offers too little, too few; It's a rather short, high quality intro to the game that will leave you asking for much more, you will need to re-route to community made levels and multiplayer [Dev has said campaign is already much longer in an internal build, update soon]\n    \n   [*] The game may feel light-weight; beneath all the flashy, innovation the game offers you may find yourself unsatisfied that there is little to do than to reach the end of each track, there isn't much sense of progress; the diverse traps, effects, the heating up mechanic and different game modes counter this con to an extent but leave the game feeling like it may be missing something after you have played it for several hours. The moves you can do remain limited, there is no AI to beat, the obstacles remain fixed as an 'add-on to the track', only 1 achievement currently\n\n  [*] There is only one vehicle model; no other cars to pick from. You can customize the the colours of your car though [Dev has said there will be another car added soon]\n\n  [*] A bit of a learning curve; you might get lost quickly, find yourself frustrated with the little mistakes that punish you, the overheating and the controls you'll need to learn. You'll can get over this after you've played for a few hours\n[/list]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]9/10[/b]\n\n[h1]I recommend you go the distance and buy the game![/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1462028752, "timestamp_updated": 1466901959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767186", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22706255": {"recommendationid": "22706255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262436972", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465370870}, "language": "english", "review": "Screenshot button destroyed. \n\n\u6c38\u522b\u622a\u56fe\u952e\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1461943929, "timestamp_updated": 1461943929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22698619": {"recommendationid": "22698619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106356418", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512861109}, "language": "english", "review": "The most unique and clever racing game I have ever played.

The graphics are gorgeous, as you can see in the screenshots above, and the soundtrack is incredibly well integrated with the action (although there's also the option for a custom soundtrack - which I have not tried - if you get bored with thumping techno).

The dark themes, the kinda awkward display, the crazy things happening everywhere; that was not what Nitronic Rush was about. But, as I played, I started to accept Distance for what it was: a masterpiece (that still needs a little work, but that's what Early Access is for).\n\nThe music is amazing. Like I said, darker than the prequel, but amazing. The first song I heard started of beautiful. Then, it got even better, introducing me to the real soundtrack. I was amazed. I don't even know if there's any way to get the soundtrack, but I want it.\n\nThe graphics are good. I don't care much about graphics, but in the artistic sense, not necessarily the quality sense, the graphics are better than most. They are able to set the mood so well, and make me feel whatever they want.\n\nI haven't even played multiplayer, so I can't comment on it. But the thing is, you don't really need to to get your money's worth. There are a fair amount of levels, and beating them doesn't mean you're done. I've spent hours slowly getting better at Nitronic Rush's measly six levels, and I'm not afraid to admit that I still am. I know, from what I've seen, that I will have the same experience. But wait, there's more! There are a crazy amount of custom levels to get, and I only have a couple, but that's got to keep you entertained! But it doesn't stop there! Trackmogrify offers a track to match your specific search terms, for more crazy fun! Now maybe we're over-glorifying it a bit. It's not a perfect tool, and the levels are never as unique as the community ones, but I still think I could use it a lot.\n\nNow let's talk about gameplay. This game can make me rage a bit, but not too much. Mostly it's just super cool and thrilling and sometimes a bit scary. I'm serious, I could compare this to a rollercoater, but I'm not good at analogies. Who gets tired of doing tricks on a cool car in a crazy neon area? Who gets bored while constantly dodging sawblades at hundreds of miles per hour? Not anybody I'd reccomend this game to.\n\nWe've talked about music, graphics, replayability, and gameplay.

Rien \u00e0 redire, on en prends plein les yeux et les oreilles, on y est vraiment.\n\nVient alors la consid\u00e9ration du gameplay. En premi\u00e8re personne, avec le casque sur la t\u00eate, et surtout sans controleur autre qu'un unique clavier... Il y a deux bonnes heures de prises en main. J'ai encore l'impression d'\u00eatre brid\u00e9 par rapport aux joueurs en troisi\u00e8me personne sur un \u00e9cran, mais rien de bien flagrant, je gagne quand m\u00eame pas mal de courses.

La communaut\u00e9 est superbe, donneuse de conseils, on d\u00e9couvre plein de map completement dingues, on peut en faire sois m\u00eame...

Qu'on voit la peinture fumer et la carrosserie voler en eclat sous les coups de lasers ? Qu'on peut bondir, tourner dans les airs, modifier la gravit\u00e9 pour conduire la t\u00eate en bas... Les musiques sont en plus adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 merveilles et contribuent \u00e0 ce stress permanent ainsi qu'\u00e0 cette sensation grisante de toute puissance et de vitesse.\n\nCe jeu c'est une d\u00e9couverte incessante, un renouvellement constant de cartes et de mode de jeu. \n\nLe seul b\u00e9mol est qu'apr\u00e8s 5 heures dans cette aventure, en enlevant le casque je n'arrivais plus \u00e0 marcher.

Almost like TRON in terms of visual style. The techno soundtrack adds a very definite atmosphere and style that will propably either help you either hate or like this. I personally am mixed how to feel about this, I like the style and innovation, and for me the techno is no real deal breaker either, it adds to the genre. But there is something in this game that gives me an unnerving feeling. The levels are innovative but somehow it just does not feel enough in terms of longetivity or variety. And by longetivity I mean not how many tracks there are but the repetition gameplay wise. It never evolves beyond that. This is a bit like wipeout was on ps1 but somehow that game for me was more fun and entertaining than this one. This game looks and sounds really cool but I'm not really feeling it. Also there is this weird vibe to the general feeling of the game. Wipeout had this upbeat positive vibe. This feels like the opposite somehow. These are propably a matter of personal preference. I still recommend trying this one out. It's definitely either a love or hate type of game depending on your preference. I'm not really delving in to the details of this game because theres enough coverage of that. I just add my 2 cents in which is more about the way games make me feel, good or bad.

I understand that a lot of fans of the original Nitronic Rush want Distance to be very similar, but that's no reason not to add a separate battle mode - why not have the best of both worlds?\n\n\nIn all, definitely a \"must own\" in my books, and it's something that I'll always come back to for a quick 'fun' fix :)", "timestamp_created": 1457328542, "timestamp_updated": 1457328635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543936", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21675438": {"recommendationid": "21675438", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968184751", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502783186}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr If you have VR, buy this game.  Campaign starts slow but will surprise you quickly.  Many game modes including random levels and a level editor, and multiplayer support.  Right stick click resets view in-game.\n\nThis game is now my second-favorite VR game after Elite Dangerous.  It does have a couple rough bits and the campaign is \"short\" though I found it quite satisfying even at the current length.\n\nVR enthusiasts will note that there's many interesting VR games but many of them are a pain to set up and operate; bad control schemes, no positional resets, etc.  This game only has one minor problem in this regard: the reset key/button does not work except during gameplay.  This is the only major problem in the game.  Otherwise, all menus can be operated with a controller or a keyboard, a reset button is available on the controller (Right stick click in), and the game is ready to rock out of the box.\n\nFInally, there's a very fun random map generator that I am really impressed by.  You can generate a level with any phrase (Try \"rainbow road\") and you get a unique level.  You can play these levels against other people online too!  And there's a POWERFUL map editor included, and any map you download can be played online as well; the game will automatically send the data to other clients even if they haven't downloaded the map before.\n\nI REALLY love this game!", "timestamp_created": 1457303461, "timestamp_updated": 1478756475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21671813": {"recommendationid": "21671813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152460908", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457292561}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the Music", "timestamp_created": 1457291322, "timestamp_updated": 1457291322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21659295": {"recommendationid": "21659295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068038586", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457683684}, "language": "english", "review": "AWESOME GAME GREAT FUN!!!", "timestamp_created": 1457248456, "timestamp_updated": 1457248456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21652416": {"recommendationid": "21652416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002247808", "num_games_owned": 510, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495935969}, "language": "french", "review": "Pour une Beta je trouve que ce jeu se d\u00e9fend plut\u00f4t bien voire tr\u00e8s bien.

A lot of the time you will be racing flat out, that is until your boost begins to overheat which cools at the next regeneration point.  You also get to jump obstacles, fly and wall/ceiling ride.  The game requires a high-level of skill and concentration, especially on some of the tougher levels!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fYKlaZSbPJI\n\nThe devs have included a track editor which mean there are around 1350 tracks at this present moment, and remember this game is still in Early Access!!  Not that you can tell this is a beta, it has the functionaly of a finished product and is extremely rich with features.\n\nOne planned feature not yet implemented that I'm most excited about are replays!  The game, as you can probably tell from video and screenshots looks absolutely gorgeous.  To have the ability to watch back (hopefully from external views!) a race in replay mode will be divine!  The engine appears extremely optimised and on my i5/970 runs extremely smooth, not even the smallest sign that any component is breaking a sweat!\n\nThe current campaign is quite short but also acts as a tutorial or introduction to the various moves at your disposal.  Although it is short it is extremely fun and very atmospheric.  The lighting rythmically flashing in time to  the dark techno pounding out your speakers and the weird static effects hurtling you through the environment really create for a highly enjoyable experience.  They are still adding to the campaign, but it's so fun I've replayed it a few times.\n\nYou've also got leaderboards, online play, time/score challenges to keep you more than occupied.\n\nOne problem I had initially was with the controls when attempting to switch surfaces to drive on.  Using the control pad to switch from floor to wall for example meant using the left and then right analoge sticks.  Previously this was my only apprehension about the game.  After perusing the forums a couple of other players recommended to switch the controls to advanced mode.  Now this frightened me a little!!  The game requires enough skill as it is without adding to it!!  Advanced mode meant that I now only have to use the left analoge stick to wall-ride.  So I can steer, jump off the road and then use the left analogue stick again to adjust my angle in the air to meet the wall.  Previously movement in the air would've been with the right stick and it felt extremely unintuitive.  Maybe this information can help someone else too.\n\nFull release is planned for later this year.  There's really no reason to wait, the game is an absolute stack of fun and a dream to look at.

This is a game that I can easily keep putting more hours into since there's a pretty much non-stop stream of new surprisingly high quality courses to run through made by the community. The \"beta\" tag really only refers to the shorter single player mode, as the rest of the game is incredibly well polished and plays amazingly. \n\nThere are a few downsides: \n[*]If you want to be good, this game is HARD. But there's also a lot of fun gameplay to master. You start by becoming good at avoiding obstacles, then you get good at using your thrusters to rotate your car in a pinch, and finally you can learn more advanced techniques like using your boost to direct your movement in the air and using your thrusters while on the ground to make quicker turns and stick to walls and such. Even beyond that is far more advanced techniques, but those are really only used if you want to do shortcuts, not really for just going through a difficult course normally. However, if you're not confident in your gaming skills, you can always stick to the easier courses, just be aware that most servers tend to run courses that are on the more difficult end of the spectrum. If that's the case, just find some easier courses in the workshop and set up your own server, there are plenty of beginner players out there that will gladly join you for some races. \n[*]The servers oftentimes are pretty few, especially in the off hours. I usually find myself starting up a server most of the time, but after a couple of races I'll usually have gathered 5 other people to fill the server. In the really dead hours though, you're lucky to find even 3 people online to join your server (however to be fair, most people aren't going to play this game at 3am EST). \n[*]There are some bad courses. For every amazing course, there are 3 horrendous ones to take its place. On the bright side, people rarely choose these courses when they're running their servers, so most of the time you only race on the truly exceptional courses (if you open your own server every time, you can of course control it so that you ONLY race on the good courses, but you don't discover any new content that way aside from browsing the workshop previously). What's cool though is that once you race on a course from another server, it's added to your library. If you don't like it, you can rate it negatively and delete it later, but if you do like it it's great because you can just keep it and play it later without any extra steps!\n\nFinally, I know that most people won't do this, but playing this game in the first person has been AMAZING. It can make it more difficult to do corkscrews and flips and such (although in some cases it actually makes some tricks easier), but once you adapt to it it truly becomes an incredibly immersive and engaging experience that I could easily recommend to everybody.", "timestamp_created": 1456731311, "timestamp_updated": 1456731311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21532032": {"recommendationid": "21532032", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982887215", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472407255}, "language": "english", "review": "really nice, good idea.

But this wasn't your typical racing survival experience. Players were thrown into an aesthetically pleasing digital world where you had to avoid various amount of obstacles as you drove fast, spun, flipped, flew, through an infected computer mainframe that doubled as a city. The game was released to the masses soon after DigiPen awarded it 5 awards including Game of the Year, Best Junior Game, Best Graphics, Best Physics, and Best 3D Visual Design. It won many awards from other Indepedent Game award shows in the following year.\n\nWhat originally started off as a freeware final project for school has evolved into a sucessor worthy of it's asking price. Distance is entirely built around the control scheme and physics of it's older brother so veterans will feel right at home with this installment. And, since it plays like it's predecessor, newbies won't feel overwhelmed. This is the kind of game that's easy to pick up but insanely difficult to master. So far the devs have shown a lot of promise in new design choices and the game is updated quite frequently. For example, one significant improvement is the change to cutting hazards. In Nitronic Rush, lasers and saws would pretty much destroy you in a single hit. Now, the devs have changed that so those hazards use a dynamic damage system to actually destroy the car without ruining your run. It's so absolutely crazy to be going at full speed, cut your car in two like a banana, and try to maintain control towards the next regeneration checkpoint. \n\nAt the moment the game's campaign is unfinished but that doesn't mean other elements aren't completed. The developers generously included the entire development kit within the game itself and integrated the Steam workshop. This allows anyone to create their own tracks and, as an added bonus, gives experienced game designers the ability to add unique and original content to the tracks they make allowing for endless creativity.

There are other, better reviews that discuss game mechanics and what it has to offer, so I'm going to skip that and ask:\n\nDo any of you, like me, remember the show Acceleracers?\n\nFormed by Hotwheels, this was an animated series that was, in my opinion, one of the best to existance. Basically, the top racers from around the world are chosen to form a small group known as the Acceleracers. They use a portal to warp to other dimensions with prebuilt tracks that they can race on. Each of these dimensions had a different feel and driving technique needed to master it. If you got to the end portal before the one hour time limit and before anyone else, you gained an acceletron; a small card-like device that gives your car \"superpowers\", and is in line with the theme of the dimension that you gained it from.\n\nAnyway, the series was insane not because of the tension between the human racers, evil robot racecars that tried to kill them, a secret society formed by the main character's own dad, and the amazing plot, but because of the stunts that all the cars pulled off in the show. Vert, the main character, is known for his car's jets being able to give him a boost upward, effectively \"jumping\". Additionally, cars were souped up with things like nitrox (a glorified version of nitro) and things that allowed them to fly, shoot a grappling hook, etc. \n\nOne of the most memorable things is when, in the final movie, was when Vert was directed by Tesla (the guy overseeing all the human drivers) to go through one final test. I'm not going to spoil it, but anyone who's seen it should know what I'm talking about. Anyway, it's a 1 on 1 race through every single one of the dimensions, and the thing is that Vert doesn't have any acceletrons. So, it's his pure memorization and skill that he needs to speedrun through the entire Accelerace before time runs out.\n\nThis game captures this perfectly.\n\nAlmost every game, I imagine myself as Vert driving, nimbly avoiding all obstacles, using boosters to jump, and maintaining a rediculous high speed while knowing that one slip up could destroy me and my car.\n\nAdditionally, in the series, there were always memorable moments of cars getting wiped out, flying out into rocks, smashing themselves off the road while the other cars kept it cool and just drove like life depended on it (which it did). There was even one scene where a car was lasered in half, and cars flying off the edge of the narrow track into oblivion.

The current build of the game under review (beta 4139), though only in Early Access on Steam - does contain PLENTY of content to keep gamers busy. The beta version of Distance houses a pretty barebones story mode called \"Adventure.\" It definitely IS an adventure, and there is some story to soak up here - though not a whole lot. The beginning narrative introduces us to the idea of the protagonist - which is some kind of sentient platform-mobile that looks like a car. I say looks like a car: because you'll find out over the course of the \"adventure\" that you have a pretty substantial range of mobility options at your disposal. As with any platformer packing some advanced mechanics, Distance starts off by treating you like a toddler. You'll have an accelerate button and be able to steer... and that's about it. But the savvy driver is soon abundantly rewarded with wave after wave of new obstacles and mechanics with which to bypass them. You'll learn how to boost right away in order to get over certain sized gaps that you wouldn't normally be able to traverse. You'll then find out that your sentient platform-mobile can sprout some wings from either side and leisurely fly in any direction. This adds a HUMONGOUS amount of range to the options you have in conquering some of the tougher challenges, although I was both disappointed and understanding when I found out that flight would occasionally be deactivated in order not to break certain difficulty barriers in Adventure mode. Additionally, boost and flight work off of the same meter, and allowing this meter to fill causes you to hear an \"Overheat\" alarm. Overheating too long causes an explosion and a reset from the previous checkpoint. Luckily, however, checkpoints are very liberally placed throughout each map in Adventure mode.\n\tWithout spoiling any details of the very barebones \"story\", which is really more of a setting than anything, I would like to say that there is an underlying horror vibe present in this dystopian neon wasteland - but it's cool, and doesn't feel too heavy-handed or like any conceits were made in order for it to make it into the game. \n\tAt the abrupt end of the included 10 or so levels of the \"remember, it's beta\" story mode, you'll find that you feel prepared to march straight into some of the other gameplay modes Distance has to offer.\n\n\tJust in the beta version of the game, there is a huge amount of replay value already present. Distance offers a pretty well thought-out, though basically what you'd expect multiplayer mode that allows groups of (currently) up to 6 players to go all Sonic the Hedgehog in maps, either: created by the developers, created by the community using the in-game level editor, or generated by inputting \"seeds\" into the \"trackmogrification\" tool: which randomly generates levels based on strings of letters. Each of these categories offer immense replayability and are sure to keep anyone coming back again and again since the game provides such a high-level of \"Wow, that was so cool\" moments.\n\tMultiplayer is purely racing. There are several modes, such as a tag mode, a challenge mode, and a sprint mode. Tag mode consists of players trying to be \"it\" as long as possible, challenge mode consists of trying to clear tons of obstacles with no checkpoints turned on, and sprint mode is just good old classic \"race-to-the-finish.\" Each of these modes is pretty spectacular, though the game misses out on achieving near-Mario Kart levels of competitive frustration since there is no collision detection between vehicles. You can see everyone else alongside you on the courses - you can even see when they SPLAT right into a barrier that popped up out of the ground while they confidently sped past at 500 miles per hour, but you can't bump into them at all. It's the equivalent of playing with a bunch of ghosts. That small complaint aside, the multiplayer is still very engaging - and the inclusion of text chat between participants allows for some nice banter in between matches. One glaring omission, however, is that there is no option when creating a multiplayer lobby on or offline to disable the platform-mobile's \"plane\" function. [EDIT: There is an option to disable flight, but it must be selected at the time of level creation rather than by the server host!] This created a situation for me where a room full of people called me a \"track-skipper\" because I flew from one tricky portion of the map to another (the equivalent of using a mushroom in Mario Kart to speed through rough terrain for a shortcut). Sure, this is probably common sense for most people, but I used the tools at my disposal, given by the game, and then found that this was looked down on. For good reason too. In some cases, because of the layout of a track - an opponent could finish a race in 30 seconds while the rest of us trudged on for a full 2 minutes, simply because he found an opening to \"skip-track\" to the exit. [EDIT 2: I have been assured by members of the Distance online community that \"track-skipping\" is very much a welcome part of the multiplayer experience as I originally hoped.] This, however, was a very small hassle - and the community seemed to be understandingly aware that the omission of an option to turn off flight in these multiplayer lobbies is an oversight simply not implemented in the beta phase of Distance.\n\tAlso, worthy of mention is that aside from the online multiplayer aspect, there is also the \"highly coveted among PC gamers\" option to play in splitscreen offline. \n\t\n\tAfter you've taken the community-created tracks for a spin, you may feel compelled to try your own hand at creating an amazing course filled with danger and explosions - and, thankfully, Distance includes a vast level editor - simple enough to get started in without much training, and advanced enough that you could basically create your own standalone story with the tools at your disposal. If you thought with the advent of Super Mario Maker that maybe an F-Zero Maker was around the corner - I hate to burst your bubble; but Distance may be the closest you ever come to realizing that dream.\n\nLastly, this experience is a visual delight and both audio and video build off of one another. The buildings pulsate in vibrant color to the resounding beats of the techno soundtrack. The environment moves in a showcase of sublime aural rhythm. I did notice that the boost sound coming from the platform-mobile was a little loud and kind of whiny when it hits top speed. Textures are clean throughout and obstacles on the track ahead of you are easy to see - even when they're flying at you in what seems to be an instant. There were a couple of times I felt a little turned around, but with clear visual cues - I found myself back on the right track quickly. As for optimization, I tested the game on my desktop with an nVidia 980TI and i7 2600k @ 1440p/maximum graphics settings and easily maintained 60fps throughout my time playing. I also tested the game at 1080p with my laptop packing an nVidia 860M and had 0 drops below 60 FPS - even when the screen erupted in a magnificent neon explosion in front of my eyes. \t\n\n\tDistance is one of the most purely fun games I've ever played. It can be very easy; it can be blistering difficult - but the undoubtedly adrenaline-filled excitement is sure to impress most. At a suggested price of $19.99, Distance is totally worth its cost right now: In Early Access.

(Ich zum beispiel habe damit noch keine gro\u00dfen erfahrungen damit gemacht.

The game is as great as it looks and is surprisingly well polished for a beta. I wouldn't have even thought it was a beta if I hadn't seen a message at the start saying so. The only thing's still missing is the remainder of the missions in the Adventure mode.\n\nThere are no timers which you have to beat and no other cars to race against (unless in specific game modes). For the most part the game requires you to traverse and survive the level which throws a variety of obstacles at you, such as looping roads, lasers, moving saw blades, ramps, flying sections, and so on. Add in the stunning visuals and nice music and you have an awesome high-speed sci-fi driving game.\n\nThere's plenty of content. Adventure mode has you go through the official 'main story' levels, which get gradually harder and introduce you to new challenges each time. Then there is also a level editor (which I've not explored thoroughly yet) and plenty of community-made levels to try out. And if that's not enough, there's a feature called Trackmogrify, where you type in a random word or anything else and it generates a race track based on it using some sort of seed generator. You can literally type in anything. Just whack random letters and numbers in and see what comes up.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the nice little touches, such as the car receiving very visible damage from the obstacles, like laser beams cutting parts of it off or even slicing it in half and the car still going. There seems to be an enormous attention to detail.\n\nOnly thing I am not too fond of at the moment are the parts where you have to jump and land onto sideways or upside down roads as it feels pretty clunky and requires absolute precision to get right, especially when a level chains up 2 or more of such parts within a short distance. Is it unfair? Most times no. But it can get very frustrating, because it creates a sudden difficulty spike in the level and causes you to die again and again and feel like you're not making any progress. In essence, the learning curve for those sections is very steep, even though they're very much doable.\n\nOverall this is a great game. I would highly recommend it for those who enjoy some high speed challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1454844944, "timestamp_updated": 1454844944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576673", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21022391": {"recommendationid": "21022391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086197785", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454901607}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not into racing games.\nI'm not into cars at all.\nBut this game...holy shit.

experieance.\n\nWant to see flashy lights and fly with your own music? Distance is here for you.\n\nThe story mode is not yet complete and adds no real depth to the game as the storyline is non-existant, however it serves as a perfect tutorial without much use of words.\n\nThere DEFINATELY needs some customizations with the car, custom maps are marvelous but the same car makes it slightly off focus time to time.\n\nMaps, lets talk about maps, it's just MARVELOUS! MARVELOUS! I wrote that twice for emphasis. The community maps are all works of art as I wonder how on earth they managed to imagine everything.\nBlaring flashing lights and the twists, curves, confusion of which way is sky and which way is ground. You may think you're on the ground until you jump to know that you were on the celing.\n\nFeel the speed when you speed up, controls start to get difficult as you reach the max speed just blaring your booster down the lane, the subtle shake of the car and blurring experieance is a stress reliever for me!\n\nGameplay is absolutely friendly, as dying is just to reset and get back on course. It sometimes actually helps to find the road where you are stuck on.\n\nI would love to use a VR for this game, it would be dizzy and some custom maps seem high on drugs but the feel like you're flying is something that is needed.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it for hardcore gamers as it doesn't have depth but if you want to ride and want to defy gravity with speed for an hour or two, I will definatly say it's worth the money.\n(Though it would be better if you could get at least a 15% sale or something $20+ seems a bit too heavy to be 100% casual.)", "timestamp_created": 1453549065, "timestamp_updated": 1453549065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20691199": {"recommendationid": "20691199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116230652", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464158473}, "language": "english", "review": "You know that experience you're wanting but never getting every time you boot up a 3d Sonic game?

I've deleted all comments to reflect this, but if I'm happy with the review then I'll leave all subsequent ones.\n\nDistance is a fast-paced racing game that focuses more on the survival of the racer than beating other people. The campaign is, at the moment, short and odd. It ramps the difficulty up pretty well but cuts off suddenly - however this is being worked on by the developers.\n\nThe car itself offers high mobility and control, with a boost, jump, and even flight - although there is an overheating function that builds up gradually while flying and boosting. If the car overheats while flying it will stop flying, and if it overheats while boosting it will simply explode and you'll die. It should also be mentioned that the car has thrusters, which allow it to flip, spin and push itself down onto the track.\n\nThe tracks themselves are either premade by the developers, or are made by the community and are posted on steam workshop, the best of which are featured on the menu screen in-game. The developer-made tracks are almost all used in the Campaign, and are all very high quality.\n\nSpeaking of quality - Distance has excellently optimised graphics. I can't say anything about the VR in the game as I do not own a Virtual Reality headset of any kind.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic - at least, in my opinion. Then again, music taste is subjective.\n\nI would recommend Distance - although the price of \u00a314.99 is a little steep, so in turn unless you're a fan of racing games I would recommend to wait until a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1453405970, "timestamp_updated": 1500141890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20657806": {"recommendationid": "20657806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108264534", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455451468}, "language": "english", "review": "For me,one of the best racing game after Trackmania:\n-Nice graphic\n-Pretty cool map\n-Challenge\n-Stunt \n-Fun\n", "timestamp_created": 1453372746, "timestamp_updated": 1453372746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20636913": {"recommendationid": "20636913", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993162982", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513035761}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great racing game that i'd recommend to my friends any day.", "timestamp_created": 1453267956, "timestamp_updated": 1480119858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20630897": {"recommendationid": "20630897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078885587", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452489934}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Nice game!

The 'Adventure Mode' which is the campaign at the moment is quite short with only 11 maps which took me just under 2 hours to complete, but these maps were very good at introducing me too the game slowly and made the learning curve very small while still teaching me many new mechanics in each level. In addition to the Adventure mode there is Arcade Mode which allows you to replay levels over and over to get better times in both Official and Community maps.\n\nThe community maps in this game are very exciting and just as good as the official maps. Many dedicated people frequently make and upload new maps to the steam workshop which is great as it keeps the game new and fresh. All these community maps are playable Online aswell as single player.\n\nThe online mode is great, although there is usually only 2-3 servers up at a time with a maximum of 6 players you can easily set up your own through port-fowarding. With friends this game can become very competetive, even if you dont have any friends that buy this game with you the community is awesome, you meet new players everyday aswell as playing again with the ones you met the day before. Everyone is extremely supportive on those levels where you are the last to finish and everybody is spectating you but you just can't get past a bit, they say what you should try and even if you DNF you have the next map to beat them on.\n\nOverall it is a great game with or without friends even though it is currently in early access and i cant wait to see the future additional content to be realesed with the updates to come.\n\nTL:DR\n\nPros:\n- Fun\n- Great learning curve with the Adventure Mode guiding you through\n- High mechanical skill cap\n- Competetive\n- 5 different game modes\n   - Sprint (racing)\n   - Speed and Style (racing but you do flips to get more points)\n   - Challenge (racing or short very difficult tracks)\n   - Stunt (do flips and get points)\n   - Trackmogrify (random gen levels)\n- Supportive and nice community\n- loads of community levels uploaded\n\nCons:\n- Small player base leads to only 2-3 servers at a time (unless you host your own)\n- Is in Early Access", "timestamp_created": 1452154573, "timestamp_updated": 1452155200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20367276": {"recommendationid": "20367276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271805142", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510064874}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u6ee1\u5206\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u7684\u70ab\u9177\uff0c\u7279\u6548\u505a\u7684\u4e5f\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5355\u4eba\u6e38\u620f\u80fd\u591f\u6dfb\u52a0\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bdd\u5c31\u66f4\u597d\u4e86\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adf\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u73a9\u5982\u679c\u6709\u5f71\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u7ade\u6280\u6027\u4f1a\u63d0\u9ad8", "timestamp_created": 1452141278, "timestamp_updated": 1452141323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20363021": {"recommendationid": "20363021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155263225", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1515992024}, "language": "english", "review": "The perfect arcade racing game: Tron-inspired, adrenalizing soundtrack, challenging and unlimited tracks, and a truly awesome experience.", "timestamp_created": 1452122915, "timestamp_updated": 1452122915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20360882": {"recommendationid": "20360882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055541101", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512688033}, "language": "english", "review": "I am really amazed by this game.

like to describe this as \"Super Meat Boy with Cars\", as the main goal of the game is to go to the end of the level while avoiding (sometimes) brutal obstacles.\n\nas for the level editor, I haven't done anything big but it reminded me a lot of blender, maybe because of the way it controls, I don't know, what I do know though is that the amount of things you can do is incredible.\n\nnow, time to list the Pros and Cons of this game:\n\nPros. :\n+ the idea of cars for a type of game like that is great and makes me wonder why it hasn't been done before.\n\n+ the controls work really well and are easy to get a grip on.\n\n+ The musics are great, they're not amazing in any way, but they work really well with the overall feel and futuristic theme of the game.\n\n+ The Graphics and 3D models look really good.\n\n\n+ The level editor is insanely powerfull for an early access game.\n\nCons. :\n- Sometimes, the game will ask you to rotate you car 180\u00b0 while in the air to stick to an upside down route, which doesn't seem to work half the time, could just be me being bad at the game though.\n\n\nAll in all, this game is a must have if you like games such as super meat boy.\n\nFinal

But it's way more fun to play split-screen with friends, you can play literally for hours. I'd highly recommend using a gamepad, it's much better than playing with a keyboard for this game.\n\nThe music, while it's not what I usually listen to fits perfectly together with the game itself and the atmosphere it creates. One of the things that surprised me is the fact that it runs really well on my second, older pc, which means that for such a beautiful looking game it's really well programmed and not hard on resources at all. \n\nThe level editor is complex, but great once you get used to it. There's a lot of really cool and interesting tracks in the steam workshop already which I highly recommend checking out. It also makes up for the fact that in the game itself there aren't that many different levels yet.\n\nThe controls are very good for driving, but flying and walljumps are difficult to get used to in my opinion. It's pretty hard if you use a keyboard and still not easy with a gamepad (in my case an xbox360 controller).\n\nI highly recommend Distance for anyone who loves racing games and I still recommend to try it out at a friend's for anyone else.\n\nI rate this game at a solid 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1451487991, "timestamp_updated": 1451488079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20116000": {"recommendationid": "20116000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153664873", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512162025}, "language": "italian", "review": "UN GIOCO DI AUTO FATTO DIVINAMENTE!!!

That's why you don't need bots; the survival/puzzle racing aspect of the game makes it engrossing enough to where you forget you're alone on the track.

Because there's no official servers or dedicated server software, people should host sessions from their own computers, and since pretty much everybody are behind a NAT these days, it makes a task of finding suitable server really difficult.\n\nPorts are okay at the very least -- as Linux gamer, I'm very pleased with how smooth and troubleless game runs on my not-so-fast-by-novadays-standarts-rig. As far as I know, Mac version runs pretty much the same.\n\nIf eventually campaign will be like four or five hours long, then I guess my money were well spent.

Unfortunately, even if they flesh out the `story mode`, there is little to do in this game other than proceed to the end of each track, each of which seems to be composed of cookie cutter components.  There are no deeper goals, no unlockables, no sense of progress, and no sense of reward.  There's no chaining combos, or learning new moves, or devious AIs, or special challenge levels, just an endless runner that happens to have wheels and loading screens every 3-7 minutes.\n\nAm I in love with the controls, the moveset, and the motif? Absolutely.  Can I spend hours browsing the workshop for more levels to add more content? Yes, but custom levels alone cannot expand the experience to the point that this game graduates from tech demo to actual title.  When every level feels like a repeat, and the only game mode is shallow, I can't recommend this as a full priced title.  \n\nSure, the game is in early access, and things could change, but the developers seem pretty clear in their direction, happy with the trajectory and `Overwhelmingly Postivie` feedback so far, so adding depth to the game doesn't seem to be on their radar at all.

All I can think of is a cockpit view and some new camera angles. And the ability to change how bright and intense the visual effects are.

The game slowly introduces you to new tricks and tips for controlling your sexy little car. \n\nThe physics glitch out at times for me, when I'm performing wall jumps my car will instantly flip around when I launch off the surface and it'll slide toward the gravitational pull of the map. If you're on a map with a portal and you go backward thru it, you'll get stuck in an infinite loop or sometimes spawn below the map (but you can blow yourself up and try again). The flying mechanics could use a bit of work as well. At times when I deploy the wings off a jump, the car will start rotating and gaining control of it can be tough if you\u2019re on a keyboard. \n\nThere is a lack of content for this game, but hell, the maps they've got are great and you can finish them in multiple ways with different paths.

There's usually a few (4-6) servers that have games loaded with their own maps. When racing online, there is a time limit, so if you're spectating a new dude you won't be sitting there for hours waiting for him/her to finish. \n\nAll in all, I pretty sure I missed a few key aspects but nonetheless, it's a very fun game.

I'm Andrew, a long time veteran from Nitronic Rush. \n\nI played it a ton when it first came out!! Loved it! I've also speedran it and enjoyed the heck out of it.

However I had a very positive transfer effect that I immediately noticed when I first started playing. I was also very accustomed to the controls, thruster boosting, and flying.\n\nPositives:\n- Incredible interaction with the developers, almost immediate and positive feedback. Bug reports are addressed very quickly.\n- Promotional events consistently every Saturday, tournaments occasionally\n- Updates are constant and positively improve the game each time. Features are added onto and changes make a lot of sense with development, user experience, and overall gameplay design.\n- Fun single, and online multiplayer experience.\n- Great solo experience that offers improving your times, finding skips, and optimization in movement of the car\n- Game modes are plentiful and offer a lot more gameplay time and hours into the game in addition to Adventure mode, community levels, and multiplayer racing.\n- Fast, quick reaction time, and game sense is awarded to avoid obstacles and finding faster ways to complete the track.

The only thing thats positive about it is controls. The car handles very well but the game fails in everything else.\n\nGraphics are ok but its like playing with no textures its a completely dull and lifeless world which doesnt keep you entertained. If there was at least multiplaye races but multiplayer is a joke. 1st there are no players and 2nd youi do not racee but instead try to complete the course without dying and you never get to see the other people because the speed of the cars is so fast that with a single second of difference youve already lost sight of your opponent. Also what is the fun in multiplayer if cars cant even collide. Its like racing against a ghost in a ghost barren town with 3 boring moves that are barely used and thats all the game is.

Todas las dificultades y obstaculos que se te ponen son un arma de doble filo en el multijugador, y eso me encanta, le puede dar un buen giro de tuerca a una carrera. La est\u00e9tica que tiene es muy estilo Tron (algo m\u00e1s recargado), efectos visuales buenos, fluided perfecta (en mi caso),... No le puedo achacar nada malo a esta faceta.

[/h1]\n\nThe game has [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDh5kXZ6BUw] come quite a long way\t[/url], and it deserves all the praise it gets.\n\nThis game is so much fun, especially with friends, I'll try to form review that's semi coherent, but this game blows my mind so it's a little difficult.\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\nThe ability to put my favorite songs from the Outrun/Futuresynth genre, fly around and have great looking visuals is enough for my purchase.\n\nI'm happy with the seasonal updates, they add a cute side effect while driving. \n\nThe game isn't that demanding either, especially for good GPU's like mine, R9 390, you can literally turn everything off, and have a simple looking game.\n\nThe community builds these amazing levels, that are not only the single most difficult thing I've had to master as a gamer, but they encourage replayability. Think if Audiosurf had more freedom, and a more intense third-person-car-timed-race feel.\n\nI look forward to future updates, and will keep playing the game, because it hasn't lost it's replayability yet.\n\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\nNot many from what I've seen.\n\nIf they had to improve on one thing, it'd have to be the controller navigation on the ending screen showing all the end scores and rating of the level.\n\nMaybe being able to include your steam music library and playlists, as I'd love not to create another folder for every album I download or buy, just to sort through all the music I have, which is over 2700 songs. \n\nIt'd be nice to have a browser for desktop music, as the navigation to your music is dependent on left and right movements of the dpad or the arrow keys, having to find the right song is a tedious process, having to copy paste in the text from the Windows explorer top text bar, EX: C:\\Users\\*username*\\Desktop\\Distance\nMusic.", "timestamp_created": 1450936391, "timestamp_updated": 1450936672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19897999": {"recommendationid": "19897999", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969702691", "num_games_owned": 558, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481921087}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

The music is amazing, visuals are extremely good, the game is extremely smooth, as are the controls. There are multiple Game-modes, a level editor and Steam Workshop support, meaning you won't ever run out of levels to play.\n\nThe games story and challenge levels are also extremely well designed, with shortcuts, unique levels and a story (which though isn't complete yet is still awesome). If you're like me and enjoy trying to get the best time and rank on each mode, then you will enjoy it. Distance is one of few games that i genuinely enjoy speedrunning levels on.\n\nThe game states that it is in early access, so there are some bugs, and the story isn't quite finished. I personally, haven't encountered any bugs, and there are enough levels on the workshop for me not to care so much about the unfinished story. If anything, i look forward to playing new story levels. I can quite happily say that this is the best early access game i have ever purchased.", "timestamp_created": 1449601332, "timestamp_updated": 1449601332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19562533": {"recommendationid": "19562533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115788941", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451354406}, "language": "english", "review": "I would not recommend this game YET.

If you enjoy arcady racing games with friends with style and substance, then you might want to pick this game up now. \n\nOr wait until there is more to come.\n\n[h1]Is There Enough To Go Around?[/h1]\n\nA common complaint about Distance is the minimal amount of creator made content. \n\nThere is a servicable \"story mode\" that is a good tutorial to wrap your head around the game's basic mechanics, but it's only halfway done. It also doesn't utilize all the game modes in it, so it's not a tutorial for everything. And if you don't screw up too much, you might get an hour and a half of substance.\n\nBut then you have to take into consideration the wide variety of user-created Steam Workshop maps right now. Currently there are over a thousand user-made content. Most of these maps are probably meant for solo so-hard-yet-so-fun players, not so much for multiplayer players. (Or it feels like it from what the devs showcase on their updates.)\n\nThe best way to think about Distance is to think about it as a game similar to Audiosurf. You can plug in your own tunes into the game, you can get tons of hours of enjoyment out of the game itself, and the amount of content is more to what is to your tastes.\n\nThankfully, you won't have to rely on crap-shooting for good user-made content. You can type in a custom search engine in-game to find the types of tracks you are looking for, whether it be thematic things like LIMBO or TRON or Super Meat Boy levels of challenge.\n\nI've only played a single game of multiplayer with one friend, so I cannot say anything about the merits of tis multiplayer longevity. We had fun doing challenge tracks meant for one player while racing one another. (We intentionally crashed into one another a lot.)\n\nOh, and best of all, the game's multiplayer can be online or split-screen. Leave it to an indie game from EA to bring back the couch.\n\nThe point of this section is to state that however much content is left to add into the game, which I sometimes wonder what is left to do other than better optomize the game itself, you will find as much content as you're willing to put into the game. \n\n[h1]You Sold Me On the Car[/h1]\n\nI'm not going to lie. When I saw what the car can do--fly, do barrel rolls for boosting, and for doing precise jump manuevers with antigravity tracks in Tron--I wanted to get into this game immediately. The inner child who played with Hot Wheels and who wanted to go drive around in Tron came out with this game, and I have no regrets for it.\n\nHowever, because of the complexity of the controls, I don't think everyone will find them comfortable on the keyboard. Doing the necessary tricks to hop off one track and continue on another requires a lot of quick-reactions. Sometimes the maps themselves will limit your abilities, so you need to be comfortable with your controls.\n\nIt's a little difficult to explain, but the gist of the controls is you steer with one thumbstick and rotate the car with the other. You have a button to boost, another button to jump, and another button to engage flight-form.\n\nThe game utilizes all of these in complex manuevers. Sometimes you'll need to do a ninty degree flip to swtich lanes, or you need to maintain your boost by doing tricks to maintain your energy. Or maybe you need to engage flight-mode to get back on to the track when you fall off. It feels all natural to use when you get a feel for the controls.\n\nYour car is also able to be split apart by lazers, buzzsaws, etc. It's a really interesting visual effect to cut your car in half--but you won't immediately lose if your car gets damaged. If you can sustain the car to the next checkpoint, your car will get auto-repaired. However, based on what gets hacked off, your ability to control the car is also changed.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, but with all the different modes takes those mechanics into different manners of playing the game. You have a HORSE style mode, a time-trial mode, a Tony Hawk tricks mode, and a no-checkpoint-shorter-levels mode.\n\nThere is no weaponry or other arcady elements from other racing games if you were hoping for something like Sonic All-Star Racing/Mario Kart/Diddy Kong Racing in Tron. Nor are there AI opponents to race against like with those games. Distance isn't that kind of game.\n\nAt its core, Distance is a racing game with more flash and style. But with a really, really sick car.\n\n[h1]Are There Other Dents?[/h1]\n\nThe game can run very shoddy at times because of all the visuals thrown into the game, so if you want the best experience you should close other applications for the best performance. \n\nOther than the optomization issue and the questionable amount of content, I don't know how else to criticize the game. The controls feel responsive enough; the gameplay offers more than racing itself; and the game itself is really, really good.\n\nYou'll have to ask yourself if that is enough to sell you on the game. If not the car, then check out the soundtrack too.\n\n[h1]Rating of Completion/Competence[/h1]\n\nHere is a detailed list of my scale: \n\n1 : A bug-filled mess with zero content or missing many features. Far too early to get into the games. Also, games that get updates infrequently. \n\n2: A game with the beginnings of ideas, yet too soon to invest any time. Check back for updates to see if things improve. (Also, games that play well but do not have all the basic features, such as promised multiplayer modes.)\n\n3: A game that is in a playable state, yet may not have all its technical issues sorted out. Features are all available--all game modes--while they may not be finalized. Games in this section are cautious recommendations to buy, so you should check the updates.\n\n4: A game that is in a playable state, technically competent, and has enough content to be worthy of purchasing right now. Features are all accounted for and the updates for the game are frequent enough to not discourage cautious buyers. Of course, the timing of these updates should be with respect to the size of the development team. \n\n5: A game that could be considered finished. It is in the final stages of development with balancing and other last minute changes to be resolved to be fit for release.\n\nThe simple raiting is a brief summary to describe the state of this game. The detailed rating goes into the nuances of what is available in Distance.\n\n[h1]Simple Rating: 3/5[/h1]\n\n[h1]Detailed Rating: 11/20 (55%). A cautious recommendation only for the gameplay.[/h1]\n\n[b]Content: 3/5[/b]\n\nMultiplayer, all game modes, the second type of car (which gives a double-jump at the cost of no flight mode) and the Steam Workshop level editor are in the game. However, what remains besides the story mode is vague. \n\n[b]Quality: 4/5[/b]\n\nThe core gameplay is refined enough that I would consider it in a complete state. The only thing that may hamper it are the optimization problems.\n\n[b]Optimization: 2/5[/b]\n\nIf you wish to get the best mileage with Distance, then you don't want other programs to be in the background.\n\n[b]Productivity: 2/5[/b]\n\nWhile I appreciate the community involvement from the developers making fan-made contests and showcasing their creations, I would appreciate more if they added their own content more frequently.

It was decently challenging, has great visuals, a fun concept, excellent physics, an awesome soundtrack, and even online multiplayer for just being an early access game.\n\nHonestly, my only complaints about this game is that the car does not feel heavy enough. I do not know if this was the intent of the developers, but you are able to turn on a dime at high speeds and it feels more like the world is rotating under you rather than you actually turning the car. To go along with this, I would have wished that drifting the car was added into the game, as it would make taking corners at high speeds all the more fun, especially since it could be incorporated into the trick system. Another problem I had was that segments that required you to continually boost, jump, and rotate the car at the same time were difficult because all three of those functions use the right side of the controller and I had a hard time rotating the car once I got it in the air because I had to keep my thumb on the boost button instead of the right thumb stick. I know that this is easily fixed by the fact that other buttons on the controller perform the same functions, like left bumper on an xbox 360 controller activating the boost, but since in the tutorial, it was stated that the A button is used to hold a boost, you could probably see how this would become difficult if others did not know that multiple buttons did the same thing.\n\nAll in all, the car should behave more like a car, and the tutorial needs to state that other buttons perform the same functions as others, but it was a fun experience playing this game and I hope to see what becomes of it further down the road.", "timestamp_created": 1449048037, "timestamp_updated": 1449048037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19432298": {"recommendationid": "19432298", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998210536", "num_games_owned": 468, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480933167}, "language": "english", "review": "Just buy it already.", "timestamp_created": 1449043074, "timestamp_updated": 1449043074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19426926": {"recommendationid": "19426926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159076611", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492642011}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Estoy impresionado con \u00e9ste juego en todos los aspectos.

It has some superb, abstract track design reminiscent of any of the TrackMania titles, but adds in the insane speed of a Need for Speed or Burnout game combined with obstacles taken right out of a kart racer. It could also be safe to say it's the Tron: Legacy we never properly got and then some, cuz it's got the bells and whistles but is a much more enjoyable and entertaining experience. That's also a major disservice to this incredible beta to an incredible game.\n\nThe Early Access version of Distance offers quite a lot for a small package, including the makings of an adventure mode that add in a Journey-esque dash of story... if Journey had lots of giant sawblades, lasers, and death-defying jumps in a cyberpunk setting, on top of a traditional Arcade mode that games seem to have lost touch with in recent years. And of course, there's the aforementioned multiplayer which throws in your traditional races as well as a briefly novel tag mode and a stunt mode that takes another queue from Burnout minus the exploding cars. Buy and large, the main reason to play the game is for the \"Survival\" or \"Speed and Style\" modes, where it's testing your reflexes and split-second maneuvering around traps and finding clever (and stylish) ways to beat a track in the quickest time possible. Mastering these stages is a delight and even just killing five minutes to feed a need for speed while jamming to some intense electronica that makes you feel like a badass when you nail those impossible jumps is an insatiable feeling that makes me always want to come back for more.\n\nIt's just a shame the current version doesn't have a lot to offer when looking at the official offerings, but the game's taken a life of its' own with the community created maps. It's just a small shame that one of the problems the game suffers, and what goes into common community level design, is the confusion of good map design with unfair memorization challenges. It's these types of maps that make for way too many unofficial tracks that feel overbearing, sloppy, and infuriating when compared to the more official offerings that have good ebbs, flows, and difficulty curves in each track that were both challenging but also more than possible. However, that's not to say that there haven't been rising stars in the community mappers as there have certainly been tracks that rival even Refract's stages, which make slogging through the sloppy maps worth it when you come across that solid, tightly-designed gem. But as it stands though, the map-making scene isn't as vibrant as, say, most of Valve's games or Unreal Tournament, so the Workshop might feel barren, at least until the game picks up in popularity and creative level designers.\n\nThat said, this game, frankly, deserves a lot more of that popularity, because it's just an absolutely fun game to play, with the bonus of being a great looker with a damn fine soundtrack. Refract might be one of the new Indie kids on the block, but they are certainly no amateurs at making a great racing game. \n\nDistance is worth your time, your money, and your commitment to beating your own and your friend's high scores. In this day and age of more realistic, simulated racing games, it's time we had a game like this to come along and remind us we're playing video games for the overwhelming, exciting, and expansive possibilities of the medium and not needing to be bound by realistic settings, physics, and speeds.\n\nSo, can you survive the distance?

Even though the Adventure mode is really short, I can guarantee that you will have endless play time.

I also will say that I can't stand the keyboard controls for the game, but that's just me. Try it yourself.\n\nThe racing gameplay is fast and fairly easy to pick up. Running through the tutorials once should teach you everything you need to know. I do wish there were better, crunchier sound effects for vehicles hitting things (especially on landing a jump), but that's just me being a bit nitpicky.\n\nThis game's main issue (in my opinion, of course) is its level editor.\n\nOoh boy. That UI. It's an absolute clusterfrak of buttons, poorly organized pieces and annoying camera control. Stretching, squashing, scaling and rotating pieces feels finicky at the best of times. Not to mention it has the major problem of making it extremely difficult to tell where anything is in relation to anything else.\n\nNo, I do not think it's acceptable for a game that banks so heavily on user-created content to have such an annoying toolset to use. It's not like a lot of this couldn't be fixed, either - just organizing the pieces in something that vaguely resembles a logical manner would be a great start. Why is the *End* piece near the top of the selection, and why is the *Start* piece buried much further down? Why aren't they right up front? This is just one example of what I mean - there's plenty more where that came from.\n\nThe icons also often don't do the best job conveying what piece you're actually clicking on, and the text is all strung together into one blurb - stupid shit like this should not be this way. At all.\n\nAnd before you say \"There are guides available,\" I will say that a game that banks as heavily on its toolset as Distance does should have a UI that's intuitive enough for a person who's never touched or looked at the game before to be putting levels together within a couple of minutes.\n\nTry to imagine, for instance, if something like Planet Coaster or Trackmania had a track editor that, rather than being user-friendly to the point a person who's never played a video game could get a handle on how it worked, was instead a headache-inducing mess. Those games would be awful just because of that - so why does Distance's level editor have this problem?\n\nWhat the hell does this game gain by its level editor being as confusing and frustrating to use as it is? Nothing, that's what.\n\nOverall, I would buy this game to race. The level editor is utterly unintuitive and I find it's a headache to do the simplest tasks with it.\n\nBut the actual racing, flying, jumping and whatnot feel fantastic - though I prefer a controller for it.

It's a reaction that I think a lot of players will have at first. But after getting used to the controls, and discovering the random level generator and edited tracks which extend gameplay considerably, I quickly went from disappoint to gleefullly enjoying this game. \n\nIn fact, I think I have played this game in VR for longer play sessions than what I usually tolerate with a headset on, including relative to stuff like Elite Dangerous. I could probably play this for an hour or two even with a headset on, if I had the time, as it's easy to lose track of time playing random tracks and seeing what other crazy tricks the game can throw at you. For my part, I did not experiene nausea or stomach churning in VR, and the game does not induce my fear of heights as much as a game like Radial G can.  \n\nThis isn't to say that the VR implementation is better than in standard establishing games like Elite, cause it's not. In fact, the VR adds less to this game than some others like Elite or Radial G, which feel more like VR can be an integral part of the game, rather than an add-on. But if the VR feels like a nice but not revolutionary addition to this game, it's well implemented enough to at least add to the immersion, and may even make the game a little more playable as you can look up to see oncoming parts of the tricky tracks more easily. Just don't expect the same level of presence that some purpose-built for VR games have. \n\nThis is not like other futuristic VR racing games with some obstacles and the occasional surprise, like the excellent Radial G. It's also not like traditional racers such as the also excellent Project Cars. At least for now, there don't seem to be computer controlled opponents, which is a bit of a disappointment. But what keeps the game interesting is that the game's tracks are, essentially, trying to kill you. \n\nWhile you generally have a chance to respond to things as they occur enough so that absolute track memorization is not necessary, things do start to feel a bit like a puzzle game all the same as you learn to navigate using a mix of odd car abilities from jumping to even flying. Yeah, flying. This game forces you to try all kinds of crazy stunts in order to survive each track's tricky obstacles, including lasers, saw blades, moving walls, and the need to wall climb or fly to reach other levels. At first, this can be frustrating. But it can soon become quite engaging as it all starts to make a weird sort of sense. A gamepad is recommended. \n\nAnd the tracks really are trying to get you. In one random level I generated, a bot-like moving wall hovered above me, following my car until it could pounce down in front of me at just the right moment to score a kill. That's one tricky obstacle! You quickly learn not to take anything for granted while playing this game, as it's more of a survival challenge rather than a conventional racing game. Not all jumps are good to take, turns that look sensible can get you killed, and there are tracks where, instead of only being able to turn left or right at a fork in the road, you also have the option to take a jump right down the middle. Which path is right for you? You can play repeatedly to find out! Come for the pretty colors and Tron-like graphics, and stay for the addictive gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1445158399, "timestamp_updated": 1445158399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18542900": {"recommendationid": "18542900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090546041", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514249844}, "language": "english", "review": "\"You can take the car out of the neon, but you can never take the neon out of the car.\"\n\nPros:\n-Near-Endless boosting\n-Neon\n-Flying/jumping over the map when you get pissed off\n-Neon\n-Keeps you on your toes every step of the way, no matter what course you're on.\n-#%&*$ing amazing soundtrack.\n-Don't like the soundtrack after all?

This is the game for you.  And you have wings.  FLIPPING WINGS!  Don't be fooled by the Early Access tag, the game is completely playable and ran very smoothly on my old GTX 750 Ti at max settings 1080p, looking beautiful.  Crank down the settings a bit and you could run this on integrated graphics, probably (don't qoute me on that).  My R9 390 has no problems whatsoever.  I still can't get over how cool this game is...  The only gripe is the length of the campaign, but there's a keyword-based random level generator and a level creator with Steam Workshop support, and multiplayer, so the content is infinite, anyway.  The campaign is still a work in progress, I gather.  THIS is what the early access model should be used for.

The general goal is to reach the finish, go fast and avoid various hazards on your way. Your space car comes equipped with a nitro boost that refills when landing stunts or driving through checkpoints, a set of wings that also use your boost meter to fly and a killer suspension system that makes sharp turns and airborne maneuvering easy.

However, thanks to the level editor and Steam Workshop, you currently have 885 custom made levels at your disposal... plenty of gameplay. So far I've tried several of the higher rated ones and they were all great.\n\nThere's also a neat Transmogrify game mode that creates a random map based on what you write. Try \"super long never ending ride\". Spoiler alert: it ends and it's not even that long but it's got a great, sinister atmosphere about it. Everything fits.\n\nThe kicking soundtrack fits the game perfectly. There's also an option to import and listen to your own music while you play. There are a lot of options.\n\nThat said, I have a few minor complaints. I think the beatbox sound mode would be better if there was no screen shake and just a bigger emphasis on the blinking lights. I also miss the over the top announcer from Distance's predecessor - Nitronic Rush. I understand that the game is a bit more serious, lonesome and mysterious this time around.

I think my favorite parts are the TrackMogrify and the custom map creation pieces. The other sections are really entertaining too, the Adventure mode has a story if you understand it, and the Arcade has many things you can do from Sprint racing, to Style races. What again makes this better is the fact that you can play on multiplayer servers.

(Even though I call it an alpha, it was well enough to be one of my favorite games) \nLet's begin (TL;DR version at end)\n\nGraphics: \n-In general: The graphics are very nice. And the options on the graphics are very nice as well, letting you customize them to a good extent which should make this playable on most machines.  \n-In game: The levels have very contrasting colors and a good variety of them in levels making it fun to see what's next.  The timer, speed, and boost gauge are on the vehicle, which works even though it might seem like it wouldn't.  I have not tried out the custom music option yet, which is supposed to change the graphics even more in time with your music (which actually sounds really cool).\n\nPerformance:\n-For some reason and I don't know why, this game seems a little slow to me. I have put my graphics to a good spot, but it still seems just a bit slow. I am comparing to nitro in this case, and I'm not sure if it's because of a new engine or some other factor, might even just be me, but it does seem like it runs slightly slow with the graphics settings on par with nitro.\n( I have been informed that the future builds are going to be more stable, and that the slowness is due to added physics and sensitivity changes)\n\nThe Gameplay:\n-This is a survival racer, not a standard racer. Most levels have you going through a level past numerous obstacles, lasers, and more to get to the goal. Compared to nitro rush I have to say that Distance really upped the gameplay. Lasers don't kill you now, instead they slice apart your car into a bunch of tiny pieces which is actually really fun to mess with. The flying is utilized a LOT more, in much more entertaining ways. Certain areas disable the wings so you can't cheat through them which utilizes more skill. Enemies do actually change depending on how you move (one actually stopped me for a whole minute because it kept tracking me). There was even a spot with zero gravity and I can't emphasize how much I actually enjoyed this area. It's something unique and I haven't seen something like that in a racing game before. I'd really like much more of that area in the game. The levels at times are confusing, and I got lost at at least one point.  All in all, just from playing the adventure mode, I can say that this is quite the improvement to Nitro.\n-The only thing I'd actually suggest for an improvement is having more wall riding and ceiling riding areas similar to hardcore mode from nitro. Those are a lot of fun to drive with\n\nControls:\n-Controls are pretty good, not as sensitive as I'd like standard, but overall good. I have learned you can customize the controls and fix them to however you like. (I would not overly reccomend customizing the controls, but it's more of a personal choice.)\n\nLevel Editor:\n-This thing... this thing is... amazing. I haven't seen a more customizable level editor. It looks very much like a full 3D modeling program. I thought you could add custom models, but apparently the maps so far have been using the in-game items which is very nice. Here's an idea, someone make a drivable map on a heavy from TF2. Overall it is a little intimidating to newcomers, but it should be fun to use and it is very cool.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed playing this game so far and it's not even fully released yet. Once it's fully released, the bugs should be fixed (there aren't that many bugs to begin with) and there should be some new features to play around with.\n\nI have learned there is a car color customizer in the options. \n\nI do highly reccomend this game, and it's not even fully released yet. I look forward to the full release of this game.\n\nThanks to Californ1a for giving me some info to make the review better and clarifying some things I mispoke on.\n\nTL;DR: Flippy car game with lasers, booms, flying and more. 10/10 would race", "timestamp_created": 1441059601, "timestamp_updated": 1441387655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17819528": {"recommendationid": "17819528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062289342", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504165681}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games I have ever played.

If you like that you will like this. \n\nDistance is a Tron-esqe racing game where you speed along floating roads and fly through obstacles at very high speeds.\n\nGameplay-10/10\nThe gameplay in Distance is absolutely flawless. The controls feel fluid and are very responsive, and I know that I am in control of my car at all times. The gameplay consists of driving along roads at high speeds while dodging obstacles like buzzsaws, lasers, walls, spinning cylinders of death spikes, and so on. While you usually just drive along roads, you also can fly. Everything about the driving and flying is great. There is also a boost system that reminds me of Excite Truck, which was my favorite racing game until I got Distance. Also, if you get cut by lasers, you can still drive with half of your car. That's probably my favorite thing in Distance.\n\nStory-N/A\nThe adventure mode isn't finished yet, so I can't really review it right now.\n\nMultiplayer-10/10\nI haven't encountered any lag in multiplayer yet. You have to get to the finish as fast as possible, trying to beat the other players. However, the other players appear as ghosts and cannot effect your vehicle, making the race into more of a synonomous time trial. \n\nGraphics-10/10\nThe graphics remind me of Nitronic Rush, but have a glossy new feel that fits with the atmosphere very well. \n\nOverall-10/10\nFor what it is, Distance is a fantastic game.

Nitronic Rush can be downloaded for free at http://nitronic-rush.com/.  If you are at all interested in Distance, play Nitronic Rush first, as they are very similar.\n\nIn Distance, you control a kickass sci fi car with thrusters, wings and a giant rocket booster.  You race through digital, TRON Legacy styled cities filled with lasers, buzzsaws and angry computer viruses.  While the new art style is very pretty, some clarity is lost behind all the bloom and neon lines.  In Nitronic Rush, obstacles and hazards were always a very bright red, while in Distance they can and often will be a similar color to the rest of the track, making it somewhat harder to see them at a Distance (heh). In addition, the world seems more lifeless compared to the 70's TRON world of Nitronic Rush.  While this seems to be a deliberate choice on Refract's part, given that Story Mode seems to focus on an abandoned world, this doesn't change the fact that the levels are rather sterile and samey.  With the exception of one song, most of the soundtrack, while great, is also very similar which is an odd change after Rush's varied beats.    \n\nWhile the game is still in beta, it does have a slight lack of content when compared to Rush.  There are more Story levels, but fewer Challenge levels, and no Hardcore levels.  The overall level design is a bit more tame and safe than Rush's was.  There is both a track editor and a random track generator to make up for this, however, and many of the community tracks are incredible (and a good deal tougher than the rather easy official levels).\n\nThere are a few other game modes besides the races.  Stunt has you doing mad tricks in an arena to score big points, Speed and Style is a mix of Stunt and Sprint, Reverse Tag is a game of keep away/king of the hill, and Soccer is, well, soccer.  Stunt is rather boring due to the lack of an announcer, another feature missing from Nitronic Rush.  In addition, several stunts possible in Rush are missing in DIstance.  Speed and Style is good fun, as you have to win the race AND pull of tricks to win.  Reverse Tag is a fun game of wits, though the official arenas are all either too big or too small.  I recommend the community level \"Pipe Plaza\" for this mode.  Soccer is a mess, the ball is nearly impossible to control and  the levels are a cluttered nightmare.  It might be good for some couch laughs with 4 players (Distance features Split Screen for all modes) but should be avoided in smaller groups.\n\nNow, despite these complaints, I still highly recommend this game.  It's the most fun I've had with a racing game in quite some time, and is beautifully creative.  Even if you don't like traditional racing games, give Distance (or Nitronic Rush) a shot.  They're very different from the competetion.\n\nTo finish this review up, I'll make a list of little things that you probably don't care about\n\n-Default control scheme on controllers is flawed, thange LB to boost like it was in Rush\n-Bring back the announcer\n-Bring back wheelies and side wheelies\n-While you're at it, just port all of Nitronic Rush's levels into Distance", "timestamp_created": 1437885909, "timestamp_updated": 1437885909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536007", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17220456": {"recommendationid": "17220456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076178538", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462301722}, "language": "italian", "review": "Wipeout on steroids!!

All in all I'm excited to see the final product.\n\nMy only major complaint is the controls, or rather the way the game introduces you to them.

What the game doesn't tell you is that you can also use the shoulder buttons for boost and jump freeing your right thumb to do the tricky bits.

There's also procedural tracks which I haven't tried out yet, seeing as currently there are over 700 community made tracks in the steam workshop - there's definitely no shortage of quality content. Add to it the ability to play your own music that the tracks' lighting and certain elements will sync to, and you've got an overwhelmingly positive game here.\n\nMy only complaints are the difficulty of adding your own music, you have to manually type in the path of the folder you want to play, and being that I use itunes for my ipod - some of my music are m4a files which are not supported by the game. It would be much nicer if there were a simple folder browser and some other formats were supported but it's not a huge deal. Could always make a separate folder just for this game and convert my files with dbpoweramp to mp3.\n\nI've never really been too much into techno but the music in the game is pretty good atmospheric semi-psychadelic.

I suffer pretty severly from panic attacks (often leading to mild seizures) from time to time, mostly at night after dreaming about situations more fucked up than Im willing to describe.  I wake up sweating, my chest in a vice, diaphram contorted demonically, mind racing, heart about to explode...  I stumble out of bed, into my chair and manage to flick on my audio interface, boot up my computer and log in to steam.   Distance only takes a few moments to start and the music is soothing.  I always start with the first track, I forget the name... Broken Symmetry?  Regardless, the slow build up of piano, filter-modulated white/pink noise and easy curves wittle away at my stress.  Upon finding a sense of calm, meditative trance begins to set in.  The beat kicks up and I find myself no longer panicking, but positively charged, ready for challenge. My adrenaline flips polarity to positive and I am back to being ME.  No worries, no stress, no job, no lonliness.  Just pretty lights and sounds, a simple goal, and a sense of peace.  \n\nI have not tried any workshop tracks, but I would love to see something in the form of straightaway tracks like the first few, with little challenge and more empahsis on cinematic thrill.\n\nInitial Review-------\n\nPlaying this game is what I imagine driving a Tesla might feel like.\n\nSexiest sight/sound match in a racing game since Extreme G\n\nAdventure needs to be more.. erm, adventerous... I loved the build up intro but it was the same as arcade otherwise.  Maybe there could be some enemy responsible for the obstacles, cliche but it would be cool to have some depth. I would also love to see some sort of upgrade system or at least some aesthetic customization, it would make 20 dollars seem acceptable.

I played those games a lot over the course of a few years. Those games, however, made me create a standard for all racing games. If I felt a certain racing game did not meet that standard, I wouldn't buy it. In fact, In the past 7 years, I have only bought and played 2 other racing games besides Burnout. One of those, I didn't like, the other one is decent. \n\nWhen I saw this game, I was intriqued. It looked unique, but I still went by my standard. I decided that 10 dollars (on sale) was a fair price and purchased it. When I started playing, I realized this game did not meet any of the standards I had set. That was because this game was truly [i]unique.[/i] It's nothing I have experienced before. I've only played this game for a few hours so far, and haven't even scratched the surface of what you can do in this game.\n\nThe graphics in this game are stunning and it is well optimized as well. I can run everything on ultra and get 50+ fps. Even though it says Early Access, I have not encountered any bugs. It's labeled Early Access mostly because they have more content to add. If you enjoy using a controller like myself, they have good controller support as well. It has a level editor, allowing you to make custom levels and then share them on the Steam Workshop. It has nearly unlimited levels, just type in a phrase, and it will generate a random level. It has multiplayer, allowing you to play with others on any map you want. It also has a singleplayer and split-screen mode. And to top it all off, it's only 20 bucks (not on sale), which makes it even better.\n\nTo be honest, I can't really think of any bad things to say about this game. If I encounter anything, I will update this review.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is a unique racing experience unlike anything I've played before. There are so many good things about this game, and the developers are continuing to add more content.

This game is absolutely gorgeous! I had to buy it the moment i played it in my friends PC. The visual, the gameplay, even the credits is a masterpiece! If i had to choose the top 3 racing games i've played this decade, i'm sure Distance would have made it second or even first position.\nEnough with the compliments, let's talk more about the game.\nDistance is a futuristic racing game like nothing else. You are in control of a car that can boost, jump and fly (yeah, it's a transform). The game has a storyline that feels a bit artistic. It has no narrative, just you, the stages and the musics (that i have to say, it fits just perfect with the game). Since it is still Early Access, it isn't complete yet, but i can already see it developing really good!\nThe arcade mode seems to be really good, even better when played with a friend or in online mode. And now with custom tracks made by the community, i can't even describe how big is the potential of this game.\nBUT, it has it cons (for now, it might change in the future). In current stages, there is no bots in arcade mode. I feel like this is needed in every racing game, mainly in this game! I want to play the arcade mode when my friends aren't avaliable and online mode isn't quiet what i'm looking for everytime.\nThe storyline NEEDS a narrative. Sometimes you feel a little lonely when traveling through the stages and the music is low. The storyline of this game shows potential and a narrative like the one in Portal games would fit just perfectly.\nIf i would recommend this game to everyone in this planet? OF COURSE! This game needs more attention! I would easily pay 60 bucks for this game when it gets out of early access. It really looks like a AAA game.\n\nPlus, spin my car in the air and land it like a boss IS SO DAMN COOL! 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1434514029, "timestamp_updated": 1434514029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520548", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16461157": {"recommendationid": "16461157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018509293", "num_games_owned": 1081, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435208323}, "language": "english", "review": "Makes Tec 3001 look like molasses, and I really like Tec 3001", "timestamp_created": 1434510632, "timestamp_updated": 1434510632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16460705": {"recommendationid": "16460705", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998679969", "num_games_owned": 618, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488715311}, "language": "english", "review": "tron if tron had cars", "timestamp_created": 1434508784, "timestamp_updated": 1434508784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16459324": {"recommendationid": "16459324", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994291818", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434503133}, "language": "english", "review": "This.

Even if your taste is not in racing games, it is a good pass time if you're overwhelmed from playing that Multiplayer game you typically play when you wake up in the morning. God knows when I am annoyed after playing Rust or Counter Strike: Global Offensive that it's these games I like to turn to. Overall, Distance has very many wonderful mechanisms to it. Gravity being a very affected party of this game; you need to understand how the physics of this game works if you want to play it properly. Once you get the hang of everything, however, you start to receive a lot of enjoyment out of playing the maps that are preset in the game, and even custom ones made by the community. Not only does Distance have wonderful mechanics to it, but it also has a nice developmental structure to it, and what I mean by that is it includes its own level editor, and you can make maps, such as a Rainbow Road and a Mario Kart map I've already took the liberty of playing on. I can say that this game is very enjoyable as a \"I have spare time and I'm not doing too much,\" type of game. Almost like listening to music or watching Netflix while you're idling in your game server trying to get rid of that TF2 item you don't like.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game is the Multiplayer. You have to set up your own server and typically invite people to your game, because there are not a lot of random public servers to play on. They are all typically private for friends or a group of people. If they had a matchmaking feature like Left 4 Dead 2 does, then that would make Multiplayer a bit more appealing in my eyes.\n\nOverall, I do enjoy this game, and hope that it's carried out in development further than what it is now.\nWonderful potential here, just don't end up like a lot of other Early Access games that are, very unfortunately, \"In early access\" for two and a half years and never actually goes anywhere often.

I've been playing arcade racers since the dawn of time, and this game is an utter joke compared to anything from its predecessor, Nitronic Rush, to F-Zero. Tracks offer low complexity obstacles, no need for boost management, and long stretches of road that give you nice eye candy but a severe reduction in challenge overall. If you've never played an arcade racing game before, or if you self identify as a casual gamer with a love for being held by the hand in your games, I would recommend this game to you. Otherwise, look elsewhere.\n\nJust because a game is in Early Access doesn't mean it should follow such a dull design philosophy, as is the case with Distance. The game's track design is completely devoid of challenge, and if you're lucky you [i]might[/i] find one decent track in a half-hour of scrounging through the Steam Workshop.\n\nWorst of all is the \"Trackmogrify\" feature. Even though the game's pre-constructed track design is already insultingly dull and unchallenging, the developers have added a track creator that spawns fresh tracks that are just as dreadful as, if not worse than, what's already built into the game. Just like the first time you are called a \"donkeyball hosedick\" or \"bullcock hobgoblin\", you will laugh a bit at how poorly you've been insulted but also feel a little stung at the same time.\n\ntl;dr If you really need to spend $20 and don't know what to do with it, do something more productive like flush it down the toilet", "timestamp_created": 1434485793, "timestamp_updated": 1434485793, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.385667", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16451878": {"recommendationid": "16451878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045809289", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 29833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514060808}, "language": "english", "review": "Call me a dork, but I would never buy this game on sale. It is worth every penny the developers have put on it's price tag, and here's a lazy amateur breakdown of why:\n\n[b]\u2022 It looks amazing.[/b] The game really is very atmospheric, with great sense of speed, and every level feels unique. It's arcade with personality, and pretty great graphics. Honestly, I don't need to say much when there's beautiful screenshots up there.\n\n[b]\u2022 It sounds amazing.[/b] As with Nitronic Rush, the music is one of the greatest things about this game. Even if you don't like the genre as much, you'll find it fitting and very well crafted. Not to mention it interacts with the level, making lights blink to the beat and things like that.\n\n[b]\u2022 It plays amazing.[/b] When we talk about controls in this game, it's important to note that you actually feel you're in control. Which is very important, considering this is survival racing. You often need to act fast, and everything is as responsive as you'd expect. Oh, and the delirious stunts you can pull make you feel awesome. And when you successfully recover from a mistake instead of resetting? That's the stuff.\n\n[b]\u2022 The developers are extremely passionate[/b], and very good at what they do. That combo means a handful of things: They are very thorough, listen to the community feedback with great care, and in fact get really involved with the player base. A chance to play with one (or more!) of the devs online is barely difficult.\n\n[b]\u2022 It's got a powerful level editor.[/b] And people make the most amazing things with it. It's got primitives, which means you can basically create anything you think of, if you have the time. As a matter of fact, most of my play time was spent in the editor. Creating is fun, and sharing is easy.\n\n[b]\u2022 Failing is often surprisingly fun to watch.[/b] Being suddenly flung out of the track, spinning ferociously, crashing into a nearby building, and exploding into many pieces, all in a matter of seconds... It can be a good laugh. Why be frustrated? It looks great even when you suck.\n\nThis is one early access game you can trust.

In a nutshell: You're a car, and shit got fucked up somehow, so you have to unfuck it by driving really fast. And that's about it because early access.\n\nGameplay wise, it's solid. You have two sticks, two triggers, and two buttons. Fairly simple, but then you learn you can drive on walls by jumping onto them, and it's really rather good. You can also fly, and that opens up a whole world of opportunity for track skips.\n\nGraphically it's pretty good as well, so yeah.\n\nThe soundtrack is exactly what you'd expect from this sort of game: Lots of EDM and dubstep. And surprisingly, it works. However, if that's not your thing, then you can play your own music so that's good too.\n\nBut what's really, really, super good about this game, is that the developers put in a random track function, which generates fairly short tracks to race around based on a seed you put in. This essentially turns the game into the video game equivalent of potato chips: You start with just one, and then you do another, and then next thing you know it's two hours down the line and you've eaten the whole bag.\n\nAnd the workshop's pretty good too I guess.\n\nOverall 9/10.

Einfach der Strecke nach, die sich ein wenig durch den Raum windet und dann auch allm\u00e4hlich mal \u00fcberkopf steht. Dann kommen noch Br\u00fcche, Spr\u00fcnge, Flugeinlagen und t\u00f6dliche Kreiss\u00e4gen und Laser, und das alles bei rasender Geschwindigkeit.\nTrotzdem werden einige Stellen auf den Strecken frustrierend, da die Fehlerspielr\u00e4ume zunehmend kleiner werden.\n8/10\n\nAtmosph\u00e4re:\nDie ist bei diesem Spiel ein Gesamtkunstwerk, allerdings muss man das Genre m\u00f6gen. Der Tron Grafikstil ist wie erwartet gekuppelt mit Electro Musik, wobei Beleuchtungen der Umgebung im Takt der Musik blinken. Wenn man Unf\u00e4lle baut oder in schwerelose R\u00e4ume ger\u00e4t, \u00e4ndert sich auch die Musik, wird ruhiger, und sobald man wieder zwischen Laser und Kreiss\u00e4gen ger\u00e4t, wummert der Bass wieder fr\u00f6hlich weiter.\nDie Grafik an sich ist sch\u00f6n detailliert, es fliegen munter Funken, das Auto wird durch Aufpr\u00e4lle deformiert und Laser zerschnitten. Ebenso der Sound passt super zum Stil, einzig der Nachbrenner verursacht auf Dauer Tinitus.\n9/10\n\nStory/Setting:\nDas Auto, das man durch die Story steuert, die nicht von Erz\u00e4hlung begleitet ist, ist nach einem langen Schlaf erwacht. Es hat eine St\u00f6rung in einem \u00fcberwachten Sektor gegeben und man macht sich auf, um dort nach dem Rechten zu sehen.\n\u00dcber mehrere Sektoren, wie hier die Strecken genannt werden, gelangt man in gut zwei Stunden zum Ende der momentanen Storyline.\n7/10\n\nBedienbarkeit:\nDas Tutorial ist in der Story inbegriffen, anfangs wird man noch sehr an die Hand genommen, jedoch wird man schon schnell mit Rotation, w\u00e4hrend man in der Luft ist, und dem Flugmodus konfrontiert. Es ist einfach zu lernen, aber schwer zu meistern.\nController werden unterst\u00fctzt, Lenkrad ist obwohl dies ein Rennspiel ist, nicht zu empfehlen.

The graphics were astonishing.there were a few intense and awesome maps and a creative Community so we could use  the workshop. I saw the latest update and started to play it again and saw all those changes. To ability to put in your own music, the boombox mode which turns your car and the world around you in a music synchronicing beatvisualizer, the option to customize the car a little bit , the little detail like the star screen on your car when you are staying at the same spot for a short time... i love all of these ! I realy love such details and i am very very happy that you can see that this game is still evolving, i swear, this is gonna be one hell of a game when it is finished.\nBut the best thing about this new update is the Trackmogrify mode. You just type in some random words, number , sentences , whatever you want and the game creates a racetrack. Type in stuff like \"rainbow road\" and fell free to have a nice journey on a colourful , rainbowcolored track... type in \"lightning storm\" to get yourself into an intense storm full of lightningstrikes. \nThis mode got rid of a big problem Distance had. After a while you had yourself through all levels and there wasnt much to do. This new mode gives you an incredible, endless amount of new tracks you can generate in less than a few seconds and can be quiet funny. Now Distance isnt just a good game anymore. It turned into a very good game, full of potential. If the designers behind this gem are still updating it in the future and bring even more content out this game will be on my top games of all time, it has so much potential and i can see that the creators have some neat ideas and i am excited for the future.\n\nGraphic: 10/10 , very beatiful and unique\n\nGameplay : 8.5/10 , unique and awesome gameplay, but i feel like there is potential for more and different modes, the new Trackmogrify mode is a good start!\n\nSound: 10/10 , nice futuristic sounds, clear and good quality \n\nMusic: 9/10 , very fitting, has a electronic style and sums up the level you are playing but not much variety of soundtracks BUT you can bring your own music into the game now which is absolutly awesome. The game even responds to your music in very different ways , like visualizers.\n\nVariety: 8/10 , thanks to the new gamemode , the workshop and some implemented level you have a nice variety of different tracks, but i have the feeling the game could use some more \"Items\" to put into the world. New traps or stuff like that ;)\n\nStory: 4/10 , the game has a short adventure mode but its more like a longer tutorial.

If you like games like f-zero, track mania and Wipeout then you will probably also like this one.\n\nDistance primarly focuses on survival through stunting up, over and under things as you make your way through countless of haphazard areas full of razors and spiked steamrollers. At a certain moment the track starts to rotate horizontally and you even get to drive upside down, straight up and every other angle you can imagine. After a certain while you don't even really know what up and down is anymore, was it not for the arrow on the back of your car that indicates which way down actually is. I do however find myself never really looking at the thing as most community made tracks are so fast and require your full attention. \n\nAfter a while you will be constantly propelling yourself forward with the turbo, jump and angle your car 45 degrees with the thrusters and as soon as you land things might start popping up left and right trying to slice your car in half. You jump on the straight orientated road again and go through a portal which then suddenly leaves you hanging in mid air. The upbeat music has stopped and been replaced for the muffled sounds of you trying to maneuver your car in zero-g. \n\nThere is also a story, which is something about you being inside of a computer-thingy which is infected by a virus. Which will become apparent in the storyline mode, but not so much right now.

That seriously needs to be fixed.  Even if the game is in beta form, most players might not stick around just for that reason.  I would add 2 points if that problem was fixed.\n\n2 Find something definitive to seperate Adventure from Arcade. I'd add one point if something that would make us actually want to play adventure, is patched in.  Some reason for why we are where we are and why our cars can do what they do would be nice.  In my opinion, to know more about my car would make me feel more investested in its usage. Every flip, or bounce, or sky manuever would give me higher levels of phychological investment, if I only knew, why these cars could do this.  Sure the game is still exciting.\n\nReasoning\n\nNot asking for anything extravagent, but even inputted dialouge to help explain these things seems nice, whatever is done, if anything is done, I'd trust Refract to execute it well. If explaining the car seems like a bit much maybe only give details to us in layers like in the loading screen, not just the car blueprint but the script for what it does in more detail and why it is there with arrows pointing to that specific part. I don't know what those things are marked \"A\" \"B\" and \"C\" for because nothing explains them. Everything else about this game looks and plays excellent.\n\nOther than those two things.  This game is awesome.  Keep up the good work, and I would'nt deduct anything from this, but if Refract could maybe dumb down track editing to like a Halo style map creation, or Trials Evolution.  That would be great as well.  I'm not to tech swavey when it comes to this game's level editing format.\n\n:::EDIT:::\n\nActual Gameplay\n\nI forgot to add this in but its about the actual gameplay.  It runs very smooth and with all the good reviews pointing out how great the car you control handles I considered whether my input on that matter was needed.  But I'll do it anyway.\n\nI've never played an arcade racer with a car that handles with such precision WITHOUT making you feel like the track controls the car.  This game makes me feel like I control my car at extreme high levels of speed on the tracks riddled with death traps.  There are portals that warp you to another location, or verticalitty.  It took me awhile to figure out I was racing upside down because everything looks right-side up.  And that is pretty cool.  As long as you have speed, you will never fall off the track if you arn't most likely defying the laws of physics.  If you do lose speed, better hope you can open you car doors and use them like gliders.  Not all tracks offer the feature, and on some tracks you can only open the doors at certain parts.  It is executed nicely. There is also a bounce menuever where you spring yourself off the surface to jump over a death trap or get yourself to a higher seperate plane. The tracks can split, or sometimes you can just flyoff completely and find a new path.  This game offers space.  And that is my favorite thing in any racer.  Great handling, and outrageously fun and spacious tracks.\n\n\n:: EDIT, AGAIN ::\n\nTLDR:  \n\nIn short now, I did give this games a thumbs up.  The port-forwarding lobby creating situation still isn't fixed at all, which should be the priority.  As I said above, this game wont last long while porting ourselves to make it work is just a nusaince most people wont bother with.  It's still fun to play even solo, but for new comers looking at online play, if you want a good arcade racing game and dont care about playing cool tracks alone, I'll say get it, for $5.  Other than that, I can't recommend.\n\nI say repeatedly the game is awesome, that's because it is a good arcade racer.  But I'm a multiplayer guy having me portforward a code for a game that is on it's online lifeline (probably because other people don't want to bother to port-forward as well) is just not worth it. The online on this game will be dead before it gets out of the beta stage.  I'm willing to bet.\n\nSave your money.", "timestamp_created": 1430363068, "timestamp_updated": 1438795040, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492085", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15616520": {"recommendationid": "15616520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156251669", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485578589}, "language": "english", "review": "Very happy thatI purchased this game!

This is tenuous, as I admit I've not really played enough to really get the feel of things.\n + Flying - Oh yeah; there's a whole shedload of distance to be got from that, if it's used right.\n - Speed - No; I don't agree so far. Unless you hold boost down all the time (which you can't) it seems a tad pedestrian. Maybe I've just not got far enough into it yet.\n + Soundtrack - I really don't like this kind of music. But I found myself leaving it on, anyway. So that's good, right?\n\nOverall, I'm glad I supported this, and hope it delivers what I'm looking for.

I usually don't play racing games (I have none on my steam account), but I decided to pick this one up. The atmosphere, the colour, the mystery, and the overall mind-bending aspects of this game make it my favourite game that I've gotten so far. \n\nAt first glance, it will just seem like a colourful driving game, but seriously, I have found EVERYTHING that I've wanted in a racing game here, it's fast paced, challenging (but not too difficult once you get into it), and certain aspects like spinning around to jump on upside-down surfaces, or suddenly having the gravity turn off and learning to adjust your playstyle make it super addictive\n\nThis game is also packed with lore, but it's never explicitly shoved in your face. The story mode seems to be about some kind of society that released... something, but that's all I've been able to figure out so far. I don't want to spoil anything either, but every detail of the adventure mode is packed with information about what happened. The adventure mode makes me feel like I'm delving into the past, trying to uncover what happened to this society. I've actually played the adventure mode three times now just because of how awesome it feels, it's so fun, and there are a lot of parts that feel so ominous, like I'm watching the end of the world but I don't entirely understand how it happened. The starting cut scene, that just shows the car starting, gives tons of information on the story, but you won't realize it unless you play it through again, and even the loading screens give you a glimpse into what is going on\n\nOverall I am thoroughly impressed with this game. Every aspect of it comes together to make a masterpiece. One thing I'd recommend is making sure you have the right hardware to be able to run it, because the game is just so freaking awesome and having any sort of lag would take away from the experience (you can change the visual settings and that does help, but again the game looks so amazing on full quality)\n\n10/10, I can't wait to see this game when it's completely finished, despite how polished

distance, the more i feel like it could be THE racing game to pick up. and for an early access title it sure as heck is more polished than other games that share space there.\n\nthe gist of it is summed up by the trailer and the game's description: you drive a super cool tron car of sorts through various areas in an attempt to get from point a to point b as fast as possible, while trying not to get sliced, smashed, flung off, or nitronic crash into a wall. the latter is silly because you can also drive on walls and cielings, which counts as a stunt (more on that later). you can also fly, but later levels tend to flip flop between letting you fly and not letting you fly, and you can shave seconds off the flying areas if you know how to.\n\nand that isn't all. you can cool down your thrusters by doing stunts. don't ask how it works, just roll with it. the controls feel buttery smooth and responsive, though some community made levels will make you think otherwise at times. the music in the game is top notch and i'd gladly toss my cash at Refract or Torcht just to get it through steam.\n\nand while the adventure is short and sweet, the replayability comes from the workshop. seriously, go check it out. there's dozens of tracks waiting to be conquered, either alone or in competition with friends and strangers alike. there's  the Stunt mode for those who want to do flips and stuff, or if you want to put it to more use on the courses, Speed and Style is a mode about doing tricks to cut time off the clock. finally, for the ultimate in keepaway, look no further than Reverse Tag. that assumes there's folks hosting that mode, which is often rare. but when it is hosted, it's the perfect blend of sprint, stunt, and king of the hill, with the hill being a ball of sorts that you snag and take with you, but others can also easily snag off you by driving into the ball while you have it.\n\nand if you intend to play this on multiplayer, be sure to hop on Distance on Saturdays. correct me if i'm wrong but i think that's the day when folks go outta thier way to host games of Distance multiplayer.\n\nEDIT:\nCaliforn1a Sep 3, 2015 @ 8:16pm  \nYup, every Saturday 2pm-4pm eastern time is our community multiplayer event: http://steamcommunity.com/app/233610/discussions/0/528398719786414266/\n\nPinning this comment to the review. speedy saturdays is a thing, okay?\n\nalso, figured i'd update this with some developments.\n\nDistance now has a Grip button (think Sonic's stomp in later games, but clings to walls and cielings if your wheels are pointed toward them, and slower, and also acts as the increased handling button) and has toned down a certain bug that allowed huge level skipping to the point it could be outright unfun. the trick is still doable, but now it's not capable of skipping entire sections of track.\n\nbut the biggest improvement is the editor, which is now capable of more things than ever before. you need only look at \"Uncanny Valley\" for a decent start. granted, it could do that stuff before, but it was limited back then.\n\non a side note, community is active enough that if you DL a map or two via workshop every now and then, you could get a good amount of maps to race on.\n\nTL:DR: Distance is a racing game all about going fast, and surviving. loads of community content keep the game fresh enough to last a while, and devs are hard workers, keeping the progress going.\n\nEDIT: if you see this review by any chance and get the game, hop onto the discord channel.\n\nthis also applies to anybody who already owns the game. it's the best way to keep on top of Speedy Saturdays and community events, as well as the community showing off tidbits of what they are working on with the game's editor.\n\noh, and the main levels of the game look like they're going to get prettied up when the adventure mode gets updated content.\n\nRIP Broken Symetry, though.", "timestamp_created": 1429411904, "timestamp_updated":

No slipping or anything at all.\n\nAll of this could be forgiven if only there was _content_. But there just simply isn't. I played through the single player \"campaign\", and it was probably one of the most boring hour of gaming in years. This game seriously needs AI competitors. Someone to tackle into the lasers. More speed, lots of it. Weapons. Explosions. Forget twisting in zero gravity and those stupid jumps into the ghost world or whatever it was. Bring us more action. And if guns and fire isn't the thing here, at least make it clear what is.\n\n\nI'm having hard time deciding what this game tries to be. Is it trying to relax or excite? Currently, it only bores. Not recommended, although there is potential, it just needs a lot more content. A lot.\n\nEdit:\nSome more info about my gaming history.

Refract's strategy of utilizing their growing fanbase really makes this game unique.

The game is also really easy to learn, even if you haven't played their first game, and it is more than a racing game. There are other exciting game modes. There is a fast-paced survival aspect to each race with tons of obstacles that you need to avoid or your car will be torn to shreds. But each race is only as hard as you want it to be!

to post my review for Distance, and the most recent update (build 3520, the workshop discovery update) provides the perfect time for me to do so. I bought into the late alpha backer stage in June 2014, and as my playtime would suggest, I've not regretted this in the least bit. Distance was well worth the almost 3x price to buy into that stage ($55), and it has only improved it's features and content since then. This game is a steal for the current $20 it rests at, and I am confident any cons listed in this review or many of the other reviews will be ironed out before it leaves the Early Access stage.\n\n[h1]Early Access[/h1]\nYes, this game is still in the early access stage. For many games that may means bugs, few updates, lazy devs, and etc. but Distance, and its devs, are far exceeding those predispositions people may have about early access as a concept. [url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1857884659/distance-a-next-generation-arcade-racer]It had a very successful Kickstarter campaign[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=103111305&searchtext=distance]it was also a Steam greenlight game[/url]. The game itself is in a fully working and stable state. The main reason behind staying in early access instead of going ahead and releasing is one thing - Features. The devs are very dedicated and have a laundry list of features they expect to be in their game before they consider it complete, and this is why it is in early access. The main features left to be added to the game at the point of writing this review are as follows: At least one alternative vehicle to choose from (+one other for kickstarter backers), an \"announcer\" similar to that of Nitronic Rush but in a different styling to fit the desolate Distance atmosphere, a full replay system with ghosts to race against, randomly generated tracks, and a full adventure story mode (part of which is currently in-game). I'd encourage whoever is considering buying this game to look past the early access tag and see the game for what it is, a very complete experience with some major new features on the way.\n\n[h1]Developers[/h1]\nThe developers are not treating this (early access) as a cash cow opportunity to make a profit and run, abandoning the game - they are very active within the community and are an easy bunch to contact if need be. There is no downside I can speak of when talking about the developers in the 9 months I've participated in the community thus far - they are an amazing team and I'm glad they are the ones to be making this great game. Anyone active in the Distance community has probably talked to them at some point, whether it be about a bug report, feature suggestion, or just discussing some of the many community workshop tracks. Occasionally they will host a livestream event to show off some of the community-created tracks on [url=http://twitch.tv/refractstudios]their Twitch[/url] and we have some great fun asking questions while they host a multiplayer server. All of their contact info is in the bottom-right corner of [url=http://survivethedistance.com/]the Distance homepage[/url].\n\n[h1]Level Editor[/h1]\nThe level editor is very complex, and a few reviews have listed that as a con, but I see the complexity of it as a good thing. The more complex it is, the more can be done in it. Yes, it won't be easy to do, but the complexity means that it can be done. There are a few level editor tutorials in the works, so they should help new players learn how to use it more easily. If you have the patience to sit down with it for a while and just play around, then you'll find that it is a very extensive editor that allows you to create pretty close to anything you want.\n\n[h1]Pros List[/h1]\nI'll be stealing some of my pros and cons from other reviews, but we are all talking about the same game so the lists would be fairly similar anyway. I suggest taking a look through [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/icebound777/recommended/233610/]Icebound777's review[/url] for a comprehensive pros/cons listing.\n[list][*]The controls are tight, and the game supports many, many types of controllers including racing wheels and flight sticks.\n[*]There is a lot of track variety and full Steam workshop support for the level editor.\n[*]The agility of the vehicle makes the game handle more like a platformer than a racer, giving it a \"new\" feeling to the racing genre.\n[*]There is no concept of \"out of bounds\" in Distance - any surface can be driven on and treated as a potential track. This leads to some crazy routes to get to the end of some tracks.\n[*]The competition on the global leaderboards is tight, even with all the off-road routes driving on buildings.\n[*]The community encourages players to use the vehicle mechanics to their full potential, and even [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj8tBw_zjKiS-dQI9LT5ndpJS_5hR8aC9]publishes videos of how to complete tracks faster[/url] to help any players improve their times (people don't keep \"fast\" routes a secret).\n[*]You can watch a replay of any time on the global leaderboards and race ghosts of them.\n[*]The vehicle can be recolored with completely custom colors and those colors show up in multiplayer.\n[*]There is splitscreen with up to 4 players, fairly rare on pc games - as well as online multiplayer.\n[*]Extensive graphics settings to be configured, including things such as \"Film Noir\" for a black and white look or \"Stylized Outlines\" for the Borderlands look.\n[*]The car can be cut into pieces by lasers or saws, making for some interesting gameplay trying to control the vehicle without a couple wheels.\n[*]The soundtrack. Seriously, just [url=https://soundcloud.com/torcht/sets/distance]go listen to it[/url].\n[*]All audio levels can be edited separately (music, car, environment, etc.)\n[*]Local custom music support to play mp3's and have the game lights react/pulse to it (Windows only currently).\n[*]All official and workshop tracks are available in multiplayer. The host needs to have the tracks locally in order to play them however.\n[*]Not having a workshop track in multiplayer is no big deal, say hi to automatic workshop downloading!\n[*]There is the option of creating private, password-protected, servers, and a \"connect via IP\" to allow for offline LAN play.\n[*]Comprehensive and complex level editor allowing you to run wild with whatever crazy ideas you may have.\n[*]Multiple gamemodes including:\n[list][*]Sprint (point a to b race/time trial)\n[*]Challenge (similar to Sprint, but no checkpoints and no deaths allowed)\n[*]Stunt (do stunts to get the highest score)\n[*]Reverse Tag (capture the flag/king of the hill type gameplay where you try to hold onto a bubble for a cumulative 3 minutes and the bubble enlarges the longer you hold it making it harder to keep)[/list][/list]\n\n[h1]Cons List[/h1]\n[*]No option of a standard HUD apart from the back of the vehicle, making getting cut extremely annoying in some situations.\n[*]Currently no dedicated servers, the host has to be playing the game and picking which tracks to play - however this has been hinted at as something the devs want to be in.\n[*]No custom assets in the level editor - that means objects or music. Local custom music is supported, but no workshop support.\n[*]Difficulty and skill curve could use some tweaking but if you stick with it, it is possible to learn the ropes fairly quickly.\n[*]General bugs/glitches[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1426563336, "timestamp_updated": 1498439229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782807", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14928053": {"recommendationid": "14928053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117734963", "num_games_owned": 2221, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451358508}, "language": "english", "review": "It's F-Zero, S.F.

Thats the negatives so far.\n\nPositives are quite a few; Take Tron, a light touch of the Horror genre, and the Matrix Highways and the portals from Dystopia and you have Distance. The in game suspense gets quite affective at times. I put down the campaign a few times just to get my head clear from the in game 'stressors' but once I figured out what I was doing its quite fun. I enjoy racing games and this made my engine purr. Refract, I salute the skill put into this so far. Glad to be supporting you know, hopeful for your bright future. \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1426223675, "timestamp_updated": 1426223675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14860262": {"recommendationid": "14860262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001541683", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509853705}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Em apenas meia hora de jogo j\u00e1 posso dizer:\nESSE JOGO \u00c9 ANIMAL!\nA trilha sonora, o gameplay com a mecanica de v\u00f4o que te faz querer aperfei\u00e7oar, a trilha sonora, o ambiente ao seu redor s\u00e3o sensacionais!\nN\u00e3o vou enrolar e falar muito porque n\u00e3o sou bom com letras e mesmo se fosse, voc\u00ea teria que comprar o jogo para sentir a emo\u00e7\u00e3o de verdade.\nTL;DR: COMPREM!", "timestamp_created": 1426219599, "timestamp_updated": 1426219599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14860035": {"recommendationid": "14860035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091579898", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470573865}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a solid racer with elemants of trials and has nice look and feel to it", "timestamp_created": 1426217855, "timestamp_updated": 1426217855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14859771": {"recommendationid": "14859771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154971548", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442437035}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0423 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432!!! \u042d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0448\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440!!! \u042d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439, \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0447\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a! \u0420\u0435\u0431\u044f\u0442\u0430, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0430\u0431\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430! \u0421\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u043b\u0438. \u042f \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u043b \u0437\u0430 280. \u0412 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c, \u043e\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430! \u041d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0435!!!", "timestamp_created": 1426215964, "timestamp_updated": 1426215964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501802", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14859148": {"recommendationid": "14859148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020326376", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426558635}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jesus, que jogo foda, vertiginoso, diferenciado.

A spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush, you have only seconds to react to what's in front of you and sometimes not even that much time is given. While sometimes frustrating with no particular payoff other than beating your times, Distance is an exciting game with a cool setting and a great soundtrack.\n \nGameplay: 8.5/10: Distance offers a variety of game modes including a short campaign, arcade sprint, stunt and style races, versus race, and split-screen up to four players. Each gameplay mode, outside of the multiplayer, is mildly lacking in replay value (unless you're a perfectionist and want to get to the top of the leaderboards which I personally could easily see myself attempting). When you enter the multiplayer it becomes an insane race for first, style points, or who can pull off the most wicked stunt. The last time I felt a game play this smooth and fun was Split/Second and that's what this game reminds me of... only if it were set in Tron.\n\nGraphics: 8/10: The setting is stunning and the tracks are intense to race on. Neon colours flash past you as you go from 0-250mph in just a few short seconds and the environment keeps up with the action you experience. However, upon closer inspection the environment isn't the most detailed setting, with speed of levels (no laps) and need for concentration aiding in the distractability from the environment itself. The car itself is physically stunning and fun to look at, particularly when you activate the thrusters or flight ability. When it explodes for the umpteenth time, you might be a little remorse at the fact that it constantly splits into the same fractal polygons and rains over the landscape below, but if you can get over that sort of thing you might just find yourself immersed in the reactive world around you, which brings us to our next point.\n\nSound: 9/10: Arguably the star of the game is the notion that the environment reacts to the pumping techno beats and seems to simulate a synesthetic experience. The developers turn sound into visuals which vastly aid in drawing you in to the overall experience. I even found myself reacting and driving to the beat, which for some reason was always perfectly timed to the rest of the level, even if you were to crash with a digitally explosive sound. The soundtrack is genuinely something I find myself coming back to the game to enjoy over and over and over again. The car sounds beautiful and is perfectly matched to its sporty design. I keep returning to the game just to hear the music again and again. I love it that much!\n\nLast Words\nDistance is a fun game for perfectionists but if you're into unlocks and specials outside of what you purchase, you'll want to look elsewhere. A visual and audible synesthetic experience that draws you in, Distance is the perfect spiritual successor to some of the most fast-paced and intense racing games on the market.\n\n8.5/10 - Give it a

Which is certainly an idiosyncratic description, so perhaps I'll go into more details.\n\nGraphically, it's gorgeous.  The art design is incredibly strong and the different areas of the city feel very distinctive - and the challenges you'll encounter vary based on sector.  The audio is likewise near pitch perfect.  The controls are tight, and the game always felt fair.  Yes, I died a lot in some sections, but it always felt like it was something I'd done wrong, rather than the game punishing me for bad luck.  That's high praise and speaks well of their design ethos.\n\nAs it stands, the game is somewhat lacking in content.  I burned through Adventure mode in about an hour.  It was incredibly polished and I encountered no bugs - it's just not very long.  So if you're looking for a full game, hold off until it's out of Early Access.

[/b]\nIt's a pretty fast racing game; easy to learn, hard to master. Good reflexes are a must. 4/5\n\n\n[list]\n[*] Official tracks are really good. From easy tutorial-like tracks to weird and fast paced ground-ceiling-wall-avoid-jump-through-hole. They look great, stuff pulsates colorful to the beaty music. They usually take about 2-4 min. so great for \"just another map\" feeling :D\n[*] Graphis is awesome. Although some effects are pretty performance consuming (e.g. car reflections), even with a mediocre pc it still looks cool. Big screen/tv is a plus since all the effects can sometimes make orientation a bit hard, especially when playing split screen MP.\n[*] Controls are fine (no mouse support though, but I don't mind). You can customize them and even put one action to 2 different buttons, but I think the default settings are just working good. Best played with controller in my opinion (worked with xbox 360 controller instantly).\n[*] Sound is, as title says, fu**** awesome! Great beats, everything is responsive to the track (which works even in MP!), which really improves imersion (if you can say that for a SciFi racing game :D). Nothing to add here. Just turn up the bass + volume! (yes the music in the steam shop video is also in game music)\n[*] Stuff like \"gold medals\" is not really necessary imho - but every player gets a profile and you can check your local player and global ranking for every track. Nice for local MP with your friends, as you can always check who's the best on which track if you'd like.\n[*] Some customization is possible: you can change your cars colors, like primary, secondary, glow and sparcle color. Gets saved to the profile, so every player can make his own colored car. Design is still always the same, though.\n[/list]\n\n\nIf you like racing games and are playing MP (and don't necessarily need weapons like Mario Cart), get this gem right now.\nIf you play singe player only, maybe wait a bit for more content or a sale, as currently you can \"see and do everything\" in a couple of hours (unless you're the type who has to lead every ranked table there is :D).\n\n\nDid not use the map creator.\nDid play with controller only.\nDid not play online MP, just split screen.", "timestamp_created": 1424604821, "timestamp_updated": 1424604821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14586908": {"recommendationid": "14586908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046265414", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513122643}, "language": "english", "review": "A successor to Nitronic Rush, Distance is a racing game with an emphasis on dynamic movement, quick reactions and a generally good sense of speed.

The question whether you'd like it is depending on your taste of games. It's a racing genre that needs more explanation.\nSo here is my review with a comparison to the older, yet free game \"Nitronic Rush\".\n\nThe control of the car is great and is heavily improved upon since Nitronic Rush, where you'd fling around carelessly by accident (though this was a lot of fun). Small turns in Distance are not as easy to make though. A controller is nice to use in case you want to aim for a nice time on a track.\n\nThe story mode, despite being minimal, has an enjoyable exploration feeling; much like it's earlier version. Shame it's not finished yet, but it looks to be promising. Playing this with some friends by giving each other the controller or keyboard is a lot of fun too.\n\nThis all is nothing I was worried about when it came to purchasing Distance. What worried me and still slightly does is the replayablity of the game. As of now Distance, does not have this so much. Nitronic Rush was free and for me the joy was kinda out of it when I completed the storyline. You've kind-of seen it all by the time you're done with it. Distance's multiplayer aspect improves on this a lot, so does the custom levels and level-editor. If all this to improve it makes the game worth the price tag of 19,99 euro's; I'm not so sure.\n\nEventually after fully experiencing the Story Mode the game turns from survival exploration racing to precision racing. It's kind of the same thing as Trackmania actually. Although there's more control over your car and it's set in a whole different setting. If you're much into precision racing; I see you'll have a decent amount of replayability with this game. Yet if you're only in for the exploration, I think you're through the game rather quickly.\n\nGet this game if you like precision racing, otherwise wait for a 40% discount. 33% works if you're desperate to try it.\n\n[spoiler]:^)[spoiler]7.6*/10[spoiler]*grade improves as the game improves[/spoiler][/spoiler][/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1424554521, "timestamp_updated": 1426104060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565987", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14581932": {"recommendationid": "14581932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057320112", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474904286}, "language": "english", "review": "a very unique racing-experience!\n\n10/10 worth every penny", "timestamp_created": 1424548359, "timestamp_updated": 1449758523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14576583": {"recommendationid": "14576583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082299411", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493585720}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Oyun gayet g\u00fczel.

Man bek\u00f6mmt nat\u00fcrlich die arcadige Fahrphysik mit der obligatorischen Boostfunktion allerdings gibt es dazu dann auch das au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliche Bewegungssystem, welches einem dank Spr\u00fcngen, Rotationen um die eigenen Achsen und kurzzeitigen Flugeinlagen komplett neue Wege er\u00f6ffnet sich durch die Level zu bewegen.\nDie Level an sich sind sehr gut gestaltet und f\u00fchren einen mit der richtigen Geschwindigkeit an die anfangs doch recht ungew\u00f6hnlichen Funktionen heran. \nDie Level kann man entweder im Storymode eins nach dem anderen spielen, oder im Arcademode direkt auf bestzeitenjagd gehen und sich mit seinen Freunden oder der ganzen Welt messen, dank intergrirter Bestenlisten.\nWem die offiziellen Level, von denen es momentan tats\u00e4chlich leider noch nicht so viele gibt (bei meinem ersten durchspielen war ich mit dem Storymode nach etwa 45 Minuten durch) nicht reichen, der hat Gl\u00fcck denn das SPiel kommt mit einem umfangreichen Streckeneditor und Steamworkshopsupport, wodurch andauernd neue gute (und auch nicht so gute) Level auftauchen, auf denen man sich mit seinen Freunden messen kann.\nIm multiplayer gibt es verschiedene Modi, so kann man die normalen strecken gegeneinander fahren, oder aber in speziellen Arenen Fangen spielen oder einfach schauen wer die h\u00f6chste Punktzahl mit Stunts erreichen kann. Hierzu sei noch gesagt, dass es keine Kollisionen gibt, \u00e4hnlich wie bei Trackmania, sodass es nicht vorkammen kann, dass jemand einfach nur da ist um zu trollen und andere zu behindern.\n\nIst das Spiel perfekt? Nein, nat\u00fcrlich nicht, aber sowas kann man ja wohl auch nicht von einer Beta erwarten. Hier und da gibt es noch Performanceprobleme und manchmal macht die Physik auch komische Sachen, insbesondere, wenn das eigene Auto durch Laser zerschnitten wurde und nur noch 2/3 des Wagens vorhanden sind. Aber man merkt, dass die Entwickler stetig daran weiter arbeiten und dass ihnen diese Projekt wirklich am Herzen liegt.\n\nKann ich distance empfehlen? Auf jedenfall es ist alles in allem ein sehr spa\u00dfiger Arcaderacer, der vieles neu macht und insbesondere die Bestzeitjagd auf einezelnen Strecken ist fantastisch (wenn man die Zeit eines Freundes um den Bruchteil einer Sekunde unterbietet ist das schon ein cooles Gef\u00fchl).

Buy it YESTERDAY, but don't expect a super-realistic driving game or even a MARGINALLY realistic one. I don't even think the cars have breaks--but if they do I've never used them.\n\nA pretty unique game that feels less like a driving or racing game(due in large part to the slippery and unrealistic car) and more like a sort-of... Sonic-y runner with survival elements. Irregardless of how the game feels however it is inarguably one of the most fun experiences I've ever had. The game is challenging at times but for the most part is very fair, even in most of the workshop levels I've played, and it introduces a pretty cool universe(though one which reminds me too much of Tron to call it wholly original) that I REALLY want to learn more about, as well as some mechanics that I can't really say I've ever seen before.\n\nYou'll find yourself frequently and seamlessly switching from driving on the ceiling and on the walls, only to jump off two and a half seconds later and flying over an endless void. After a while, you'll land on solid ground again-- and if the planets align, you'll be actually horizontal on the GROUND and not on a wall or the ceiling, and nothing will be trying to kill you. At which point you'll probably make your car JUMP and do a couple flips for bonus points. This is the game's biggest asset, in my opinion. Everything just works--and works so very, very well. Jumping from a walll to the floor or vice-versa has some occasional hiccups, but otherwise the physics engine is constructed so well that the game just FLAWLESSLY and instantaneously responds to your commands in a way that I'm too illiterate to describe. The controls just feel so right... I'd even call them close to flawless. When you're a car, it drives like a car--a car that can jump, flip, and drive when half of it gets shredded by laser beams, but a car nonetheless. When you leap into the air and deploy your fucking WINGS, it feels like a plane. The game instantly transitions from a really solid(but floaty and weightless) arcade driving game into a really solid flight simulator--but it does it so well that you don't even notice most of the time.\n\nAnother huge plus is the striking art style. It feels reminiscent of Tron, but it has its own unique flare that defines it as its own, like most of the rest of the game does. It looks really overly shiny and neon and it's not something that I'm usually very fond of, but it works REALLY well. The screenshots and footage on this page seriously do not do the game credit in this respect.\n\nThe obsticles in the game are also pretty awesome, in combination with the car's damage model. Imagine Metal Gear Rising where Raiden's sword is a grid of laser beams, and you are the watermellon. Obviously your car does not like to drive as well if it is split in half, but it can take a lot of abuse as I recall.\n\nThe lore and universe in the game gives me mixed opinions. The developers have made it clear that they'll probably change a lot of the \"story\", but as of the time of this writing the game has a really solid universe and what seems to be the beginning of some AMAZING lore to build off of, but it doesn't really do anything with it. It attempts to almost tell the story through the tracks as you race through them, and while it translates pretty well in some ways, it doesn't really allow you to get a good idea of where you are, why you're there, and what the hell is going on around you, and it certainly leaves you drawing blanks for specific details. Story is by no means of any importance in a game like this and when the tracks are designed so well that they should make AAA publishers feel inferior, I really don't mind too much, but I simply can't help but lust for more lore. Hell, I'll sebtle for a two-issue tie-in comic for god's sake.\n\nIn conclusion, the game has its faults, but I'll be damned if I can name any of them. I'm too busy trying to beat my backflip record.\n\nIn a car.", "timestamp_created": 1423626475, "timestamp_updated": 1423626475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14427926": {"recommendationid": "14427926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086298637", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507272234}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow", "timestamp_created": 1423624476, "timestamp_updated": 1423624476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14425753": {"recommendationid": "14425753", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984065275", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 4697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501458653}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game of 2014\n\nEdit:I wanted to elaborate on this statement but realised that nothing I could say about this game would in any way dissuade anyone from buying it.

As one of the seemingly few Racing genre fans left out there, this was high on my list for arcade style shenanigans.  When I saw it up for Early Access, I just had to try it for myself.  \n\nFirstly, let me start by saying I didn't know it, but I've been waiting my whole life for this game.  The flying mechanic is awesome and it brings a totally unique spin on survival racing genre.  The look is fitting, the soundtrack rocks, and the graphics are modest but sweet.  If you enjoyed Extreme G on the N64 or any of the F-Zero games, or games like them, you should enjoy Distance.  A big thing that's different though that I haven't seen often is what makes it a survival game.  There aren't weapons on vehicles or combat in any traditional sense.  Instead, your faced with a myriad of interesting obstacles to overcome.  Some of it is track memorization but there's plenty moving around and enough nuance that it's going to take on-the-fly skills to get a good time in this game.  Ok, so it's kind of a dream come true, but what's wrong with it?\n\nFor fairness sake, I need to talk about what I think isn't so great about the game too.  For starters, I think the multiplayer is going to be a tough sell since people have to host their own servers.  That's hard to get people to do even for games where it's expected, like FPS games.  I hope a dedicated few make a nice online scene for the playerbase, otherwise we're gonna have a hard time playing together.  Secondly, there's still something to be desired in the handling.  They've got a really solid base for how the controls feel (I'm using a game pad), but there needs to be some more precision to it.  Everything feels just a little bit soft, so hopefully they can tighten those knobs.  Finally, there needs to be better programming to handle bumping into stuff.  If you full blown crash, you're out of the race, and that seems to work fine.  It's when you ram a wall, or awkwardly get turned upside down, or stuck in a corner, or land funny from flying, that you find yourself pressing buttons that don't help.  There needs to be more protocols for what happens when X fails.  This is of course beta, so stuff like that is already on the to-do list I'm sure, but that will help a lot with the replayability of levels and it will make failure less frustrating.  \n\nAll in all, this game is a solid buy for any fan of the racing genre, particularly those older arcade style games that were focused on external stuff like survival rather than pure-racing.  I will be spending plenty of time in this title.  I think there's a lot of room for improvement but the game has a really solid foundation and so with proper support I'm excited to think we'll get an iconic title out of this one.  \n\nPS: I'd like to add that they really did a nice job with the mechanics and how they teach them to you.  They took all the advice I see directed towards newer developers (not saying these guys are new, I don't know the company's history) and they used it to their advantage.  The overheating system in juncture with the restoration circles is beautifully simple and very well tuned.  The story mode teaches you all the crazy things you have to avoid in a perfect way.  Very non-tutorialy while at the same time being an excellent tutorial.  - Nice job on the basic mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1422997431, "timestamp_updated": 1422997431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14306869": {"recommendationid": "14306869", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972219713", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431216680}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is such a mess and not because it's Early Access.\n\nYou want to know what made Trackmania work despite it's crazy tracks?

Multiplayer consists of people just jet flying to skip a good portion of the track as a \"shortcut\" which makes the game dull and uninteresting.\n\nThis sucks because the music and art direction are superb, but it's a complete garbage when it comes leaderboards and time trails.

I really can't recommend it one way or another as I think this just isn't my type of racing.  It's a neat concept but I prefer simulators with real cars and the ability to modify and tune.   Game is decent but it should be f2p.  \n\nNow, steam is making me choose to recommend it or not, I personally choose no but that's just me.", "timestamp_created": 1422664171, "timestamp_updated": 1428326177, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413658", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14235411": {"recommendationid": "14235411", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992913795", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449378214}, "language": "english", "review": "So far, I have only played the single player, but the game itself is quite good.

But I have to say this is one of the few gems inside of this program. Distance is just plain addicting. I can just spend hours on end replaying the same levels (Or going through the library of community made tracks on the workshop! ) over and over again. The car itself is amazing allowing you to boost, jump, fly and rotate giving you many options for sick tricks that you can do. The teleporters I have to say is another one of my favorite things about this game, nothing is as  cool as doing a flip through a teleporter and dodging multiple blades and lazers before landing it or suddenly being taken to an area with Zero Gravity or where you're upside down. Did I mention that the car also lets you ride on walls and ceilings? This game is fast paced, and very awesome if you can stay up to speed and stick to your reactions as you dodge anything that blocks your path. It has multiplayer already in the game from the get go which works pretty well for an Early Access game so far. The game also lets you customize your car to a limited extent along with an easy, but deep level editor. Also if you were wondering, you can go first person as well! There's no interior just the front of the car but holy shit it's tough but cool as hell to drive in that view. Recommend this game to any of your friends if you own it, this needs a larger community to support it!\n\ntl;dr: Game is like hotwheels, and trackmania with it's own little twists (Teleporter, and the car.) Very fun, awesome tricks. If you've been hesitant on buying it, don't hold back.\n\nI'd give this game personally a 10/10. Can't really find anything I don't enjoy about it. It's one of those fun, addicting little games you find that you can't put down and keep coming back to.

Ich war schon lange auf der Suche nach einem Rennspiel dass die perfekte Mischung aus Arcade- und Funracer bietet. Hiermit hatte die Suche endlich ein Ende gefunden :)\n\nZuerst sei gesagt dass sich das Spiel noch in der Early Access Phase befindet d.h. Bugs oder Glitches sind hier keine Ausnahme. Trotzdem hat mir das nicht die Lust genommen das Game f\u00fcr akzeptable 20\u20ac runterzuladen.\n\n\nSTORY:\n\nDas Spiel beginnt meiner Meinung nach, mit einer recht coolen Startsequenz die einfach mal auf jegliche Worte verzichtet und direkt in's Gameplay einleitet. Man hat zwar nie eine wirkliche Ahnung davon, gegen wen oder wof\u00fcr man gerade f\u00e4hrt aber das ist man ja eigentlich heutzutage von Rennspielen gewohnt. \u00dcbrigens kann man den Story Modus locker an 1 Tag durchspielen. Zu viel soll jetzt aber auch nicht verraten werden, denn ihr sollt es ja selber erleben ;)\n\nZusammengefasst: Die Story ist nicht gerade die St\u00e4rke von Distance, ist aber jedem selbst \u00fcberlassen.\n\n\nGrafik/Optik:\n\nDie Anforderungen an den PC um das Spiel auf Ultra spielen zu k\u00f6nnen sind nicht gerade ohne :D\nMein Mittelklasse-PC schafft es noch knapp auf \"Hoch\" zu spielen mehr aber nicht.\nOptisch macht Distance einiges her. Nicht nur der Neon/Laser look gef\u00e4llt mir sehr gut sondern auch die verschiedenen Designoptionen geben einen mehr M\u00f6glichkeiten das Spiel zu personalisieren. Mein pers\u00f6nlicher favorit ist der \"cel shading\" look bei dem alle schwarzen Linien etwas dicker dargestellt werden als sonst. Das verpasst dem ganzen eine Art Comic Stil. Doch wie fast immer gilt: Look ist Geschmackssache ;)\n\nZusammengefasst: Die Grafik ist alles andere als entt\u00e4uschent, da jeder selber den Look bestimmen kann, um das beste Spielerlebnis rauszuholen.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nDas Gameplay von Distance hat seine Vor- sowie Nachteile. Na ja... um genau zu sein gibt es nur einen Nachteil dazu aber gleich. F\u00fcr alle die jetzt ein wenig skeptisch geworden sind: ES MACHT VERDAMMT NOCHMAL SPASS!\nEgal ob am Boden, in der Luft oder an den W\u00e4nden, wenn man den Dreh einmal raushat, geniesst man Level f\u00fcr Level!\nDie Steuerung ist eher simpel gehalten (Positiv) Gas geben, Nitro, Bremsen und Lenken, dass \u00fcbliche.\nNeu sind Drehen und Springen/Gleiter \u00f6ffnen. Die zuletzt erw\u00e4hnten Steuerrungsm\u00f6glichkeiten machen das Fliegen in der Luft m\u00f6glich. Das Handling bzw. das Fahrgef\u00fchl ist ebenfalls untypisch. Anders als bei einer Rennsimulation, reagiert das Auto sofort auf Anschlag somit ist ein Schleudergang unm\u00f6glich. Wie schon erw\u00e4hnt gibt es keine \"normalen\" Strecken. Statdessen startet man erst auf einer Geraden dann sind \u00fcberall Hindernisse verteilt wie z.B. S\u00e4gebl\u00e4tter Rampen etc. und es folgen Flug- oder Wandpassagen. Diese Variationen sind abh\u00e4ngig vom Schwierigkeitsgrad.\n\nDer einzige Nachteil ist ein Bug in der Steuerrung, der dringend behoben werden muss! Ich spiele Distance f\u00fcr gew\u00f6hnlich mit meinem \"Razer Sabertooth\" Gaming Controller und das einzige Problem hierbei liegt in den Steuerrungsoptionen. Entweder wird er als eigenst\u00e4nndiger Controller oder als X-Box Controller erkannt das passiert gef\u00fchlt alle 2 Sekunden und kann beim Zocken f\u00fcr nervige Steuerrungs-Konflikte Sorgen. Das k\u00f6nnte eventuell nur bei mir der Fall sein, ist aber trotzdem erw\u00e4hnenswert.\n\nZusammengefasst: Der Grundgedanke von Distance liegt im abwechslungsreichen Gameplay dessen einzige Schw\u00e4che in der Controller-Steuerrung liegt.\n\n\nOnline:\n\nDer Online-Modus spaltet sich in \"Workshop\" und Online rennen. Im Workshop von Distance steckt eines der gr\u00f6\u00dften Potenziale. Jeder kann mit dem seeehr ausf\u00fchrlichen Level-Editor eigene Level kreieren und online stellen. Somit bietet das Spiel jeden Tag neue Herrausvorderrungen und wird theorethisch nie langweilig. Jeden Tag kommen rund 15 neue Level dazu, was f\u00fcr die Early Access Phase keine schlechte Quote ist.\nDie Online-Matches hingegen sind noch sehr verbesserungsw\u00fcrdig weil teilweise kaum Server vorhanden sind oder hin und wieder Verbindunsprobleme auftauchen.\n\nZusammengefast: Der Steam Workshop garantiert f\u00fcr langanhaltende Spielzeit wohingegen die Online-Matches teils \u00f6de oder nicht spielbar sind.\n\n\n\n\nPro:                                                                   \n\n-Solide Grafik                                                \n                                                                          \n-Look gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils personalisierbar                \n                                                                         \n-Erfrischendes Gameplay                                \n\n-Herunterladbare Level im Workshop\n\n\nKontra:\n\n-Magere Story\n\n-Eventuelle Steuerrunsproblme\n\n-Unausgereifter Online-Mode\n\nEndnote: 3+", "timestamp_created": 1422051959, "timestamp_updated": 1422052276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14112604": {"recommendationid": "14112604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030137422", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477842039}, "language": "italian", "review": "Fantastic game!

The developers behind Nitornic Rush made Distance after a successful Kickstrater compaign, in which I was a backer. I played the game since pre-EarlyAccess beta and it's one of those titles that doesn't have a long-lasting attachment feature, yet immediately sinks in as being something unique and great.\n\nThe production quality of this indie racer made by 6 people is 100 times better than something like The Crew, which shows something... At the very least a clear ability to estimate the workload and project scope in regards to the team's resources. There is no question that the game will be delivered exactly as was promised, if not better, and completely bug-free with great performance. Because it already is. I have no qualms with recommending this even under Early Access because really it is complete. All features promised by Kickstrater campaign have been delivered in time and as advertised. It is strange to praise a company so much just for doing things how they have to be done, but lately so few have been doing so, that as sad as it is, Refract really do stand out as being exceptionally professional and honest about their goals. And having a solid vision to boot.\n\nNow the actual game. It's a survival racer where you can drive on tracks, under tracks, on walls, on roofs, you can fly, jump, there are zero-gravity sections and generally a complete and glorious clusterfuck every time you spawn on a level. No signle race will be the same because at some point, someone will decide \"Racing on track is 2lame4me\" and jump on a nearest skyscraper, ride on it's wall to cut, screw up the jump-off, fall onto a lazer and cut off his front wheels (the car doesn't die from that, as long as you can get it to a next checkpoint where it will regenerate any missing parts, it will keep going until it overheats or smashes into something). After that they will make a best attempt to use side thrusters to turn and sprint thruster to get more airtime, overheat, explode and everyone will laugh hysterically.\n\nThis game is one of those LAN party games that becomes and instant must-have. It is full of hilarious moments. But if Goat Simulator, which is similar in that respect, only has funny moments, Distance posses a huge mechanical depth and complexity unparallelled by any racing game other than Simulators. If you can get past the flying controls and master the \"EveryTHING is a race track\" mechanic of switching between tracks, walls, ceilings, portals, all the while avoiding obstacles and performing tricks to get cooldown and boost more or get more flytime, you will find a very satisfying experience due to the amount of ways every track can be completed in. \n\nYou can drive to next checkpoint. You can fly to it. You can jump to a wall, drive up, jump off, do a 180\u2018 flip to land on the part of the track above you and skip to the next checkpoint. You can fly off the track at any time and use building rooftops to skip track parts. And it's not cheating because it takes an enormous amount of skill and training to pull that off without meeting your demise and being reset far back. There is really nothing like this. Distance takes the \"alternative route\" of racing games to a completely new level.\n\nAlso a very advanced level editor, a ton of levels on Steam Workshop, incredible soundtrack, great graphics and atmosphere, fantastic production quality and a fair price. If you can find friends for a LAN party or organize a group to play in online multiplayer (because generally that part is pretty dead, if you don't organize and host, there are no random servers to join and race), you will have a blast. It is very difficult to properly master this game's 4-dimensional racing, but it's worthit and if you don't want, you don't have to do it. I had a blast taking 14 minutes to reach finish line, just because in those 14 minutes I discovered 34 ways to reach it. Also I love driving half a car.

Naturally as the predecessor of that game, I'd expect just as much from Distance, And they delivered. not only is there a stronger sense of speed, they also enhanced the engine, allowing for some crazy gravity-defying roads and unique obstacles that launch you, explode you or just plain cut you in half and let you struggle to the next checkpoint. Now I'm not saying the game is perfect, there are a few tiny things that bug me. First of all, the colors don't seem as extravegant and intense as I remember them in the first game, also it get's anoying randomly exploding because you are riding along the wall to just barely pass by a sawblade.

Atmospherically, this is the best sci-fi racer I've played.  The game offers a single player story campaign, arcade racing mode, multiplayer and a fully fledged Level Editor in which you can build your own tracks.  The Steam Workshop is already integrated, offering an infinite resource of game content far beyond what is already offered in the game itself.  Best of all, you can specify any random phrase or word in the editor - and a track, with scenery and such as in the campaign will be added for you.  While it IS just as easy as typing a word and racing the resultant track, there is some sophistication built in: using certain words in your 'phrase' will add more sprint sections, particular effects, or more flight etc.  It's utterly brilliant and you don't have to be a boffin in order to use it (well, I used it - 'nuff said...).  There is also a full-blown track editor too if you really do want to craft your own by hand.\n\n[h1]How difficult is the racing?[/h1]\nThe racing part has absolute precision controls and difficulty in the single-player campaign curves gradually.  There have been past similar titles where you can find yourself bouncing from one wall to the other, but not this one - it's lovely to play.  Jumps and flips are taught by button-prompts on-screen.  Flight sections can be a fair bit tricky however.  Straight flight is easy enough, but the roll mechanics of the vehicle are very strange and I find it very tricky to fly around corners without rolling uncontrollably and spiralling to death.  It takes some skill to play these parts, but practise does pay off and reaching the end of the campaign feels like a genuine achievement. Until then, expect a challenge - especially with gravity being a thing when you're not sure which way up you're facing!  Falling to crash UPWARDS is often the only time I realise I'm completely flipped.  It's crazy and it's silly - but above all it's fun.  Gamepad ninjas will blaze through it, and then roll around the floor laughing at the rest of us with our 50+ attempts to get through that maddening flippy dodgy section without burning up.  \n\nThe game offers full controller support, including racing wheels and gamepads.  However, while the game can be played with a wheel, the best experience is experienced either with keyboard or gamepad for lighting-fast reaction play.\n\nA word of warning: if you suffer from any photo-sensitive condition like photo-sensitive epilepsy, this game might not be for you because there is a lot of flashing neon.  Watch the trailer videos first and judge for yourself.\n\n\n[h1]About that Early Access thing...[/h1]\nThe single-player campaign is rather short at the moment and, on its own, is not enough to warrant a typical AAA full game price.  However, there is a ton of content already in the Steam Workshop (some 700 new tracks the last time I looked) and these are seamlessly integrated with the game's 'Arcade' mode, plus the infinite possibilities of randomly seeded tracks, you'll never be bored.  As far as multiplayer goes, it seems really popular but check the game forums (I don't play multiplayer so I can't offer comment on this).  As a single-player product though, Steam reviews are giving an \"overwhelmingly positive\" for a very good reason: it really IS a great game already.  If you enjoy Wipeout-style games and not troubled by a lack of AI racers, then this should definitely be in your collection - it's worthy even as an Early Access title.\n\nHighly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1420942406, "timestamp_updated": 1439155679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709981", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13932107": {"recommendationid": "13932107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040012049", "num_games_owned": 1092, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473496950}, "language": "english", "review": "While I never played Nitronic Rush, I did play Rush 2049 back nearly 15 years ago (fairly sure both on the Dreamcast and N64) which I guess heavily inspired Nitronic Rush. Rush 2049 back in the day felt really enjoyable and worth playing a lot of.  Stunt Mode in Distance feels exactly how I remember stunt mode in Rush 2049 feeling (which to be fair it probably feels a lot smoother in this, but its been nearly 15 years). As for the race tracks defualtly in the game they feel challenging, easy to complete, but hard to master. Even though there is not a lot of courses built in yes, because they are challenging courses with a lot of parts to master I can see spending a lot of time enjoying playing the same tracks over just to get that little bit better each time.\n\nWith that said, it is definitly early access, \"Story\"/ \"Adventure\" mode right now is just a handfull of tracks that you complete with no AI drivers to compete against, no ghost to race against, heck it doesn't even tell you your time at the end when you complete a track it just goes straight into the next one.\n\nTo sum up, its definitly not finished yet, it has about 11 longer tracks, 7ish short challenge tracks, and 7ish stun arenas, but currently 366 user created tracks. The courses are highly repeatable because they have a high challenge and learning curve, while user created tracks will be hit and miss, there is definitly a lot to try from.\n\nWould I recommend this game? While the tracks feel a bit empty without an option to race your ghost, I would definitly recommend this game, specially if you liked Rush 2049 or Nitronic Rush. This game is great to play by yourself and even better to play with friends.

Distance is practically the only game I bought on steam for full price, because I think it is worth the full $20. \n(Note: in the world of $60 AAA games like CoD, $20 for a multiplayer game like this is pretty darn good)\n\nGameplay\n\nDistance is \"racing\" game but most of the time your objective is to simply survive the track. Fall off the beaten path, and it is up to you to get back on. Your car has boosters, rotational thrusters and even wings, but that doesn't make it easy. You are constantly riding on walls, doing tricks off jumps, keeping track of gravity, and avoiding evil robotic obstacles. These include but are not limited to: giant buzz saws, rollers, spikey rollers, lasers that cut your car in half, robots that fly ahead of you and land in your way, walls that pop up from the ground, and my personal favorite: the lamp post. \nThe faster you ride on a wall, the more you stick to it. When you make a checkpoint, your overheat-meter goes down and your car is regenerated if it got cut by a laser. You can also reduce your overheating by landing tricks.\n\n\nThe game supports singleplayer and online multiplayer (an upgrade from Nitronic Rush), sports a user-friendly level editor, and even allows splitscreen with gamepads (a nice touch). Downloading community levels is easy via Steam Workshop. There are the normal racing game modes, and some different ones like \"tag\", and \"speed and style\" where doing tricks will reduce your overall time.\n\nFlavor\n\nDistance would be nowhere NEAR what it is today without its awesome, intense flavor! The setting is very Tron-inspired. As you ride down the colorful circuit-y roads which twist and turn through the cybernetic cityscape, you can't help but admire the fact that everything is flashy and genuinely cool. Even some community level creators add a different flavor to the game with their levels; they will thrill you with all manner of trickery. Many things that light up in the game pulses with the intense beat. Which leads me to another topic: \n\nThe Music. Oh God the music is amazing. It falls in that dubstep/techno genre. It blends SO WELL with the visuals of the game. And lemme tell you something: I hate dubstep, techno, or whatever it is with a PASSION. But for some reason the music in Distance, its just different. I can't explain it... but it sounds great.\n\nDistance, by the way, is appropriate and available for all ages. There is no language, gore (obviously), or even words spoken by a person. The community level designers are clean. You don't even need a mouse to play.\n\nI love Distance. It should be clear to you by now. PLEASE BUY IT!! The one downfall of this game, (mainly because it is in early access) is that it lacks a full player base, sometimes I cannot find a multiplayer game at all. It needs more players to survive. I feel this game can become a prime example to the gaming community, of how Indie games should be developed, put on Early Access, and released. That is why I recommend Distance to every gamer.\n\nTL;DR: Buy Distance.", "timestamp_created": 1420823478, "timestamp_updated": 1422387596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13907098": {"recommendationid": "13907098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012707910", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444249367}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a cool game, BUT to control the car properly you will need an aviation helm or you will risk breaking your fingers", "timestamp_created": 1420802188, "timestamp_updated": 1420802188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13903590": {"recommendationid": "13903590", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999210367", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443843665}, "language": "english", "review": "Distance is worth buying if you're looking for a racing game that involves more than driving down a basic track.

When I play this game, I am constantly being remminded of Trackmania and how the cars felt when climbing up steep ramps and walls.  This game takes it further by adding in a jump feature allowing for some awesome manoeuvring over gaps and jumping from wall to wall like a car ninja.  For an early access, this is definetely something amazing.  We can all expect that this wil continue to get better with each update.

I absolutely love it! I loved Nitronic Rush but thought it felt a bit old. Then I got Distance, problem solved. Beatiful graphics and an epic soundtrack together with the lumo/electro/whateveritis lighting give it the most amazing atmosphere. And make it trippy as hell. Seriously, wow.\n\nThe simple mechanic of the jumping and the directional thrusters to let you do tricks and twist the car in the air add so much more to this and put it ahead of all the other racing games I've tried. There is nothing else like in this game when you are moving at high speed and rapidly jumping and flipping to get onto the next piece of track.\n\nThe obstacles can vary in function, which is nice considering there are only 3 or 4 types (saw blade, laser, barrier, but some can move, some can appear only when you're nearby, some can be different sizes, etc, the variety works here). Furthermore these obstabcles have a signifigant impact on you, hitting a sawblade on the side can send you spinning off the track, skimming too close to a laser will chop off a piece of your car leaving you with half a car, etc.\n\nThen there's replayability, so much of it, really. Many of the levels have multiple ways to get to the finish, some are marked 'detour' some you have to discover by keen viewing or complete accident, some are quick, some are harder/longer, some are simply an alternate. The currently released official levels don't show this as clearly but this game is in beta so don't judge. This brings us to another feature, the built in level editor. This gives the community a chance to make their own levels and if you look at the workshop page you will see... so many levels. And they are all great! They also make brilliant use of the whole 'multiple ways to get to the end' idea and have created some awesome looking tracks.\n\nPros:\nBeatiful Graphics\nAwesome soundtrack\nSlick controls (I would reccomend a controller though)\nTracks with multiple paths -> Replayability for dauys\nCommunity levels -> Even more replayability (did I mention that these community levels are actually brilliant?)\n\nCons:\nKeyboard controls are iffy and take some getting used to, even if you normally play keyboard and mouse\nThe whole 'early access' thing, aside from community levels, it does feel a little incomplete (but that's because it's in Beta still).\n\nOverall, for $20 I would not hesitate for a second to try this game. If anyone wants to try before you buy kinda thing, look for 'Nitronic Rush', it was essentially the prototype for this game, but it's free and will give you a feel for the control system, the jumping and twisting, the flying, and the trippy tracks. Really, if you like racing games and want something different, or if you enjoy games like trackmania, give this a go.

Made by some of the same creators of Nitronic Rush, who graduated from Digipen, these dedicated developers work every day with lots of passion on this outstanding game. I've honestly never been more hooked on a game such as this one, thanks to it's amazing gameplay, community, build-in speechlessly-powerful level editor, and random track generation system, you are in for lots of replay value with over 2000 community workshop level submissions and it's \"trackmogrify\" mode which allows you to enter any seed you want, and a track is generated based on what you put in (modifiers can be used to alter the difficulty, length, etc.). You are able to customize your car by changing the car colors, but unfortunetly, no custom cars are possible due to complications with leaderboard compatability, hitboxes giving different physics (which can give different leaderboard results and can screw with the top times.). Good news, there is confirmed one new vehicle model for all players in the works, and another, backer-exclusive vehicle, to be in the game prior to launch (these new car models will have the same hitboxes as to avoid messing with leaderboard times being screwed with). For the level editor, it is one of the easiest-to-learn, easiest-to-use, most powerful editor you will ever get your hands on. You can change many settings of any object available such as, but not limited to: Colors, emit colors, lights, rotation axis and speed (animator component, axisrotation if supported, or rigidbody if supported), spline road mannipulation, simples (can change bumpmap strength, emit texture, texture scales, togglable collisions, transparency, colors, reflect settings, etc.), particles (also very powerful with many settings such as texture, amount, colors, speed, acceleration, gravity, lifetime, offset, etc.), event triggers, addable components (a system where you can add special properties to any object that allows extra effects and spiciness to your map), and many other features that are too many to mention on here. A couple other major features of the game are Arcade mode, and Adventure mode. Arcade mode currently has a couple gamemodes like Sprint, Stunt (currently getting a big revamp as of 6/14/17), Reverse Tag, Challenge and Trackmogrify. Sprint and Reverse Tag are the most popular gamemodes. Sprint mode is straight-forward where you must get from point A, to point B in as little as time as possible. NOTE: Unlike most racing games, Distance does not bind you to the track against your will. Your car has 4 abilities: Boost, Jump, Fly, and Grip. These abilities allow you to move off the track and drive along the walls of buildings and any other piece of environment to carve your own path to the exit. Some players may tell you \"Skipping is back and no one should do it\", that is not true by any means. The game's core mechanics set the stage for skipping tracks, and the devs themselves encourage skipping if possible (Not telling you how to play, you can choose to not skip if you want. But you'll find that the global leaderboards will always have its top times be made by skipping). It is a big part of the game that some players don't realize, and it should be a known thing to everyone. Reverse tag mode is exacly what it says on the tin. One player has the tag bubble, and everyone is trying to get it. First player to 3 minutes is the winner. Challange mode is basically like sprint, except no checkpoints, and no respawning, and short tough tracks. Stunt mode is where you must rack up the most points by performing the best/most tricks out of anyone within a time limit. The last gamemode is Adventure mode. Although it is currently short and unfinished, when this game exits early access this year (the current goal is this year, and they are damn determined to get it done this year. They have even hired recently 3 community members to help finish adventure mode while the original devs work on the other things). Adventure 2.0 will be published as one giant update instead of small incrimental updates.\n\nTo wrap it all up, i'm going to compile a list of all the things mentioned above:\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nGamemodes:\n- Adventure, Sprint, Challange, Stunt, Trackmogrify, Reverse Tag\n\nLevel Editor:\n- Build-in powerful editor that is easy to use/learn (the same editor the devs use to make their levels)\n- Simples 2.0, Particles, Spline roads, Event triggers, Components, Buildings, Teleporters, Biodomes, Customizable skybox/fog/ambient colors/lighting, and lots more!\n\nCustomization:\n- Car hull color, glow color, hull2 color, and sparkle color\n- 2 new vehicles are confirmed to be added before release (one a public car, the other a backer-only car) Both cars will use the same hitbox as the original to avoid screwing with the leaderboard times with different physics\n\nReplayability:\n- Over 2000 workshop level submissions\n- Trackmogrify allows random track generation simply by entering a seed and watching it generate!\n\nReplay system:\n- Watch/race against ghosts offline in any any track that has been played!\n\nAdventure 2.0:\n- Massive update containing a completely new adventure experience, all new/updated music, tons of new level editor assets and components\n- Near-release before Distance leaves early access\n\nCommunity:\n- We have a discord server available where a majority of our community hangs around. Come join us! (look at survivethedistance.com or in the steam discussions for the invite link)\n\nUpdates:\n- This is a passion project by the devs. There are updates to the game and that ill persist post-release for a good while. This game has been in development for 5 years, and been in Early Access for ~3 years. Please give it time, this is an indie team and they are working hard every day to not rush this project and give us the best-quality product they can. Updates are being made. (Some take longer than others, it's just the way it is) Just take a look at the change logs when an update is made, or you can follow the devs on their twitter. Alternativly you can join the Distance discord and keep up-to-date there.\n____________________________________________\n\nHope you find this review helpful, and i am proud to be with such an amazing community and follow the greatest devs on EA. Truly excels at being an Early Access title and feels like a finished product as is.

For being a mac user like me, this runs really well and you barely have to run it on low quality for it to not lag. And that's impressive! I bet it runs even better on windows, too. High speed, great destruction on the cars, well done graphics, heart pounding dubstep, everything is just perfect about this game. Also, this game can work with almost any gamepad! You name it, they can support it. Though a XBOX controller gamepad is mostly recommended. Could you guys just give a support for my steelseries controller?

An adrenaline fueled, hectic experience. I played Nitronic Rush back when it was first released and there is a significant amount of refinement, not only in the game's direction but in the mechanics as well. The story mode isn't long (given it is still in development) but a quick trip to the Steam Workshop will have you overwhelmed with fantastic community designed levels. My only gripe would be the music. Don't get me wrong, it's great but most of the time it just doesn't capture the heat or the energy that you get from playing the game, and at times it kind of dulls the experience a little. All in all, an absolutely spectacular product from Refract.

I do not like most racing games, and I'd also like to point out that Distance is not most racing games. Distance puts you in control of a vehicle that can fly with wings, has jets on all sides, can wall ride, jump, flip, and do anything in between. The controls feel fantastic, the music is amazing, the enviorments are immersive, huge and explorable. \n\nThere is an adventure mode that acts like the tutorial and tells the story of the game (which is actually quite good, especially when you realize it's being told through a race track), however the real fun begins when you enter the challenge maps of the game. The developers respect player skill and are not afraid to give you a real challenge. Add in community levels and steam workshop, and you'll have replayability and new maps forever. \n\nI can't love this game enough, if you feel on the edge about it, I'd highly reccomend trying out Nitronic Rush. It is free and it is the predecessor to Distance. It functions relatively the same as Distance, and will give you a feel for what you can expect from Distance.

As some of you know this is from a concept that was created in college by the guys, it was called nitronic rush.

As soon as i got into playing the visuals are spot on, the gameplay is extremely fun and addicting and the overall concept is great. Yes, then i discovered the mechanics: Boosting, jumping, flying and wall jumping; crazy stuff like that!\n\n[h1] THE POTENTIAL [/h1]\n\nI can't even begin to explain the potential this game has, at the moment it actually is decently polished but not many official levels and progression pointers and goals, i'd imagine that to be fun. But there is the community making levels and there is a powerful level editor, it's nice that it has that. There is the Adventure mode which is short at the moment (and there isn't a story to it really). Arcade mode which has various gamemodes in it to play your community levels and official levels. \n\n[h1] So, do i reccomend this game? [/h1]\n\nYes, i do. If you'd like to support it at it's current state i'd definetley reccomend for you to purchase it.

Throughout the adventure you seem to move from a potentially busy vibrant city into a dark lost society. If you put your imagination to it I am sure you can come up with some interesting scenarios as to what happened to this world!\n\n[b]Arcade:[/b]\nArcade mode is where it really gets interesting. There are a few modes to choose from:\n\n[b]Sprint:[/b] Basically get to the end of the track as quickly as possible to get your name on the global scoreboards. Go through checkpoints to prevent the car from overheating. Reset if you screw up too badly and push yourself to the limit to gain the fastest time possible! (this mode counts towards global leaderboards).\n\n[b]Stunt:[/b] Try to do as many flips, flights and wall rides as possible within the time limit to gain the greatest score. This is played in an arena mode with plenty of ramps and heights to get the maximum amount of flips in before that inevitable landing, just be sure to land upright or the subsequent landing may be more of an explosion!\n\n[b]Reverse Tag:[/b] There is an orb which must be collected. Each player will compete to steal the orb from the other player. Whoever can keep the orb for the longest time will win. This is played in an arena style map which has plenty of cheeky little areas to try and trip your competitors up.\n\n\n[b]Workshop:[/b]\nFrom the date of writing there are over 200 community created tracks to try out. There are different tracks designed for each individual mode. Each track varies in length and difficulty with some sprints taking less than a minute, to first time tries clocking in at over 10 minutes.\n\nOne problem with the workshop currently is everyone must have downloaded the community maps themselves, they don't just download from the host. There is however a quick solution to this on the workshop with a \"subscribe to all mods\" tool which allows you to instantly subscribe to all the tracks available.\n\n[b]Track Editor:[/b]\nThe game ships with its own in game track editor which provides all the tools you need to create some really exciting / wacky tracks which you can then upload to the Steam workshop and let others race and rate. There is massive room for some truly exciting and unique track experiences.\n\n[b]Leaderboards:[/b]\nThe leaderboards are what help to make this game what it is. You can see times set by the top 1000 in the global community but also filter down to personal best times and friends. \nIf like me you want to be at the top of your friends leaderboards you should definitely give this game a try!\n\n[b]Controller:[/b]\nThe front of Steam says the game has partial controller support although while using my Xbox controller it seemed to work 100% fine, I was able to re-bind keys however I liked, vibration function works no problems.\n\nIf you prefer to use the keyboard then this is fine too, again it has 100% re-bind capabilities.\n\n--------- [b] CONCLUSION ---------[/b]\n\nAs mentioned at the start this is the best Early Access I have played in a long time. It works flawlessly without any crashes and very few if any bugs. One issue I have noticed is when watching another person finish a race it can get stuck playing the same loop, however this isn't game breaking and when they finish / the timer runs out the game will continue as usual.\n\nOne small problem with the community maps is every person wanting to race online must have individually downloaded the maps. They don't download from the host. There is however a quick solution to this on the workshop with a \"subscribe to all mods\" tool which allows you to instantly subscribe to all the tracks available.\n\nThe game is still in beta and already I would say 8.5/10 I can't give it more because the adventure mode is not yet finished and the issues with online downloading of maps. But it is well on its way to becoming a fantastic game which could give hours of fun and frustration!\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxq5m4A3hVk", "timestamp_created": 1418828655, "timestamp_updated": 1418828814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13413208": {"recommendationid": "13413208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019075550", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484273391}, "language": "english", "review": "Was a kickstarter back for quite a while.

Five Stars!\n\nIf you're thinkin about getting it, get it! \n\nThis is actually my first time posting a review of any kind, and that should say something.  I saw this game on the store page, bought it, and it was worth every penny.  This game is perfect for someone who is looking for a racing game but wants to step away from the traditional stick-shifter, and move in the direction of a sci-fi obstacle course where your pilot a highly advanced supercar equipped for land, air, and zero gravity travel!  It made me think of Sonic All-Stars and maybe the baby of Kario Kart and Portal or something.  I've never seen anything like it, very original gameplay and you can even make your own levels.  I just recently purchased the game and I've spent seven hours on it.  Refract did an amazing job and I wish them the best of luck! If I could make a request for the next update; pick up items for versus style gameplay, and a shuffle option for maps! That would be pretty radical.\n\nOne last thing, the introduction video was very exciting and I actually saw a huge potential for storyline development.  I'm eager to see where it goes, I know you guys won't disappoint!\n\nP.s., It was awesome.\n\n\nEdit: I noticed the design for the car would actually be usable design for an all terrain sports car.

The other is challenge, it's like sprint but shorter and no respawn, so prepare to fail quite a lot. There is also stunt, the least attractive game mode this far, where you are just suppose to do different stunts to gather a high score. There is also a multiplayer only game mod with the name \"Tag\" or something like that.\n\nTag works like the classic child game where one or more are chasing the others trying to \"tag\" them, however here it's the other way around, everyone is chasing the one with the forcefield, and you win when you've held the \"tag\" for three minutes. Quite fun. \n\nThe car is customizable when it comes to colours, I do hope they add more customization though, since it's always a plus. But for a early access game this game works really well! It never crashes unless you've tabbet it for quite some time. \n\nAll maps have a high score screen where you are not only competing against your old record, but also against all other players who play this game. I would love if they added something like Trials where you can see how the different players have been driving, because sometimes you do suspect cheating.\n\nI really recommend this, one of my best buys this year!", "timestamp_created": 1418666263, "timestamp_updated": 1418666263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13378507": {"recommendationid": "13378507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058093092", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446138981}, "language": "english", "review": "I have decided to rewrite my review from scratch and delete the older one as I have now played more of the game and can give a better account of my experience. \n\nThe good:\n\nI love the setting of the game. I like the Tron-esque visuals, the throbbing lights that dance to the rhythm of the beat, and the accompanying soundtrack. Overall, the atmosphere is done well and delivers on what you see in the screenshots. \n\nThe handling of the cars are also pretty good, and a keyboard is a viable alternative (some even say a keyboard is better than a controller in this game). The main driving controls are easy to learn, though it may take some time to fully grasp the controls to do 90- and 180-degree flips, as well as the controls for the flying sections. \n\nLevel editors. I have not explored this myself yet but I have played a number of user created tracks and it seems like a pretty good and functional feature. \n\nThe not so good:\n\nMultiplayer is \u201cbroken\u201d in the sense that the game condones \u201ccheating\u201d. Some people may like this, but I don\u2019t. Basically, all the top racers and top time in the leaderboards are set by people who fly far off the racing track and find their own shortcuts (through buildings etc). I personally hope that the developers can consider adding a separate mode that somehow mandates you cannot leave the track (via checkpoints for example). \n\nGame isn\u2019t properly optimized well at the moment, though the developers acknowledge this and have come on record to say it will be improved. Still, be wary that you may need to turn down quite a number of settings on a card that exceeds the recommended requirements and even then not get 60fps all the time (I have a GTX 750 SC for reference). Performance in multiplayer is much worse than single player.\n\nThe adventure mode at present has zero story to it. It is a glorified tutorial at best. I find it hard to believe there will be a story by the time v1.0 releases since the devs say more levels are to be added, but in the 45 mins or so of content that there already is, there is nothing like that. Still, adventure mode is a must to grasp the basics of the game to move on into multiplayer.\n\nThe difficulty is kind of high at present, and it may turn off many people. It would be good if the developers can allow the community to rate tracks with different difficulties, especially those that are user created. Would be also nice for the developers to create some \u201cnormal\u201d racing maps that don\u2019t have so many outrageously difficult sections!\n\nThere are other broken multiplayer features. If you join a lobby with a user created track, the game just tells you that you have a missing level, but doesn\u2019t prompt you to download it. Also, if you finish a race early, you may have to wait for minutes. Would be nice if there is only a 30 or 60 seconds window from the time the winner finishes before moving on. \n\nThere are a few others things that should be in I believe. A single player mode that allows you to race against CPU AI (currently, you can only do speedruns in single player).

SO much. \n\nUPDATE:\nAfter playing more, I've realized that there is some severe problems in terms of taxing a GPU. for example, on some levels I get sub 50 fps though I clearly should run that slow considering I have an overclocked Radeon 7970 that can run almost anything at 60 fps no problem. this game shouldn't be an exeption especially with it not that stunning graphics.

This may even be my favorite racer of 2014 (Although, to be fair, there weren't too many racers in 2014). The track editor seems really confusing to me, but apparently not to others because the tracks on workshop are ridiculous. Also, 3 hours may not seem like a lot of time for this game, but considering the short \"campaign,\" most of it is workshop levels. Of course, keep in mind this is still an EA game and there are bugs (like being able to take advantage of flight and skip entire portions of track) but overall this is a fun, refreshing game. \n\nDisclaimer: I came into the game with absolutely no expectations. I had never heard of the studio or the previous game.\n\nSummary: Distance is a game that's reminicent of a combination of Trackmania and the Hotwheels stunt games. Even in this state, it's very polished. My one complaint thus far is the lack of content, however, like Trackmania, this game offers a full fledged track editor even this early in development. If you like survival racing games but you're concerned of the shortness of the campaign, wait until the full launch. If you like the aformented but enjoy creating content yourself/playing other player's content, just get this now.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay consists of survival racing, where you manuever your car around obstacles and flip the car to reach other surfaces. Very fast paced and fluid. Only complaint thus far is sometimes it felt like the car flipped too slowly, but it's minor. Also want to note the attention to detail here. When a lazer cuts the car in half, it actually feels like that half is missing and the car is considerably harder to drive.\n\nGraphics: Game looks pretty nice even now. There are more graphical options than most AAA titles that come to PC. Optimization is okay right now. On a 760, 3770, and 8GB of RAM, I'm getting 30-60 fps.\n\nStory: There is a story, but frankly I skipped the cutscenes.", "timestamp_created": 1418443386, "timestamp_updated": 1418958898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547362", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13337990": {"recommendationid": "13337990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048554394", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512253195}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Ladies and gentlemen, this is what an Early Access game should look like. [/h1]\n\nI bought [b] Distance [/b] because I wanted to play a polished version of [b] Nitronic Rush [/b] (which is its predecessor), but now, the question is, did I get that? The answer is... yes. Not only did I get it, I got far beyond my expectations. This game is [b] Nitronic Rush 2.0 [/b] and hot dang, is it worth the money. It's stunning visuals and flawless gameplay alone make it worth the money. After the disaster that was last game I bought that happened to be Early Access (StarForge), I was a little paranoid, but once I swallowed my fears and picked this up I realized that this is a shining example of an Early Access game done right. While in its current state it may not have the most content (The actual campaign itself only lasted me about 45 minutes) doesn't mean it isn't worth the buy. The game itself in its current build is incredibly stable and beautifully optimized. I was able to run it on ultra while managing to stay at a constant 60 FPS with no problems, which is rare for an Early Access title. Now most importantly, the gameplay. The gameplay itself is incredibly enjoyable. Anyone who has played and enjoyed [b] Nitronic Rush [/b] will agree. Basically its parkour cars. Carkour? I don't know. Anyway, driving in a long Tron esc environment with everything out to get you is amazing. It goes as far as standard-y obstacle-y road blocks, to giant, glowing CIRCULAR SAWS, to laser beams all trying to kill you in one happy package. Speaking of the laser beams, they are by far the most enticing obstacles I've ever seen. Whenever you come into contact with one your vehicle will get cut accordingly. Not even joking. It's like Metal Gear Solid Revengeance: Car edition. Whenever I saw one I always had a little debate in my mind, \"should I just risk it and get cut in half just so I could look awesome driving a now cut in half car?\" (the answer was almost always yes). This made the game enjoyable and added quite a bit of variety. There is even a bit where there is zero gravity, which for me was a magical experience to be able to just admire the graphics while I float through space. This game is worth every penny. Get it.\n\nReview summed up:\n\nIs really good.

I'm not big into racing games, but watching the trailer wowed me enough to buy this one without hesitation, and I don't regret it. I was psyched to see the game run perfectly on my Nvidia Surround setup without any tweaking, and this made the experience all the more immersive.\n\nI started with Adventure mode which moves you through the levels, learning the controls a bit at a time. For the most part, they're very easy to pick up on, and extremely fun to put into action. You can boost your car for added speed, jump over obstacles, and even sprout \"wings\" and start flying, for limited distances. You're also able to flip the car 90 or 180 degrees onto other tracks. All of this while racing at breakneck speeds on a psychedelic course full of deadly lasers, blades, and other obstacles. Checkpoints cool your car down and save your progress, and there are some other cool effects that I won't spoil. The game kept me constantly surprised and I was on the edge of my seat, thrilled after surviving obstacle after obstacle, going faster than ever. It's seriously exhilerating to play. The soundtrack only adds to this - driving beats that match the style and pace of the game perfectly. I would like to find out where I could buy the soundtrack, though I was able to find a previous album for the original game on the artist's Bandcamp page. Really excellent music!\n\nThe one downside that I've found to this game is that some of the flips you have to do are pretty unforgiving. I thought I was doing well with them in one particularly flip-heavy track, only to reach a point where I died dozens of times trying to get it right. Gravity was just not allowing me to reach the other side of the track before falling into oblivion, and I think it's because I had lost my speed from earlier in the track, so continuing from the checkpoint wasn't working. I had to back way up and speed up from there, and then I made it. Throughout the levels, there are a few particularly difficult moments like this, and while I've gotten better at them, they can still take you out of the exhileration and into frustration, if only until you get past them. But just like any game, you learn a bit more every time your car explodes, and mastering those techniques and pulling it off feels really, really good. I would boil it down to this - if you think you would enjoy the survival part of \"survival racing\", than this game is for you. If the thought of watching your car explode over and over while you lose any chance of beating your best time sounds annoying, you may want to look elsewhere. But you'd be missing out!\n\nNot all of the traps are a bother. The lasers and blades are awesome. Not too hard to avoid with some deft maneuvering, and even if you do get sliced, it's pretty cool when your car is cut in half but you still make it through the checkpoint (and your car regenerates). Great concept, and it adds to the excitement of the racing by making you think, how the hell did I just survive that?\n\nI've started on the time trials and those have been fun too. There are also a few other modes, plus custom levels that others have built, and that you can build yourself. I look forward to checking those out. For $16, I feel this game is a steal. Definitely has a lot of replay value and would be a fun game to share when friends come over. I'm happy to see that the devs plan to release this on PS4 next year.

The sequel to Nitronic Rush is fast, intense, and a joy to play.\n\nThe graphics in this game are glorious. The tron-like style is perfect for this type of game and the amount of color on the screen is a treat for your eyes. The cars look great, with the ability to edit the car's color and glow - making each unique to the certain player when playing online. The graphics are also optimized well, making it run on lower-end machines. \n\nDistance at it's core is a survival racing game. Throughout the levels, you can do things like jump, boost, twist and fly. The levels have a directed path, but with the ability to fly - it adds an extra element of exploration and freedom. The game as of now has a strong amount of game modes. Adventure is Distance's story mode, it's short and doesn't really have a clear story; the levels are well designed and are fun. It's more so of a tutorial the first few levels which is good for those who have no clue what they are doing. In these levels, there are ramps, lasers, twisting roads, sawblades, and other things there to kill and confuse you. It requires a solid amount of skill, the boost has the ability to overheat and flying requires boost to actually use. It's a nice balance that doesn't feel restrictive. The sense of speed is fantastic, speeding past 3 lasers then twisting, dodging a pole and then flying over the sawblades just making it towards the regeneration checkpoint is exhilarating. There are also a bunch of other game modes as well - Sprint (time trial), Speed and Style (Time + Tricks), Challenge (Mini Challenge Levels), and Stunt (Tricks); there is also a reverse tag mode that I have yet to play. The amount of game modes are fresh and give players more to play. Lastly, is the integration of Steam Workshop. The community have already made some fantastic levels, one highlight is the replica of Rainbow Road from Mario Kart. The amount of levels and the quality of those are only going to grow. It's a match made in heaven. \n\nThe audio is solid. It's sharp and clear. Where the game's sound shine though is the music. It immerses you in the game and only boosts the intense nature of the game. \n\nThe controls are extremely smooth and responsive. I personally use a gamepad. If you do choose to use a gamepad, try using the triggers for both boost and jump as things can get awkward sometimes. \n\nWith the amount of developer-made levels, gamemodes, online play, and community levels - there is tons to do already. The best part is, the game is going to keep on growing. If you live fast, survival racing games, you must get your hands on this.

Speaking of which...\n\nStory:\n+A visual adventure with great portrayal  of mood\n+Still in beta, so improvements and overall increase in narrative are likely\n+Music conveys most of the message\n\nMusic:\n+I love it\n+You want more explanation? Okay\n+Electronica, progressive house, and dubstep fused together.\n+Sound good?\n+You bet\n\nLasting appeal:\n+Workshop support for hundreds of levels\n+Still in beta, expect more content!\n-As of now, lacking enough to keep you busy for more than a couple days. Will improve with time most likely\n\nOverall, team Nitronic (Now known as Refract Studios) is raising the standard for the racing genre.\nMuch like Sonic the Hedgehog gave the platformer genre a faster, fresher experience to the platformer genre, Distance is the new way to experience the high speed thrills of a racing game.\nThe Distance Beta gets a whopping\n9/10 for Pre Release\nAnd a predicted\n10/10 GoTY for 2015 racing enthusiasts.", "timestamp_created": 1418341419, "timestamp_updated": 1418448768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13322988": {"recommendationid": "13322988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008330088", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448226542}, "language": "english", "review": "Quality of early access game:\nVery high, the devs keep adding content and have the game already very polished from the get-go so you don't feel ripped off that it took them forever to finish the game.\nThis game has full workshop support!\n\nGlitches:\nTo be honest, it already feels like a finished game, it just has a few glitches here or there that are mostly User interface.\nThere IS currently a very obnoxious part of the game where you have to go to the workshop > collections > all collections and subscribe to all of them so the people hosting the multiplayer games can host pretty much anything.\nThis is the result of the fact that downloading host maps in-game is currently not possible.\n\nHave you played Nitronic Rush?\nYes?\u00a0\nThen this is a better, faster, more polished version of that with multiplayer, fun new gametypes and the best damn level editor you've ever used.\n\nHaven't played Nitronic Rush?\nDistance is an (currently as of writing this) unfinished early access racing game by the digipen grads that made Nitronic Rush as their capstone project.\n\nGameplay:\u00a0\nYou drive a car that seems to be a mix of an electronic sports car and a jet pack, as the car itself can not only fly but also has small thrusters on every section of the vehicle which are 100% necessary as the roads will end suddenly and this forces the player to literally jump, spin, and twist to another track section. The controls are tight and feel satisfying when you pull off a trick or make a perfect landing.\nIt's about going fast and avoiding MANY obstacles, which can range from pretty much anything and everything. If you get hit by a laser the game will remove parts of your vehicle realistic, and you can keep going to try and rebuild at the next checkpoint, it's often hilarious!\n\nGraphics:\nwow, just wow. The game is absolutely beautiful. I haven't seen such amazing reflection (specular) mapping on anything in video games in, ever. The game has some CRAZY filters and lighting that results in areas having feeling to them. I.E. a VIBRANT red area that is very in your face with it's obstacles will make you tense up and concentrate as you dodge as much as you can. While a cool blue zone, even if it has more obstacles, might make the game feel a bit more relaxed.\nEven in multiplayer the game is very atmospheric, allowing creators of custom maps to be extremely creative.\n\nStory?\nThere IS a story, it's very abstract. Not as in it's trying to be artsy, instead it goes for a more vague, mysterious and atmospheric feel. Without spoiling anything, I think you'll enjoy the story if you like video games that don't shove the story down your throat. Do keep in mind, as it is early access, the story is not currently complete and only has about ten levels. Which will actually take you a good hour or so to complete them all, much longer if it's your first time playing it.\u00a0\n\nMultiplayer:\u00a0\nYes, it has multiplayer. Currently players cannot collide with each-other. Instead every player shows up as a real-time ghost, which surprisingly doesn't actually make the game less fun.\nThere are a few issues here or there unfortunately, as the physics for the game are connected to the frames-per-second, you may collide with walls or pieces of track even though you thought you landed just fine. Do keep in mind this has happened to me only two times in the over a hundred multiplayer races I\u2019ve driven.\nThe other game modes are pretty fun too, reverse tag is just a big game of keep-away, It's pretty fun, and results in some silly moments.\n\nDifficulty:\nThis game is has a very subtle difficulty curve. It starts off easy and explains mechanics as you go by, then it gets surprisingly difficult. When you finally get used to the difficulty of the game it semi-mellows out to the point of making it easier but still challenging. Once you get good at it, you'll start trying new shortcuts and attempt tricks to skip parts of tracks. The custom maps however range from incredibly easy, to insane in how difficult they are. If you get a large amount of them and play with some people (or friends if you have those) you'll have a blast.\n\nConclusion:\nDistance is fun, REALLY fun. It breaks many of the assumptions we have for racing games and makes the game feel fresh and new with it's style and feel of originality. It's very atmospheric, and that personally is very appealing. The addition of multiplayer and custom map support is genius and makes the game feel fresh almost indefinitely. It may not be finished but it sure feels like a complete game at this point.\u00a0\n\n9.5/10 One of my new favorite games. Can't wait for them to finish it!\n\n\nP.S.

Even the lowest graphic settings makes the game look pretty good. The visuals are also very very optimized, guaranteed to run on almost any machine, which seems to be quite rare with these Early Access Games.

The music fits perfectly with everything. From the high octane Drum&Bass tracks to the chilled out electro you'll defenitley find yourself bobbing your head to the beat. Amazing soundtrack (If only they separately sold it)\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\nI personally play with a gamepad but keyboard and mouse feels excellent with little to no complaints. However it's prefered to play the game with a controller/gamepad to get the full feel of the controls. With it everything feels so much smoother and I also recomend using the advanced controls for more finer flips tricks and stunts! Wonderful controls\n\n[b] Multiplayer [/b]\nThe \"Distance\" community is some of the best I've run into. I havent encountered a single problem with the people. The multiplayer gamemodes consist of a simple racing mode, to reverse tag (my personal favorite) and a challenge/stunt mode. All of which you can sink hours into, and theres even more gamemodes to come!\n\n[b] Level Editor / Steam Workshop [/b]\nPossibly the coolest part of this game. The level editor is so easy to pick up and learn and you can just upload to the workshop with a press of a button. And getting maps is even eaiser!\n\n[b] Overall thoughts [/b]\nA MUST BUY. You have a unique racer combined with an explosive soundtrack, breath taking visuals, a friendly community, and a wonderful level editor.

Les graphismes, \u00e9pur\u00e9s, sont tr\u00e8s jolis, et le jeu est tr\u00e8s fluide. Logique, car la richesse des textures n'est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e qu'en style \"n\u00e9on\" comme tron. Les circuits rappellent un peu Trackmania, mais avec des obstacles mortels en plus. La voiture est capable de planer, mais pour un temps limit\u00e9. De m\u00eame, le boost est limit\u00e9 dans le temps, et une surchauffe prolong\u00e9e se solde par l'explosion du v\u00e9hicule.\n\nLe mode aventure propose une difficult\u00e9 croissante \u00e0 chaque circuit qui se succ\u00e8de, et fait d\u00e9couvrir de nouvelles commandes. Sur les circuits les plus simples, la prise en main est relativement ais\u00e9e. Cependant, \u00e0 mesure que l'on progresse, l'intuitif c\u00e8de le pas \u00e0 la difficult\u00e9 de ma\u00eetriser le v\u00e9hicule. Surtout qu'\u00e0 certains endroits, on a du mal \u00e0 se rep\u00e9rer, et savoir par o\u00f9 passer. En outre, il m'est pour ma part encore difficile de faire effectuer une rotation du v\u00e9hicule sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9, pour pousuivre sur un mur vertical qui devient alors la suite du circuit (la cam\u00e9ra effectue une rotation d'elle-m\u00eame pour se retrouver en vue classique). Etant donner qu'une touche permet d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer, une autre le boost, une pour sauter, et si l'on rappuie dessus planer, sans compter celles pour effectuer une rotation sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9, sans oublier de maintenir celle pour tourner \u00e0 droite ou \u00e0 gauche en m\u00eame temps, s'av\u00e8re un exercice d\u00e9licat, et se tromper de combinaison de touches est sanctionn\u00e9 par un cuisant \u00e9chec. La principale difficult\u00e9 du titre me semble se trouver \u00e0 ce niveau.\n\nEn conclusion, le jeu semble prometteur, et la dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 du joueur \u00e0 trouver les bonnes encha\u00eenements des boutons de la manette mise \u00e0 rude \u00e9preuve. Je pense que cela n\u00e9cessite un apprentissage qui pourrait en d\u00e9go\u00fbter plus d'un. Il s'agit tout de m\u00eame d'un titre \u00e0 suivre.

The devs are receptive and communicate regularly on the official Discord. This in and of itself blows my mind, because I myself have actually spoken to the devs on many different occasions, which to me is like talking with celebrities.\n\n2. The level editor. I cannot stress this point enough: There is a large community of people in this game who create quality content on a regular basis. If you go through the workshop for this game, you'll see what I mean. \n\n3. New features. Over the lifetime of this game, features have been suggested and not only implemented, but implemented well. From its' early beta to now, we have seen the introduction of a complex particle system, retexturable simple objects such as cubes, cones, triangles etc., an animator feature, and most recently customizable skyboxes. \n\nEven if you're not a racing fan, I highly recommend checking this game out.

It reminds me of the classic Trackmania which I loved. It is really addictive trying to master a track by shaving off fractions of a second on every corner or just doing crazy stunts while avoiding over-the-top obstacles. Here is my experience with the Beta...\n\n[b]Driving:[/b] Responsive, arcade controls for driving, jumping and flying. The game works well with a gamepad and provides sensible layouts for many controllers. It would be nice to have a button to reset the camera though. I like the way the car handles mid-air maneuvering. Sometimes collisions with obstacles can feel a little bit off. I also wish there were more obstacles that you can interact with, like the lasers - how about destructible surfaces or gravity fields?\n\n[b]Aesthetics:[/b] The world looks like it was partly inspired by things like Tron, but feels much more gritty. It features impressive lighting effects and a great soundtrack. You can get an amazing sense of speed through the visual and sound effects, combined with the track design.\n\n[b]Story Mode:[/b] A good way to get accustomed to the controls and obstacles, as it has a very nice learning curve. It sets the mood with some awesome set-piece moments that don't feel tacked on.\n\n[b]Tracks:[/b] The track you choose determines if you are playing a race against the clock (Sprint), a hardcore platformer (Challenge), a Tony Hawk-like playground (Stunt) or all at once (Speed & Style - my favorite). The various tracks often allow multiple paths which require some skilled driving and creativity while making split-second decisions. If you get off-track, there is usually a way to recover. The ability to make your own tracks in the editor or download community ones gives this game longevity. \n\n[b]Multiplayer:[/b] I have not tried the different multiplayer modes yet but I am eager to get into it now that the game is on Early Access.", "timestamp_created": 1418180191, "timestamp_updated": 1418180497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604511", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13300990": {"recommendationid": "13300990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020881462", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423784241}, "language": "english", "review": "Distance is hands down the most visceral, fast paced racer I've ever played.

The theme of the levels is fantastic (almost Tron-esque), and the music goes with the environment very well.  Light will pulse along with the music, and the overfall feeling is just fabulous.\n-Excellent handling.  The cars handle beautifully, and really are easy to drive but hard to master.  Mechanics such as boosting (which has a heating system a la Motorstorm), jumping, and flying are all implemented very well.  The levels often utilize these too, creating for a unique driving expirience.\n-Challenge.  Distance is fun for just your average racer, but it has a suprising depth for speedrunners.\n-Level editor.  Have not used this much personally, but you can see by other people's fantastic creations that it works well.\n\nCons:\n-Content.  The game's in beta, so I can't be too harsh here.  However, at the time of writing this you can complete the story in an hour or so.  \n-Level editor.  While very robust, it's not particularly easy to use.

The game is essentially an arcade racer that focuses on avoiding obstacles and quick reflexes. It has a lot of very interesting ideas and mechanics, including flight (yeah, your car can fly), interesting play on gravity (drive on walls and ceiling), and some environmental hazards that are quite unique in how they can affect your performance.\n\nThe game excels at giving the player the sensation of speed, but also keeps him/her on their toes as the tracks are always littered with piles of hazards. When you first jump into Distance, some parts of the game may get frustrating at first, and your first flight will probably end in tragedy. There is a learning curve, but if you can get over that hump, this game can feel incredibly satisfying as you learn to needle thread through obstacles, and flipping your car just at the right moment, you'll find that \"holy shit\" moment more than once.\n\nMy only real complaint is how the game handles gravity some times. As mentioned previously, you can flip your car to drive on ceilings and walls, but the game some times doesn't know what to do with the car if you don't jump or flip exactly as the game wants you to. Instead of making a landing that looked perfectly reasonable, you fly off into the nether, then your car blows up... I hope the developers can make some adjustments in the future and tweak the gravity to be more consistent and user friendly.\n\nDistance is in Early Access, but unlike many in the same program Distance feels very complete. It already features a full and robust options and graphics settings, level editor with over 150 user made maps available already, local and online multiplayer, and multiple ways to play the campaign maps. Distance has raised the bar of what gamers can expect from early access games, and this is a good thing.\n\nOverall Distance is a very enjoyable arcade racer that will have you pulling your hair out one minute, and in the next, your nose will be touching the screen with focus and determination. It's a hell of a ride. \n\nPros:\n- Great visuals and audio\n- Fast and visceral gameplay\n- Challenging\n- Tons of interesting ideas\n- Feels extremely complete for an early access (Beta 3297)\n\nCons:\n- Gravity feels wonky at times\n- Can be frustrating at first", "timestamp_created": 1418140238, "timestamp_updated": 1418140238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13294937": {"recommendationid": "13294937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027326625", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 21740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512170532}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect survival racing game.

I loved Nitronic Rush and Team Nitronic (now Refract Studios) have definitely lived up to, and gone way past the fun and excitement of it with Distance. I've been in since the beta, and so far I've loved every bit of it.\n\nWhile this game is in early access, I highly recommend it even if the game never updates again (which it will by the way, Refract are cool guys)\n\nFirst, the level editor: Steam Workshop support and a built in level editor is a game changer for any game, and this one especially. The editors advanced features reminds me of such things as Autodesk Maya, but can be simplified down to the Portal 2 in-game map creator. Tracks in the editor snap together and can be automatically resized. They act like splines and the track automatically is generated along them, so you do not have to worry about that at all. Everything is very easy yet advanced at the same time which will make some really brilliant levels (and has already infact).\n\nMultiplayer: This was the most requested feature from Nitronic Rush, and they've implemented it right down to the core of the game. It is done extremely well and I couldn't ask for anything more (well, maybe auto downloading of workshop levels to clients who dont have). It's really fun with mates or strangers on any of the modes: sprint, speed and style, challenge and reverse tag (shame they removed the football gamemode though).\n\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere of the game is clear from the start and I think it works really well. There's less of the really bright colours from Nitronic and the announcer is gone (for now at least). The world is dark and gloomy but mixed with flashing lights and exciting music makes for an interesting yet enjoyable experience. The soundtrack itself is incredible, Torcht and the team really have outdone themselves this time, it's much better than Nitronic Rush's music (and for the record, I loved Nitronic Rush's music).\n\nThere are only a few things that I think should be worked. The first is optional realtime portals, since right now they work like a static 360* image wrapped around it - but don't get me wrong they look great and aren't noticeable at high speeds, of course this should be off by default and as an advanced graphics option like realtime reflections since they would require a beefy GPU. Another thing would be mod support for custom gamemode types. My biggest issue currently is no mouse support at all, not even for menus - but I'm sure it's planned (we are in Early Access right now, after all), but these are more like feature requests than actual issues - and I'm certain Refract has more up their sleeve for us, so we'll see.\n\nConclusion: Get this game if you love any of these:\nA.

Digne successeur de Nitronic Rush ?\n\nCrowdfund\u00e9 \u00e0 hauteur de 161,981 $ sur Kickstarter en Novembre 2012, les ingr\u00e9dients de base sont simple pour ce jeu de course et survie : une ambiance futuriste \u00e0 la fois classieuse et l\u00e9g\u00e8rement psych\u00e9d\u00e9lique \u00e0 la Tron, une soundtrack \u00e9lectro de haute vol\u00e9e mais surtout un gameplay aux petits oignons. Car outre le level design audacieux des circuits, c\u2019est dans les capacit\u00e9s de votre v\u00e9hicule que Distance a s\u00e9duit le joueur pas plus accroc que \u00e7a aux jeux de voiture que je suis. \n\nParlons donc des contr\u00f4les, tout d\u2019abord, le jeu se joue imp\u00e9rativement \u00e0 la manette, je d\u00e9conseille fortement de jouer au clavier, vous allez vite comprendre pourquoi.\n\nEn effet, dans Distance, votre voiture, si on peut encore l\u2019appeler comme \u00e7a, peut se booster, faire des bonts, voler, ou encore effectuer vrilles et autres manoeuvres improbables gr\u00e2ce aux propulseurs situ\u00e9s sur le dessus de la carrosserie. Si vous gardez le boost ou que vous volez trop longtemps, le v\u00e9hicule finit par surchauffer puis exploser, et pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer de l\u2019\u00e9nergie, il vous faudra r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement passer les checkpoints ou faire des figures de style.\n\nAjoutez \u00e0 cela l\u2019adh\u00e9sivit\u00e9 de l\u2019ensemble des surfaces planes du jeu, on se retrouve avec des circuits totalement WTF, et, pour avoir test\u00e9, je peux vous dire que sur \u00e9cran g\u00e9ant le tout rend extr\u00eamement bien. J\u2019ai d\u2019ailleurs h\u00e2te de voir ce que \u00e7a donne en 3D.\n\nBref c\u00f4t\u00e9 Gameplay, et pour un jeu de course arcade comme celui ci on parle donc vraiment de l\u2019essentiel, Distance est une vraie r\u00e9ussite. Les contr\u00f4les \u00e0 la manette r\u00e9pondent parfaitement bien, l\u2019impression de vitesse est l\u00e0 et les sensations aussi. \n\nMais qu\u2019en est il du reste ?\n\nLe jeu propose plusieurs modes de course en solo et un mode aventure, pour le moment celui-ci s\u2019apparente plut\u00f4t \u00e0 un long tutorial avec quelques passages d\u2019ambiance tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ussi mais n\u2019apportant pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments sc\u00e9naristiques explicites. Cela va sans dire, ce mode n\u2019est pas encore termin\u00e9, et Refract nous annonce quelque chose de relativement bien travaill\u00e9 avec des circuits ouverts permettant au joueurs de choisir diff\u00e9rents chemins afin de joindre course et exploration. Sur le papier c\u2019est tentant, mais pour l\u2019instant je n\u2019ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vraiment convaincu par l\u2019aspect exploration de Distance. Bien que son monde soit immersif et myst\u00e9rieux avec ses zones infect\u00e9es visuellement tr\u00e8s impressionnantes, on ne se sent jamais vraiment dans un monde ouvert favorisant l\u2019exploration mais plut\u00f4t un grand circuit \u00e0 plusieurs chemins plus ou moins rapides.\n\nPour l\u2019heure donc, le mode aventure de Distance est un excellent tutorial vou\u00e9 \u00e0 se transformer en une v\u00e9ritable exp\u00e9rience solo dot\u00e9e d\u2019un sc\u00e9nario. Il faudra donc attendre pour juger r\u00e9ellement cette partie du jeu.\n\nQuoi d\u2019autre alors ?\n\nSi vous poss\u00e9dez 2 manettes r\u00e9jouissez-vous ! Distance peut se jouer en \u00c9cran partag\u00e9 ! Une forme de multijoueurs qui tend \u00e0 disparaitre sur PC, la pr\u00e9sence de cette fonctionnalit\u00e9 est donc vraiment appr\u00e9ciable, surtout quand on veut mettre une taule \u00e0 un pote en live.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 multijoueurs en ligne, Distance se distingue par ses quelques modes tr\u00e8s sympathiques dont voici un rapide d\u00e9tail :\nTout d\u2019abord Sprint : Probablement le mode le plus populaire, arriver au bout du circuit en premier, respawn autoris\u00e9 aux checkpoints et collisions activ\u00e9es.\nStunt : Comme le titre l\u2019indique, sur ces circuits sp\u00e9ciaux le joueur au score de cascade le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la partie gagne.\nOn a aussi du Reverse Tag : Probablement mon pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, dans ce mode vous jouez litt\u00e9ralement au loup \u00e0 l\u2019envers. Le premier \u00e0 rester en possession de la balle pendant un temps donn\u00e9 gagne le partie. Les autres joueurs peuvent \u00e9videmment r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la balle en passant \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du porteur.\nEt enfin Challenge : Dans ce mode pour les hommes les vrais, pas de respawn, uniquement des petits circuits tr\u00e8s difficiles, et bien \u00e9videmment le meilleur temps gagne.\n\nMalheureusement pour le moment le jeu \u00e9tant en early access, il n\u2019y a pas beaucoup de joueurs ni de serveurs en ligne, mais \u00e7a viendra j'ai confiance ; de plus jusqu\u2019i\u00e7i la communaut\u00e9 a l\u2019air tr\u00e8s accueillante et m\u2019a un peu rappel\u00e9 Trackmania dans ses premi\u00e8res heures.\n\nPour finir abordons un point qui pour moi fait vraiment la force de Distance et me donne envie d\u2019y repasser r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement : l\u2019\u00e9diteur de niveau. N\u2019\u00e9tant personnellement pas un grand architecte de circuit, je prend surtout mon pied \u00e0 tester les circuits de la communaut\u00e9, et je peux vous dire qu\u2019on a des mecs extr\u00eamement bons, le niveau de certains circuits d\u00e9passent ais\u00e9ment le pack de base cr\u00e9e par Refract livr\u00e9 avec le jeu. Tout cela \u00e9tant g\u00e9r\u00e9 et class\u00e9 par l\u2019excellent Steam Workshop, t\u00e9l\u00e9charger les meilleurs niveaux de la communaut\u00e9 est simple comme bonjour. Ah et \u00e9videmment tous ces circuits se connectent automatiquement au leaderboards du jeu, enregistrant tous les temps des joueurs de Distance sur Steam\u2026 Bref, le paradis si vous \u00eates du genre comp\u00e9titeur dans l\u2019\u00e2me.\n\nAlors est-ce que je recommande Distance, bien s\u00fbr que oui, foncez, le jeu en vaut la chandelle.", "timestamp_created": 1418122105, "timestamp_updated": 1418122105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13292309": {"recommendationid": "13292309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081137628", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512479627}, "language": "english", "review": "I had a seizure from an orgasmic display of light characteristic of a peacock. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1418121117, "timestamp_updated": 1418121117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13292279": {"recommendationid": "13292279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049134411", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484242289}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub514\uc2a4\ud0c4\uc2a4? \uadf8\ub0e5 \ub2e5\uce58\uace0 \ub2ec\ub9ac\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc778\ub370 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub2e4. \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c.\n\uadfc\ub370 \uc740\uadfc \uc0ac\uc591\ud0c0\uc11c \ub098\uac19\uc740 \uc778\uac04\ud55c\ud150 \uc5c4\uccad \uace4\ub780\ud55c \uac8c\uc784.\n\n\uc0ac\uc6b4\ub4dc \ud2b8\ub799 \ub098\uc624\uba74 \uc0ac\uc57c\uc9d5.\n\n\n+ 2017/01/12\n\uc815\ub9d0 \uc624\ub79c\ub9cc\uc5d0 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud574\ubcf8\ub2e4.\n\ubc14\ub010\uac83\uc740 \uac70\uc758 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \ubc14\ub010\uac74 \ub0b4 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ubfd0\uc774\ub2e4.\n\uc61b\ub0a0\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub178\ub9ac\uc2a4 \ub7ad\ud0b9\uc5d0 \ub4e4\ub824\uace0 \ubc1c\uc545\uc744 \uc37b\ub358\uac8c \uae30\uc5b5\ub098 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ud574\ubd24\ub2e4.\n\uc544\uc9c1 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1418120833, "timestamp_updated": 1484226888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13292144": {"recommendationid": "13292144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043659083", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506563820}, "language": "english", "review": "No aguardo das novidades.", "timestamp_created": 1418119434, "timestamp_updated": 1418119434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519270", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13292091": {"recommendationid": "13292091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009184624", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 4744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508167653}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing racing game with tron-like graphics.

But the first few stages are tutorials getting you accustomed to the game. Even though the game never actually gets any faster, the obstacles thrown in front of you creates a very real feeling of speed. Looking back at my LP, it does seem slow, but when I was playing, it was hectic.\n\nThere is a nice magnetic grip to the car. It's not way overpowered, it's tuned very nicely and helps with all of the crazy go-nuts car flipping to perpendicular roadways. I've already seen some speed runs and I'm excited to see what comes of it.\n\nThere are already UGC for the levels!  http://steamcommunity.com/app/233610/workshop/ Which is NUTS!  Really cool that there is so much UGC on day one when the game launches.  Easily has to be some kind of record. I toyed around with the level editor at the end of my LP and I have no idea what I'm doing, but it seems fairly simple after you get the hotkeys situated in your head.\n\nLastly, I want to mention that there is a very real kernel of a story present in Distance.  Which is kind of odd, because you usually don't expect stories in racing games.  But something is definitely up.\n\nAll told this game is precision racing.\n\nExcellent job from the Nitronic Rush guys!", "timestamp_created": 1418114298, "timestamp_updated": 1418114298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13291661": {"recommendationid": "13291661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041791247", "num_games_owned": 1235, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418149319}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey everybody!

Why ? well we kinda seen it all... haven't we ?\nI mean.. what could they possibly do to impress us ?\n\nWell Distance did it...\nThe game features a fresh take on the trackmania recipe with pleasant Tron-ish graphics.\nThe soundtrack is ok but considering the way the actual game plays ...perhaps something a bit more \"strong\" would have been better.\nYou don't get to chose from X number of cars and have only one which is slightly customizable...a color here and a accent there. Strangely i never felt the need to change my car and i never felt like the game would benefit from a larger variety of vehicles.\n\nSo what is this game all about ?\nDriving as fast as you can and avoiding all obstacles as swiftly and as elegantly as you can.\nThe game features several game modes such as Sprint, Stunt, Speed and Style, Challenge etc...\nWhen it comes to multiplayer we have either split screen (up to 4 players, only one can use keyboard the rest have to use controllers, and in 2 player mode you can chose vertical or horizontal split screen) And then we have the online component for up to 6 players.\nThe game includes a full and very complete level editor and steam workshop support (for which you can already download over 100 tracks). Obviously this can ad a ton of replay value, and if you fancy yourself a hot-shot designer maybe you will make the next \"epic track\".\nThere is even a single player campaign which is used as a tutorial and introduction to this futuristic high tech world (full of sharp/pointy/blunt death-traps that are in your way!).\nDuring this campaign you will learn how to barrel roll, fly, hover and glide in zero gravity.\nThe games main mechanic is the boost. There is no recharge time for it like in most games but you do need to be careful not to overheat or else you go BooM! There are some gates which will either partly or fully cool and regenerate your car for all the damage taken up to that point.\nSomething i really liked was the way the HUD is done, it is mostly integrated into the game elements, which dose lots for the overall feel of the game. There are some who do not like this aspect because at times the HUD is not visible. In my opinion this is not a big deal because a game such as this should be played by.. \"feel\" if that makes any sens...\nAnother design element i really appreciate is the way vibration is done for the 360 controller. This is used to GRADUALLY warn you about how overheated your car is. This means that you can keep your eyes on the track and off your rear bumper. \nWhen it comes to the ugly \"early access\" tag i would go as far as to say that Distance dose not really need it. The single player campaign is not complete and the mouse is not functional in all menus... but these are all the early access \"scars\" i could find in my time with the game.\nI can go on and on about Distance but i don't wanna bore you to much so let's wrap-it up.\n\n\"The Good\"\n-The Track Editor- is not exactly user friendly but its a very complete tool\n-The Graphics- although graphics are a rather subjective topic in my opinion\n-Gameplay- rock solid, pure gaming, no nonsense\n-HUD Design- this is the way a HUD should be done in modern games, yes it has some issues, but its a big step forward from the classic and outdated designs.\n\n\"The Bad\"\n-Only 6 players in online multiplayer...How Could You ?!\n\n\"The Meh\"\n-Soundtrack- I believe there are much better options for a game that plays like this...but again this is a subjective topic by nature.\n\nWhat else is there to say ? \nDrop the clutch, boost to max, juke the spikes and i'll see you at the finish line...if you get there ;)\nFor a clearer view you can watch my first impressions video :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MCy1uIvL5o&list=PLPu1MBLqtny7rnijEzJ3bPSEMepog_rOK", "timestamp_created": 1418112169, "timestamp_updated": 1418112169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518122", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13291510": {"recommendationid": "13291510", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979084213", "num_games_owned": 3573, "num_reviews": 921, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418068959}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Intro[/h1]\n Distance is a racing game where your main goal is to survive and to get to the end of the level. It\u2019s just you and the track. There are no opponents that can run you off the road, but there [i]are[/i] many obstacles. But is it interesting enough to keep you going ?\n \n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n When you first start you\u2019re put into the seat of a futuristic racing car where you have to race across tracks and just survive. Just. Survive.\nBut this is not just an ordinary car. Your car can, besides racing at insane speeds, also turn mid-air, fly, boost and jump. It\u2019s quite spectacular to see your car appear, especially with the HUD being projected on the car itself. There\u2019s no true HUD, because the car will show you all the vital information: the direction you need to go to, your boost meter, your speed-o-meter and a timer. The timer allows you to set a high score and I guess that\u2019s the true goal of the game: repeating a level over and over again and hoping that you get better and beat your previous high score(s).\n\n All of this is done while you complete random tracks. At the end of the track you\u2019re being teleported to a new one where the whole process begins anew. Except that it gets more difficult with each new track. You\u2019re gradually introduced to new gameplay mechanics and after about 10 tracks or so you should know exactly what to do when an object appears out of thin air or when a new part of the track suddenly appears beside or above you. That still doesn\u2019t make it an easy game. On the contrary; it\u2019s a hard game and you have to choose when and how long you want to boost and you have to perfect your flight and trick abilities at the same time. You\u2019ll frequently crash and burn.\nThat\u2019s partly thanks to the game itself (well, the game designers really), because it doesn\u2019t always let you fly whenever you want to. For me personally it was very confusing because I had no idea when I could or couldn\u2019t use it. Whenever I was about to drop down a track I just pressed the button and hoped that it would work. Unfortunately this didn\u2019t work more than half of the time. When you\u2019re playing a game where the goal is to get to the end of the track as quick as possible then you don\u2019t want to have worry about if you\u2019re being able to fly or not whenever you\u2019re about to crash. It\u2019s a small design flaw in my eyes. You either let people know that they will be able to fly during a track or you don\u2019t. You can\u2019t just change things up halfway through a track. But enough about that for now; it\u2019s still an Early Access title and we must have faith that things can still change. And obviously I understand that the developers want to add an extra layer of difficulty to the game this way.\n\n I haven\u2019t yet talked about some of the things that will appear on the track so I\u2019ll try to spend a minute talking about that. The game starts with introducing ramps and other basic/common things you find in most race games. After a while, huge, sharp rotating blades can be seen cutting into the tracks as well as laserbeams moving around trying to cut your car in half (which really does happen and you can then decide to either try and get to the next checkpoint or you can reset to the last one). Not much later you\u2019ll also encounter blocks appearing out of thin air, rotating fans and spikes coming in from all sides. Plenty of stuff to keep you on your toes, as you can see.\n\n The game has an Adventure Mode and an Arcade Mode. Adventure Mode is the single-player mode that I was just talking about where you follow a story (yes, there\u2019s a story). Arcade Mode lets you play solo, split screen or online.  Solo gives you different choices than split screen and online so there\u2019s plenty to do. I haven\u2019t yet tried any of the modes except for Adventure Mode but unfortunately that one is incomplete and still being worked on. I\u2019ve seen glimpses of the story but I\u2019m not quite sure that I understand what it\u2019s all about. Maybe soon.\n \n[h1]Graphics & Audio[/h1]\n Graphically Distance is pretty impressive with dark lighting and a dark atmosphere in general, only brightened by colorful neon colors that appear on the tracks and specific objects (now I think about it; it\u2019s shown on pretty much anything that can kill you). It has a cool Tron-like vibe but unfortunately the game uses a lot of basic geometry. Levels are kinda boring and the car itself doesn\u2019t have much detail. I get that it\u2019s futuristic but a little more variety in the tracks would\u2019ve brought the game to life. But, since I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s part of the story I can\u2019t properly talk about it I guess. So again, maybe we\u2019ll know when the game finally releases somewhere next year.\n The audio consists of sci-fi music with a somewhat frantic tempo. It fits the game completely so this is all good. Sounds like your car crashing and beams and blades closing in also sound great. No, the sound department is just fine.\n \n[h1]Length/Replayability[/h1]\n Since this is an Early Access title the game isn\u2019t yet complete. Still, the Adventure Mode can take you anywhere between 1,5-3 hours I think. After that you will probably have seen it all until the next part of the game releases.\nBut, of course, you can always spend some time with the Editor to create some new tracks yourself, or download custom made tracks from the Steam Workshop. That will add at least several hours extra to the total playtime.\n \n[h1]Closing[/h1]\n Distance hasn\u2019t entirely become the game that I initially expected. I don\u2019t know exactly what I was expecting, but I think that I was expecting a game similar to WipeOut maybe. While it doesn\u2019t even come close to being that game this game is good in its own right. Partly thanks to the fact that it tries to do something different. I honestly can\u2019t think of a game that uses these kind of mechanics so that\u2019s absolutely a good sign. While it can definitely use some more polish and maybe a few changes here and there I certainly like what I\u2019ve been playing thus far. And who knows what more we can expect in the near future ? I for one am looking forward to the final release. For now I\u2019ll rate this as follows:\n \n[Rating: 76/100]", "timestamp_created": 1418112152, "timestamp_updated": 1418141872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709058", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13291500": {"recommendationid": "13291500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064053817", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500578305}, "language": "italian", "review": "English:\n\nThis is the epic verision of Nitronic Rush, totally worth the admission fee.\nIf you like driving games and want something else that stands out, do yourself a favor and check this game out.\n\n\nI'm deadly serious...\n\nItaliano:\n\nQuesto gioco \u00e8 fenomenale, \u00e8 la versione epica di Nitronic Rush.\nSe vi piacciono i giochi di corse e cercate qualcosa di interessante, pigliatevelo subito.\n\n\nNon sto affatto scherzando...\n\nTL;DR;

While they are attending school one day, a mob from the Squidfather hits up the school, stealing supplies from it and frightening childrend, while disguised as a ghost. So Freddi and Luther must follow a trail deep into the bowels of Hell itself in order to uncover the dastardly truth of this sinister plot.\n\nI might be making fun of the game, but to be completely fair, I did enjoy it far more than the original Freddi Fish.\n\nThe game centers around you catching the alleged ghost haunting the school by getting supplies for a trap. It seems a little a**-backwards, since Freddi and Luther have no literal idea when the ghost might come back, even if it does. I think their efforts would have been better spent actually tracking down the ghost. Hell, I even tried to at first but the b****** just up and disappeared after I chased him for a bit.\n\nWhile you hunt down these various items, you get to explore are far more enjoyable and colorful world, and while the characters don't exactly fit in it like the last installment, it still looks more friendly than the ominous backgrounds of Missing Kelp Seeds. I was actually surprised with how much there is to do in the world this time around as well. Many characters will break into song (most of them not that great), there's a Space Invaders minigame (which is watered down, but still fun... no pun intended), and even movies you can watch (all of which center on dumb puns, not unlike my last pun).\n\nWhile I can say that just throwing more sh** into a game doesn't make it better (A lesson that could be sorely learned by the Call of Duty franchise), it'll give the little snots a little something extra if they ever play this game. Which I assumed they won't. The only people that do these days are greasy f***s that are far too old to be playing a kids game.\n\nLike... me...\n\nA final point that I'd like to make, is that for this being a \"Case of a Haunted Schoolhouse\", there isn't a lot of mystery to it. All you're doing is collecting items for the trap. I mean, it is obvious to anyone who's older than 5 to tell that the ghost is f***ing fake, but the game goes out of its way to explain who the ghost really is before you even get a chance to start suspecting the various characters in the game world. And it's the same two damn punks from Missing Kelp Seeds and that cliche pun on The Godfather. When I saw those two tumors appear on screen again, I just sighed and rested my hand on my forehead, and promised myself it'll all be over soon.\n\nLuckily enough, it was. This game, while larger than Freddi Fish Uno, is still pretty easy on the run-time, but also low on the relpy value. It definitely fits into most of the Humongous game tropes, with gathering items, talking to zany characters, and playing minigames along the way... but it all feels disconnected in the large world. It doesn't feel as creative as Humongous' later efforts to make fun kids games like Pajama Sam or Spy Fox 3. But it's still and improvement from the first game, and that's definitely a plus in my book. For all that, I'm giving Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse a 5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1470347597, "timestamp_updated": 1470347597, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441615", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24308218": {"recommendationid": "24308218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024294295", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468468711}, "language": "english", "review": "Just played this game as well.

I played it off a CD I got in a cereal box on my dad's ancient Windows 95 computer, which I had for about 10 years. \n\nThis is a game I have this strange nostalgic fondness for despite fundamentally being a simple kids game. The plot centers on the two characters, Freddi and Luther, who have to discover the identity of a mysterious ghost who steals the toys of all of the other children. And they have to gather various objects inorder to build a trap to capture the ghost. Like I said it is fundamentally a children's game so the humor is a bit predictable, the puzzles are very simple and you're frequently told what to do and what to get. (IE: Freddi says you need scissors to cut some kelp, you need a wrench to remove a wheel, you need to ask a character for a combination to a lock. Etc.) \n\nSomething the game does have much like other Humungous games is random elements. When you start the game up, certain elements are removed wheras others appear. For instance, all of the trap items you need to locate are randomized during every playthrough. While this isn't that big of a difference it does make the second or third playthrough feel different. When I was a kid this blew me away at the time but nowadays it just feels like a way to pad out the game time. Since it is a very short game.\n\nGoing through it on the first try you can beat the game in maybe 30 minutes. This is a common aspect of Humungous games compared to other SCUMM games like the ones by Lucasarts. So it might not hold your attention as an adult, but it will return you back to a day when you were a kid, and every game was a treasure to behold.", "timestamp_created": 1464672032, "timestamp_updated": 1464672032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.791732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23056318": {"recommendationid": "23056318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257041646", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452709902}, "language": "french", "review": "Le meilleur des \"Marine Malice\" !\n\nQuel bonheur de voir ces vieux jeux revenir \u00e0 jour !\n\nLes enfants adoreront ce jeu.

Starting the game I could already tell this was a master piece. The stunning visuals and superb sound quality left me absolutely awestruck. The downside to the unbelievable graphics is that I could only run this game at about 98-100fps on mega ultra settings.\n\n The story is quite linear with several sidequests that interweave with the main storyline, similar to The Witcher 3: Wildhunt, but was executed far better in my opinion. The characters, unlike in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are not 1 dimensional and have interesting personalities and backstories. For me, the most memorable quest was finding the glasses in the hole, I can vividly remember recieving my first weapon as a reward: A scoped slingshot. It was easily the best weapon in the game, but since I had specced into intelligence it was practically useless. This makes the combat far harder, I remember the final battle against the ghost took me several tries to beat. This is not helped by the unweildy combat system that utilises QTES(Quick Time Events) which seem very out of place, considering this is kids game. In several areas of the huge open world map, there are big scary male fish that try to oppress you with musical instruments. You have the option to initiate combat with them, but it takes a lot of grinding in order to get to their level.\n\n There is a high level of interaction within the environment, my favourite place is the movie theatre, with the right button combination you are able to play reruns of the hit tv show, The Fresh Prince of Belair. Other than the horrible combat system, another gripe i have this game is the economy, it is very clear that the octopus has a monopoly over the entire pulley market, as one pulley will often run you 5 sea urchins, which can be very difficult to come across, while exploring the gigantic open world. My last gripe is this game, is more of a personal one, after playing for a while I literally developed cancer, this game cost me so much money, that i was unabable to pay for my hospital bills. Since this is the only game I own I am just sitting in the hospital playing this game, waiting for the sweet, sweet release of death.\n\nBest game ever 10/10\n\nThis game sucks fish sticks\n", "timestamp_created": 1451119422, "timestamp_updated": 1451119422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515253", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19853773": {"recommendationid": "19853773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089427742", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456624148}, "language": "english", "review": "Spooky", "timestamp_created": 1450822816, "timestamp_updated": 1450822816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19601918": {"recommendationid": "19601918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067157628", "num_games_owned": 637, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475652430}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked playing this game.

Daarnaast verscheen dit jaar ook [i]Grand Theft Auto V[/i] voor de PC, met een immens grote wereldkaart en met zoveel realisme dat mijn tere kinderzieltje het haast niet aankon. Ook deze game claimde 'de grootste' te zijn. Weet je wat ik daar van vind?\n\n[b]Onzin[/b].\n\nJe leest het goed: pure onzin. De droeftoeters die bovenstaande daadwerkelijk beweren, zijn net zo na\u00efef als Bassie de clown. Nee, beste mensen, hoor mij aan: [i]Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse[/i], van [i]Humongous Entertainment[/i], is de daadwerkelijke Shawshank Redemption onder de video games. Dit meesterwerk was ruim zijn tijd vooruit en zelfs tot de dag van vandaag kan dit stukje perfectie menig volk en bourgeoisie verbazen. Plebs spelen GTA, patrici\u00ebrs spelen Freddi Fish.\n\nProtagonist in dit meesterwerk is Freddi de vis, die samen met haar vriend* Loebas de zaak van de bespookte school moeten oplossen. Hier begint het al; het plot is simpelweg fantastisch. Het tikt niet aan Pulp Fiction of Forrest Gump, nee - het overstijgt het, met [b]gemak[/b]. De combinatie van een femine bolleboos en een na\u00efve Vlaming, [b]in visvorm[/b], is als [i]Elvis[/i] en [i]The Beatles[/i] bij elkaar. Stoort het feit dat het beoogde publiek kinderen was tijdens het maken van de game? Welnee, [i]The Lion King[/i] was toch ook voor kinderen bedoeld? Nou kun je die twee niet echt vergelijken natuurlijk, \u00e9\u00e9n is duidelijk beter dan de ander. \n\nHoe zit het dan met de game zelf? Welke gangs zijn er uit te moorden, welke steden worden herbouwd na een nucleare ramp, welke tijdlijn van de alternatieve geschiedenis volgt dit epos daadwerkelijk? De gameplay valt te omschrijven met de volgende woorden: het spelen van de game is als het leegdrinken van een fles Fanta (de Zuid-Europese versie, die extra oranje versie) na tien kilometer hardlopen met een zon die bloedverziekstralend heet is. Ken je dat gevoel? Dan ken je het gevoel van Freddi Fish 2. \n\nMuziek en presentatie zijn 'state of the art'. Een subtiele mix van Rembrandt van Rijn, Andy Warhole en [i]Ducktales[/i] zorgt voor een onvergetelijke ervaring, die zich al vanaf de eerste seconde permanent in je brein nestelt. De zoete klanken doen denken aan grote namen als [i]Coldplay[/i], [i]Avicii[/i] en hier en daar zelfs [i]Corry en de Rekels[/i]. Je hoornvlies zal een massage krijgen, wellicht is er zelfs sprake van een oor-gasme. Snap je?!\n\nEr zitten hier en daar nog leuke verwijzingen in naar andere personages van Humongous Entertainment, zoals de infantiele [i]Pyjama  Sam[/i] en de olijke auto [i]Putt-Putt[/i], die later [i]Pixar[/i] ge\u00efnspireerd heeft om de kaskraker [i]Cars[/i] te produceren. Ja, jongens, dit is een waar godsgeschenk die de engelen vanuit alle zeven hemelen hebben moeten maken - een simpele sterveling zou nooit tot zo'n magnefique creatie zijn gekomen, zelfs een groep van twaalf of meer mensen zou moeite hebben de ontwikkeling van  een game als deze te bewerkstelligen. \n\nKortom, mocht je net weer geld hebben gekregen (verjaardag, vakantiegeld, wat kan mij het schelen), schroom dan niet en doe jezelf een plezier door dit genot aan te schaffen. Het is wetenschappelijk bewezen* dat het spelen van Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse bijdraagt aan een betere gezondheid en levensstijl. Er zijn gevallen bekend van personen die zijn gestopt met roken of het gebruik van verdovende middelen door slechts het horen van de naam van de game. Dat is hoe goed deze game is. \n\n[quote]Live as if you were to die tomorrow.

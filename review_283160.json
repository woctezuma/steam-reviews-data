On a straight run through Invader (Easy) difficulty, one can reach the ending in under two hours. There's technically several endings, but only minimally different, which is sort of the problem with the game: HOTDS is structurally very minimalistic, with a very solid flight model, fun combat system and a killer atmosphere, but there's little meat to the bones.\n\nThe twists and turns it offers help extend its length, but hardly qualify as a serious effort in replayability, as it's mostly a retread on already visited fixed content. However, the core systems are so good I can't help but keep going back in my attempt to clear all the missions' levels and bring down every traitor flagship.\n\nSo this is indeed an uncertain, mixed feelings review. How do you rate something that's excellent but [i]really[/i] leaves you aching for more, far too soon? Price-wise, 20 dollars for a game you can very well squeeze dry within 6 hours at best is quite steep from my point of view, so I can't really recommend purchasing HOTDS at full price unless you're willing to support/gamble with the notion that some day the developer might return and produce something more engrossing around this gorgeous skeleton.\n\nThat said, during sales the price can drop considerably, so I'd say by all means go for it in those cases.

Il titolo \u00e8 stato prodotto e sviluppato da una piccola casa di sviluppo indipendente, la Marauder Interactive fondata nel 2013 negli USA a Seattle da Mike Tipul. Il signor Mike non \u00e8 esattamente una new entry nel mondo dell\u2019 industria videoludica, per lungo tempo infatti \u00e8 stato un produttivo impiegato dei Bungie Studios ed ha lavorato attivamente nel 2009 al progetto di Halo 3:ODST e nel 2010 su Halo:Reach. Mike dopo aver terminato il suo rapporto di lavoro con i Bungie Studios mostra al PAX 2013 un primo prototipo del suo gioco, all\u2019 epoca intitolato Enemy Starfighter\u2026 riscuote un buon feedback dalla critica e decide di continuare il suo lavoro. Lo sviluppo dura 3 anni, il titolo sopravvive sia al percorso di sviluppo che ad un curioso rebrand del nome, Enemy Starfighter nel  maggio 2016 infatti cambia nome e diventa ufficialmente l\u2019 attuale House of the Dying Sun.\nUna sviluppo articolato, che ha il sapore di successo personale per Mike Tipul\u2026 ma il titolo creato \u00e8 all\u2019 altezza della sua storia? Vediamo un po\u2019 di scoprirlo.\nHouse of The Dying Sun si presenta come un gioco single player ad ambientazione fantascientifica, in cui il giocatore impersona un pilota in un angusta cabina di comando di un caccia stellare pronto ad ingaggiare frenetiche battaglie spaziali in prima persona. Il modello di volo adottato \u00e8 arcade, esso risulta essere estremamente funzionale al ritmo di gioco elevato proposto e ben disegnato per supportare adeguatamente sia l\u2019 accoppiata mouse/tastiera che i moderni joystick.  La storia del gioco ci da subito un buon pretesto per scatenarci ai comandi della nostra nave: I giorni felici sono finiti e gi\u00e0 dimenticati; l\u2019 Imperatore \u00e8 morto, il suo regno che si estende per tutta la galassia \u00e8 passato nelle mani di un nuovo Re\u2026 un falso Re. Non ci verranno forniti molti dettagli, sappiamo solo che l\u2019 imperatore \u00e8 stato tradito dai nobili e che un usurpatore siede sul trono del regno\u2026 il giocatore \u00e8 un fedelissimo membro della guardia imperiale ed ha un unico obiettivo, esaudire l\u2019 ultimo desiderio del suo defunto Imperatore: uccidere tutti i traditori e portare la rovina sulla loro gente.    \nSi\u2026 avete inteso bene, in questo gioco non siamo degli eroi\u2026 non ci batteremo per l\u2019 ordine e la giustizia\u2026 non c\u2019 \u00e8 nessuna principessa da salvare o popolo da difendere\u2026 agiremo solo spinti  della vendetta: elimineremo i Lord traditori e le loro famiglie, attaccheremo civili per rappresaglia ed arriveremo  a radere al suolo interi pianeti abitati da innocenti. Veramente un atmosfera allegra\u2026 ma andiamo avanti!\nIl gioco \u00e8 strutturato in 15 missioni, ogni missione di svolge in una location specifica della mappa galattica; per completare le singole missioni dovremmo portare a compimento uno o pi\u00f9 obiettivi: assassinare un determinato bersaglio VIP, distruggere un certo numero di navi nemiche schierate, scortare e proteggere alleati o resistere agli assalti nemici tenendo la posizione per un determinato periodo di tempo.\nOgni volta che completeremo con successo una missione saremo ricompensati con i Favor Point, questi punti favore saranno indispensabili per poter sbloccare miglioramenti per armi , struttura, scudi e abilit\u00e0 speciali della nostra nave e delle navi della nostra flotta\u2026 eh si ho detto flotta! Ecco la caratteristica pi\u00f9 originale di House of the Dying Sun: non siamo soli nella nostra vendetta, mano a mano che completeremo le missioni altre navi da combattimento si uniranno a noi e ci seguiranno di  missione in missione , o meglio di massacro in massacro!\nLentamente ricostituiremo la flotta della guardia imperiale; si uniranno a noi sia navi della nostra stessa categoria, gli intercettori, che navi di categoria e stazza maggiore, come i destroyer e le imponenti fregate. Sul campo di battaglia potremmo impartire con un pratico menu radiale a scomparsa ordini basilari alla flotta: come ad esempio difendi, attacca, sperona o bombarda il bersaglio. Se invece volessimo dare diversi ordini pi\u00f9 articolati alle singole navi alleate verr\u00e0 in nostro soccorso una visuale tattica in cui vedremo tutto il campo di battaglia con chiarezza; all\u2019 interno di questa modalit\u00e0 potremmo selezionare le navi alleate una ad una ed impostare le diverse rotte da seguire e i bersagli pi\u00f9 adatti da ingaggiare per il tipo di nave selezionata. L\u2019alternarsi tra la visuale in prima persona del nostro caccia e quella tattica in classico stile RTS dall\u2019alto \u00e8 piuttosto bene riuscita, la transizione tra le due modalit\u00e0 \u00e8 sempre piuttosto fluida e risulta utilissima nelle situazioni pi\u00f9 affollate per capire meglio cosa ci circonda.\nNonostante tutti i mezzi a disposizione e la compagnia dei nostri indottrinati compagni d\u2019 arme, sul campo di battaglia non avremo mai la sensazione di essere potenti ed invulnerabili, tutte le missione infatti saranno sempre una corsa contro il tempo; pochi minuti dopo l\u2019 inizio dei nostri assalti si diriger\u00e0 su di noi puntualmente una grande flotta capitanata dalla Flagship del traditore, la nave ammiraglia nemica\u2026 L\u2019 arrivo della flotta di difesa rappresenter\u00e0 sempre un momento di panico per il giocatore e per la sua flottiglia. La nave ammiraglia in pochi secondi lancer\u00e0 salve su salve di siluri e spazzer\u00e0 via ogni malcapitato a raggio; il compito del giocatore \u00e8 quindi chiaro: bisogna realizzare tutti gli obiettivi velocemente e ritirarsi dal campo di battaglia possibilmente prima che arrivi la flotta di soccorso nemica capitanata dalla temibile ammiraglia\u2026 insomma bisogna usare la tattica della toccata e fuga.\nHouse of the Dying Sun \u00e8 stato sviluppato interamente con una piattaforma di terze parti, il motore del gioco che lo sviluppatore ha scelto di utilizzare \u00e8 stato il celebre Unity (quinta versione). La veste grafica del titolo \u00e8 molto piacevole,  sia il design generale delle navi e le ambientazioni dei livelli, caratterizzate da colori vividi e da forti contrasti, sono di chiara ispirazione passata: si nota con piacere l\u2019 influenza dei grandissimi titoli della serie di HomeWord all\u2019 interno del gioco. Ottimo il comparto degli effetti audio; \u00e8 veramente piacevole il contrasto fra gli allarmi squillanti e i vari avvisi sonori provenienti dalla strumentazione del nostro abitacolo rispetto i suoni ovattati e lontani provenienti dall\u2019esterno della nave. La colonna sonora \u00e8 di qualit\u00e0 e risulta estremamente coinvolgente e ritmata, ci si sente letteralmente incalzati dalla musica che trasmette un vero e proprio senso di frenesia durante la partita.   \nTutti gli elementi di House of the Dying Sun si incastrano molto bene fra di loro creando un prodotto omogeneo e pulito\u2026 niente spine quindi? Bhe una c\u2019\u00e8\u2026 ed anche piuttosto appuntita: il gioco pecca di longevit\u00e0. In circa 4 o 5 ore sarete riusciti a bruciare tutta la galassia completando tutte le 15 missioni che il gioco vi mette a disposizione, l\u2019assenza totale di una qualsiasi modalit\u00e0 multyplayer non aiuta di certo ad alleviare il problema. Il gioco ad ogni modo cerca di compensare questa grande mancanza inserendo due meccaniche distinte. La prima consiste nella possibilit\u00e0 di ripetere le singole missioni con livelli di sfida crescenti: al crescere della difficolt\u00e0 aumenteranno il numero e la pericolosit\u00e0 dei nemici presenti nelle missioni. La seconda invece \u00e8 rappresentata dalla comparsa di una 16 esima missione supplementare, denominata challenge mode, in cui dovremmo affrontare ondate infinite di nemici cercando di resistere il pi\u00f9 a lungo possibile prima dell\u2019 inevitabile disfatta\u2026 insomma una last stand il cui unico scopo \u00e8 raggiungere un punteggio sempre pi\u00f9 alto.\nIn conclusione\u2026 House of the Dying Sun \u00e8 un prodotto veramente ben confezionato in cui si amalgamano bene elementi provenienti da generi diversi e nonostante la scarsa longevit\u00e0 mi sento di consigliare questo titolo senza remore", "timestamp_created": 1518700886, "timestamp_updated": 1518835964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748496", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40060010": {"recommendationid": "40060010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039282153", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518561673}, "language": "english", "review": "I played for like 5 minutes.

You play as the Dragon, the Emperor's right hand man, you have command over the ships in your fleet as well as the ability to swap between pilots like some sort of ghostly murder machine.  \n\nThe game progresses almost like Starfox in a way, with your fleet heading to one system after another in search of vital targets or those dirt bag traitor lords. There are ten traitor lords in all and you end up basically killing all of them on your way to the last mission. \n\nEach mission starts with you giving orders to your fleet, although you start with only yourself, eventually pick up wingmen and even larger ships such as Destroyers and Frigates. Every mission has three difficulty settings and secondary objectives, the higher the difficulty the better reward for completing the secondary objective. \n\nOnce your done fumbling around in the command mode, you press a button and take control of one of your star fighters. From here the game turns into a really competent arcade space sim. You have three weapons, your main gun, a secondary, and a heavy payload. What makes things a little complicated are enemy ship types, some weapons are better at destroying shields while others tear through enemy hulls like paper.\n\nMuch like my crippling debt, House of the Dying Sun's ship movement feels real and physical. You're not just an object floating through space, there's actual weight to everything you do. You need to use thrusters to come to a complete stop or else you just keep floating off, and you can even drift to basically do the space equivalent of a drive by. \n\nIts actually amazing just how realized the universe of House of the Dying Sun actually is. All you have to go by are codices you unlock and the mission objectives. In the three hours it takes you to beat the game you basically get filter fed lore and back story across each mission. Its really refreshing to have a developer who's not afraid to express their creative vision, it honestly feels like writers for other games are waiting for permission to be creative so they don't get...I don't know, made fun off for being a writer? I guess. \n\nHouse of the Dying Sun's universe is almost Dune inspired in a way. You're not on some righteous cause and you're not fed any kind of message, unless that message is \u201cKill your enemy\u201d. We don't know much about the traitor lords, or what life is like under their rule. Maybe the new King is a plucky, self righteous fellow like Luke Skywalker or that nerd from Eragon? Maybe he's beloved by the people and spreads nothing but joy and peace across his empire?\nDoesn't matter, still going to kill him.\nYou're not out there to save the galaxy, you're following your final decree, and its very clear that, if there even is a good guy, you're not them. Everyone has to die, civilians included. \n\nOkay so I'm about to drop some harsh spoilers right about now, fair warning.\n\n[spoiler]The final mission involves you purging the throne world of Rhal'Tuum Prime of it's entire population, including the usurper. The idea is that the Emperor's last decree was \u201cKill the traitors and bring ruin to their people.\u201d basically means everyone is a traitor and they all have to die. The mission basically ends with you exterminating fourteen billion people, not including enemy combatants. So in three hours you basically become one of the greatest mass murderers in video game history. [/spoiler] \nThis, along with the fact that the galaxy is fleshed out by reading codex entries, you're left with this eerie, almost frightening setting that a lot of video game writers are probably afraid to even approach, let alone write about. \n\nSo do I have any actual complaints about this game? \n\nWell, its too short, for one. I beat it in around three hours and that includes me going back to try a few missions on a harder difficulty. The strategy controls are kind of lacking, even if they do get the job done. And the amount of times I taken out by a lucky shot from a enemy ship kind of made me sour.\n\nI also wouldn't mind if the game gave you more fighters to choose from instead of the one, and maybe larger fleet battles? Cant go wrong with absolute cluster fucks. \n\nBut other than that, the game is actually pretty amazing.

As a fan of the Homeworld series, I really enjoyed the callback to those game's styles. I half way got the feeling of being just another one of the grunts for the space meat grinder in a grand RTS. Almost. \nGameplay is actually similar to arcade flight sims I played when I was really young and some of the sound effects are REALLY similar in design to late 90's early 00's aesthetic. So the game gets good scores in visuals, sound and gameplay. Plot is pretty thin but that's fine honestly. I like the bluntness of THE EMPEROR IS DEAD, KILL ALL TRAITORS. If you approach it like an arcade game with a little more depth, it works just fine. So well done to all involved there.\n\nThe enemy of this game is time. I don't know how long I waited for this game to release, it was at least a couple years, maybe three? I didn't actually play it until a year after that and I beat every mission and got maybe 3/4 of the bonuses completed in a little over four hours. I got this one sale for nine bucks, I will probably get another four or so if I get a VR headset and want to invest some time in the endless mode but I really don't know if I will pass ten hours total which is really unfortunate. I was surprised when I realized I had actually already unlocked almost every additional ship and weapon because it feels like you're half way there at least but nope. \n\nSo ultimately it's super hard to recommend this for $20 dollars. I got it on sale for $9 which was fine but honestly this would be super easy to recommend if it was like $10 at base price and then like $7.50 on sale.

In trying to use joysticks, rudders, and a throttle, it was really confusing to figure out which # joystick each controller was. The way the analog axes are set up always threw me off, too. It didn't seem to play nicely with my throttle axis and took some trial and error to figure out.\n- Speaking of throttle, there's no variable throttle control if you have a throttle controller. You are either at 100% throttle or 0% throttle. Took me a while to figure that out, too because it wasn't obvious.\n- Flight controls. Your fighters fly like an airplane. You can go forward, pitch up and down, roll left and right, and yaw left and right. There is no lateral thruster movement in any direction. You can \"de-couple\" from your current vector, though.

Nei panni di un pilota di caccia della Guardia Imperiale il nostro compito e' quello di eseguire l'ultimo ordine del legittimo sovrano: Giustiziare tutti i traditori e massacrare la loro gente...\n\nLa realt\u00e0 virtuale sembra finalmente prendere piede come tecnologia ludica grazie ad ad una serie di titoli indie e non che sfruttano i vari visori come Oculus Rift e HTC Vive. Tra i tanti, House of the Dying Sun e' un interessante simulatore di combattimento spaziale che per diversi aspetti ricorda molto le atmosfere di Battlestar Galactica, in particolare grazie alle musiche e agli effetti sonori.\n\nCome in ogni buon simulatore di combattimento spaziale, tutta l'azione si svolge dentro l'abitacolo del nostro caccia intercettore, con il quale affronteremo tutte le 14 missioni (+1 che fa da tutorial) della campagna. Salvo un paio in cui dovremo proteggere degli obbiettivi, sono tutte del tipo \"vai e uccidi tizio\", che significa fare a pezzi una qualche grossa nave per poi distruggere la capsula di salvataggio con a bordo il nostro obiettivo. E' bene dire che li missioni durano solo una manciata di minuti, anche per il fatto che se non raggiungiamo gli obbiettivi velocemente il nemico chiamer\u00e0 i rinforzi (e a quel punto saranno i proverbiali \"volatili per diabetici\").\n\nLa scarsa longevit\u00e0 della campagna (che potete chiudere in poco meno di due ore al livello pi\u00f9 facile) e' pero' compensata dalla rigiocablita' della stessa, grazie alla difficolt\u00e0 selezionabile per missione: i livelli di difficolt\u00e0 pi\u00f9 alti portano ricompense pi\u00f9 grandi, ma ovviamente ottenerle e' molto pi\u00f9 complicato. Tra le varie ricompense che potremo ottenere, oltre agli sblocchi di armi o perk per la nostra nave ci sono anche altri caccia per il nostro stormo (nei quali potremo reincarnarci se veniamo uccisi durante una missioni) o anche navi pi\u00f9 grandi che non potremo pilotare in prima persona ma alle quali potremo dare ordini, cos\u00ec come ai caccia alleati, usando una interfaccia di comando molto semplice e rapida da usare. E' quindi presente nel gioco una componente tattica che, se ben sfruttata, semplifica notevolmente il lavoro di completamento degli obbiettivi, che per altro non e' mai banale: l'IA nemica non ci dar\u00e0 mai tregua e il lavoro di pilotaggio del caccia e' complicato da una fisica che pur non essendo realistica non e' neppure un becero plane in space: Provate a far virare il caccia quando questo e' lanciato alla massima velocit\u00e0 e capirete cosa intendo.\n\nNato espressamente per essere usato con la tecnologia VR, HotDS e' pero' perfettamente giocabile anche sul normale schermo per PC e nativamente compatibile con i dispositivi della serie TrackIR, che costituisce un ottimo compromesso tra le due cose. Volendo si pu\u00f2 giocare con tastiera e mouse, ma e' caldamente consigliato utilizzare un joypad con 2 levette analogiche (peccato che i Joystick HOTAS non siano supportati). Proprio per venire incontro alla sua natura \"virtuale\", il gioco ha una componente grafica molto essenziale e semplificata, che pero' con il suo stile pulito e' estremamente gradevole da vedere e gira con un discreto frame rate.\n\nHouse of the Dying Sun e' un ottimo prodotto, facile da imparare ed estremamente divertente da giocare, adatto sia ai puristi del genere che ai semplici curiosi che vogliono testare il loro visore VR.

House of the Dying Sun is a distillation of all the best parts of the space combat genre. I have been playing these types of games since Wing Commander and \"Mantis\", for those of you who once owned a single speed CD-Rom drive. My favorites of the genre, before House of the Dying Sun came along, were Tie Fighter and Freespace 2.\n\nThis is *pure* gameplay. Do not expect Tie Fighter. Do not expect an extensive campaign with tons of story. That's not what this game is about. This is more like Geometry Wars and Ace Combat crossed with Homeworld and Tie Fighter. You even jump between a finite number of interceptors which serve as \"lives.\" The campaign exists only to slowly teach you the 'rules' of the game and to develop an atmosphere, as you pay to unlock upgrades by working your way through the star map. There are, perhaps, only a dozen engagements, but they each have 4 difficulty levels, as well as extra bonus objectives.\n\nYou start with only one ship: the deadly interceptor. As you progress through the game you will amass a fleet of 7 vessels, all under your control. Interceptors, destroyers, and a frigate. Each ship can be outfitted with special weaponry and equipment in 4 slots (the interceptors you fly get the coolest toys). Half of this game is spent in the cockpit pulling off wild maneuvers, the other half is spent on the 3D tactical map, ordering ships around and micromanaging your fleet, very much like Homeworld (though purely tactical, no building stuff). It is this component where the second course of this delicious meal is found.\n\nOnce you complete the campaign, you are ready for the daily challenge: An endless fight to the death against the evil forces of democracy. Avenge the emperor. Make the traitors pay. You can play this challenge over and over and try to crack the top of the leaderboard. Change your fleet load-out, try different strategies, see how many waves you can get through before your fleet is reduced to ash. You can spend hours a day trying to perfect the unique random challenges that refresh once every 24 hours.\n\nIf you have a VR setup, TrackIR, or any other way to get decent head-tracking, you absolutely owe it to yourself to play this game. My only complaints are with some quality of life and interface issues. The tactical map is fiddly, ships sometimes refuse to obey orders (this is rare, except for interceptors which seem to have a mind of their own sometimes), but flicking through every tiny target with the thumb stick is a pain, and mouse navigation isn't much better. This interface desperately needs a list of all friendly vessels, and groupings, so you can manage all the chaos. I beg the developers to polish the tactical interface a bit.\n\nThe graphics are stylized and gorgeous, and the sound is deep. If there were sound in space, it would sound like this. What an incredible experience this game is. For my money, it is the best space combat game ever created. The developers knew exactly what the most fun elements of the genre were and stuffed them into one tight experience and fit every control you would want easily onto a gamepad. The controls are great. Order your frigate with repair drones to hide behind an asteroid, waiting for your return, then strap yourself in and order your wingmen to join you on a bombing run of a capital ship. Dance around flak cannons and deliver the payload. Watch the fireworks.\n\nI played this game with an EDTracker head-tracking dongle with TrackIR output through Opentrack.

The presentation inside the Rift really enhanced the experience -- I could turn around and see the back of my cockpit chair; look to the side and there's a screen showing objectives; look up and there's a couple wingmen in formation...\n\nI liked it so much I stood in line again (which was rapidly growing) to try it again, and even got to talk to the developer while waiting.  Very cool guy; big ideas and yet very approachable.\n\nWell, I finally have both the game and a way to play it in VR.  The sound is still incredible, especially the music (now available as a free download!).  The sound effects have a nice oomph, the cockpit noises are immersive (including oxygen mask breathing noise), and the radio chatter is cool.

It's not about being a hero or saving the day. It's a story about dragging people kicking and screaming down into the grave they dug for the rightfull ruler of the Empire. There isn't much to tell you whether or not you're a good guy or a bad guy, all you know is you have enemies to kill and the equipment and missions to do so. The gameplay is very tight, flight feels smooth and responsive. Only having two weapons feels restrictive at first, but it quickly becomes apparent when fighing it was actually a rather good design choice, as there often times you don't want to be fumbling for the right weapon out of a list. It stays fast pace and reactive, and swapping between one of two weapons to quickly snap of shots with them at their appropriate targets begins to leave you feeling like a badass gunslinger. Which you won't feel like until you've put some work in. You start the game with only one single seater attack craft and it is without any upgrades at all. You have to earn them through missions, and the more risky the mission setting, the more you earn.\n\nLuckily, you aren't punished with a game over if you die too many times, you instead learn to fight better and you get to keep trying. Even after you beat the game, even if you only select the easist missions, you still keep the upgrades and currency. You can even go back and redo missions in the middle of the campaign at higher difficulties, making it significantly easier on you to play through at lower levels to earn the rewards and some currency to outfit yourself to stand a better chance on the more difficult settings. You'll need it. Even with a full picket fleet at your command (more on that in a moment), you're going to want them and yourself upgraded to be able to tackle some of these missions. But it doesn't feel frustrating, because you can move to another one if you can't get through it, which makes the entire experience so much more enjoyable. The addition of having wingmen to back you up in these missions that you can give orders to (or pilot if they are in one of the other three fighters), was a surprising but welcome addition to the game.\n\nIn the end, everything about this game, from the flight, to the fight, to the framerate the game was just 100% smooth. That's the best word for this game: Smooth. Even the menu, the story, and the credits are smooth and polished. The team that made this game should feel proud. The only gripe I have is that it wasn't longer, there wasn't more, and it wasn't bigger. I'm not saying there isn't enjoyable replayability to it, but that I wish this team had the kind of resources to make a grand scope game with this style and story. Pretty much a near perfect game as games are meant to be.\n\nTL:D\nGamplay: Smooth and fun, the fleet mechanics are well balanced and expertly implemented\nSound Effects: The radio chatter is perfect, weapons firing and cycling sounds exactly like it should in space, and the music is sublimly subliminal.\nStory: The story is sparce but impactful, especially the end. You're only given pieces to decipher what is happening, but when it all comes together, you'll be shocked.\nVisuals: Ever wanted to fly one of those little ships in a Homeworld space battle? It feels exactly like how I imaged it would be.\n\n9.5/10. I only wish it didn't end.

The controls are tight and easy to grasp, while the gamplay loop is simple and rewarding. Missions lasts about 5-10 minutes, each with a clear goal. You need to get in, get the job done and get out before traitor reinforcements arrive.\n\nIt a rogue lite type of game, with each successful mission rewarding you with a currency to upgrade your ship. As you progress through the game you gradually get more supporting ships such as; fighters, destroyers and frigates. You're free to swap between friendly fighters as the battle demands. Each also represents an 'extra life' of sorts, allowing you to take control of the pilot seats after your current ship gets blown up. Unfortunately you cant take control of the larger ships, but you can issue them with rudementary commands. \n\nIt can be quite difficult at times, with each mission acting like a puzzle. If you get stuck, the chances are you're approaching it with the wrong loadout or with the wrong tactics. \n\nAfter you work your way through the later missions, building a larger and stronger fleet, you can return to earlier missions to complete them on higher difficulties. This rewards you with more curency that allows you to upgrade your ship further and make later missions easier. For completionists there's plenty of replayability. \n\nThe graphics and sounds are simplistic but stylised and do the job. Its very reminiscent of the homeworld franchise. I personally really like them, but your opinion may differ. The interface is great and works wonderfully in VR (which is a massive plus that can't be emphasize enough). I especially liked the tactical layer, where it zooms out (similar to an RTS), making the ships look like toys. \n\nIf you're looking for a simple but fun starfighter combat game, without the long commitment of games such as elite, this game fits the bill. The developers obviously put a lot of thought into this game and it shows. Their commitment should be rewarded. \n\nHighly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1509309101, "timestamp_updated": 1509309101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36085211": {"recommendationid": "36085211", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997421384", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509242081}, "language": "english", "review": "Couple hours in, I'd say it's pretty fun.

Well, its not like that.\nIts beautiful, very immersive, but people should understand that it's not just an action space-sim with short levels of 3h worth of content. The game is all about the challenge the levels provide on highter difficulties. Each level is a well crafted puzzle on a time limit. You have limited resources. Your opposition is numerous and ruthless. They must die. This will do.\nIf you arent into repeating the levels multiple times, trying to unravel the way of beating it in the most optimal way, on 3 different difficulties (that change the enemy fleet composition and reinforcements strenght) AND with a challenge of besting the enemy flagship, then this game might not be for you. The enjoyment is in struggle, in besting the superior foe, in enacting the Emperor's edict. \n Also this game has a minor fleet management, you got to load out and order around 7 ships (and 3 of them you can pilot) both from cockpit and from tactical view with tactical pause, and this strategy element is fully gamepad supported. You wont succeed on hight difficulty without telling your ships what to do and where to go.\nAudio in this game is superb: sound effects are very nice, music keeps your adrenaline hight; you can hear constant fleet chatter giving you their sitrep (their shield/armor status, target status etc. I dont even need to check the hud to tell how well my fleet is doing), battle chatter's done extremely well.\n There's a survival mode, that lets you play against waves of enemies of random composition and/or escorts. In this mode a fleet strategy is extremely important, for you cant get replacement capital ships. And i say its simply boring after a while, simply because its not hand crafted. I would rather have 3 hours of art of a game than 50 hours of procedurally generated boredom. \n The game is VR capable, it looks awesome in VR. On youtube because i dont have it lol.\n Tldr: Buy it if you want a challenge/immersive experience. Each level is very well made, everything placed there for a purpouse. But it is short, very condensed, for some it is repetitive (for me it was around 3h for the first run, i have 11h for 3 runs + survival and i would play more if i wasnt such a weakling to seriously try and get all flagships and beat all levels just with interceptors). Some people despise the idea of playing the same level again, even with vastly different enemies . And did i say that highter difficulties kick your teeth in? I think i just did.

And it gets repetitive very quickly.\n\nI think another major flaw is the mission structure, the missions objectives are almost always \"Destroy Target X\" with a few \"Escort\" missions sprinkled in. What makes these missions worse than similar missions in other space games is that you have a limited amount of time in the area of operations before the enemy flagship rocks up. Once the flagship has arrived you have wrap up quick and evac. I don't like time pressure in my games, I would like to be able to complete missions at my own pace.\n\nAnother thing I have to bring up is the lack of content. The missions are only small and there is not many of them. I have completed the entire campaign while having to redo multiple missions due to failing them and I have played with the challenge mode and all that took me less than 3 hours. The replayability isn't there at all, the challenge mode has a ridiculous \"kill ship to extend time in AO\" structure that doesn't make sense and isn't fun.\n\nAt first I didn't understand why this game has a \"Very Positive\" rating but then it dawned on me, it's a VR game and there is almost nothing to play in VR hence any semi-competent game will get rave reviews. If you have a VR setup, this game might give you a few hours of okayish gameplay, if you don't get something else, this game is poor value even with 50% off.", "timestamp_created": 1504856631, "timestamp_updated": 1504856631, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587262", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34808070": {"recommendationid": "34808070", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961314453", "num_games_owned": 436, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467016291}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the one VR space sim I've played that actually feels immersive.

Dogfights feel satisfying.\n\nHowever, there is very little content in this game. When you beat the campaign which takes about 2-3 hours or so, there's very little reason to keep playing. The story was pretty standard too. Since the core gameplay is so much fun I feel like this game wasted lots of its potential. It could have been bigger and more epic. Instead what we have is just a series of \"Go in and destroy X before the timer runs out.\" type of challenges.\n\nI hope for the next game the developer invests in the story and mission making more now that the mechanics are in place. It's a good game if you're into space combat but know that it only will last at most 3 hours with very little story content if you're not a completionist.\n", "timestamp_created": 1504517025, "timestamp_updated": 1504517025, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481545", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34719453": {"recommendationid": "34719453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042243161", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504464578}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0411\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u0432 \u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e. \u0410 \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e.

Lovers of X-Wing or Wing Commander will feel right at home here.\n\nMinimal story, which is the way you should do this kind of game if you ask me.  You fly as a pilot in the \"Royal Guard\" for a Dune-esque space dynasty that's just been toppled, and you and your fellow guardsmen are trying to pull the pieces together and take revenge on the traitors who brought down your regime.  Perfunctory stuff but it's different from the kind of setup typical to these sorts of games, at the same time, and deserves credit for that alone.  Space-flight games don't really lend themselves well to grandiose plots and severe character development; every time someone has tried to characterize the pilot of a space-flight game (Wing Commander 3 and 4, X-Wing Alliance, and Terminus are good examples), the game winds up dragged down for it and you feel like the cutscenes and character fluff are getting in the way of the actual game.  Playing a faceless nameless pilot just seems to work better in this kind of game, as TIE Fighter and Freespace both proved, and keeps the focus on the action.\n\nFantastic controls, they're very intuitive once you get used to them.  Despite having pages of remapable controls, it doesn't overcomplicate and keeps things simple so that the focus is on the action and not the interface (if only games like Elite Dangerous could claim the same...).  It handles more like X-Wing than anything else, but there is a \"Drift\" ability that lets you preserve inertia in one direction while turning your fighter in a different direction.  Besides that, it's as wonderfully 1990's arcade'y as a space sim can get.  The method for cycling your weapons is simple and easy to do on the fly.  There's a merit-based unlock system for better gear, but it's not just earning a gun that does more damage: different weapons for the same slot have completely different uses, and totally change your strategy for a given mission.  NOTE that this game doesn't seem to support using the Oculus Touch controllers (or the Vive controllers either, I'd assume), so you either need a dedicated joystick or be willing to flying on mouse-and-keyboard. Not sure what\u2019s up with that; the Oculus Touch controllers with their dual analog thumbsticks and eight buttons are just suited to this game as an Xbox gamepad or dedicated joystick are.\n\nGraphics are minimal in the same way the original Homeworld's were, and also beautiful and fun to just stare at for the very same reason.  Don't expect a lot of super-colorful nebulae or extraneous eye-candy, but the starfields, ships, asteroids, and space stations are all fun to just stare at.  The virtual cockpit is exquisitely rendered, with gages and displays for stuff like damage and targeting that are conveniently-but-not-obtrusively placed.  Explosions are visceral and satisfying, and flashy effects for things like warp drive are used sparingly with a \u201cless is more\u201d approach obviously in play.  The result is a very strong and unique visual style that also happily takes some of the stress of your GPU, squeezing those precious few extra frames per second out of it.\n\nThe game\u2019s also very short, though.  It\u2019s obviously intended to give you full value through its replayable missions with different difficulties.  After you beat a mission at one difficulty setting, you can go back at any time and replay it, adjusting to one of the higher challenge levels for better rewards and ranking points.  You use these points to purchase better weapons and equipment for your fighter as you go, which makes replaying these missions useful rather than just time-wasting fluff.  But at the same time I think instead of just a starfighter-ized level grind, a meatier campaign would have been a much more satisfying way to pad out the play-time of this game.  No mission editor and no mention anywhere that I could find of plans to include one at any point in the future.\n\nSo it\u2019s not a perfect game.  The execution of its gameplay and story setting are pretty much perfect, but there are a couple of niggling details that a lot of people aren\u2019t going to like.  This game was a labor of love for a very, very small dev team, and they clearly focused on delivering the best, tightest experience possible in the few missions they offer rather than diluting the whole experience with more numerous but less engaging missions.  As someone who cut his teeth on X-Wing for DOS, I recommend this game whole-heartedly.  It captures the essence of space flight shooters for VR masterfully and I was relieved to discover it.

Kind of like No Man's Sky, but it feels a lot more refined and everything follows a more simplistic design and feel. However, I did run into an alarming number of random FPS drops at the most random times. For instance, one time I was in the menu and out of nowhere I went from about 80 FPS to 4.\n\nHowever, perhaps the biggest shortcoming of this game is just how short it is. I would have loved to make my way around the whole Galaxy, destroying bases and purging heretics before getting to the homeworld - but instead I got a very linear and very short path directly through the center of the Galaxy to the enemy homeworld (which would make sense in a realistic military scenario, but doesn't serve this game too well). All in all it only took me about 3 hours to complete all of the missions on at least 2 difficulties, unlock most of the more important perks, and get 4th place on the daily challenge. It was a blast, but a very short one. \n\nAnother thing that betrays this game is it's potential to have much cooler and bigger fleet battles than it does.

The AI in this segment of the game is a bit hit or miss, but the game allows you to assume direct control of other wingmen as well if you feel that they're not performing effectively, so there's always that option as well.\n\nIf i had to compare this game i'd say its a mix between \"StarWars: X-wing\" mixed with \"BattleZone: Redux\".

There is nothing else quite like it. \n\nAs my understanding and skill have increased, it has become increasingly clear: this game.... THIS GAME... it is the polished, perfected, evolved essence of space combat that I originally loved in games like X-wing, Tie Fighter, Freespace & Freespace 2. \n\nI think I'm about 15 hours in now, maybe more. Having beaten every level on almost every difficulty, I'm now going through again to complete the Flagship Bounty on each. Achieving this level of completionism is something I have never wanted to do in any game before. But in this game, the level design is exceptional - each additional difficulty brings an additional level of challenge that you will sometimes need to really think about, and learn, how to overcome. Sometimes I have had to leave missions, and come back after some serious thought (or having unlocked more firepower). I've been surprised that redoing the missions hasn't felt stale - I think because the difficulty works exceptionally well at forcing new approaches, which means you are genuinely solving a different problem. (In retrospect this probably isn't as true for all missions, but for enough that it feels very special). Do yourself a favour and don't just Google when you find a mission difficult or seemingly impossible - think about it, come back later, and keep trying until you succeed. The resultant feeling of triumph is unbeatable. I treasure some of the war-stories I gained that way. They would have meant nothing if they weren't hard-won from repeated, stinging failures.  \n\nOne thing I really admire about the game is how well it manages to guide your improvement as a player, without feeling like it's holding your hand. When you start out (with no fleet), the objectives are generally simple, which allows you to focus on understanding your ship & its systems, the basic enemy ships, and how combat works. As your fleet increases, so does the inherent mission difficulty - requiring you to start thinking about how best to use that fleet. As difficulty increases further, you need to think laterally and develop new tactics. By the time you have beaten all the missions on easy (and unlocked everything), I would say you have only learnt 50% of what the game can teach you. Extracting the other 50% has been a wonderful plateau of consistent enjoyment for me, and it's still going. Even after 15 hours the game is still surprising me, still forcing me to try & learn different things as I approach missions with a different end-goal. I am now doing things I wouldn't have thought possible at the start. \n\nI often think back to my first hour - a confused, rookie pilot, wondering what I should be doing in this vast, pretty starfield. And I am so glad I stuck with the game for long enough that I can see & enjoy it for what it is - a true masterpiece, and the new solid-gold standard for space combat. \nMy main wish for this game is that there were more of it - but that's not a criticism, just a genuine desire for more to learn & experience. Knowing now just how good it is, I would pay double the original price for another campaign. It is seriously that good. \n\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\n- This game supports TrackIR and HOTAS, which form a huge part of my enjoyment. Being able to look around for a suitable asteroid to put between you and the Enemy Flagship is pretty handy. I use TrackIR v4 and Thrustmaster TWCS Throtle + T16000M Flight Stick. They are beautiful.\n- The flight model includes Drift mode, which allows you to spin around while you maintain your current trajectory. Fantastic fun & utility in dealing with capital ships in particular. \n- One minor criticism is that many of the unlocks are essentially useless, and the same is true for some weapons. I do wish the design made better use of the different options. There's fantastic potential there which wasn't quite fully realised. The Gap-drive is a great concept, but to make it really worthwhile there would have to be a deadly close-range weapon to justify the risk (Blunderbuss is not lethal enough). I think allowing your fighter to equip 3 unlock modules would have resulted in realising more of this potential, but probably made you overpowered. Even if only in Challenge mode, it would be fun.

It's very gentle in that, but in a way, all the more effective, and I absolutely loved it for it. So many space games end up bogged down by feeling they need to let the player to BE ANYTHING THEY MIGHT EVER WANT TO BE, IN SPACE, only for all the options to SUCK.\n\nThere's some degree of rather drastic but sparse customisation - by completing secondary objectives on heavier difficulties, you get points to unlock auxilary stuff with, while new weapons (mostly just straight up better than your stock stuff) get unlocked in later missions and you can return to the earlier ones with it. There's not a lot of unlocks and it kind of adds to the general feel of \"this is fantastic but shouldn't be $20\" but at the same time they are pretty well pulled off and offer at least two or three meta-playstyles for your fighters.\n\nThis leads to talking about rest of the fleet. The \"what's your force actually made of\" is actually rather unintuitive and like with the story, you basically have to finish the game at least on easier difficulties, before you get a good understanding of what's the intended \"fleety-ness\" they wanted to go with. One mission unlocks you a frigate, another a trio of destroyers, and two more missions each unlock you an extra fighter. You can only directly control the fighters, but they function as \"health points\", and you can freely jump between the tree of them. You also get kicked to the next one if the current dies. Finally, these fighters replenish if you are missing some from your unlocked limit and kill 3 enemies.\n\nThere comes the second big reservation I have with the game - no direct control of the frig nor the destroyers. You can direct them around and choose targets for them, but the friendly AI is a little bit stupid and the RTS interface a bit limited so all in all, you will mainly use the capital ships to draw fire for you while you do the heavy lifting in person, in the fighters.\nFinally, overall, the controls are /mint/ - responsive, intuitive and nothing beyond what's necessary - I played it with keyboard+mouse but heard only good things about controller mode.\n\nOverall, it's one of the most satisfying spacesims I have ever played, combat wise - everything is very deadly and very mortal; particularly with the more daring module choices, you gonna be burning lot of fighters and killing minor enemies to get a fresh reinforcement so you can go be suicidal again.\n\nAll in all - excellent game, but BIT content scarce and short (I finished it in 3 days of being technically at work (homeworking)) with all missions on hardest difficulty. Still, I am not mad about the cash I spent, but definitely hope the devs gonna at least come up with a cheap meaty DLC or something.\n\n(I've been playing the game in \"non-steam\" mode which is why I have nearly no time counted - the real time count for me is somewhere around ~10 hours I would guess. That's how long it took me to beat all missions on the 3rd (hardest) difficulty, and then one time over on the 4th special one.)\n", "timestamp_created": 1500053365, "timestamp_updated": 1500053365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33442456": {"recommendationid": "33442456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237735502", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499723405}, "language": "english", "review": "My PC is too far outside of my play area to play this game.

The story (and perspectives of it) was quite riveting also.

Your ship is the Executor Mk 2, a highly customizable interceptor for a variety of playstyles (Have you ever played a space sim that allowed you to sit back and snipe?). You go from system to system, hunting down traitors who assisted in killing the emperor until...well I won't spoil it but it is a rather crazy twist ending, which also explains a game mechanic.\n\nIt's got the best Mouse and keyboard style controls I've ever used in a space sim. Fantastic sound design and despite it being low poly, a slick art style when it comes to ship design (Well at least yours, the enemies seem a little clunky at times). \n\nIt even does that mission select where you can replay harder variants of missions to earn more rewards. A particular favorite of smaller developers for some reason. Regardless I love this mechanic, and it does ablate the worst problem about this game.

The game is simple and to the point. \n\nYou hop in your interceptor and slaughter your enemies. \n\nThat's it. You're outnumbered, outgunned and up against traitors that overthrew the emperor. \n\nThe campaign is short, but well crafted. Each mission adds new abilities or enemies to gradually increase your skills prior to the final confrontation. There are bonus objectives and multiple difficulty levels, which can drastically alter how you approach the mission. Especially at the highest difficulty where you only have interceptors and no capital ships for backup.\n\nThe visuals are colorful, but simple, and provide enough visual feedback in the fast-paced dogfights. I don't have VR, so I can't comment on it. I tried it with a (Steam) controller, but reverted to using a mouse and keyboard instead since it plays exceptionally well with it. It's all personal preference though.\n\nAs I mentioned, the campaign isn't all that long. Maybe 6-10 hours max if you re-do all the missions at the highest difficulty for unlocks and achievements.

Thats right,  if you are good enough at the game you can kill literally every thing,  including your own ships or that big bad boss that shows up at the end of every level.  It honistly shocked me to look at the global stats of the game to see that very few people managed to do such a thing when its so easy once you have the right formula.\n\nPilot or tactical view?  I played both,  there are some instances like a bombing run that its better for the player to do it instead of the AI as unguided bombs are certaintly not a robots strength.  There are also time were keeping your eyes on every thing will help you catch those kamakazi fighters that are about to slam into your capital class ships.  Sure there are perks to doing it one way or the other and i certaintly did not use the tatical as much as i could.

Why?  its explained in the story,  for me to tell you would simply ruin it.  I personally believe the game would of been ruined had they permitted you to fly the capitals.  The AI is not overly dumb,  some time it screws up but look at it this way your human.  you screw up just as bad or worse some times.\n\nYou can be a kamakazi fighter.  3 words.  THIS IS GLORIOUS!

Oh,  and escape pods wont kill you if you decide to cleave through them in your ship,  it was pretty funny.\n\nAll in all this is a great game to me;\nWould i recomend it for the impatient?  No.\nWould i recomend it for the easily angered?  No.\nWould i recomend it for those who do not posses higher thought?  No.\n\nHow ever if you dont meet those three no's then by all means get it!  (when its on sale or something :P)\nI personally got it on sale for 12 USD  My rule of thumb is if i spend an hour per a USD and meet or exceed that the game is potentially good and considering i have almost exceeded that end completed every achivement i find it well worth the buy.\n\nNow for some of the negitives comments/tips to be aware of that i have read,  \n\nThis game is unbeatable - This game is a bit of a puzzle game.  The wrong upgrades WILL GET YOU KILLED.  There is no way around it,  you have to be flexible to play the game correctly.\n\nSome weapons will one - two shot kill you -  Learn to dodge.  there is nothing more to it.\n\nYou can not be every where at once - This is a lie,  use tatical.  every fighter is you,  you can be in all of them at any point in time.\n\nThere is nothing more then three difficulty levels - actually there are four.  and each one changes how the game plays almost entirely.  cant go guns blazing when every thing is designed to kill you at certaint ranges.\n\nLast note from me, 10/10 would complete again.\n\nThanks!", "timestamp_created": 1491776249, "timestamp_updated": 1491776249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584644", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31045241": {"recommendationid": "31045241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023253162", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509034762}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer Homeworld mag und auf Spacesim steht wird dieses Game lieben!

Great combat fun. Solid short missions. Too few for full price.[/b][/i]\n\nBite-size Freespace/Wing Commander missions. With a bit of Homeworld tactics thrown in. And some Battlestar Galactica mood sprinkled on top. Yes please!\n\nThe action is a lot of fun. Classic space fighter combat. On top of that, you have a tactical command map similar to space RTS games like Homeworld. Issue orders directly to friendly ships. Great feature, and necessary to succeed at higher difficulties.\n\nThe missions are very short. Like somebody took a full mission and cropped it to just the best fight. No build-up fights, no filler. Some may be disappointed, but I like it. Great for nights where I don't have a lot of time to play. Or I need to kill some time waiting for something else.\n\nIt is a bit sad there are so few missions, given their length. I am glad changing the difficulty changes the ships you face, thus changing the battle (for example, I went from dogfighting a corvette to bombing a missile-throwing frigate for the same mission). And there is an optional boss-like ship at the end of each. But still, there is no getting around that this title could use more missions.\n\nThe story is minimalist. There's no lengthy exposition or even dialogue really. But it does what it needs to and sets the mood. The Emperor is dead. Hunt the Traitor Lords. Bring Ruin to Their People. What else do you need to know?\n\nOverall I really like this game. I got it at full price and I think I am getting my money's worth; it fits my tastes and my schedule nicely.

I picked it up on a 40% off sale just to see what it was like. I didn't have high expectations since most VR games are absolute garbage. I played Elite Dangerous and was very disappointed. With how bad most VR games were, I was skeptical to get Eve: Valkyrie for $60. This was only $12 so I figured that I wasn't out much money if it turned out to be a flop. This game is really good. I play using the Steam Controller and it is really good.\n\nFirst, the graphics are okay. I use an RX 480 and many VR games are not too optimized, this included. I had to turn the graphics down to 80%. It still looks good and framerates are stable-ish. I do get framerate drops in the menus, but I get this on most games. It isn't as bad as those in Arizona Sunshine. Not enought to cause motion sickness. Distant text is a little blurry. If I had more GPU horsepower, this probably wouldn't be an issue. Many of the textures in the game are low-poly, which is cool but feels a little out of place with the quality of your ship and the enemy ships. This is something I would have expected from an Early Access but not from a full release.\n\nThe interface is really good. Because you are using VR, you can't see your controller. The game shows where the button is on the controller so you can feel for it. I never had any problems with button presses. There is a tutorial for the game but it could use a little work. It does show you the basics but doesn't go through ship customization. YouTube really helped out here, especially since some of the missions require using specific weapons and armor to win. I wish that more developers would push toward the motion control interface. This is my biggest complaint with most games. The cockpit is detailed but I can't interact with anything in it because there is no motion controller suppoert.\n\nThe game paces okay. In the beginning, it tells you that you may need specific loadouts to succeed at missions. This worried me a little but it wasn't all that bad. I did get hung up on some missions but after looking on YouTube for suggested builds, it went smoothly. There are some levels where enemies can one-shot your ship but this is rare. The AI, both enemy and friendly, is a little simple. I lost my ship in a fight only to find my friendly AI trying to engage the flagship. They can be micro controlled but I'm pretty lazy at this.\n\nOverall, this game is well worth the money. Even at the full price, this game has a good bit of content. Hopefully the devs keep moving forward and fixing some of these small issues. As I said before, most VR games are complete garbage and a waste of time, which is more valuable than money. This game is not one of those.

On y joue le pilote d'un chasseur parti pour un voyage sans retour pour venger l'empereur d'une trahison. Dans le titre \"House\" d\u00e9signe une maison au sens de grande famille noble. La dynastie du soleil mourant. Rien que le titre j'adore. Et donc le jeu consiste \u00e0 accomplir des missions sur un sch\u00e9ma r\u00e9p\u00e9titif simple (mais au gameplay assez bon pour compenser) afin d'\u00e9liminer un par un les tra\u00eetres \u00e0 l'empereur. C'est pour \u00e7a qu'on passe notre temps \u00e0 \u00e9liminer le duc untel ou la duchesse machin-chose. C'est d\u00e9paysant.\n\nComme r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9, le feeling est tr\u00e8s proche d'un Ace combat : compl\u00e8tement arcade. Avec cependant une r\u00e9sistance et une maniabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rentes dues \u00e0 l'espace. Chaque mission consiste en une arriv\u00e9e de l'ext\u00e9rieur vers un point central, puis un objectif principal obligatoire et un objectif secondaire optionnel, et enfin l'extraction en se t\u00e9l\u00e9portant vers une plan\u00e8te \"Rendez-vous\". Les missions : assassinat ou escorte. C'est tout. Mais non en fait car d\u00e9gommer un petit chasseur c'est facile, mais un destroyer c'est tout de suite plus compliqu\u00e9. Assassinat \u00e7a veut dire dans le jeu d\u00e9truire le vaisseau indiqu\u00e9 ou tuer le pilote s'il s'est \u00e9ject\u00e9.\n\n[list][*]Interface et gameplay[/list]\n\nL'interface est claire et pas. On a un petit \u00e9cran qui montre l'objectif et sert parfois de r\u00e9troviseur. Un syst\u00e8me simple pour la vie. Un cercle bleu c'est le bouclier. Quand il est touch\u00e9 et si on se met \u00e0 l'abri, il se r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e8re relativement rapidement. Quand il est d\u00e9truit, on peut subir un choc qui fait que syst\u00e8me d'armement tombe en panne. Et \u00e7a entame le cercle vert : la barre de vie du vaisseau, qui peut aussi se r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rer mais tr\u00e8s lentement et seulement apr\u00e8s le cercle bleu. On retrouve un syst\u00e8me \u00e9quivalent dans X3 par exemple. Et on a un radar. Le souci c'est le choix bizarre des couleurs : Bleu = ennemis / orange = alli\u00e9s / Vert = civil / Cible \u00e0 assassiner = orange. C'est tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s troublant.\n\nAu fur et \u00e0 mesure de la campagne, on se voit octroyer des alli\u00e9s : d'autres chasseurs, des destroyers, une fr\u00e9gate. On peut prendre le contr\u00f4le des autres chasseurs en perdant le sien. Malheureusement on ne peut pas piloter un vaisseau plus gros. On peut juste leur assigner des ordres sur une carte tactique. Soit en pointant un alli\u00e9, \u00e0 ce moment on peut l'envoyer \u00e0 un point ou lui ordonner de d\u00e9fendre un vaisseau ; soit en pointant un ennemi, et l\u00e0 on peut indiquer avec quelle classe de nos vaisseaux l'attaquer.\nEn fin de partie, notre flotte max comporte 3 chasseurs, 3 destroyers et 1 fr\u00e9gate. C'est beaucoup et peu en m\u00eame temps vu ce qui nous arrive sur la tronche. Pour chaque classe on peut s\u00e9lectionner deux upgrades et deux ou trois armes. Tous avec un avantage/inconv\u00e9nient. Certains boucliers sont plus solides mais r\u00e9duisent le booster par exemple. Certaines armes entament bien le bouclier mais ne font quasi rien \u00e0 la barre de vie. S'il y a peu d'armes diff\u00e9rentes (8 seulement), il y a en revanche 15 am\u00e9liorations diff\u00e9rentes, certaines tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes d'ailleurs. \n\n[list][*]Un mot au sujet de la dur\u00e9e[/list]\n\nLe gros d\u00e9faut, c'est la dur\u00e9e : 5-6 heures. Il y a cependant un mode \"challenge\", en fait un mode survie avec des vagues successives infinies d'ennemis. Et 4 niveaux de difficult\u00e9. Celle de base en facile pr\u00e9sente un d\u00e9fi \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Les deux autres ajoutent plus de vaisseaux ennemis ou des gros vaisseaux. Le dernier mode s'obtient en finissant le jeu. Il permet d'affronter des ennemis fous furieux... en ayant seulement des chasseurs. Honn\u00eatement vu comment certains ennemis piquent fort, \u00e7a semble quasi-infaisable. Les destroyers ennemis ont des lasers qui piquent fort et les fr\u00e9gates ennemies, un laser qui pique tr\u00e8s fort et qui sait viser juste.\n\n[list][*]Etats d'\u00e2me[/list]\n\nIl avait atterri dans ma wishlist \u00e0 cause des combats spatiaux, du style graphique pas moche et du trailer bien rythm\u00e9. Ce qui me retenait de franchir le pas : le fait que ce soit conseill\u00e9 VR m'inqui\u00e9tait quant au rendu en normal sans VR ; le jeu semblait cher en rapport prix/dur\u00e9e car je lisais partout fini en moins 6 heures.\nJ'ai travers\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents \u00e9tats d'esprit au fil du jeu. D'abord la hype de pouvoir y jouer. Puis la satisfaction devant la maniabilit\u00e9 impeccable tr\u00e8s proche d'un Ace Combat. Une phase de lassitude \u00e0 cause de la r\u00e9p\u00e9titivit\u00e9 des missions. De la d\u00e9ception de ne pas pouvoir piloter les vaisseaux plus gros mais seulement mon tout petit chasseur. Un grand sourire en comprenant comment utiliser la carte tactique, m\u00eal\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9nervement de devoir syst\u00e9matiquement envoyer un vaisseau plus gros s'occuper des gros ennemis sous peine de suicide syst\u00e9matique. De l'\u00e9merveillement devant un truc vu seulement dans un Ace Combat auparavant. Un gros wahoo pendant la mission finale en me disant que \u00e7a rattrapait bien tout le reste. Et puis un peu de d\u00e9ception quand m\u00eame parce que 6 heures c'est quand m\u00eame vachement court. Cependant c'\u00e9tait en facile, \u00e7a peut se rejouer en normal et difficile. Et le facile \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pas toujours si facile.\n\n[h1]En bref[/h1]\n\n+ graphiquement agr\u00e9able, m\u00eame sans VR ; le choix des coloris rappelle celui d'X3\n+ un aspect tactique int\u00e9ressant\n+ une fin grandiose\n+ enti\u00e8rement reconfigurable, pour la manette ou le clavier : \u00e7a permet d'assigner des boutons pour voir lat\u00e9ralement ou au-dessus du cockpit ; \u00e0 la manette il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 tout juste assez de boutons, par contre c'est tr\u00e8s maniable.

Boring is another word. ED is trying so hard to be \"realistic\" that you also notice everything that's not or is \"non-Euclidean\" so to speak. ED is pretty, HoTS is cool enough.

Go play the early X-Wing / TIE Fighter games, or the Wing Commander series. They should offer a much better experience in exchange for the lower immersion of a flat screen and older graphics.\n\nAt the time of this review I've played the game for more than 11 hours, which is far longer than you actually need to beat the game, so clearly I enjoyed it a lot. But I enjoyed it in spite of one very glaring flaw: this game is ridiculously easy. Now, it's been decades since I last played [i]Star Wars: TIE Fighter[/i], and I was practically a baby at the time, but the one thing I still remember so strongly about it is how hard it was.\n\n[i]Dying Sun[/i]'s difficulty curve is nonexistent, but for both good and bad reasons. What's good about this game's (lack of) difficulty is that the controls definitely aren't going to get in the way, like they seem to in so many other flight / space combat games. They are smooth and streamlined, while allowing some fun and complex maneuvers using the drift button.\n\nWhat's not so good is the progression structure of the missions. If you can't beat a mission at the highest difficulty, you can just beat it at a lower difficulty, and still get the exact same reward (plus a slightly lower number of upgrade points), which is usually a fleet upgrade, just as if you had beaten it at the higher difficulty. Then, you can just play that mission again at the higher difficulty using your now beefed-up fleet. Though still depressing, a slightly less absurd progression would be to play the whole game on the lowest difficulty to get all the fleet upgrades, then go back to the beginning and play it again on the highest difficulty using your now wildly overpowered fleet.\n\nEither way, it's grinding, and while you aren't [i]required[/i] to play it this way, it suggests that the missions haven't been carefully balanced to offer exactly the right amount of difficulty for progressing in a completely linear fashion on the highest difficulty, which is how games are supposed to be played.\n\nNone of the above is really a deal-breaker though; if you have enough discipline you can force yourself to only ever play missions on the highest difficulty, and then it's sort of an okay game, but still ridiculously easy compared to early masterpieces of the genre.\n\nYou can artificially increase the difficulty for yourself even more by trying to kill all the traitor flagships. But this deprives you of the fun of trying to escape before the flagship arrives. The best moments in the game come when you have just completed all objectives, and the flagship warps in close by and you're trying to warp out before your ship gets hit by all its incoming missiles. There is a wondrous moment of exhilaration as you warp out, knowing that you were just seconds away from getting blown to smitherines.\n\nIf you instead wait around and actually try to kill the flagship, I noticed that both in the music and in my own emotional state, there was a very noticeable deadening of excitement and slowing of the game's pace. So it seems this game is about warping into traitor territory, exterminating the human garbage who were complicit in the murder of our glorious Emperor, and then warping out as quickly as possible. You just need to make sure you play it that way to get the most enjoyment.\n\nIt's also drop-dead gorgeous, epic even, in virtual reality. The graphics look stupid and amateurish on flat screens, especially in screenshots; you [i]have[/i] to play it VR to feel the full effect of the colorful environments, and for the VR lenses' godrays to accentuate the dramatic white-on-black text announcing the death of the Emperor and your mission to kill all the traitors. But the visuals are not the biggest winner here -- that prize has to go to the game's sound design, which effectively makes it way more immersive and breathtaking than it deserves to be.\n\nThis game should really be a 3/5, but when I look at all the other flight/space games that are around nowadays, all I see is rubbish.

Equipping a choice of a few different weapons (7) on your fighters, and two of (18?) upgrades is a decent compensation though.\n*Short campaign - Its a small price tag, and you unfortunately feel it.

You fly a fighter, you're supported by a couple of NPC capital ships, and you can go into a Homeworld-style real-time-with-pause tactical map to get a 'big picture' view and issue more specific orders than \"shoot this/bomb this/guard this/kamikaze into this\".\n\nThere's also a 'wave' mode; destroyed fighters get respawned if you get enough kills, but capital ships stay dead until the end of the mission, so you need to husband them.\n\nThe story's quite good. Fairly understated; you can ignore it if you just want to shoot things and watch the pretty lights. Pity about the war-crimes, but you knew you were flying for the bad guys when you started.

It has some nice qualities but in the end, after few missions in - I find myself just continually restarting over and over and over.  I was hoping this was going to be a new wing commander / descent freespace but sadly it's not even close for being fun.\n\nPros - \ngood sound and graphics. The subtle jump in thumps and radio chatter was nice.\neasy to track targets\nupgrading feature for your ship gives incentive beyond just clearing missions\n\nCons - \n-Idiotic wingman (even after you give them commands) - pretty much die instantly going after sentry guns or anything that has any form of firepower (apparently from other comments by players - you have to constantly fly avoidance patterns) - they should teach wingmen how to do that. I personally wish i could tell them to sit out of range and after I use my heavy weapon switch to them and use theirs intelligently.\n\n-Unofficial time limits. It would be nice to apply better tactics (like trying to fly toward a different approach of a ship).  But you don't have the time.  a \"traitor\" flagship always jumps in about 5 minutes in that will destroy you flat out.\n\n-limited heavy weapons to use (if you wanted to take out a ship).  How many?  ONE (torpedo - long range)  2 bombs - close but you have to get very close then if you can survive getting that close..  You can target their subysystem (bridge) from afar with a torpedo - and if you hit it - great. If not - RESTART .(you can try to jump to another fighter in your squad - assuming they haven't been squashed).\n\n-upgrades- spend favor points to get them. But to get any decent amount of them you have to fly warlord or last - in which again you will be squashed pretty quick and you will have to RESTART again and again (and you only get them for \"bonus\" objectives - not the main mission.\n", "timestamp_created": 1483026712, "timestamp_updated": 1483026712, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28777748": {"recommendationid": "28777748", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961110553", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482986049}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game! beat the main campaign in 3.5 hours total on the level 2 difficulty - Wish it were as long as freespace 2 was.", "timestamp_created": 1482986174, "timestamp_updated": 1482986174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28774121": {"recommendationid": "28774121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000900149", "num_games_owned": 704, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482975908}, "language": "english", "review": "Above-average space dogfighting game with WH40k tendencies that becomes incredible in VR.

Would be great for some voice over interaction as well, like an intro vid about the assassination, mission briefings, maybe even have a few of the lords pleading for their lives or something. \n\nThe Missions again are fun, but they sometimes feel to short. It would be great to see more stages for some missions, and more types of missions other than warp in kill a few targets then warp out.\n\nI don't feel the $19.99 usd price tag is too much for what you get, there is some extended replayability with the challange mode and all the achievements.

[/b]\n\nOH. MY. GOD.  Ya know what?  Ignore these negative reviews you see smearing the front of the page.  This feels like it might be one of my new favorite games.\nThis game is the [i] epitome [/i] of what I've always wanted from my sci-fi fantasy of piloting an intergalactic fighter ship.  This is hands down THE space-flight-combat game I've always wanted.  What makes it so good?\n[u] Atmosphere [/u]\nThe atmosphere and game design align with predicted realism perfectly.  What you see here looks- and FEELS- like how you would hope and expect a starship to function in real life.  There are tons of little details carefully put on your ship's dashboard.  The weapons systems are designed in a very detailed manner that look like they are physical guns protruding from your ship.  The game feels so atmospheric that going into warp drive made me lean back in my chair almost by instinct, as if I was actually being pushed back in the chair.  It's an absolutely visceral experience. The natural maps are designed in a way that almost feels like an acceptably-realistic cosmic nebula.  Contributing to the atmosphere is the AI. Many ships seem to coordinate with fleets and attack in a way that feels natural and epic.\n[u] Gameplay [/u]\nIt's actually fairly simple.  This is why I'm not sure if I'd reccommend the game if it isn't in VR, since VR enhances the experience and catalyzes the gameplay so well that it makes the game awesome.  \nMost of the time, you start the game by warping into a zone where it shows your fleet as if it were a real-time-strategy game.  To be honest, though, it really is not an RTS.  From that screen, you assume the perspective of a ship.  You then must follow objectives that usually follow the lines of \"blow up this, kill them, protect these guys, then escape.\"  To be honest, yeah it's a bit generic.  However, I'd say that this is the standard generic formula done almost perfectly.\nThere are a few weapons, and you can switch between three at any given moment (one standard, one short-range weapon, and one heavy).  When you're trying to escape the scene, an enemy flagship will come.  Although I don't know if you can actually kill them yet, they are boss-battle status difficult, and are meant to signal that you need to leave.  However, their approach feels intense and panic-inducing; warping out just in the nick of time leaves you panting, and having the flapship launch dozens of heat-seeking missles (only for your avoiding them to be unlikely) makes you feel like that epic martyr in any sci-fi movie that dies in this exact cliche cinematic sequence.\n[u] Sound Design [/u] \nGiven the VR presence, this might be one of the best things about the game.  All the sounds coming from outside the ship feels realistically muted, as if you were hearing it in space or at least hearing it from within a sealed cockpit.  The sounds are all extremely bass heavy and just sound incredibly cool.  Reloading your gun makes a nice and satisfying \"whirring\" sound, switching weapons makes a loud clunk, explosions sound deep and thump-ey.  When warping out of the scene, there is a certain sense of beeping sounds that are \"just right.\"  Everything about the sound is amazing.  \n[u] VR Implementation [/u]\nThis is the first VR game I've played that realistically makes you feel like you're sitting in a cockpit.  Unlike games like EVE: Valkyrie or Gunjack, you do not aim with your head.  You play with either a controller (which I actually strongly reccommend) or mouse and keyboard.  Rather, you can actually look around using your head.  Your windshield is huge, so you can effectively gander throughout a huge field of view.  As you're chasing down enemies, you can spot them out of the corner of your eye through the side window.  It's so cool!! \nThe game also runs very, very well, especially considering my use of VR.  It takes a little while to launch, but the performance is generally pretty good.  \n\nOverall, if you're thinking about this game for VR, get it right away.

Your mission is simple: hunt down the lords who betrayed the emperor, and execute them. This simple premise is backed up by killer music, sound design, and a mission structure which will at once make you feel like an unstoppable force of interstellar destruction, while also leave you biting your nails and praying for your ship's hyperdrive to warm up juuuuuust a little faster.\n\nIn terms of structure, the missions all have relatively the same idea: jump into a new system, hit your target, and bug out before reinforcements arrive. But behind that simple structure, each mission is its own puzzle that forces you to consider upgrades, target priorities, and your own role in order to accomplish the mission.\n\nThe gameplay is simple to understand yet provides a shocking amount of depth. For the first few missions you'll be focused soley on your own dog-fighting. As you grow your fleet you'll find yourself frequently flipping between your cockpit and your tactical overview. You might order a group of destroyers to hit a high value you target, send your wingman to distract the enemy fighter screen, then flip back to your cockpit to bomb a target, then flip back to tactical and take control of your wingman's ship, letting the AI take control of the fighter you wer using. \n\nWith all of that said, HotDS may not be everyone's cup of tea.

However I couldn't keep myself from playing it, and I am glad that I did. \n\nYou play as (what I presume) one of the bad guys, noticeable by the color scheme; Enemies are blue and you and your allies are red on the radar. Some of the mission descriptions reinforce this theory, but I won't spoil it for you.\n\nThe flight controls are made near-perfect by the simple mechanic of \"drifting\"; Boost your speed up in one way, hold down the Drift-button and you can turn around while still going in your original way. Much like how a car can drift. Very neat.\n\nThe story is sparse, you get two or three sentences before each mission explaining who you will fight, and why you should kill them, and the game then throws you into the mission.

Sadly, it's let down by a dire lack of content and an overall game design I found very unfulfilling.\n\nThe game is kind of \"mechanical\" to a fault, with little flavor to the between mission presentation beyond an inspired font choice.  What story you get is in very short text blurbs.  It has only 14 missions and it's intended for you to play those missions multiple times at progressively higher difficulties; but while the missions do change a bit between difficulties (mostly just additional ships), they're still not different enough that I'd take their slight variations in lieu of a more lengthy traditional campaign.\n\nIn addition to the small number of missions, they also go by too quickly.  Every mission has a hard time limit enforced by a more or less unbeatable ship warping in.  You're constantly being rushed to the extent that you barely have time to take in what's going on in a mission.  I often failed missions not because I was killed, but rather because I actually tried to enjoy dogfighting a bit instead of just making a beeline for the objective, and ran out of time.  I personally think that being under a time limit in a game is rarely enjoyable and here's an entire game built around that concept.\n\nIn my hour with the game I already got through 10 of the 14 missions and at that point I had to evaluate whether I had any interest in playing them again and again to get my money's worth.  I just couldn't see myself doing that, so I had to make the somewhat tough choice to return the game.\n\nHotDS isn't bad, in some ways it's quite good, but for me, that kind of makes it all the more massively disappointing because all I could see when I played it is the missed potential for something so much better.  I wish the game had a slightly larger team behind it that could create a campaign that more closely resembled the story based space fighters of yore.

It is straight to the action, no grinding, intuitive controls, graphics that work beautifully even on my almost decade-old machine (with a 4 year old card) at 1920x1200, allows you to progress and increase your forces, and has high replayability.  I think a lot of the criticism comes from folks that wanted more out of this, like maybe an Elite competitor.  It's not as deep as Elite, but also isn't nearly as long-winded, complicated, or grind-ey as elite is.  It doesn't take hours to get to combat, the combat is deep enough to be satisfying, and the weapons are easily used but still fun to master.  \n\nThis should be viewed essentially as a puzzle game with first person space sim combat being the way you solve the puzzle.  It has all of the fun action of a game like X-Wing (if you are old enough to remember that), but the missions are really not that deep and admittedly pretty cookie-cutter, and I would say not as frustrating either.   Be prepared to die often in the beginning, and embrace it, because the wins will come fast.  It works with Track IR, which is a great bonus and a good reason to buy if you already made that investment.  This is one of the few games I found myself going back to old missions to see if I could do better vs. chasing newer missions to level up.\n\nI would ding it on not having a map editor or Steam Workshop access, but my guess is that games like Elite sap a lot of the audience and the developer just wanted to deliver on the dream he promised, and he did.

The only things I have yet to do are finish the hard and expert level difficulties of all the missions, but really they are not much different from the previous difficulties.\n\nIt\u2019s a mixed bag for this game, and I\u2019ll list why below. I\u2019m going to recommend it because I\u2019m finding it sort of difficult to find any decent VR games that aren\u2019t just a 3rd person perspective camera with movement linked to your head. Cockpit games just have the edge in VR.\n\nPROS:\n- A decent VR (Played with the Rift) cockpit space fighting game where you command a growing squad\n- The combat is good too, good pacing and you\u2019re able to change out your weapons and ship upgrades for slightly different play styles\n- Supports the X-55 Rhino Saitek joysticks, though as usual you will need to figure out the mapping. ( I actually ended up using the Xbox One controller, which worked perfectly)\n\nCONS:\n- Lack of content. Probably the biggest downfall of this game, there just simply isn't enough content. I was able play the game to what I'm considering completion in 4 hours.\n- The squad management screen can be annoying at times, when you're trying to cycle through your units and just can't seem to get the right unit selected.\n- While able to buy upgrades to get more stuff, once you get the first 5 upgrades, there really is no driving force to get the other ones other than preference or curiosity.

Controls feel very smooth and intuitive on an XBone controller, and I appreciated the Homeworld-like feel of the tactical map. Drift mode also blew my mind\u2014there's something immensely satisfying about flipping around backwards without changing trajectory and shooting down a pursuer. \n\nI do agree with others that the campaign itself is short\u2014it took about 5 hours to get through the first time around, and I just completed all achievements in 20 hours.

Lot of complaints about how little content there is - and I guess that a concern if you value quantity over quality.  If you want a game that has 200 hours of dull, grinding gameplay, go play some Elite Dangerous.  Have fun carting around cargo from star system to star system, if that's what does it for you.  Maybe after 300 hours you can even afford a decent ship.\n\nThis game is not overprised.  They've focused on stellar gameplay instead of sprawling content.  It's not a game that tries to annoy you into DLC purchases, like EVERY OTHER SPACE SIM out there right now.  No, you can't pay an extra fifty dollars for the spiffy boa-constrictor ship so you can easily annihilate all your friends online.  The game is what it is, and it was made to be as fun as possible.  No fluff, no load times (seriously, none at all), no monotonous jumping from cookie cutter system to cookie cutter system.  It's 100% action.\n\nHotDS takes all the best gameplay elements of Freespace, Xwing, and Wing Commander and squeezes it into a few heart-pounding missions.  The controls are amazing - imagine drifting past a carrier as you drop a salvo of dumbfire torpedoes, then blink-driving across the battlefield just before you get slammed by a volley of missiles.  Each mission is short by design, if you haven't taken out your target in five minutes, you're in for a world of hurt as reinforcements come in.  Replaying a difficult mission 10 times doesn't feel like suffering - there's no load times, so when all your interceptors die, you go right back into the action.  \n\nIf you like space sims from the golden era of space sims, this one is a must buy.  It took me 5 hours to three star all the missions, but I think it's going to take that much time again to beat all the missions on the bonus difficulty.  I'm going to enjoy every minute. \n\nIf you don't like dogfighting but would rather play space trader, then go buy elite dangerous.

That focus is on two things: dogfighting and atmosphere. In those two areas, the game shines.\n\nThe feel of piloting the Interceptor is just so tight, so intuitive, you're flying like an ace pilot within minutes.\n\nThe art style is mature, consistent, and bold. From the flare of local suns as your fleet drops out of warp, to the pseudo-polygonal ship designs, to the sleek UI of the Interceptor's targeting system, the polish is remarkable. The audio design is also notable, with almost all sound being suppressed and distorted in some subtle way to enhance the feeling that space is truly just outside your tiny cockpit.\n\nThe game suffers from lack of variety, lack of content, and in my opinion, lack of difficulty. The missions, while beautifully hand-designed, are just too short and too unvaried to provide any lasting stimulation. This isn't like X-Wing of old, with multi-stage missions where you're updated with new objectives as you complete current ones, moving through phases of a battle. You're given one main objective as soon as you warp in, and a single bonus objective. Most missions are over within a few short minutes. These are always skirmish battles, which is where the lack of variety in mission type comes in. At only 14 missions plus the challenge mode, I'm already feeling heavy-hearted in recognizing this dearth of content isn't going to be able to bring me back over and over again. Which is such a shame!\n\nHaving played on all three difficulty levels, my ship was only ever destroyed when I rammed into something by accident, or when the flagship arrived and I dallied too long. While the combat is fun and satisfying, it is not very challenging.\n\nAs far as customization goes, there isn't much. You get to pilot one ship, the Interceptor, and there are a couple handfuls of weapon and armour upgrades.\n\nThe tactical aspect of the game is the only area where House of the Dying Sun's tight design falters. The tactical UI is confusing, and it just feels unnecessary. As I said previously, I was never in much danger so there wasn't much incentive to mess around with my fleet's orders, unlike a game like Mount & Blade where unit orders can really change the course of a battle.\n\nFinally, I'd like to give a nod to the lore of the game. The worldbuilding is done in a very effective manner which makes use of evocative titles, great font, and brevity. The universe is hinted at through these things, letting you fill in the details with your imagination. You end up with vague impressions of who these people are and where they come from, and what the Empire might have been like. Which is great.\n\n***\n\nOverall, I can definitely recommend this game. I recommend it to people who love unique experiences, and who relish a game which can produce a very specific feel when played. If you love dogfighting, appreciate excellent and tightly focussed design, and don't mind how short the game is (it is very, very short), get this game. The current price point feels much too expensive to me for what you're getting; I feel like I'm paying for art and sound more than gameplay content, which is not what I expect from a game labelled as a tactical space shooter.

I'll explain why in a minute.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a quick fix for their space sim needs.\n\nIf you're expecting an epic space opera, you might want to look elsewhere. The story that ties together everything is a little on the abstract side. Personally I thought it was intriguing. The developer has said there won't be any additional single-player content added in to expand on the story, which is a shame. I do hope that they come back to that eventually.\n\nGameplay is excellent - if you're a veteran of space sims like Evochron, Elite, or the X series of games, you should feel right at home. Controls feel good, especially with a HOTAS, and TrackIR is supported so that adds quite a bit to the immersion factor. (I can only imagine what it's like with a VR headset.)\n\nThe visuals are good too. I like the colorful backdrops and the game runs smoothly on my rig. \n\nThere's an aspect to the game that I thought was fairly interesting as well, and that's the ability to command your ships individually by \"hotswapping\" between fighters and issuing orders to your capital ships in a way similar to Homeworld. It's not my preferred method (I like the radials because I can stay in the fight) but it might strike some people's fancy to switch between flight sim and strategy game.\n\nNow, the reason why I suggested playing on Harbinger difficulty: The game is short, the missions are straightforward, but they can be very brutal and therefore very satisfying if you play it on the highest difficulty. Some missions can be completed in a matter of two or three minutes (and that's on the long end of things) but that doesn't mean it's going to be easy. Some of them you'll have to white-knuckle all the way, lest your capital ships and supporting wingmen get annihilated. Trust me, you'll need them. This is especially true in the early stages of the game when it's just you and possibly one other interceptor. There's one mission in particular that gave me a lot of trouble for the sheer fact that I simply didn't have the firepower to take down the target before the enemy flagship arrived and started lighting me up. \n\nAnd I love that about the game - you really do feel like you're under the gun all the time and if you're not focused on achieving your primary objective, you're going to lose ships. Because of the \"warp out\" mechanic, it is entirely possible to get destroyed and failing the mission despite achieving the objectives. Happened to me a few times. So don't stick around if you're feeling the heat.\n\nAll in all it's a pretty quick play.

On low difficulty, you can easily complete all of the campaign missions in under 2 hours.\n\nThis is adjusted for by having multiple difficulty levels for each mission which significantly increases the difficulty for each step up you go. This also increases the time it takes to complete each mission, which makes up for how short missions can be on lower difficulty ranks. If it were up to me, I would probably increase the health of all ships and rebalance everything to make the engagements more lengthy affairs.\n\nAs mentioned, the fleet system is nice and the interface is very well done. The upgrade system is a bit underwhelming as there are some clearly better upgrades over others and some upgrades have such high purchase requirements that by the time you actually get the upgrade, you'll have basically had to do everything in the game thrice over already and might not even be inclined to keep playing.\n\nIt's difficult to say whether \u00a314.99 is worth it for this length of an experience, but I would verge on yes.

Juego hermoso en donde todo es preciso. Han traicionado y matado al emperador, su ultimo deseo, eliminar a todos los que desertaron de el, como a los seguidores de ellos. Una corta premisa para dar paso a un juego de una calidad tan excelente, con graficos increibles para un juego de naves, muy pulido, su estilo poligonal le da un toque nunca antes visto en algo de esta categoria, escenarios grandes y coloridos, las nubes espaciales se ven hermosas, los efectos son fuertes y adrenalinicos. En resumen, graficamente espectacular, y ya imagino como se veria en VR, ya que esta exclusivamente dise\u00f1ado para ello. Una jugabilidad inigualable, con un excelente formato de lock on contra enemigos, drifts espaciales para girar mas rapido, menus finos acordes a la atmosfera, sistema de ordenes genial e intuitivo, mezcla entre un RTS y un FPS, sistema de ordenes para tus compa\u00f1eros. Sigue sumando puntos en este momento. En terminos de sonido, un deleite. Banda sonora llena de accion y hecha exclusivamente para este tipo de atmosfera, no se vuelve molesta y le da ese toque especial cuando la batalla se pone extremadamente epica, pero lo que se lleva el 10 en los sonidos es estar dentro de la nave, los sonidos se escuchan como deberian, silenciados por estar dentro de la cabina y obviamente por el vacio espacial que nos rodea, realmente te mete en la atmosfera con unos audifonos buenos, sobretodo cuando alguna nave lanza misiles contra ti y puedes ver como se acercan mientras la nave te da la alarma de esquive, espeluznante y lleno de accion al maximo.\n\nYa me lo he terminado, y el final es hermoso, rico en accion y brutal en su historia. Son pocas misiones, pero la verdad, ni siquiera me importa ya que el valor de replay es muchisimo en dificultades mas altas, sobretodo en el challenge mode, el cual pone a prueba todas tus capacidades de piloto. Cabe destacar que el creador esta en constante contacto con la comunidad, si existe un bug, puedes publicarlo y te contesta dentro de un rato para actualizar el juego. Que mas se puede pedir?\n\nEste juego merece ser mas conocido, y si alguien lee este review, por favor, gaste su dinero en esto, no se arrepentiran.

The obvious comparison point is Tie Fighter (or perhaps Freespace 2), but it ditches the bar-management of late-90s military space sims to give the in-cockpit gameplay a lot more of an arcade feel, that ends up.. Similar to Strike Suit Zero, but with the animation & soundwork making it a much more immersive experience than that.\n\nPlot is minimal; You're the last.. You of a beaten empire, and your emperor's last edict is that you kill everyone who betrayed him. ..And anyone who works for them, watches their cat, goes to the same cafe for lunch, etc. You are not the Good Guys here. You are the diehard loyalists to The Empire, in the tropiest sense of the name, and it adds a lot to the tone that the player is put in that position in no uncertain terms. Every mission is titled \"Murder at _____\", and often your bonuses (which give precious upgrade points) are to, yes, turn innocent construction workers/whathaveyou into pink space-mist.\n\nThis may be offputting to some, but.. I find it adds to the Tie-Fighter link, while giving the game room to breathe verymuch as its Own Thing.\n\nWhat I haven't touched on yet is what HotDS adds in terms of tactics; You may be thinking that without the bar management, this reduces the game to a simple point-n-shoot. But as the game progresses, you go from a lone fighter with a mean grudge to a small fleet (with a mean grudge). Your fighters become troops for you to command on the zoomed-out management map, as well as doubling as precious extra lives for when you mess up. Your other ships are More Punch in various sizes (orderable, but not controllable directly). All can be upgraded with aforementioned Upgrade Points.\n\nI haven't played Challenge Mode, so can't comment on that, but the core gameplay is enough that I don't mind early-access savewipes with updates, which says a lot. I've happily played through the earlygame 3 times now, and will probably again. It's just.. That solid in terms of gameplay. Pick your difficulty right, and you're constantly on the edge of your seat, with the timer counting down to when the enemy's Flagship arrives, slowly meanders across the battlefield, and squishes you into space-dirt with the ease of an elephant seal rolling over in its sleep.\n\nBasically, buy this game if:\n* You like your spacefighter games more structured and less trucker-y\n* You like being the Bad Guy\n* You like a challenge\n* You like tense, hit-n-run gameplay.\n* You played & enjoyed X-Wing/Tie Fighter, Freespace, etc.\n* You enjoy tactical management, while being able to get into the thick of things yourself.\n\nDon't buy this if:\n* You want a lot of plot, scripted events, indepth voice-acting, deep worldbuilding & characters.

Adding to that the ability to pause the game and examine the situation on the tactical-map is also quite excellent, as that supports depth being added to the game (eg. stronger  shield/armor/countermeasure considerations), such as explicitly commanding your long-range units to disable a ship's engines so the slower craft can catch up. There's also fun details such as most ship shielding being large enough that brave fighters can actually fly through and directly hammer on the hull (eg. with the shotgun), which adds neat \"seeing the whites of their eyes\" experiences.\n\nThe time-pressure on each scenario (in the form of a capital ship always hunting you down) is also quite interesting, as it means each attempt on a level is both short (success or failure), and feels like a puzzle whenever your current armada is well-matched to the current difficulty (each scenario has three difficulties for replayability).\n\nOn a side note, I'm also very thankful for the flat-shaded graphical style, both for the Homeworld-nostalgia (which is quite substantial), but also to make sure this game plays smoothly in VR.

I grabbed it during the 2016 Summer Sale and didn't regret it.  What's most surprising is the amount of polish House of the Dying Sun has.  It runs smoothly, controls perfectly (with my PS4 controller, that is), and feels like a complete product, not an Early Access game.  \n\nThe gameplay is lighting quick.  With a couple of exceptions, each battle is framed as a hit-and-run mission.  You're encouraged to only focus upon completing the primary objective, dealing with immediate threats in the way, completing the bonus objective if time permits, and then successfully warping out before the enemy Flagship arrives.  Thus, battles are finished within less than 10 minutes.  Trying to clear out every single enemy provides no bonus and is a foolish idea in most situations, especially since you're often heavily outgunned and won't have any effective options to deal with the Flagship until the last couple of missions.\n\nYou're encouraged to use the tactical view and give orders to the starships, doubly so on the higher difficulties.  This is because while you do have the edge in firepower, your fleet mostly consists of 'glass cannons' and will easily be wiped out by the superior numbers and capital ships the enemy often receives each mission.  It's at this point that you'll begin to get a strong Homeworld vibe from the game, because the tactical view looks and controls much like Homeworld's, and it's indeed possible to flank enemies from above or below - this is three-dimensional space, after all.  Furthermore, each time a ship surivives a mission, it gains experience.  It's most notable with the Interceptors, who will be more intelligent during bombing runs, deal with enemy fighters on their tails more effectively, and dodge incoming fire - something the standard rank Interceptors kinda suck at. \n\nThe sound design is EXCELLENT.  The developer chose to go for a more realisitc muffled audio for everything outside of the fighter, and allowing the player to hear all of the subtle noises inside the cockpit, including the pilot's breathing and background radio chatter.  The few times you hear a loud bang become notable and worrisome, because it means that you suffered a direct hit and may see the damage in the form of cracking glass or loose parts on the exterior hull.  The music  and it's drums only help to add to the game.\n\nHowever, the biggest complaint that everyone else has - that the game is too short - is indeed true.  Chances are that if you were to play only the easy mode you'll end up beating the game in 3 - 4 hours.  Granted it took me longer to beat the game due to playing on the normal and hard difficulties, not to mention unlocking all of the upgrades, and finally trying out the survival mode, (hence why I have 12 hours on record), but that's still not very much.  And it's not because the game is incomplete either - with the recent addition of the survival mode, we're probably not going to see much else added before the game is finally considered a finished product.\n\n\nNOTE: I don't own a VR headset, so I can't give any critique on that aspect of the game.\n\n\n\nTL;DR?

You can customize loadouts to suit a particular mission, issue commands to divide and conquer objectives, and pursue secondary goals while racing the clock to get out before the enemy flagship (a heavily armed missile cruiser) FTLs in. It's exciting. Seriously.\n\nThere are some interesting tactics that you won't get with other aerial combat games: using a tactical FTL fold to close in to an enemy face to face, instantly turning around with inertia, hitting the brakes, and ending up inside his energy shield. Target a subsystem (such as engines) and blast away with the canister shot. Stay in his wash and his weapons can't hit you and his shields can't protect him. It's a potent tactic you won't find in Freespace / IWar games.\n\nThis game has an interesting bedfellow, a Square Enix 360-exclusive Project Sylpheed. They both have fleet-on-fleet action where the strike fighters play a pivotal role in taking down subsystems and providing much-needed fighter screen. To a lesser extent, Strike Suit Zero and Macross VO hit the same sweet spot.\n\nIf this game was purely about the ambiance: the Battlestar-like music, the Homeworld-like radio chatter and contrails, the fantasy sci-fi of Destiny, then you would be perfectly content watching this game on YouTube.

Il n\u2019y a que deux types d\u2019escarmouches : les assassinats de cibles prioritaires, proches du \u00ab faux empereur \u00bb et quelques missions d\u2019escorte de vos propres vaisseaux. C\u2019est tout.\nQuelle est la particularit\u00e9 du jeu ? H\u00e9 bien, c'est que vous d\u00e9marrez avec un chasseur unique et que, au fur et \u00e0 mesure de vos r\u00e9ussites, vous allez d\u00e9bloquer des vaisseaux qui vous accompagneront dans vos missions. Par exemple : lors de votre premi\u00e8re r\u00e9ussite vous d\u00e9bloquez un deuxi\u00e8me chasseur qui vous aidera dans votre mission et servira aussi de vie suppl\u00e9mentaire puisque lorsque votre chasseur est d\u00e9truit, vous prenez la place de l\u2019autre chasseur. Et lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a plus de chasseur, c\u2019est la fin de la partie et vous devez recommencer la mission.

Apr\u00e8s cela, il y a encore deux niveaux de difficult\u00e9 pour chaque mission, ce qui permet tout au mieux de tripler la dur\u00e9e de vie. On arrive donc plus ou moins \u00e0 cinq heures de dur\u00e9e de vie pour 19,99 \u20ac.\nJe trouve cela plut\u00f4t limite mais le d\u00e9veloppeur a promis l\u2019ajout d\u2019un mode horde qui pourra augmenter quelque peu la dur\u00e9e de vie du jeu pour les nombreux fans de ce mode de jeu.\n\nAu niveau de la patte graphique, je trouve cela plut\u00f4t classe sans \u00eatre exceptionnel, les couleurs sont plut\u00f4t chatoyantes et les vaisseaux plut\u00f4t bien mod\u00e9lis\u00e9s.\nL\u2019ambiance sonore par contre est excellente avec des bruitages tout \u00e0 fait dans le ton et qui renforce l\u2019immersion.

Let's try that again...\n\nIn House of the Dying Sun, you play as the [b]Dragon[/b], recently released from your centuries long cryosleep to wreak vengeance in the name of your deceased Emperor. Rebellious generals and duplicitous members of Imperial [i]Nobility[/i] have assassinated Him, triggering a final sanction and unleashing His greatest weapon upon the throneworld.\n\nI could tell you this is a stylish quick firing space first person shooter (simulation apparently now being owned solely by the sort of folk who get overly excited about the rocket equation and delta V) but you probably saw that in the video.\n\nLet's talk about how it feels like instead. It feels FAST. Even in the quietest movements there's a feeling of motility, a sense that sitting still would be pretty embarrasing. Your fighter wants to move, and with only 2 upgrade slots for your machine you will be making choices that will close the door on your \"shields and armor\" safezone to venture into hot new flavors of death dealing. Flavors like \"Kamikaze\" and \"stutterjump fly-by shotgun blasting\". \n\nLet's look at that style. Imperial equipment, all sharp edges, convex curves and aggressive coloring denoting that they are at the Top of the Food Chain, even as they fight from a position of inferiority in every mission. Witness how quickly your enemies wither under your Autocannon, how quickly your own assets fall under the guns of the Enemy, sniper turrets and torpedo-launching dreadnaughts.\n\nListen to the sound of astronomic silence, punctuated only by muffled gunfire, the thrum of your engines and the whirring of your reloading mechanisms. Read the blurbs of lore, like perfectly carved Doritos of sci-fi, just enough to get you excited, but not bored. The UI, so light and flab-free (except maybe the joystick support, but if you aren't rocking a spare 360 pad or something what are you doing here come on this is the 21st century don't you play emulated games?). \n\nIn my opinion there is definitely still a place for the minimalist, curated game. We don't need to have an indie scape littered with six million different styles of procedurally generated playing fields, all interacted with in the same manner. For Marauder to stand to their own principles and murder their own ludological children for the sake of principle is, I believe, something to applaud. \n\nBuy the game, try it out. If you're not into the short play times, simplistic upgrade trees and gamepad-focused, light Newtonian play this may not be your thing.

Also replaying each mission and completing the bonus objectives on each difficulty level is essential to obtain enough favour points to purchase the aforementioned upgrades.\nWhile there is no energy management, there are plenty of tactical options once you get other fighters and some capital ships for your fleet, both from your fighter's cockpit and by using a tactical view and your maneuverability is influenced by your speed: you will have to slow down if you want to keep that pesky enemy interceptors in your sights.\nThere is also a glide function that allows you to rotate your ship while going on a fixed direction like in Tachyon: The Fringe and some Wing Commander games, or the reimagined Battlestar Galactica. However the flight model remains stylized like in the best games of the genre, many would say it's \"arcade\" and while it may be compared to Elite with flight assist on it's the typical way old school spacesims worked: enough complexity to be deep but not too much as to require a flying license like some fighter jet simulators.\nThe game is made to work primarily with a gamepad or keyboard and mouse but after a bit of fiddling in the options it works very well with a HOTAS as well, but beware that the throttle axis also includes the afterbruner (or \"boost\" as it's called in-game) so hitting maximum speed without activating the boost by accident might be difficult if you throttle doesn't have detents. The gamepad-centric nature of the controls actually works very well with a HOTAS as the orders and some targeting and weapon functions are accessed through radial menus instead of the incredibly numerous keys of older titles in the genre, though there are optional hotkeys for targeting and weapons. To cut it short: no matter if you have a gamepad or the latest super expensive Thrustmaster army-approved metal replica of a fighter jet stick and throttle, you won't have to reach for the keyboard EVER.\nThe art style of the game is minimalistic yet striking, the music and other aspects are inspired by the Battlestar Galactica reimagining, with the sound of drums intensifying during battles and the muffled explosions, and I liked the minimalistic narrative choices as well and I won't say anything else because it's better to go in blind as I did.\nThe campaign is short but intense, while a veteran of the genere it took me something like 7 to 8 hours to complete the game, while some people said it's possible to beat it in two hours I guess they didn't unlock all the upgrades or played only one difficulty level for each mission, if you want to unlock every upgrade you might need a good five hours if you are very good.\nThere is also a challenge mode that essentially pits you against waves of enemies with a timer that gets delayed every time you kill something and an online leaderboard, also the various achievements will stretch the game to something closer to 15/20 hours.\n\nNow the tech-y stuff: the games runs very well on my Radeon HD 7770 1gb card on a i5-3470 with 8Gb of RAM (windows 7 64 bit) with frame rate problems only in the last two missions at 1280x1024 (yes, my LCD monitor is old) with full bells and whistles as well as 4x anti aliasing but nothing gamebreaking. EDIT: I've also tried the same configuration with a 1920x1080 monitor maintaining 4X anti aliasing and same lavel of detail, and the overall fluidity of the game seems to be more or less the same.\n\nIn conclusion: what are you waiting for?

Shockingly no motion sickness, the sense of 3d and of presence was very convincing, and the use of 3D really worked wonders as far as depth perception and the feeling of distance from far off ships.  The controls were not bad, but on my Steam Controller I was having difficulty resetting my profile, so I didn't end up banking my ship almost at all.  I suspect this aided in my avoiding motion sickness, but only time will tell.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's a somewhat slim, but extremely engrossing space combat game.  Play occurs on two interfaces, the tactical view for issuing commands to your fleet and assessing the battlezone, and fighter view, which places you into a ship and sends you off to engage the enemy directly.  You generally want to be doing this, as it seems like you do more damage when you are piloting a fighter than when you are telling a fighter to shoot stuff.\n\nThe story is thin, but this is a smaller experience, and the restraint lets the game get into the action very quickly.\n\nAll and all, highly recommended.

I play in VR, so it's cool that I can just sit anywhere and face anywhere. Speaking of VR, it's also implemented well. There's a subtle touch when you first boot the game where you activate the menu by pressing the button that resets the view to your current position, and points out that you can hit that button again at any time. That small attention to detail shows the consideration the dev put into VR. Other flight sims don't mention that functionality at all and bury it in the button assignments, but it's a critical part of VR. Anyway, the rest of the VR presentation really nails it. Like all things VR, it's hard to describe, but I'll say that the sense of presence is some real next level stuff.

I rarely write reviews, but when a game is so good and the achievement by its developer is that great, how can I not help such an effort by getting the good word out?\n\nAnd thats not a typo - developer. This is all done by one man. The result? It's clearly a work of passion as you can see everything work together perfectly to give this game a consistent voice. Gameplay, art style, music, UI, and even the story premise all compliment each other.\n\nMost importantly, its lots of fun. Gameplay harkens back to the arcadey simplicity, tension, and action of the first space sims. Point and shoot and you will hit your target. You can change between 2 or 3 weapon types. Controls are responsive and flight feels perfect. More than any other space sim of late, I can EASILY switch to spin-mode (like in Battlestar Galactica) while my fighter's momentum continues flying in one direction. Just one simple button and that give me, the player, a feeling of power. I'm swerving and angling WITH INTENT in this game.\n\nWith that simplicity, it isnt to say there isnt depth. Like all great games, and I believe this will be a classic, there is simplicity and depth. The game progression is so clear, yet coaxes you to replay the snappy missions to achieve better results.\n[list]\n[*]Accomplishing the optional bonus missions provides currency to upgrade your ship/fleet. These include improved weapons, shields, and drones.\n[*]Finshing missions adds more ships to your fleet which increases the management depth of the game since you ahve to control your larger fleet in later battles.\n\nAll of that works perfectly with the art style. Theres a simplicity to it which is apt for the game. Its some cross between Homeowrld, Lego , and old sci-fi. When playing in VR its absolutely magical. Like other flight sims of late - the immersion is indescribable within the cockpit, but the added bonus is during the strategic view. I spent so much time on the title screen as well as the strategic view in game, just hopping fro one ship to another, looking at the model design and details. Its like being able to be anywhere inside a battle re-enactment.\n\nAdd to that the BSG music, and Homeworld-ish UI and you have perfection. \n\nI could go on about this game, but I'll just say do yourself a favor and get this.

It's easy enough but the game doesn't a fantastic job at showing you the controls (the game basically requires a controller) and easing you into things. From there on out it's up to you to figure out how hard you want the game to get. Each mission lets you try and earn more \"Favor\" which in turn is used to upgrade your ship (and eventually fleet), which the mission changing in slight ways to make it more challenging but never really changing the objective. In the beginning taking on the harder difficulties are going to lead to frustration since you'll have no upgrades or wingmen to help you out, so I suggest sticking to the lower difficulties at first.\n\nAs you complete missions you'll open up new \"paths\" on your star chart (think Starfox 64) which will eventually lead you to your ultimate goal at the top of the screen. The game can probably be completely really quickly if you just picked the necessary missions to get to the end and nothing else, but there is a fair bit of other stuff to do if you want to be a completionist. With over two hours into the game I'm only about halfway up on the mission list and I still have a lot of missions I haven't completed on the higher difficulties. Though, at $20, I don't know if there's enough content yet to justify the price.\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are unique with low-poly, basically textureless, models which makes things easy to see and decipher among the chaos. This also really helps if you're playing in VR as the lower resolution doesn't make super detailed objects easy to make out. The lofi look is minimal but really, really well done and the game as a absolutely fantastic use of colors; every level feels different with it's own painters palette of colors.\n\nThe sound leaves a bit to be desired, since everything is happening in the vacuum of space, you'll mostly hear all the action outside as muffled thumps and thuds with everything that happens in the ship (beeps letting you know if you're locked on, damaged, etc) being really clear which helps to know what's going on around you. It's a pretty slick way of bringing attention to the player without important sounds getting lost. The soundtrack, if you can call it that, is okay but it seems like it's a single track that keeps looping (not sure on this). While it isn't annoying, it would of been nice to have more variety.\n\nFinally, the gameplay is really solid. Don't expect a really in-depth space sim because you won't find it here. What you're getting is a shooter with tight controls and fun gameplay. You can personally control different ships, tell your fleet to converge on whatever you're targeting or even control everything from an overhead map and jump back into your ship. It's simplistic, but not so much that it gets boring.\n\nI'd definitely recommend the title to anyone, and moreso if you want a great game to play in VR.

The mix of Homeworld inspired Aesthetics with classic Freespace style combat is something i've been dreaming about since I was a teen. When I met Mike Tipul and figured out he was working on this game essentially alone I knew it was ambitious even with such a long dev cycle.\n\nI am happy to report he did it. He really did it.\n\nThis game is small, tight, and satisfying. For a single person to do even half this good of a game would be impressive. As a game developer myself I cannot even imagine how much work went into getting all the details right.\n\nThis will seem like a strangely myopic thing to focus in on but consider the menus.\n\nIn indie games menu and UI design are normally not at the forefront. you just don't have the development time, money, or expertise to excel in all areas. So, there are bound to be some rough edges because you need to polish the core gameplay loop. But damn if this game doesn't have menus that just *FEEL* good. Good feeling things you often don't notice. These are so good i do.\n\nThe campaign is concise and very tight. The aesthetic and story remind me of Homeworld from the opposite side, which is full of classic 1970s Dune-esque themes. Rather than glorifying revenge this game feels fascinated in how or why we justify our violence to ourselves. Even if this isn't the core focus of the game you get the sense the developer was thinking about those ideas.\n\nOne of the most impressive things is how the game keeps the energy up over the 5-6 hours it takes to beat the campaign once through. A lot of older arcade style space combat games - x-wing, freespace, starlancer - had definitely \"filler\" missions. Those would be the missions with lots of gaps between combat encounters, often with very challenging elements late in the mission, that were a pain in the ass to repeat if you failed near the end. This game has no filler. Each mission is a unique and challenging combat encounter that requires thoughtful use of both tactics and dogfighting skill to execute successfully.\n\nOne of the ways the experience is improved is the short load times. On my computer, at least - SSD, i7920 - the missions load and restart exceptionally fast. This means if you fail because of a mistake in your tactics you can restart fast enough that the lesson from that mistake is fresh in your mind. It is really hard to get load times down in Unity so props to him for that piece of polish.\n\nI don't know if this was a side-effect or an intent from the beginning but this game runs really well in VR even on slower machines. The simple aesthetic combined with good use of simple color means the actual effects and models are pretty slim on memory requirements. Despite this it looks absolutely fantastic on my DK2. Not realistic in any sense but stunning in that way that, again, reminds me of Homeworld's use of painted textures on simple models. The first time I flew by a frigate at close range it looked just like a plastic model from a 70s sci-fi film.\n\nAnd that is rad.\n\nI would say the only way I could see this game easily improved upon is the customizability. I hope it was designed in such a way that would allow to build out a campaign creator toolset if Mike makes enough to justify the time. I would love to see custom campaigns or new player-created in this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1466555571, "timestamp_updated": 1466555571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23687892": {"recommendationid": "23687892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035082372", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500644180}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok so, I have always been a fan of space combat, looking at those sequences from Star Wars, Battlestar... etc\n\nI must say this game brings you the best experience for that, and adds its own little style to it with its tactical options.

If you ever played Vanquish, expect a similar level of holy-shit-that-was-awesome bursts of excitement. The dev has done an incredible job polishing this game to a great level of detail. It's a great space-fighter sim, and there's lots of room to maneuver (heh) in terms of gameplay.\n\nFor the pros, I've gotta mention that the sound design is fantastic, something that a lot of games lack nowadays. It's definitely a throwback to hearing the radio chatter of squadrons and frigates in Homeworld. Hearing missile-tones and the muffled sounds of cannons inside the cockpit is awesome; it sounds exactly like I'd imagine flying a Viper Mk II. The overall aesthetic is similarly awesome: simple, clean, and immersive. Good effects and lighting let us appreciate how cool everything looks, but also keeps the framerate high for tight gameplay. Also, I got a couple smiles at the heavily sci-fi canon campaign (C-beams glittering in the dark near Tannhauser Gate, anyone?). The last mission is great, especially if you played Homeworld 2.\n\nAs for cons, I was a little disappointed to hear about the scale-back on the overall project. I know this game has been sitting in development for a good amount of time, so it wasn't entirely unexpected either. Some of the RTS mechanics might need a retweak, and I hope that a fleet composition tool will be added in the future (akin to how it was hinted at in earlier gameplay videos). However, I understand the developer's need to get this out the door. I'm looking forward to the wave mode - but what I really want is a skirmish/scenario designer. I hope that modtools or similar devkits may be released if the developer decides to move on from this.\n\nPersonally, I really really hope that the positive response to this release shows how much people appreciate and want this kind of game, and that somehow we get more content for it. Honestly, the action in the game blows E: D out of the water, and I don't say that lightly.

The campaign is relatively short, yes, but that really isn't a bad thing, and I think it's a little ludicrous to expect a sprawling 40-hour game from a lone developer. I really like the length and the replayability of the missions.\n\nIf you skip the rest of this review, at least read this paragraph:\n\nThe tension and pace of this game is brilliant. You could choose a mission at random, and I'll guarantee you'll experience a series of dramatic, desperate dogfights - fighters pirouetting in the emptiness as tracer fire streaks past - while dispatching orders to your fleet. You hear something large explode and turn to see your prized frigate in pieces. You improvise, and hurl your own fighter at the enemy capital ship, dodging its flak batteries and dropping your payload into its bridge. Just when you think you have the upper hand, the enemy flagship warps in, and you have to hurriedly line up your warp coordinates and jump out of the system as the warning alarms scream, hurtling past planets that seemed impossibly distant seconds ago. And then you look at the mission timer: 3 minutes. You just had the ride of your life in just 3 minutes. On to the next one.\n\nI haven't played a space combat game this good since, well, ever. It personally reminds me of Colony Wars: Vengeance, which was a PS1 game with a similar premise: an empire had been vanquished and you flew as a member of its remnant forces, waging a war of retribution against the 'good guys' who had defeated it a generation before.\n\nI really like the simple setup in this game. It's so stripped back and unencumbered by lore and context, that the depth of the combat and gameplay stands out that much more. Everything, from the games title, to the locations, ships and missions, is named excellently. I know that's a weird thing to praise but this guy just fucking nailed it. I loved that in the final mission there's an enemy ship called 'Poor Yorick'. I still think Enemy Starfighter is a baller name. Wish he'd stuck with it.\n\nObviously Battlestar Galactica looms large in this game. The style of combat and the sound design both tip a hat to that brilliant show, and it's not just dressing. The muted exterior sound contrasts with the immediacy of the interior sounds. And the driving martial music, as anyone who's played the game will attest, is perfect.\n\nI don't really get these people who talk about getting 'their money's worth'; I don't want to play a game that takes 40+ hours to complete!

I used the xbox 360 controller for my first run and I am planning on mapping my x52pro for further gaming. The force feedback when firing weapons enhances the immersion greatly. The drift capabilities of the fighter is something special, arcady but makes you feel like an ace pilot.\n*Gameplay, the first four missions i flew, quick and dirty warping into a region, taking out the target and warping out before the capital ship showed up, consecutively, was an exciting adrenaline pumping experience.\n\nCons:\n*I understand there is only 14 missions. Considering how quickly I flew through the first four that does not seem like much.\n\nIs this worth the money? For me yes.

The rumble of the autocannon, the soft roar of the engines, cold indifferent tones of your flight and targeting computer all make this game feel very grounded, despite it's abstracted visuals.\n\nThe music, visual design and very language used in the (consise) mission briefings are all designed to make HOTDS the ultimate villain \"power fantasy\". There is no blood, no corpses, but you are first and foremost a murderer.\n\nI usually can't be bothered with completionism (I can think of the Batman Arkham games, which I adore and had absolutely no will to explore outside of the main quest and major sidequests) but HOTDS's repetable missions and daily randomised wave clear mode brought out the perfectionist in me. In my quest to kill every battlecruiser commander on \"Dragon\" difficulty (no ships, fighters only), I managed to rack up more time with this \"\"\"two hour\"\"\" game than I did with any long-form first person shooter (despite being a sucker for such games).\n\nIf you've watched the trailers and seen the screenshots and something about Dying Sun \"speaks\" to you, I'd have to recommend throwing caution to the wind and buying it, it will scratch an itch no other game can. \n\nDying Sun has moderate tactical depth, it's not a complicated game - it's a perfect game.\n\nPro tips:\nDon't use a joystick, use a gamepad, this isn't DCS. The game was made by a designer from Halo: Reach and to an extent plays like it (see the shotgun and shields).\nThe \"AOE damge\" that carapace armour refers to is damage from Omniflak, the blue cloudy weapons that keep owning your shit when you fight drones. Use it.\nShields aren't mandatory, violence is, use the armour damage boost when fighting capitals.\nFlak drones, the gap drive and the engine upgrade all protect you from missiles.\nI played without VR, it's fine.

The emperor\u2019s dead. And you\u2019ve to avenge him.\n\nThat\u2019s the slick and stripped down premise for this space combat game, casting you in the role of the galaxy\u2019s deadliest assassin, piloting an imposing starship seemingly made of pointed blades. There are echoes of Star Wars TIE Fighter but House of the Dying Sun really doubles down on making you feel the like the ultimate villain.\n\nYou\u2019re alone at the start of your vengeful quest but you\u2019re armed with the most deadly vessel in existence, so naturally it\u2019s time to put it to use, hunting down the \u201ctraitorous lords\u201d who killed your emperor. After a brief but helpful tutorial you\u2019re set loose on your targets, a galaxy map giving you a few missions to choose and later the option to replay those completed, perhaps on harder difficulties or to complete bonus objectives. \nEach mission is hand crafted but most follow the routine of giving you a target to assassinate, albeit with varying obstacles between you and your enemy. Not just a variety of enemy vessels but also asteroids and the blinding light of a nearby sun. Each one is a short but intense hit and run, as you have to try and take out your target before the imminent arrival of the massive enemy flagship, prompting the helpful message on your display \u201cTraitor Flagship Arrived: You are Out-gunned\u201d. If you\u2019ve taken out your target, that message means its time to high tail it out of there and get to the extraction point before you\u2019re turned into space dust.\n\nYou will end up replaying missions. Not only are they tough and it\u2019ll take a few attempts to tidy up those bonus objectives, to upgrade your ships you need the currency provided in greater amounts by higher difficulties. There\u2019s also a handful of weapons and load-outs on offer, that really change your targets and can be swapped out before each mission, allowing you to tailor your tactics appropriately. Hell, you\u2019ll replay them because they\u2019re immensely enjoyable.\nAs you progress, your fleet expands with different vessels, of varying sizes. First, small interceptors like yourself and soon Frigates, imposing as they warp into each mission, a dark silhouette against the fiery nebula.\nMore than just accompanying you into each fight, they can be given orders. Simple ones are available in a radial menu whilst you fly your ship but a tactical view lets you issue movement orders. It\u2019s not that complex but just enough to make each mission a more challenging and thoughtful affair, encouraging you to actually think about what the task will require. Initially I didn\u2019t really touch these options but as my fleet grew and the missions grew bigger in scale, dozens of vessels clashing, co-ordinating your allies to support your attacks became vital. Certainly it adds to the Homeworld like look and feel of the game, giving you some minor RTS elements whilst fulfilling the fantasy of Battlestar Gallactica-esque dog fights.\n\nAnd oh boy does it deliver on this fantasy. There\u2019s been a resurgence in space sims and such in the past few years, with a variety of approaches but in terms of sheer excitement and feel, House of the Dying Sun is the best I\u2019ve played.\nIt looks the business first and foremost; a sharp minimalist style, distinct, colourful ships and weaponry against a dazzling universe that\u2019s tremendous scale lends to the stakes of the story. Homeworld has been an obvious influence here but the unique perspective of House of the Dying Sun really makes it its own. The sound is a real treat too, whether it\u2019s the muted gunfire rattling your cockpit, the fuzzy warning transmissions from your allies or the beeps of your targeting system, it\u2019s all extremely functional and informative whilst designed to keep you alert, invested in each twist of the fight.\n\nBut it is the feel of it that keeps me wanting to play. The sheer sense of speed and momentum goes beyond anything else I\u2019ve played in the genre. There\u2019s no strafing, you can only move forward but are permitted to aim in a different direction from the one you\u2019re moving by \u201cdrifting\u201d, switching off your engines and letting your velocity carry your ship past a target whilst you twist round to land a perfect shot.\nAnd the weapons are great, all distinct and useful in different ways. My favourite ended up being the sniper-like cannon, giving you only a few rounds before requiring to reload but letting you line up targets from a considerable distance as you moved in. The surgical like precision of it really played into the sense of being the most dangerous star-fighter in the whole galaxy. Yes, it really is that nerdy a delight.\nYou\u2019ve only a few systems and weapons to worry about at any moment (much simpler than Elite Dangerous whose ships are endlessly configurable) but the simplicity allows it to focus on making each beat in a fight matter, making your options always clear and allowing you to just get swept up in the intensity of it all.\n\nSo again, yes, the game is short but it\u2019s so intense I\u2019ve no idea how the game (developed by just one clearly talented fellow) could sustain itself over a longer campaign without a considerably larger budget. The way it perpetually escalates, your fleet slowly growing, your challenges becoming near suicide runs. How it teases you throughout, having you flee upon the arrival of the Flagship, building up to a fateful stand-off with the massive starship. All for one terrific final mission that plays the fantasy of being this wrathful assassin out to its most extreme and ending on a surprisingly somber note for an otherwise bombastic adventure.\n\nIt lacks in content compared with some of its peers in the genre but House of the Dying Sun excels precisely because of its sharp focus on a handful of small but important things, offering an experience that\u2019s near breathless in its pace. If you haven\u2019t heard of it and fancy living out those Battlestar or Star Wars fantasies of the perfect space dogfight then I suggest checking it out if you can.\n\nThough it\u2019s still only in Early Access, it\u2019s as polished as any finished title I\u2019ve played and it\u2019s another perfect title in a year packed with focused, razor sharp games.", "timestamp_created": 1465767784, "timestamp_updated": 1465767784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592530", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23526619": {"recommendationid": "23526619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098150574", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482610060}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game overall, one of the best I've played in a while.

Launching in VR mode would cause steam to crash every time. Then launching Steam VR and chosing play in VR would also crash. The method seems to be to pre-launch steam VR, then chose the 'PLAY IN VR' button on the game, any other way seems to crash steam.\n\nAnyhow on to the game. It's basic and cool, I love the graphics, nothing fancy in terms of poly count, it reminds me of starfox, philseed and the like which is great. It has an oldschool feel to it which is great. It also reminds me of the movie 'The Last Starfighter'. I'm guessing this game took inspriration from old school movies like that and the games mentioned.\n\nThe sound is good, and so are the war drums, but you better get used to them because that is the ONLY music in the game. A quick string chord followed by war drums, and more war drums lol. It suits the game, but it would be great to have a couple more just to keep thins from getting stale.\n\nPlaying in VR is good, although it does need optimising. I can run all current VR titles on ultra with my machine, this one uses 60% of any GPU or each whether SLI enabled or disabled. Mostly the game will run smooth when in game, but oddly the menu screens are very glitchy and laggy. I observed zero difference in performance from runnig on the lowest settings to the highest, so clearly something needs tweaking with the engine.\n\nGameplay is good, to start with you will find yourself going head on into dog fights, after a couple of hours play you will have a couple of fighters and some destroyers at your command. You'll then discover that it takes on a 'Homeworld-esq' flavour. You sit in the map, and look around in VR at your fleet, targeting them and sending commands watching the battle unfold, then jumping in and out of a craft when you think it is needed or want to. It leads to a pretty unique and original game which is fun.\n\nWith more content and some optimisation it could be something quite special.

That would be enough, but then it candy coats the entire game with the added depth of a tactical view and a lot of depth. \n\n\n[h1]Piloting the craft[/h1]\n\nPiloting the ship is fun and easy. In addition to pointing yourself in a direction you have three other controls, a booster, a break, and the ability to drift. Drift lets you cut your engines, but maintain all of your momentum. Combining all three gives you nimble control over the direction and speed of your craft.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\n\nCombat is what you\u2019d expect. You have a main weapon, a secondary weapon that is usually a missile of some kind, and a heavy weapon. Each weapon has different strengths and weaknesses. Knowledge of when and how to use each weapon is vital to the successful completion of missions. \n\n[h1]Missions[/h1]\n\nThe missions are comprised of little tactical puzzles with a time limit. So far most of them have been of the \"go here, kill this guy as fast as you can, and if you have some time left, do this bonus mission.\" At first it seems a bit routine, but quickly becomes tactically more varied. Get in, do the mission, do the bonus objectives, and then get out before that capital ship warps in quickly becomes, Get in, protect this guy, blow that stuff up, help your wingman out, complete objective, grab the bonus while the capital ship is bearing down on you as you pray it doesn't blow you to pieces while your warp engine powers up. \n\n[h1]Mission Bonus Objectives[/h1]\n\nThe incentive to complete bonus objectives is high. This leads to a lot of nail biting close calls with the Traitor capital ship as you \u201cknow you can make it.\u201d  Completing bonus objectives grants you \u201cfavor\u201d which you can then spend on new weapons and armor. This aspect of the game presents you with some choice in dealing with the difficulty. An earlier mission that seemed impossible might be a lot easier now with whatever upgrade you just purchased. \n\n[h1]Mission Difficulty[/h1]\n\nFor each mission there are three levels of difficulty. The early missions will be a cakewalk for anyone with a few space shooters under their belt. The difficulty ramps up quickly though, and you need to think about how to most effectively equip your ship for the mission ahead (a process that may require some trial and error). The higher the difficulty, the more favor you get for bonus objectives. \n\n[h1]Mission Tactics[/h1]\n\nOne of my available missions is to blow up a capital ship defended by flak drones... seems simple enough, but a shot from the main gun of the capital ship is a one-hit kill and extremely accurate. I can't (yet) get the drones out of the way before the gun takes me and my wingman out. However, there is another mission that seems to unlock something that would be very handy, a bomb with some immunity to flak and point defence systems. That might do the trick. I can choose either mission, but the game suggests that I think about the order. Wouldn\u2019t you love to just bomb that capital ship through the flak with a giant warhead? Yes, I would. Ok, do this mission then. \n\n[h1]Dying[/h1]\n\nDeath seems to be consequence free, which I feel is a good tradeoff to the fact that there is no mission briefing. You warp in, use the tactical view to make sense of the situation, then attack. It\u2019s more fun and immediate and creates a good flow that doesn't get tedious. \n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nI'm still discovering the game\u2019s mechanics, especially the tactical parts. It seems like there is a lot of depth waiting in House of the Dying Sun in every facet. From the piloting of the ship/combat, to the tactical view, to the bonus objectives and favor. \n\nIt plays well on both a regular screen and in VR. The VR comfort level is very high.\n\nFor a single-man development effort (which I have been following for some years now on Twitter), it is an impressive and interesting game.

If you like liked any Space Combat Flight Simulator ever, go and purchase this game and you will have fun.\n\n###    DRM    ###\nAt the time this review goes up, 12 June 2016, the game is DRM-free and can be launched and played without Steam (http://steam.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_DRM-free_games). Let's get on with the review now shall we?\n\n###    FULL REVIEW - NO SPOILERS   ###\nHouse of the Dying Sun asks of you to beat around 15 hand-crafted levels / scenarios by piloting your lethal fightercraft through enemy formations and flak-fire, destroying opposing interceptors and capital ships. The scenarios are short, intense and well crafted, in short they are fun and replayable. Every single one prioritizes player agency and gameplay, this is a game about you beating the challenge the level designer has prepared for you.\n\nIn terms of gamplay, HotDS can probably best be compared to Tie-Figher's or Freespace 2's style of space combat but like stated before, that is a rough comparison. There are different flavors of capital ships, there are sentry guns and cargo containers and enemy fighters in between and it is your job to figure out how to best use your available assets to achieve your objectives. Situational awareness is key.\nTo this end (and to teach you these skills), the game comes equiped with a tactical pause mode in which you can freely give orders and assess the situation. And in contrast to said Tie-Fighter (or Wing Commander Prophecy), the feature is fully integrated and controls very well. Make no mistake though, this is a flight simulator and not an Homeworld-style RTS and you will not triumph without throwing your skills into the breach!\n\nYou will equip your fighter, and later your escorting capital ships, with different variants of weapons and equipment such as shields or better (but slowing) armor. The vast majority of these feels useful and well balanced, supporting different playstyles.\nFlying and controls are spot-on and very precise, I personally preferred the gamepad and ignored both my Keyboard (which I use for Freespace 2 and the old Wing Commanders) and my HOTAS (which is my method of choice for every other flight sim bar the ones in the previous brackets). You feel very much in control of everything that is going on.\n\nGraphically, the game is very beautiful and I can only imagine that is looks brilliantly on a VR Headset (will purchase the next generation in one or two years). The ship models are surprisingly detailed will background noise such as asteroids are kept flat and uninteresting to control your focus.\n\nSound design is outstanding, the same goes for the music. Think a more intense version of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica design and you are spot on, as far as I am informed the composer of the now defunct \"Beyond the Red Line\" Battlestar Galactica Total Conversion is on board here. Everything here serves both its purpose and its artistic goal perfectly, the sound is actually so incredibly brilliant it might just outshine all the other things that the game does...\n\nBeing so scenario-focused, the game has no traditionall-told narrative to speak of. What is present however is written exceptionally well and the credits reveals that one of my favorite weaver of English words, the great Seth Dickinson, was involved here. To discuss what is present would already be a spoiler, so I leave it at \"do not expect a story driven campaign, but rest assured you will not miss it\". And note that this comes from a die-hard single player story enthusiast, hence what is present compensates :-)\n\nI refuse to add anything to the usual fuzz regarding the completely senseless \"how much playtime\" discussion. You should only judge an experience based on its overall quality. This is a very good game in all regards and achieves the rare feat of both appealing to the very hardcore audiance and being accessible enough to be able to teach less experienced players how to a) have fun and b) get better at it.\n\nBeing in Early Access, every review should also state something about the technical side of things: In regards to stability and performance, everything present was already very promising. I had very little problems and zero crashes. In fact, I have only nitpicks at all, namely a very minor performance hiccup at the start of the last mission (game probably has to load many ships at the same time there) and sometimes a audio-crackle when entering another craft's shield bubble. And THAT IS IT. Lets face it, every triple-A game released today has way way WAY more issues at launch.\n\nJudging from the forums and already released updates, the developer is currently responding to all reported issues at an absolutely alarming rate...    I have no idea if Mike Tipul currently sleeps at all. Here is hoping he does.\n\n\n###    SUMMARY   ###\nThis is an outstanding release, both in terms of actual game design and content, as well as in terms of polish and supporting it.\n\nSUPERCONDUCTOR CARAPACE FLUSHED WITH CONDENSED SUPERFLUID HELIUM.\nQUANTUM STASIS SYSTEM.\nONE SOON-TO-BE-ENTERTAINED OCCUPANT.\nBREAKABLE SEAL.\nPURCHASE GAME TO OPEN.", "timestamp_created": 1465734395, "timestamp_updated": 1465734533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23518174": {"recommendationid": "23518174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006384755", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518954617}, "language": "french", "review": "Joueur infini des Freespace 1, 2, SCP, et autres mods BSG/B5 etc... sans compter les x-wing alliance, starlancer et consorts.

"playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470076024}, "language": "english", "review": "What a terrific game.\n\nFor years, the one game I've wanted more than anything in the universe was a spiritual successor to Freespace and TIE Fighter- and that became even more true once I picked up my Oculus Rift. \n\nTHIS IS IT.\n\nWhat a fantastic game. To go into the specifics:\n\nGraphics: What do you do when you don't have a huge art team dedicated to making super high resolution textures and models? Go with an art style that doesn't need it and, at the same time, looks distinct and beautiful. The game has a wonderful 40s/50s pulp/art deco sci-fi look, which I absolutely love and works spectacularly well. It runs like a dream at very high framerates and the look is one of my favorites of any game I've tried in the last few months.\n\nSound: You really feel like you're in a cockpit. The subdued thump of weapons fire, the muffled cockpit audio- it is, by design, intended to make you feel like you're piloting a spaceship rather than listening to some huge orchestra. It really gives you a great sense of presence.\n\nGameplay: Here is where HotDS really shines. Ship control is tight, fluid, perfect. There is an excellent \"drift\" mechanic that lets you take advantage of Newtonian physics and turn to point any way you want. Weapons feel powerful and realistic. Not since TIE Fighter have I felt so much like I'm actually sitting in a spaceship cockpit doing battle with my interstellar foes- and that is not an exaggeration. To counter a common misconception, the game absoultely does have joystick/HOTAS support- it's just not the main or primary or official or whatever you want to call it control scheme and takes a little effort to bind it the way you want, but I played through with my HOTAS and it worked like a dream.\n\nOriginally the game was set to be released with procedurally generated missions and campaigns. While I do find the idea of infinitely regenerating missions, I do believe that the exquisitely hand-crafted missions we get here probably do play a lot better than procedural content would have. The developer says a wave move is coming which should help extend the playtime a bit.\n\nTo this end, to the extent the game has one flaw, it's quite short. I have only played for a few hours but have already beaten most of the content. Still, I would always opt for a short, high quality experience than an endless, more mediocre one (not to mention any other games by name, but you can imagine). I do hope some content gets added at some point, and between the wave mode and whatever the developer adds in the future I'm hopeful but, as it stands now, this is easily worth $20, and then some, today as it stands. Literally not for almost 20 years has a new space combat game of this quality been released, and I'm ecstatic over the quality of what's been delivered. \n\nVR Support: Have to throw this in here because I just started using my Rift. This is perhaps my favorite looking game on Oculus. Everything mentioned above with respect to presence, framerate, audio- it's magnified tenfold in the Rift. The head tracking is spot-on perfect, framerate doesn't miss a beat- and while Elite: Dangerous has its pros and cons, it doesn't hold a candle to this in my opinion when it comes to pure, TIE Fighter/ Freespace style combat. Ever since I started seriously considering VR, a VR version of that style of game is what I've wanted most- this is it.\n\nTo top it all off, this game has, amazingly, been created by a single developer, who, unlike many or even most early access developers, graciously listens to and implements feedback and truly appreciates his players. \n\nIn summary, this is a very high quality, very polished, technically flawless, beautifully controlling and playing game that finally provides the updated Freespace/TIE Fighter experience that I and I'm sure many others have been longing for for so many years. If you enjoyed any of those types of space combat games back in the day, get this one immediately. If not, get this anyway and see what the excitement is all about! And if you have a VR headset, this is easily in my opinion the best VR cockpit experience on the market today, hands down. You cannot go wrong. What a fantastic game. Excuse me, I have to go hunt down and punish more enemies of the Emperor...\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1465582620, "timestamp_updated": 1465582620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.997145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23487733": {"recommendationid": "23487733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257053394", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465568251}, "language": "english", "review": "Games like these are really good, and have great potential, but I found the controls on this game to be weird and hard to use, which kept me from enjoying the game.", "timestamp_created": 1465579993, "timestamp_updated": 1465579993, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23485860": {"recommendationid": "23485860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002245408", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465535655}, "language": "english", "review": "Dying Sun is a really polished and fun game.

It's been hyped to hell for me, but despite that, the game meets even my highest expectations.  Alot of the developer's original ideas for the main campain were scrapped in favor of a much more straight-forward, stream-lined experience.  Despite not getting the exact same game I had hoped for such a long time ago, I got something equally as spectacular.  The missions are quite short, but that doesn't take away from how much fun the space combat is.  You pilot a quick-striking TIE intercepter-like space fighter.  You don't have a lot of armor or any doomsday devices on your craft, so a lot of the engagements you get into wind up being short, albeit thrilling. You have to get in, strike hard, and jump back out before the enemy calls for reinforcements.  As you play through the campain, you start unlocking weapons and ship mods while also building up a small fleet, providing you with more firepower that you can take back to previous missions, allowing you to unlock more rewards on higher difficulties.  The ship mods actually give the game a lot of depth while the fleet-building mechanics give the game a suprising amount of replay value.  On top of solid gameplay, the visuals are simple but delightful while the audio is completely sublime.  Friendly units chatter over the coms, giving them a suprising amount of life. Weapon sounds are muted and muffled by the vacuum of space, similar to what you might hear in the new Battlestar Galactica TV series.  Speaking of Battlestar Galactica, the TV show's music composer Bear Mccreary even lends a hand to the music production, offering his trademark heavy percussion tunes which triumphantly punctuate each space battle.\n\nIt's a good game.  If you want to play some super intense, fast-paced space battles, look no further and give it a go.\n\nAlso, since this game is in early access, expect to encounter a bug or two. If you notice one, take the opening screen's advice and report them to the email displayed on screen.  Mike Tipul is really good at responding to those.  I found a problem with remapping controller inputs, reported it to the email, and got an email response within the day saying to download the update, he just fixed it.

It can be a very slow and frustrating process binding every action, but that isn't enough for me to give it a negative review and it seems like this developer is really working hard so that may happen in the future. \n\nGood game, buy it now while it's on sale.

There's little downtime, missions can be restarted quickly, controls are very simple and have no special keys involved, and you never get bogged down in any complicaitons.\n\nThe controls are very simple, and don't require any special commands or fiddling with the function keys. Keyboard hand is throttle, orders, and switching weapons, mouse hand is firing, flying and targeting. You eventually unlock other fighters and capships, but you never leave your interceptor.  You can edit the loadouts of all of your ships, including the capitals, which usually makes or breaks your attempts to succeed.\n\nThe weapons selection is rather sparse. 2 main weapons, 3 secondaries, 1 special for fighters, just the mains and secondaries for cap ships. That said, changing weapons makes a huge difference in your effectiveness and needs to be considered based on the mission. Some weapons are hopeless against shields, others don't penetrate hull or capship armor well. You can also select 2 perks for each class, from simple armor and shield upgrades to sentry robot hacking and mini-warp jumps. These have to be unlocked, though, and aren't immediately available.\n\nThe missions are short, sweet, and replayable at several difficulty levels. They don't have the downtime of older games where you had to accelerate time for long stretches at a time- missions rarely last more than 5-10 minutes win or lose, and can be quickly restarted if you're unhappy with something. I know we all hate comparisons, but think more Hotline Miami rather than IL-2. Short, quick, easily replayable and easy to change your loadout and strategy if you're struggling. \n\nYou can choose to replay any mission at any time, and you usually have a choice of missions you can pick. The briefings are short text explaining your main and bonus objectives. The main objective is the bare minimum you need to unlock more missions. The Bonus objective unlocks Favor, the game's currency, which unlocks more perks for your ship. Currently I would say the game is a bit too easy, especially once you unlock all your escorts and weapons. That said, Hard  mode with no shields is quite a rush.\n\nOverall, a simple, but excellently crafted game that doesn't get bogged down with unnecessary complications.

Saw a youtube video in my sub box and by the end of the video I was reaching for my wallet. I also do not own any VR gear so I don't have a clue of that side of things.\n\n[h1]This game does two things extremely well.[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Immersion:\nThis game has immersion in ample supply, the sound design is the biggest hitter in this department. Coming out of warp, pushing thrusters to full with that muffled thrum coming from behind to the muffled sound of your auto-cannon, maneuvering thrusters  softly hissing in the background, and the snap of the torpedo launching from your fighter. They are all as you would expect being in a vacuum. To top it all off you get wardrums as your OST something akin to BattleStar Galactica. The HUD is of something from modern era fighter jets with near flat color and many geometric shapes. Watching as your shell casings whip by as you unload your auto-cannon adds to the feeling that it is real, or at least believable.\n\n[*]Mechanics:\n(I highly suggest playing with a mouse and keyboard as the gamepad was not precise enough.)\nThe interceptor controls tightly, after an hour of play maneuvering became much than just drifting past other ships. Pitching and yawing while drifting to quickly change targets became reactionary. Even though you are stuck in one type of ship it didn't get old and I can see myself spending more time flying around without getting bored. The addition of the tactical mode/command mode is extremely useful, micro managing individual ships to targets or around an asteroid to flank a ship. It gives me Homeworld feelings all over again.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]The stuff that needs work.[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The Tactical mode:\nWhile it is useful there are some functions that I find need to be there. Being able to target multiple ships with just creating a selection box, giving multiple ships the same move command, creating control groups, and special orders. I expect these things because it invokes such a Homeworld vibe and find myself asking why something isn't there to have to remind myself it isn't Homeworld.\n\n[*]Content:\nThis is the single biggest issue I've had while 14 missions was long enough for me to get almost five hours out of it and I'll get about three more for replay value. There are people who blew through it in just a hour. The lack of more missions is the biggest hindrance to the game. In general I just want more, more ships, more weapons, more upgrades, more abilities, [i]just more everything.[/i] It's not hard to fix the mission part, give the community a mission and map editor then hook the game up to the workshop and bam endless missions to be had. \n[/list]\n\n[h1]Would I still buy it again?[/h1]\nOh, hell yes I would. Those few hours of content had me so focused and immersed in the game I was almost late for work today. The game is just plain fun, enough there to make you think but not too much so that there is a massive learning curve. The game strikes the proper balance.

I'm happy to say I would recommend this game - if you have money spare or are dead set on space combat that absolutely blasts anything else out of the water, do not hesitate, buy this game. Elsewise, if you are on the fence or buying a lot this sale, maybe wait until the games price lowers. I stand by my original comments below that the game lacks longevity and some of the features it had in the Alpha, but fresh off the bat with however many hours logged, I can say that they can be forgiven. This is a game full of lore, history, glorious cinematic stages and fluid and dynamic combat. Sound design is glorious, as are the space vistas that accompany you from campaign to campaign. There is enough variety in ship upgrades and what I originally labelled 'pseudo-content', the recently added wave mode, is engaging enough to always warrant another run.\n\nI am extremely pleased and happy to recommend this marvellous game.\n\n[b] YOU CAN READ MY ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW: [/b]\n\n[b] TL;DR: [/b] Game features are amazing, but lacks longevity and therefore immersion. Not worth $20.00 AUD.\n\n[b] EDIT (14/6/16) [/b] Don't let the 'early access' tag fool you with the promise of more content. The developer has stated that the 'early access' labelling is purely for bug fixes, and he plans to add [i] no more [/i] additional content to the game, aside from a wave gamemode: [i] \"House has had a ton of iteration put into it before even hitting Early Access, so right now I have no plans to add or change anything major to the game. The remaining work will center around bugs, weapons, upgrades, wave clear, and mission balance. \" [/i] [url=www.dyingsungame.com] - dyingsungame.com [/url]\n\nSimilar to what other people have said, this game has amazing potential. It's atmosphere, design, gameplay, optimization - the list goes on - are top notch. It's sound design is phenominal and extremely emersive.\n\nThe issue is a [i] severe [/i] lack of content.\n\nThe game contains a total of 14 missions, each of which can be completed 3 times and higher difficulties, some of which you will have to return to once your ship is better equiped or you have a larger fleet. However, these missions take, at a max, five minutes to do each. Crunch the numbers and you end up with around 4 hours of gameplay (and that's being generous). For a game priced at $20.00 AUD, this is a pretty big rip-off.\n\nAnd maybe it's a product of the industry - other games do worse. But this game is already so good, and has the potential to be so much more, it feels like you're being treated to a proof of concept or a fancy paid tech demo.\n\nFrom what I've read since following this game a few months back, there was actually an implemented feature in which you would jump between systems, earn money for upgrades by completing various missions within them, and use this as a way of boosting your overall capabilities. Why this system has been removed completely, I cannot for the life of me figure out. While it's true that the 14 current pre-defined missions [i] need [/i] to be set (timing is extremely important), there seems to be no reason that this could not be implemented as a side feature, adding a beautiful eliment of RPG and immersion to what would be a fantastic game.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/314230/] Rodina [/url] comes to mind. Rodina has all the sandbox elements that make it a wonderful game to explore and become immersed in, whilst lacking all the refined combat, sound design and graphics that are offered by House of the Dying Sun. In the perfect world there would be a single collaboration between the makers of the two games. In the mean while, we can only pray that the Marauder Interactive listens to the people who want to see a return to this form of freeplay, and takes a leaf out of Rodina's book.\n\nThe only other niggling issues I have is freelook is currently limited to people with VR headsets. This is a pretty massive oversight for a game of this nature, and hope it's resolved soon. (EDIT 10/6/16: the developer has responded to threads saying he will implement actual freelook in an update). Additionally, it'd be amazing to see an increase in 'simulation' focuses, letting you interact with your ship in greater detail.\n\nAll in all, the game is beautiful and fun to play - but the game itself prevents you from playing it for long, and does not seem to be worth the $20.00 it is priced at.", "timestamp_created": 1465441111, "timestamp_updated": 1479951397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656394", "comment_count": "39", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23461829": {"recommendationid": "23461829", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961997315", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483031568}, "language": "english", "review": "Enemy Starfighter, now named House of the Dying Sun, has finally be released on Steam Early Access!\n\nIt\u2019s a bit overwhelming at first because there\u2019s a lot of little controls and things to keep track of, but after a few missions you start to get the hang of it.\n\nThe core combat feels awesome, and the visual and sound design is very strong. Everything has a muted and bass heavy sound because that\u2019s obviously what space really sounds like and it feels great. The combat is a lot faster than I was expecting, so you need to stay on top of it. It's a very colorful game with a colorful depiction of space.\n\nThe map mode is essential as it gives you a paused overview of the map and allows you to order ships around in a simplified Homeworld-style interface. At the start of each mission the game begins paused in this mode, which allows you to plot out a simple plan of attack for your fleet. It\u2019s really satisfying when a mission goes exactly as planned and you take minimal losses while completing both your primary and secondary objective.\n\nWhile the core mechanics and gameplay loop are all there and feel great, the game is very light on content. There\u2019s only 14 missions, with each taking about 5 minutes to complete, often less if you\u2019re quick and don\u2019t go for the bonus objectives. The game heavily encourages replaying the missions with its multiple difficulty systems and unlock system, but it\u2019s hard to get around the fact that there\u2019s so few missions.\n\nSpeaking of the unlocks, each class of ship (interceptor, destroyer, frigate) has its own set of unlocks and weapons. However, you can only equip 2 upgrades at a time, so you\u2019re encouraged to swap out upgrades depending on the mission you\u2019re playing and the play style you prefer. It\u2019s pretty fun to try weird combinations and trying to make them work, and when you get something that works well (such as flak drones in a mission with a torpedo flinging carrier), it feels great. As the game continues through early access, there are supposed to be more weapons and upgrades added.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that before the game gets released in full, \u201ca custom wave-clear mode\u201d is planned to be added. Similar to how Strike Suit Infinity capitalized on Strike Suit Zero\u2019s excellent gameplay and then made a spin-off around that, I think HODS will benefit greatly from a similar wave-attack mode.\n\nI\u2019m hoping that more game modes get added over time, because the core gameplay and the style of the game are both fantastic.

Sound design is superb, from the radio chatter to the cracking of the canopy glass, it immerses you into the world instantaniously. Even though the game is entirely focused on combat with not much story to it, I still found myself shouting out \"Die traitorous scum!\" in my head as I lit up a corrupt politician's escape pod. \n\nThe mission areas are pretty small but the designs of the locations are beautiful with nebulas and stars of many colours ensuring the game doesn't feel repetitive. The only real downside to this game would be the length, there are 14 missions and each lasts about 5-10 minutes. I found myself really disappointed when I realised I was already at the end of the game, would have loved to amass an even greater fleet to take on even fiercer foes. \n\nI also felt like there weren't as many ships as there could have been, only one type of fighter, destroyer, frigate and dreadnoguht for the protagonist's faction. It's a real shame too because they look very impressive with their black spikey hulls and intimidating red engines. I would have loved to be able to jump into the bigger ships and broadside the enemy flagship with my artillery but you can only fly the Interceptor (it's still great fun regardless). \n\nAll in all, I'd HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who would love a chance to relive the glory days of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 with a dash of Freespace to make things really interesting.

It not only runs well, but it plays better. There is no better feeling than drifting perpendicular to an enemy blasting him to bits like the \"Teacher\" in Sky Crawlers. This, obviously, is the main point of the game. If you do not enjoy somewhat non-realism, then please don't buy it. If you like fun, then you're missing out if you don't drop that wallet.\n\nStarting with the post/pre-mission, each weapon and ability that can be equipped to your fighters, destroyers, or frigates, affects how you should use them. On Harbinger difficulty, prepare for a phyrric victory. Losing all your (and only your) fighters is the end of you, which was hard to understand at first, but the reveal at the end somewhat explains that, while raising a billion more questions. It's something you are more likely to find either A) wierd and interesting as hell or B) not something worth paying attention to.\n\nBut there is no contest, gameplay has been put first. You have FPS fighter controls that you operate manually, and a RTS esque strategy mode in which you can command your ships. It is about as depthy command wise as most generic RTS' out there (go here, attack this, bomb this, kamikazi that, etc.), which came as a surprise to me given the polish of the fighter controls. You can even command ships while in fighter mode. There are actually a lot of command/strategy controls that aren't addressed in the \"tutorial,\" so please check your bindings and experiment before putting down the controller or keyboard.\n\nGenerally, once you have more than one fighter, you may be micro-ing by switching between each manually, and turning the flowing tide of combat, similar to the  Men of War series (a WWII RTS), while pausing the gameplay to give bigger command queues to your other ships in strategy mode. The styling of the strategic gameplay isn't super in depth of course, but it does more than I would have normally asked for based on the premise of the title.\n\nThere is a difference between a good pilot, and a good commander, and if you are both, the harbinger difficulty will be far easier. Knowing which ships and weapons in each mission becomes a neccessity, and while it may be easy to send a wave of ships at a target, wisely managing each to manage the different objectives may be the only way to result in total victory (bonus objectives, which add more \"favor\" for upgrades), or crippling defeat (I have beaten the current campaign on all difficulties in just a few hours).\n\nThe upgrade system itself is unshamefully arcade like, you have weapon sets and two buffs for each type of ship in your fleet. The bigger ships often function as bullet shields, whilst the \"Executor\" strike fighters act as the sword to strike enemies of the emperor down.\n\nYou are not a good guy, hence \"Enemy Starfighter\" (original title). You pillage and kill at will, and if they try to eject in an escape pod... blow it up, ram it... kill them, so their heresy may never continue.\n\nThe campaign is short at this time, however, there will be  survival/wave mode added in the future.\n\nThe story is bare-bones, with more questions than answers, but as I said, everything else has meat where there should be fat.\n\nIt's a beefy, brawly, space fighter, and you are the baddest of the bad guys.\n\nPS: I would like to note, as other reviewers have, that the \"upgrade system\" and \"strategy mode\" options aren't particularly vast. It isn't, but to be honest, what aircraft dog-fighting arcade games have ever had either of those? The envisionment (from what I have gathered) is an supremely enjoyable arcade spacecraft fighter, with some rather unique mechanics thrown in, and it achieves that. For the price, even in this state, there are far worse games you could buy. Given that this is early access, and the campaign is going to be extended (along with the addition of a survival mode) I'm pretty satisfied with the purchase (it was on sale for a few bucks off when I got it). I won't force you to buy it, but honestly, I think the developer's could use the money to make more great games. Or was it developer...?\n\nEDIT (6/8/16): Found some hitching using gap drive whilst all my other fighters were in transit, likely due to the rapid movement affecting the GPU, first and only problem I've had running it so far, minus the 'chieves (which I could care less about).", "timestamp_created": 1465427450, "timestamp_updated": 1465460448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23459320": {"recommendationid": "23459320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014344003", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470443502}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a real good surprise\nIt work really well with the htc vive\n\nI recomend it if you like fighting like elite dangerous", "timestamp_created": 1465424930, "timestamp_updated": 1465424930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441409", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23459294": {"recommendationid": "23459294", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966595640", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506714148}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a gorgeous flight-sim that serves bite-sized tactical engagements.

There's a lot to love and there's no doubt in my mind it IS a good game.\n\nHowever, the amount of content is lacking.\nYou'll have a maximum of three ship types in your fleet.\nYou remain in the same fighter throughout which can begin to feel stale.\nAlthough it technically has 42 missions (14 missions with 3 difficulties), only the hardest missions last anything over a couple of minutes.\nThere's little to no strategic component. For the most part, you just order your capital ships at a target and they'll wipe it out. \nLoosing ships is of little consequence. You can have your entire fleet get wiped out and jump into the next mission with all 7 ships. \nI couldn't find a use for any upgrade other than the jump drive (your mileage may vary)\nOverall, unless you REALLY enjoy replaying the same missions, I can't imagine you'll get more than a couple hours of gametime from the whole thing in it's current state. That's not to say you won't enjoy those hours.

I don't have a VR headset *cries*. I'm sure this would only be more amazing with one.\n\nI played with both an Xbox 360 controller and a Thrustmaster T-Flight X HOTAS. The controls are extremely remappable. I played the first few levels with the Xbox 360 controller first, since there is a built in tutorial for that, and it allowed me to understand the mechanics of the game well enough to know how to map my T-Flight X. If you have both, I highly recommend playing with the Xbox controller first for 10-15 minutes to understand the game, and then remap to your HOTAS for maximum awesomeness.\n\nThis game handles beautifully with a HOTAS. Love it.\n\nPros:\n+ Priced correctly \n+ Doesn't feel like most Early Access games - this is a complete product. \n+ Excellent controls/handling\n+ Gives that TIE Fighter/X-Wing/Wing Commander vibe\n+ Has good replayability - I've played through some of the early missions 3 or 4 times already just because they're fun\n+ Good customization mechanics - there are lots of mods/options you can unlock for your ships, which changes the feeling. You can swap out armor for speed, or vice versa, or lots of other things. Various weapons that can be equipped, and each feels unique\n+ Each difficulty feels truly unique. There's none of that \"enemies just have more health and do more damage\" garbage on the higher difficulties. Each increase in difficulty adds new enemy groups that require new strategies to beat the level.\n+ Dat spaceship shotgun weapon tho\n+ Has a drift button to incorporate Newtonian physics, so you can continue flying one direction, but turn your ship around and fire the opposite direction of the way you're moving\n+ Dat drift button tho\n+ Great control customizability\n+ Works with HOTAS (used Thrustmaster T-Flight X)\n+ The developer is great\n+ The graphics look great, even though they aren't Elite: Dangerous quality or anything\n\nCons:\n- Short (I have a couple missions left, but I imagine you could probably play through all the missions on easy in about 2.5  to 3 hours. Probably 1.5 to 2 hours if you completely ignored all the bonus objectives and tried to speedrun it)\n- Lack of objective variety (most of the missions are \"kill this target\", with a few \"defend this target\" missions mixed in.\n- The tactical part of the game feels lacking - its mechanics were definitely secondary to getting the dogfighting right.\n- Once you've built up a fleet, you start to feel pretty overpowered on the earlier missions, since you have a bunch more ships than you did when you originally flew the mission. There is no way not to bring your whole fleet with you.\n-  The missions feel more like a collection of training scenario simulations rather than a cohesive story\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nOverall, this is a great game, created by a great developer (I think it's just one guy). This is the type of guy that I wish had AAA resources and funding, because considering how stellar this game turned out with him working on it alone, I can only imagine what he could accomplish given the resources. I recommend you buy this game not only because it's great, but because the developer deserves to be supported.\n\nAlso, in the extremely unlikely event that the developer actually reads this review - I would DEFINITELY buy a \"Mission Pack\" DLC with additional missions, especially if you added new types of objectives to them, or longer missions with chains of objectives.", "timestamp_created": 1465400011, "timestamp_updated": 1465400065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.713028", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23452977": {"recommendationid": "23452977", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983083655", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1521641304}, "language": "english", "review": "Stylish, immersive, fun warcrimes.\n\nGet this immediately.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis game rules and deserves way more attention than it gets.

I've read countless complaints on other games (Elite Dangerous) regarding text legibility and the text looks great in this and I haven't had any trouble reading it (note: using a Vive).

I'll make a quick pros/cons list:\n\nPros:\n-Looks good.\n-Runs great (all settings maxed using a GTX 980)\n-Sounds are cool.\n-Controls well with a gamepad (I haven't tried the kb/m yet)\n-Combat is fun overall.\n-Weapons are pretty fun.\n-Ships control predictably.\n-Newtonian drift mode so you can \"slide\" while you turn, which is cool.\n-Ship size and scale is pretty cool (big ships vs. little ships).\n-Dogfighting is what the game is built around.\n\nCons:\n-Repetitive. Each mission feels basically the same. My biggest gripe, by far.\n-I've played through quite a few missions and have only upgraded two things, so feels a little grindy. To be fair, I am playing on the first \"star\" option of each mission, so lower rewards. It warns against going higher though if you're \"new to the game\".\n-The ship radar could use a little more color to help assist with not just where something is, but WHAT something is.\n-I have trouble finding the \"warp out\" point at the end of a level sometimes. Not sure if that's a bug, or if it is just something that doesn't show up on radar all the time.\n-By default, there doesn't appear to be any left/right/up/down (horizontal or veritcal) thrust, which seems really weird to be absent from a space flight game. I can pitch, roll and yaw, but not thrust up/down/left/right. Maybe it's in the controls somewhere, but by default it doesn't appear to be enabled unless I am missing something (using an Xbox 360 gamepad).\n\nI say it is worth the $20 if you like space dogfighter games. It's a well built game. The repetitive nature, for me, is the biggest down side of it. However, if you have VR (I do not), then I imagine this game is EASILY worth $20. I'm guessing it probably looks pretty amazing with VR, because it's not bad looking on a regular monitor. [b]I give it a 7/10.

The atmosphere is engaging, and the setting and story elements hit the balance of vague but not obtuse in an excellent manner, similar to the backstory of Homeworld. While we're drawing comparisons, yes, the art style evokes the Homeworld games (and is great), and it kinda feels like the space shooter version of Homeworld I never knew I wanted. Participating in fleet actions is fun, although I wish your AI-controlled fleet was a little more active, and the scale of combat is interesting. Instead of being able to be a one-man army in a strike craft like other games (here's lookin' at you, Freelancer), you [i]will[/i] die if you're not careful. So will your fleet, although it's less \"aw hell, I messed up\" and more \"My frigate died? Why?\", which can cause some frustration, especially after your fleet gets loaded up with promotions which presumably make them more effective in combat, but isn't entirely clear.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have with the game is a lack of depth - there's a 14-mission campaign mode with 1 optional bonus objective and 3 difficulty missions per mission, and only the Harbinger difficulty really evokes the space brawls of the 199X/200X space combat sims, at which point you're dipping your toes into the Dark Souls of space sims. Previous dev updates look like there might be a wave clear skirmish combat mode in the works, which will add a depth of replayability to the game.\n\nIt's high praise to House of the Dying Sun that the biggest complaint I have is that I wish there was more of it.

What makes the game unique is the nature of the missions you have to complete in order to progress. They are basically hit and run missions, where you have to assassinate an enemy lord or complete a specific task and escape, before enemy reinforcements arrive. This feature is what makes this title so much fun to play. As you complete more missions you can unlock modules, weapons and more ships to join you in your campaign.\nBy equipping different modules and weapons you can customize your ships and make them suitable for a certain role, like bombing capital ships or going after enemy fighters. Different loadouts change the way you play and how you can approach your targets.\nChanging to the tactical map gives you the option to take a better look of the battlefield and guide your wingmen more efficiently. Overall House of the Dying Sun is very good game, with intense combat, perfect for fans of the genre but also newcomers.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, then please consider following my curator page.

The actual second-to-second gameplay mechanics work well. The flying is probably the nicest combination of arcade-y feel and realistic movement I've ever played. The muted sounds and reduced speed during drift mode makes the game feel like you're piloting a submarine at times, which fits with the very busy environment of Homeworld-esque space. The shooting is well-done, rewarding skill while not asking too much of you and for the most part, everything is smoothed over with the calculating hand of a well-versed developer. The missions are pretty functional, the graphics are good and show an artistic flair you don't see often in sci-fi these days.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is also one of the shallowest I've ever played. You've pretty much completed the game by the time you've played the first mission and theres no expansion of what you do at all from there. You have bubble shields to get under which adds gameplay, but then you get a weapon that renders them almost meaningless. The tactical decisions you make are barely relevent and the strategic choices of what ships you have and what weapons to equip them are even worse. The bonus system is nice, but theres no reward for it. Killing escape pods is basically an annoyance that you have to do, lining up a tiny target in a submarine for no reason other then to waste a few seconds. The missions last no more then a few minutes by their very design and outright punish you for taking your time. You can beat the game in an hour, two if you screw around alot like I did. For fifteen bucks, thats a hard sell.\n\nBut what bothers me, honestly, is how much potential this game squanders. I've been following this for years, and the game I was following was a quasi-roguelike space shooter with tactical elements. The promise of an open battlefield and a quick transfer, watching a powerful but slow force desperately try to deal with your precision strikes as you move about, striking weak positions and garnering the resources to build a more domineering fleet. The possibilities were endless and the theme of playing the bad guy against a greater force. Taiidani fighters against a Kharak empire.\n\nBut what I got was a shell of what I expected. Instead of a castle, I got a rock so smoothed of all sharp edges that you can see your own reflection in it. I got a shallow, snack-shaped bite of a game. A Ground Zeroes from where a Phantom Pain should be. I'm a victim of my own heightened expectation, I guess. But I've never played a game so bitterly disappointing.", "timestamp_created": 1465334802, "timestamp_updated": 1465334802, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 251, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748787", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23442154": {"recommendationid": "23442154", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961439297", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465332313}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd like to recommend this game, the dev is active responding to people's problems etc\nand the game has some promise. \n   Sadly the cockpit design needs a rework since the scale is wonky which breaks immersion.

I've been playing on a laptop with an Xbox One controller.\n\nPros:\n\n- Beautiful art style. Not too simplistic and not too detailed, just the right balance to make it distinctive without being too minimalist\n- Runs very smoothly for an early access game. I'm playing on an Aorus X7V2 and get >40fps at all times on 'high' settings\n- Flight controls are smooth. The ship goes exactly where you want it and the imput just feels, well, good, once you figure out the control scheme (more on that in the cons)\n- Audio is very satisfying. Though some of the voiceovers seem to be a bit lacking in quality the sound effects and music are wonderful and really pull you into the game.\n- Clean, simple UI is very easy to navigate with either controller or mouse and has very few issues that I've found.\n- the pseudo-RTS aspect of the game is really cool. It's easy to control but not so easy that you feel like commanding your fleet makes no difference in the battles. I've restarted encounters several times because I've botched fleet instructions. Which leads into...\n- Difficulty. Holy **** is this game challenging. Even on the lowest difficulty it took me several tries to finish missions. You can very easily get into situations that will end your mission nearly immediately if you don't pay attention. That said, the game rewards learning strategies and good fleet management.\n\nCons:\n\n- Controls can feel a little awkward at first. The default gamepad controls are, by and large, not at all like a traditional 6-axis space game. I still find myself flubbing buttons because of the unorthodox layout and some things really can't be changed enough to fix this.\n- Minor UI issues can be frustrating. Switching between ships in the tactical view almost feels like guessing sometimes and you find yourself bouncing around different targets a bit before getting the one you want. Some menus can be unintuitive to get between. It's also very easy to accidentally send your ships to a different target in the radial menu if you aren't careful.\n- I find navigating can be difficult without zooming to the tactical view. The radar and HUD pips just don't seem to be where I expect them sometimes, coming from someone who's used to a system like Elite's.\n\nOverall this game was money well spent for $20.

After years of waiting, it's finally out under the name House of the Dying Sun, and I can say with full confidence that it's just about as good as I thought it'd be. House of the Dying Sun is an *exceptionally* polished space fighter sim. The art style, simplistic as it is, is absolutely gorgeous when combined with the phenomenal lighting and post-processing effects, and it allows the game to run smoothly on lower-end systems. Don't worry about wrestling with the controls; they're easy to follow and very tight. I've never been a big fan of complicated control schemes that span a large portion of the keyboard in space sims, unless they're meant to be hardcore. It just ends up disrupting the gameplay and causes frustration for the player, a fact that Dying Sun understands implicitly. The tactical layer is also well-designed, allowing you to easily distribute orders to your allied ships as you progress through the mission.\n\nThe gameplay is thrilling. Missions rarely last more than a few minutes, but there is absolutely no filler to push through as they progress. As soon as you leave hyperspace and enter the mission area, you are beset by hostile forces and you'll have to adapt to the situation. Combat is very fast and lethal, and the presence of actual terrain in the form of astroids, stations and what not, along with the ability to cut your engines and drift in accordance to Newtonian physics ensures that dogfights don't devolve into boring circle-chases.\n\nHowever, if I had to make a complaint about the gameplay, it's that it feels a little easy, even on the higher difficulties. Enemies seem a bit too squishy to me. That being said, I think I'm only a quarter of the way through the game and I haven't played all of my completed missions on Harbinger difficulty yet, so that could change. Also, the developer has stated that he plans on boosting the difficulty in a future update. The game also seems a bit short, with fourteen missions available for you to undertake. However, each of the three difficulty levels change the missions significantly, adding new and tougher enemies to fight and modifying the objectives, so there's a good amount of variety here. The ship upgrades (of which there are many) allow you to use a wide variety of playstyles depending on the ones you use, and the developer intends to add a wave clear mode at the end of the early access period a few months from now. With the combat being as tight as it is, I look forward to challenging myself through the wave clear mode.\n\nNext up is sound design, and this is probably my favorite aspect of the game. The sound design is *masterfully* done. There are no artificially clear sound effects from outside your ship like in most other space sims. Instead, most of the sound you hear comes from within your fighter's cockpit itself; the rumbling and the roaring of the engine reverberating through the cockpit, the muffled mechanical whining of the weapons as they reload, the deep breathing of the pilot through his respirator as you pull tight turns that would undoubtedly flatten a pilot were they in atmosphere, and the laconic reports from your allied vessels as the combat situation evolves... it all sounds phenomenal and makes for an incredibly immersive experience. The game also has a killer soundtrack that seamlessly augments the intensity of the combat. The pounding, tribal-esque percussion reminds me very much of Battlestar Galactica, and it fits perfectly.\n\nThe lore is minimal and unobtrusive, but what's there is quite interesting. You can view information snippets and quotes from prominent individuals in the codex, and they give you a good idea of what life was like in the empire. It all has a very mythical tone to it, and it feels very reminiscent of series like Homeworld and Dune. If there ever is a Dying Sun 2, I'd love to explore the setting further.\n\nOverall, House of the Dying Sun is a real diamond in the rough. Most of the space sims that have been recently released or are in development are open-world experiences, and we've seen very few that hearken back to the older, more linear experiences like Freespace 2 or X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter. Sure, they may not allow you to experience the thrill of discovery, but the polish in the core dogfighting gameplay is undeniable, and I think that's enough. I am glad to say that House of the Dying Sun stands proudly among the classics for me, and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more from Marauder Interactive.", "timestamp_created": 1465331321, "timestamp_updated": 1465331870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23441435": {"recommendationid": "23441435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008426364", "num_games_owned": 706, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502845969}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing Elite Dangerous for a good 6 months.

Dying Sun is one of those games.\n\nSet in the aftermath of the Emperor's betrayal, you and a small band of allies set out to assassinate those who rose up against him. The story, beautifully written and sumpremely understated, never intrudes on the main aim of the game: to kill as many of the traitors as you can.\n\nAnd there is plenty of killing. Much in the vein of Elite, you pilot a spacecraft from a first-person perspective. Similar to Homeworld, you have a tactical map to order your ships around. WIth a wide variety of ship types and weapons, you have to decide mid-battle who to attack, where to defend, and things can get a little crazy. This game is punishingly difficult on higher difficulty levels, and not for one second does it hold your hand. You get a 2 minute tutorial, and the rest is up to you. From the second you warp into a new area to the second you warp out, the action comes thick and fast. Indeed, the only time I had a chance to breathe was in the menu between levels!  You can complete bonus objectives for extra Honor, which can be used to upgrade and unlock new things for your ship between levels which can make you very powerful and able to tackle the harder difficulties.\n\nThe graphics are excellent and the soundtrack is perfectly suited.

I usually don't write reviews because I don't write for free however in extraordinary circumstances sometimes one has to do things differently. And one word describes this game extraordinary. \n\nSome background to give first because I believe its always good to shortly describe who the reviewer is before getting into any review proper. I have been following this game since 2013. Watched all the trailers multiple times, followed the dev on twitter tumblr, his website, religiously read the blog etc., So I am a fan of this game and therefore my review will be coming from the position of a fan.\n\nSummary: \nThe game does more than just check the boxes off of what an arcade space shooter should be. It does more than just bring Starlancer and Freespace to the modern era. It is its own animal, and it fully immerses you into the cockpit and into the battle. Where other games dillie daddle with a long boring tutorial this game House of the Dying Sun now being referred to as HDS gives you a short and sweet tutorial and then blast you off into hyperspace.\n\nOne thing this game doesn't do and I am so glad for it, is it does not waste time. It doesn't waste your time. It doesn't waste it's time. The game is not slow, and battles take place at short range CQB knife fight ranges. The fluff and chaff has been cut away and burned. And whats left is a purified vision of a modern stylish gorgeous arcade space shooter brought into reality. All weapons accept for the heavy weapons have infinite ammo. So watching ammo counters is no longer a distraction. The controls are tight and not lose. I am playing with an x360 controller. It doesn't bog you down with a long boring convoluted story that make no sense and it does everything to keep you immersed and to keep you in the feeling of actually being in space fighting a guerrilla war to the death.\n\nI will break the review down into three parts\n\n1. Gameplay\n\n2. Sound\n\n3. Graphics\n\nGameplay:\nThe basic gameplay loop is this. Pick a mission on the starmap, customize your ships, warp in to the level, complete the objectives, warp out of the level to the starmap, pick a mission on the starmap again. Repeat.\n\nAlong the way you unlock something called Codex which has story and lore for you to read if you choose to.\n\nThe whole design of the game is to purposefully elicit a feeling inside you. That you are hunting down traitors, people that have back stabbed you and betrayed you and you have now been \"activated\" to cleanse the galaxy of the betrayers on behalf of your emperor. Everything is designed about trying to make you feel that. That you are the hunter even while the enemy also feels like they are the hunter. There is a strong feeling of progression throughout the game the more you fight the stronger you get, the stronger you get the bigger the battles.\n\nThere is a constant feeling of intensity with 3 difficulty levels, normal, hard and harder. This is a twitch game and you will need good reflexes. This is not a slow paced game. If you are a slow paced gamer and not willing to add on to your preference you will not like this game. There is an extreme feeling of quickness that grabs onto you as you fly and juke between fighters corvettes and capitals.\n\nThe game can be played using a x360, xone, ps3, ps4, hotas, mouse&board, or other usb controllers. With hotas, and other usb controllers you will have to manually set up the buttons and sticks. With the xbox and playstation controllers it is auto configured for you out of the box and then you can choose to modify the buttons. For example I switched the y button and right bumper on my xbox controller as I have a very specific set up when I play space games.\n\nSound:\nSound is awesome. Muffled explosions really really hit your ears. I do realize that not everyone has a finely tuned and sensitive ear or has ever played instruments. I have an instrument and music background so coming from that perspective I notice tonality and sound and in general sound is just as important as gameplay and graphics. The music has been compared to battlestar galactica but I feel the music really comes into its own and doesn't sound as much like battlestar as others say and feel. Because sound is very subjective these difference in opinion is to be expected and no one is right or wrong. A soundtrack will be released and once it is I'm buying it.\n\nThe music has been coded in to match the gameplay so it is a dynamic soundtrack, with the game code deciding based on the action what prerecorded musical loop to play. Some might fear or worry that this would make the music boring or repetitive but I feel like this is unfounded because you will be so focused on the actual battle that the music doesn't overshadow or de-immersify you out of the game, but it pulls you in more and deeply into the cockpit as you fly around blasting bad guys.\n\nI have some experience creating mods with sound effects for other games it is another hobby of mine. The most important question one should ask about sound effects is this. Does it help me feel like I am in the game? Or does it make me feel like I am listening to poor quality low quality effort made by someone with no experience using ableton live or whatever sound design program? The answer is it definitely does help you feel like you are in the game. The sound effects make sense. It feels like a missile. It feels like a bullet. It doesn't just sound like some random noise some guy put together. The soundscape and tonality match what you see with your eyes on the screen when you go to shoot that gun when you go to fire off the salvo. There is no disconnect. Its connected. And good sound design coupled with good background music help you feel connected to the game and what you are doing inside the game.\n\nGraphics:\nIt's definitely a call back to homeworld in many ways. From the design of the ships to the way the ships were modeled and textured to the way they look like when you move etc., With that being said the developer in no way ripped off homeworld as there are plenty of stark differences between homeworld and HDS to make HDS have its own distinct style. \n\nIts got a retro modern feel. The graphics are not hyper realistic at all, its semi cartoony with a smooth look to it. It feels smooth it feels smooth it looks smooth. The details are in the edges not the center. I have experienced skinning and texturing as I enjoy making mods using skins and textures. In graphics design there is a school of thought that says let the viewers eyes wonder. So in this specific example with this game the way the ships are skinned and textured to not be hyper detailed or hyper realistic lets you focus more on the overall shape of the ship in other words the edges of the ship or the outline of the ship. This removes visual noise and clutter and helps the gamer to determine at a quick glance what ship is what by letting your mind take in the big picture outline of the ship. \n\nThe skybox has a soft feeling to it with softer non glaring non crisp colors. The skybox does not feel crispy or sharpened but has  a blur filter or a desharpning filter or a soft edge filter or some combination of filters on it is to soften it.\n\nI have slight issues with the ingame in cockpit ui. The colors in my opinion are too soft and semi hard to see. I wish there was an option to brighten and sharpen and deblur the ui and/or at least change the ui colors. There is an option to decrease or increase the font size at least. That is very welcomed.\n\nClosing:\nHDS is an arcade 3d space shooter with mission based gameplay that takes a genre that has really gotten stale and does something new and different", "timestamp_created": 1465329422, "timestamp_updated": 1465336096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23440952": {"recommendationid": "23440952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006179748", "num_games_owned": 891, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501395060}, "language": "english", "review": "VR Review (HTC Vive)\n\nAbout: \nHouse of the Dying Sun is a space combat sim with some tactical elements.

Combat is varied depending on your abilities and weapons, replayability is actually fun trying out new combinations and tactics. \n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are quite simple but stunningly beautiful due to the aesthetics and atmosphere.

Pretty fast paced and quite good fun. Completing missions grants you unlocks such as new weapons, or additional fighters, destroyers, and frigates for your fleet, who you are able to assign orders to during missions.\n\nThe game has you flying for/commanding what is essentially a small pirate faction. This plays into mission design; where you warp in, hit the enemy hard and fast where they're most vulnerable and get the hell out of Dodge before the enemy fleet's flagship arrives and blasts you (and your little fleet) to itty bitty pieces. Ultimately this means that most missions so far have been no longer than a few hectic minutes before I've either escaped triumphant, with a field of wreckage in my wake, or I've died most ignobly on the battlefield, one last ugly footnote in the history of a ruined empire.\n\nGraphically, the game is very stylized, but pleasing overall. Ships do seem to keep to a fairly low polygon count, which allows for quite a lot of action to be on screen, even when playing in VR, without any significant performance issues (albeit on a rather beefy system). The perspective from the cockpit feels spot on, and the HUD is both fairly intuitive and unintrusive for anyone familiar with space combat sims.\n\nSounds are somewhat muted in a way.. It's hard for me to explain. But, since you can hear what the game sounds like quite clearly in the trailer, look there to determine if the audio is pleasing for your own tastes.\n\nOverall, the game seems to run in VR with no significant bugs or performance problems, and it has a very impressive level of polish for Early Access.

Sure, the genre is resurging thanks to crowd funding and the novelty of VR. But the genre finds itself carrying the inertia of Chris Roberts and David Braben's gradiose visions. That's not to say their visions of widescope of space combat and exploration are any less valuable contributions to the parched space sim landscape. But sometimes you just want to get in, shoot stuff, and get out. And more importantly, play around with mechanics that are tighter focussed for that quick pace. While also being titillated aurally and visually.\n\nThat's where House of the Dying Sun comes in. House of the Dying Sun is such a tightly focussed space sim with mechanics and gameplay that have taken the Freespace and X-Wing mold but have applied such a wonderful spin on the concepts taken for granted. The game feels familiar but so different than anything I've ever played. The shooting feels great. Maneuvering is straightforward but still reflects a certain mount of tension and stress via the speed conveyed and the drift mechanics that can be used. And the sounds are meticulously detailed such that it greatly enhances the immersion. And dat hyperpsace effect. \n\nI have trouble believing that a game as polished as this was primarily developed by one man. Buy this game, just for that awesome warp effect alone.

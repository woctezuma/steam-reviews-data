The story is linear but you can progress at your own pace, as there are side quests and achievements to garner as you go along.  It's really a charming game that's suitable for all ages.  All I know is, through two sessions of a few hours each, I smiled and clicked my way to get all the achievements with no hints from outside the game.

However, Hero of the Kingdom is a story-driven game as apart from its main story, there are many side-stories along the way. As you move on in the game, you will stumble across some obstacles as well as many new characters who need your help. You need to complete objectives, build buildings, finding objects and move your way forward.\nHero of the Kingdom is a very unique game as it is more of a RPG/Adventure game than a Strategy or Time Management game as some of you might have expected it to be. The game also gives you freedom to explore places you wish and complete objectives you want as it has no fixed instructions to it. Anyway, if get lost you can still follow the incredibly helpful Hint system which will guide your way.\nIn contrast with the game\u2019s fun and addicting gameplay ,the presentation is not so well done. The graphics are certainly not the best quality, they are grainy and the scenes are not attractive. This is fine as long as the items are big enough for our eyes to spot, Hero of the Kingdom basically does the opposite as most of the items and characters are extremely tiny. In addition, the music and sound effects are nothing spectacular. Plus, there are no voice overs despite its large amount of dialogues.\nThe game was very addictive while playing it, and its relative repetitiveness did not hinder it much. The one major flaw of the game is that it is very short, and I completed it in a matter of hours. Overall, it is a very enjoyable indie game, especially if you like calm and casual RPGs.\nOnce you know what to expect (and what not to expect), the game is fun.", "timestamp_created": 1515830302, "timestamp_updated": 1515830302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598540", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39272650": {"recommendationid": "39272650", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971392285", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1515731583}, "language": "english", "review": "Just not my cup of tea, if it had some better writing perhaps, but it is just very blend.", "timestamp_created": 1515731695, "timestamp_updated": 1515731695, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39224497": {"recommendationid": "39224497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031703690", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 318, "last_played": 1515543424}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome.

There's no fancy lighting or edgy music to try and put it in the \"Art\" category that an ever-increasing number of indie games are targetting these days. But what Hero of the Kingdom does deliver on very successfully, is sheer enjoyment and satisfaction.\n\nIf I had to give it a label, I would say that Hero of the Kingdom is a Hidden-Object Adventure, but it's certainly not like other games in that genre that I have played. Those games tend to be more about steering an antagonist around beautifully rendered environments in which the things Im seeking stand out like dogs balls, while trying to solve a crime, or avoid becoming the victim of one. In contrast, Hero of the Kingdom's hidden objects are often feindishly well hidden simply because they utilise the same low-key rendering as the rest of the environment, and are not presented to you as a random chest that has a butterfly, a skull, a broken 17th century hand-blown bespoke led-lit gilded 1:23 scale fucking church window, and a pack of Tic Tacs to sort through, but rather, parts of a thoughtfully crafted map that your shit eyes are going to find challenging to identify. Seems like a really simple problem to avoid considering how long Hidden-Object games have been around, but you might be surprised how much garbage is still churned out and consumed because Kmart only stocks five PC games that aren't Heroes of Might and Magic III.\n\nWhat I'm getting at (I think) is that it's pretty rare to find a game that balances all the things we tend to gripe about, and still manages to be fun, great value for money, and the right length. That last one especially, is an attribute that can never be understated in this genre either. So hats off to you, Lonely Troops, for some of the best innocent fun I have had in quite a while.

Sie sind deshalb optional, weil man sie beliebig erledigen kann sobald man sie erhalten hat. Die 2D-Grafik wird durch einen soliden und passenden Soundtrack erg\u00e4nzt. Man darf keine grafischen und musikalischen Highlights erwarten. \n\nMit einer Gesamtspielzeit von vier bis acht Stunden kann man Hero of the Kingdom ohne Weiteres durchspielen und alle Errungenschaften sammeln. Es h\u00e4ngt auch etwas davon ab wie lange man f\u00fcr das Suchen und Finden der versteckten Gegenst\u00e4nde braucht. Das erkl\u00e4rt eventuell auch den Wimmelbild-Charakter des Spiels.

"language": "english", "review": "Hero of the Kingdom is as casual as they come but despite being very simplistic it's quite pleasant. So pleasant in fact that you can easily lose track of the time by completing it in one session.\n\nIn  the game you're left in charge of your family farm when your father goes for a trip to the market in town. While repairing a broken lookout tower, bandits set the farm on fire leaving you with only some food and money. You embark on a journey to find your father... and unexpectedly save the whole kingdom.\n\nYour only tool in the game is your mouse which you use  to accomplish quests, collect resources and trade for money or other items. Quests and tasks, like collecting herbs or hunting animals, often need strength which is consumed after every action and can be replenished by sleeping and eating food. This is what the gameplay involves in order to proceed to the next area. The achievements are also a considerable part of HotK; some are story related but others for example require you to find every mushroom, egg or treasure or to catch a lot of fish.\n\nFor some reason, to me, the hidden object part of the game is very addicting. It is annoying that everything on the screen is very tiny and you feel like your face needs to be extremely close to the screen. But the completionist in me loves the idea of finding items, selling them and getting more money. I went over every area very carefully and practically scanned them with my eyes like a machine.\n\nHero of the Kingdom takes a little over 4 hours to complete, which is a perfect length for this type of game. The story is really basic, as expected, and the music a bit repetitive but then again I didn't care for them much. The gameplay was so relaxing and the beautiful backgrounds so delightful that it more than made up for it.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 8/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1508014777, "timestamp_updated": 1508016216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35600200": {"recommendationid": "35600200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405231266", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511023019}, "language": "german", "review": "naja", "timestamp_created": 1507568254, "timestamp_updated": 1507568254, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.352928", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35598456": {"recommendationid": "35598456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390562487", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507428253}, "language": "turkish", "review": "K\u0131sa ve \u00f6z bir oyun olmu\u015f.

But for now let us take a look at the pros and cons of the game.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[b]+) Story:[/b]\nA simple piece of writing, but it definitely works. You start as a young boy, who is forced to leave his home and start a journey, which ends in him becoming a hero (I didn't use spoiler-tags, since the title already tells you as much). Nothing new, but told well, which is the most important part.\n[b]+) Art style:[/b]\nI have to admit, that I'm not really objective, when it comes to this point. Some of my favourite childhood games use the same kind of art style. I won't go into details, since you can look at the screenshots yourself, but it was one of the points, which sold the game for me.\n[b]+) Music:[/b]\nThe music fits the overall relaxing atmosphere of the game, while also being dramatic enough to fit more tense moments like battles or hostile environments. However it lacks variety. I'm a person, who can listen to the same song for hours at a time, so it didn't bother me, but I know that this point could also be a con for some people.\n[b]+) Relaxing atmosphere:[/b]\nI pondered if I should write this as an extra pro, since it's the result of the former two points. But in the end it's one of the main reasons why I liked this game. Slowly improving a kingdom, while listening to a soothing tune is a perfect way to end a stressful day.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[b]-) Difficulty:[/b]\nI didn't expect this game to make me grind my teeth, but I still felt let down by how easy this game was. There are no instances, where you need to think what to do next or how to solve a problem, something which I expected from a point & click adventure game. Your character mostly tells you where to go next and interactable objects (people included) have special indicators. The only form of challenge comes from finding the few people, who only get such an indicator after clicking on them and hidden objects all over the in-game world, which appear after you unlock them through skills.\nIn the beginning I thought that money might be another source of difficulty, since nothing is for free. From collecting resources to simply resting, everything needs some kind of consumable, which in return costs gold. But fairly early in the game you unlock the ability to earn unlimited money through trading (if you have enough patience), so as long as you have at least 4 gold, you can't become bankrupt.\n[b]-) Item/Work failure:[/b]\nI don't know if it's scripted or random (perhaps I'll update this review once I started a 2nd playthrough and found out). Either way it's a useless mechanic, that lets your equipment (hammers, axes, etc.) break or certain tasks fail (e.g. making a potion, which you spill at the last moment). Both cases provide no source of challenge, since you can buy new tools or consumables (to finish tasks) indefinitely and money is infinite. Instead it's only a cheap way to lengthen a playthrough.\n[b]-) Last quarter of the game:[/b]\nIt starts right off with the story making a leap of logic, but the main problem I have with this part is the following: Right at the beginning you finish the last side quests. Once this is done the game rushes towards the end. Once you reach this stage you have all the money you could ever want, so you just jump between traders (to get the necessary equipment) and the next main story objective. At this point the game could just as well be a visual novel.\n\n[h1]Additional notes:[/h1]\n~) I 100% completed the game in roughly five hours. My stats may say otherwise, since I played most of it in offline mode.\n\nNow to my conclusion and why I was/am unsure whether I should recommend [i]Hero of the Kingdom[/i] or not. \nI liked the game. It was a nice, relaxed evening playing through it. But before I recommend a game I always try to look at how much you get for your money, both quality and quantity wise. I bought the game for 0,59\u20ac. Based on that I'm absolutely satisfied and recommend it. However the original price (6\u20ac) is just too damn expensive.\nSo yes, [i]Hero of the Kingdom[/i] is worth playing, but only if you get it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1505049178, "timestamp_updated": 1505049178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623585", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34852850": {"recommendationid": "34852850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123697378", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504992552}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was surprisingly enjoyable.

Get it on big discount only.\n\nThe setting is a fantasy kingdom, and you are a young farmer who's trying to figure out what happend to your father. There are bandits, wild animals, and other tasks. Clickable locations on the map are marked, indicating things like places for resource  gathering (fish, animals, etc). A good part of the game is finding hidden resources, represented by tiny icons (like a hidden object game). There are no logic puzzles, timed puzzles, or random combat. The story is cliche', about what a child would write for a creative writing assignment.\n\nThe rest of the game is resource management. You have health and money. Strenuous tasks cost health, which you can replenish by resting and consuming food. You can buy and sell items are certian locations. In order to complete certain tasks (including battles) you need specific amounts of items. All the needed items are spelled out for you when the task becomes available, so that you spend the next bit of game play trying to come up with the right mix of items to complete the task. Getting this right mix of items is where the resource management comes in. You spend quite a bit of time finding raw items (such as by hunting, fishing, or gathering herbs) and converting them into finished items or money. As your characer gains experience, more items are able to be found.\n\nThe whole thing could either be a game teaching young children about resource management games (with lots of hidden objects) or a game for weary adults needing a mental break. About the first 15 minutes of gameplay is very straight forward, as you have everything to complete them and are just clicking through, but soon you come to tasks that require you to do some resource management, above.\n\nOnce you finishe the game, you can go for 100% achievements, but the pixel hunting to collect all the eggs/crates/mushrooms is not easy.\n\nThis game is cheap and periodically goes on heavy discount. I got it for $0.50, if I sell all the cards it'll be cheaper. It's maybe 4 hours of very low brainpower investment, and thus a very good value/cost ratio.

That last goes double if you want to get any of the master level skills. Not that there's much point to it, since very few of the items you collect can be sold. And even though your character is taught herbalism, I haven't found a way to actually make potions.\n\nYou're also given access to a wide range of tools that prove useless soon after you get them. Despite carrying an axe through the entire game, the only times I was able to actually cut wood were during the tutorial and on a quest for the lumber camp. This despite the many quests that require wood.\n\nOne last thing. There are several side quests early in the game. About halfway through, though, that source of income dries up and you're reduced to scrounging across the map for flowers (that require non-reusable containers that you have to buy) and animal hides to sell.\n\nIt's a nice little game with an interesting premise, but it feels unfinished and has essentially zero replay value.

Sostanzialmente interpretiamo un giovane che inizier\u00e0 un viaggio alla ricerca del padre, dopo un attacco alla nostra fattoria. \n\nIl gioco \u00e8 abbastanza semplice, sostanzialmente si raccolgono/acquistano oggetti utili per completare le missioni.\nAd esempio per sconfiggere un gruppo di non morti dovremo avere la mazza, lo scudo, una pozione magica e l'energia per combattere. Mazza e scudo se non li abbiamo, li possiamo comprare o farceli craftare in un accampamento militare, la pozione magica pu\u00f2 essere acquistata oppure realizzata da noi con l'uso dei funghi particolari e l'energia la si ottiene facendo riposare il protagonista in una locanda o in uno dei vari accampamenti.\n\nIl gioco non ha una grafica o musiche eccezionali, \u00e8 semplice anche nel suo comparto tecnico.

(Are you the only compentent person in the kingdom?)\n         4)  Too easy... no real skill seems to be required.  (Point and click, point and click, point and click...)\n         5)  Hunting a boar with a dagger...  NO!

At this point in the game the tutorial starts to let you do your own things. After a while the farm gets burned down by a bandit. This leaves you with no home, no tools and just a little bit of money and food. You decide to seek shelter elsewhere and leave the burned down farm. This is the beginning of your journey on which you will become the Hero of the Kingdom. Fishing, hunting and gathering your way to riches to enlist the help of hunters, knights, scouts and wizards to find your father. \n\n[b]More technical aspects:[/b]\nThe HUD layout is quite astethically satisfying and completely out of the way. Which is to be expected with this kind of game. I like the artwork as it leaves a lot to the imagination while simultaneously indicating what a 'creature' or character you should be imagining but not completely showing you how it looks. In short, it looks dated and a bit like Anno 1602 in some respects. \nAudio wise the reminder of Anno is the same. It gives a nice atmosphere and it really helped to draw me into the story. \nI have had several minutes of pleasure laughing at the rediculous quality of the cow's moo. \n \n[h1]My experience:[/h1] \nI normally avoid p&c games because it is not as action packed as I like my games to be. However, the description of Hero of the Kingdom really drew me in. Seeing it was on sale for only 60 eurocents I decided to buy it and was pleasantly surprised. The story progresses well and it kind of saddened me that it was over so fast. I played for roughly two to three hours to complete the story, the last hour or two were to complete all challenges as I am quite the completionist if my mind is to it. I personally would love there to be a much bigger map and a lot more to do as it seemed to be very possible to do so and would potentially greatly improve the game. Maybe with another big questline.\n[i]Pro tip:\nYou can make an infinite amount of money by buying grain from the farm, taking that to the mill and, at the with 5 coins, creating flour.

As you explore, more of the map opens up, you discover crafting, magic, and the ability to level up, none of these is in any depth however, and the toughest challenge you will face is managing your economy, as most quests require objects that more often than not, require gold to obtain. So exploring whether or not hunting, herb gathering, fishing, delivery services etc. are enough to earn a profit is about the only learning curve in the game.

You are the young son of a humble farmer and you're thoroughly enjoying your peaceful life of agricultural management until one day when malicious bandits suddenly raid your homestead and burn it to the ground. Worse yet your beloved father has also gone missing just as a darkness begins to fall over the entire kingdom. What's a boy to do...overcome his fear and set off for adventure on a dangerous journey to places unknown as you try to find your father of course!!! \n\nHero Of The Kingdom does an excellent job of mixing multiple genres into one solid package...lite roleplaying, adventure, hidden object and point and click. This was my very first foray into a hidden objects game and I must admit that I rather enjoyed it. The visuals and animation are nicely done and fit the game perfectly. The title has a terrific soundtrack and the sound effects are fantastic as well. One downside, however, is the length of the title as I finished this game in under five hours but it was well worth the time spent. There are also some achievements to hunt for if that is your bailiwick.\n\nI was also pleasantly suprised to find out that there is a sequel available, Hero Of The Kingdom II, which I plan to play as soon as I pick up a copy. Anyone looking for a casual game that covers more than one base, genre-wise that is, would be remiss to give this little title a chance.

It doesn't take a nice PC/Mac to play this because it's simply clicking (but it feels like you're doing more). Here are the things I love about this game:\n\nIt's sort of like an I Spy game in which you're trying to find resources in various landscapes - so that feels like a mini game in and of itself. And as you progress, you have to go back and look at old maps/landscapes to see what suddenly appears now that you have the skill to gather/hunt it, etc.\n\nThere are a few crafting/assembly lines you can use to make money. Many you must use to progress in the game because you need a various item. For example, you end up needing bread quite often to heal/sleep and to help others. You can buy the grain, take it to the mill and pay for it to be ground into flour, then you take it to the bread maker, and then you sell it for a small profit. It takes patience but I love that it does because the reward is all the greater. \n\nIt has acheivements which are super fun for completionists. I am still trying to get all of them - so close! I can't find a couple of things on any of the maps! But that is fun to me because it means more time playing the game of I Spy.\n\nThe story progresses perfectly without hitches. There are no glitches and everything you need is basically given to you if you focus on progressing through each map before you complete everything in it. The more maps you have the more opportunities you have to gather/hunt/find the stuff you need for free. It also unlocks more things in the maps you need to go back to anyway. I can tell this game has been thouroughly tested for bugs.\n\nIt's fun to make money in this game! Due to the assemply-line type of things like bread or potions, you end up doing some simple math to figure out who gives you the best deal on the supplies to gather, and who will buy what you've gathered for the highest price. Also, it's fun to figure out which camp is cheaper to camp in based on what resources you need to camp there. \n\nI can easily play this game in windowed mode at work. When I have nothing to do but want to look busy, I just pull it up and play. The simplicity of it makes it easy to be disracted from and come back to just to pick up where you left off. \n\nMy only complaint is that the story is your typical saving someone you love just to find out that you have to defeat a bad guy to save everyone. That being said though, the story was fun enough.\n\nThis game has obviously been translated from another language and is hilarious to read sometimes. Everything makes perfect sense but it's said in a way that sounds like a literal translation from one language to another with no account for the differences in grammar/common use of words between the languages. \n\n\nI think anyone who likes the types of things I mentioned above would love this game. My mom doesn't like most games, especially not adventure/RPG games, but I honestly think she would find this fun due to the \"puzzles\" (where to go to get what to solve various tasks) and the I Spy part of it. Be warned though - if you play windowed you need good glasses or good eyesight because things are tiny and very subtle. To me that makes it more fun though. \n\nPS the only reason I have logged over 100 hours on the game is because I've left it open in the background at work. Being anal about all the acheivements has given me about 10 hours of gameplay, versus the 4 others claim to have gotten out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1484158833, "timestamp_updated": 1484159071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29168836": {"recommendationid": "29168836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062094591", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484077078}, "language": "english", "review": "Casual Game.

You start out as farm boy witnessing your home being ravaged only to find out there's far more behind it (and your family) than your innocent farm boy's ambition could have asked for. And yet, although the linearity is strong in this one, the backtracking is real, sending you from A to B to C often enough to make this tiny world feel more lively and bigger.\n\n\n\n100%ed the game in one session of 5.6 hours which bore little to no let-down. It only presented me with very few issues, like the final battle being rather bland compared to other ones, one or two grammar related issues and one quest that didn't give directions...of course that's not much of an issue as relevant NPCs are highlighted and the world is small, but still.

The gameplay mechanics and graphics are incredibly simplistic, but design choices and details help give the player motivation to keep playing.  A simple one was how as you progress through the game you'll not just expand your inventory, but also develop skills, which give you more options on tasks that you can complete.  This ranges from fishing to hunting, though the chief mechanic doesn't change at all; everything is accomplished with a simple click, if you have the necessary tools and stamina for it.  Part of me thinks that some simple mini-games might liven up those tasks, but part of me also thinks that could become tedious with how often you do it.  Regardless, as you complete quests you will advance in these skills, allowing you to achieve more, and find more hidden objects lurking on the screen.  I found this motivating, as I would scour the screen looking for items that I could sell, as gold is absolutely vital to get anywhere in the game.  In general the game gives you enough freedom to achieve certain things in the order you deem fit, as well as how far to advance in certain aspects, that you don't feel stuck or too tied down, even if there is a degree of linearity in quest advancement.  It does help that the game is short as you never feel like you're straying too far away from your main quest, as inevitably you will finish any side quests and only have one method available to you to move forward.\n\nI wouldn't say this game couldn't stand some improvements though, as there were some design choices that I wasn't a fan of.  For starters, considering how simplistic everything is in the game, I would have hoped that when you click on a task to complete that it would process almost instantly so you wouldn't have to wait to get your results.  This was especially annoying as you discovered mushrooms, eggs, and chests, as you'd see several of them in a new area, but have to wait on each one before you could click on the next one.  This same issue plagued the market system, as you could only purchase in the increments shown, which was usually only one and you have to pause inbetween each individual click.  Streamlining these aspects would make the flow feel better.  \n\nAnother aspect that disappointed me was that despite starting off the game using an axe and saw in order to chop down trees and produce lumber that mechanic was very sparsely used throughout the entirety of the game.  Other tools, like the sickle, were used heavily to gather flowers, so it felt a bit misleading to start off that way and almost never do that again.  That seemed especially pertinent when you'd need to get lumber a few times in order to build things like a water mill and a house, so I would have liked to see a bit more balance and distribution of those less utilized abilities/tools.\n\nThis might be something only I missed, but one aspect of the game that threw me off was replenishing stamina.  Since the game throws you out of your home after you've only regained stamina once, as I progressed and kept healing, I was under the impression that the cap on my hearts was something like 20.  That's the highest amount you can heal yourself for and what you start off with in the game, so I never questioned it.  As I got to the point where tasks took 8+ hearts, you can imagine how often I was going back and forth in the game.  However, I eventually experimented and found I could go higher than 100 actually.  If I had known that sooner, I would have spammed those camp sites in order to stock up on several hearts before getting back into completing tasks.  \n\nA word of advice if you're going for all of the achievements - I found the last treasure when I robbed the three crypts in the cemetary.  Since that lowered my fame after I robbed the first one I didn't end up going through the other two.  After all, I was afraid I'd end the game with too low fame to get my achievement or otherwise harm my ending somehow, but as long as you complete everything you'll be just fine in both the storyline and in achievement hunting.  So you may as well just do it when you can, or otherwise you could miss out on that last treasure by accident.\n\nI already said that I do recommend this game, but it's the sort of experience I'll likely only play through once.  Maybe years from now I might want another go through, but there's little to offer for a 2nd playthrough in either the gameplay or the story.  Also, I have played games just like this for free before, that varied only slightly in overall game mechanics or even in the overlying plot behind the gameplay, which doesn't motivate me to want to pay for a game like this (or in my case trade it for another game).  I doubt I'll bother getting the sequel, as I don't think it'd offer anything more than this game did.  A one time playthrough that's harmless enough, but doesn't give very much meat or fulfillment either.", "timestamp_created": 1480544584, "timestamp_updated": 1480544584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28098349": {"recommendationid": "28098349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074300978", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480514371}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Nagyon j\u00f3\u00f3!

Qu'est ce qu'on y est bien...on m\u00e8ne notre aventure, on se d\u00e9tend, on admire la beaut\u00e9 du monde, on \u00e9coute les sons et la musique, et on est vraiment \u00e0 l'aise\u00a0: \u00e0 la cool.\n\nHero of the Kingdom est un point n' click / gestion / lecture de tableaux. C'est un jeu ou vous collectez des objets, r\u00e9solvez des \u00e9nigmes li\u00e9s \u00e0 la gestion de vos ressources et surtout ou vous observez chaque d\u00e9tails de votre environnement. Le scenario qui vous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 parcourir la r\u00e9gion part d'une id\u00e9e simple et mille fois vue dans l'Heroic Fantasy, mais dans un sens c'est ce qui rend le jeu si bon. Le pitch \u00e9tant tellement basique qu'il \u00e9l\u00e8ve l'aventure au niveau d'un conte classique en quelque sorte. Par de retournement de situation extraordinaire, une histoire toute simple qui n'est rien d'autre qu'attachante et agr\u00e9able.\n\nVous vivez paisiblement avec votre p\u00e8re \u00e0 la lisi\u00e8re d'un bois, vous partez quelques heures loin de votre refuge pour aller chercher des ressources, et pendant cette petite escapade votre p\u00e8re se fait enlever par des bandits de grands chemins. Qu'a cela ne tienne, morbleu\u00a0! Vous d\u00e9cidez de partir \u00e0 sa recherche. Au cours de votre p\u00e9riple, vous devrez rendre service \u00e0 monsieur et madame tout le monde pour progresser plus loin dans la vall\u00e9e et obtenir certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments rares. Tout ce travail d\u00e9veloppera vos capacit\u00e9s dans beaucoup de domaines, ce qui finira par vous \u00e9lever au rang de h\u00e9ros dans ce petit monde m\u00e9di\u00e9val saupoudr\u00e9 de Fantasy, \u00e0 la fois sympathique et hostile.\n\nLe principe de jeu repose essentiellement sur un sous-genre du point n'click que l'on voit de moins en moins de nos jours, \u00e0 savoir les jeux de lecture de tableaux. Pas de surbrillance pour les items \u00e0 collecter, \u00e0 vous de d\u00e9nicher sur de grandes fresques les \u00e9l\u00e9ments allant du sanglier au plus petit champignon. Les jeux de ce type reposent souvent sur des artworks somptueux sur lequel on a plaisir \u00e0 passer des heures \u00e0 scruter chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ments du d\u00e9cor. Mais Hero of the Kingdom \u00e0 une esth\u00e9tique particuli\u00e8re\u00a0: Le jeu n'est pas magnifique au sens ou on peut l'entendre, mais sa direction artistique \u00ab\u00a0\u00e0 l'ancienne\u00a0\u00bb est tout \u00e0 fait g\u00e9niale, une sorte de floue s\u00e9pia qui recouvre globalement les tableaux et est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 des bruitages ultra clairs qui rendent le tout extr\u00eamement vivant. A l'\u00e9cran vous avez devant vous une image statique si vous coupez le son du jeu, mais d\u00e8s qu'il est activ\u00e9, tout semble s'animer. L'aspect visuel de Hero of the Kingdom m'a beaucoup rappel\u00e9 l\u2019esth\u00e9tique des vieux jeux Sierra, ce qui a s\u00fbrement contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 booster mon plaisir sur ce titre.\n\nLe jeu n'est vraiment pas cher, et vous pouvez le trouver pour quelques centimes en p\u00e9riode de soldes. C'est un jeu \u00e0 jouer pour se d\u00e9tendre, pour explorer, se laisser porter par l'ambiance visuelle et auditive, pour le plaisir de farmer, de scruter. Je suis sur que Geralt de Riv joue \u00e0 Hero of the Kingdom \u00e0 Kaer Mohren quand il est en vacances.\n\nUn beau 18/20 pour un classique du genre, un souffle d'air frais qui d\u00e9poussi\u00e8re un style malheureusement trop souvent oubli\u00e9.", "timestamp_created": 1479927047, "timestamp_updated": 1479927047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507735", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26788670": {"recommendationid": "26788670", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994622900", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443527592}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely love this!\nSerene, calming gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1479926435, "timestamp_updated": 1479926435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26771404": {"recommendationid": "26771404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006919903", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436712086}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is simply beautiful. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1479925047, "timestamp_updated": 1479925047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26743606": {"recommendationid": "26743606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136395777", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510011266}, "language": "english", "review": "The good old, Hero of the Kingdom.

Having picked it up on offer, I decided to give it a run-through, and it was a generally pleasant experience. Nothing that stands out in particular in terms of what would set it apart from other games, but nothing that felt like it hampered my experiences either. If you have a few hours to spare and a bit of change, this is worth at least one playthrough to pass the time away. It doesn't have much of worth to bring you back for a second playthrough, but given a reasonable price point and it's worth the one time.\n\nThe game is essentially a resource management simulation where you have to manage what you have, your energy, money and your skills to eventually become the \"Hero of the Kingdom\", and honestly, it's not too challenging provided that methodical progression is applied to everything, from levelling your capabilities to ensuring you have enough food or money for the next event you have to overcome. It does have some strategical layer of depth to it (case in point, you can simply buy certain things you need, but if you work on your skills you can get items for much cheaper than you would buying them) and I appreciated the layers that had been taken to reward those who did go a little extra in managing their resources more efficiently\n\nA lot of the gameplay elements are easily visible event points, though one of the other draws of the game is an element of hidden object games, where you find items such as mushrooms or crates for extra items and money. Beyond these elements, it tends to play forward in a more point-and-click adventure game than your typical RPG (a great number of RPG elements are not present here, so if you are looking for an RPG experience, I would advise seeking this elsewhere) and the story it does tell through the story is a simple one, with a neat bow finish after the ending progresses. If any complaint could be thought of, it would be that there's no real sense of time passing by as any of these events transpire - and given that you can rest in camps without any effect to the story does not help in this regard.\n\nIn terms of the art assets, the landscapes, the various icons and the people you get to see are pleasant to look at, with nothing looking out of the ordinary for a fantasy adventure. The game has a good sound quality to it, from the effects to the music, though it can sometimes be distracting when the track suddenly changes while you've been on a screen for a while without any change. All-in-all, though, the complaints that I have are minor and nit-picky, and did not detract from the fact that I did get enjoyment from the game overall, and while I clocked only about 4-5 hours and obtained all achievements (with others completing it in less time), it was a worthwhile 4-5 hours that I had spent without any regrets.\n\nIn summary: While a short point-and-click adventure experience, it's hidden object and resource management elements helped keep the gameplay varied and entertaining, while the story and progression was balanced enough that it did not feel like it carried on for too long or too short a time, and it didn't leave any loose ends. It's lack of difficulty or replay value is an appeal for anyone seeking something to plug into for a few hours of their time, and the price value makes this at least worth a purchase on a sale, if not at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1479193582, "timestamp_updated": 1479193582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26609699": {"recommendationid": "26609699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339267700", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479147118}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un buen juego para pasar un rato", "timestamp_created": 1479179524, "timestamp_updated": 1479179524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26606031": {"recommendationid": "26606031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035905391", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479600731}, "language": "french", "review": "un jeu fort reposant", "timestamp_created": 1479157193, "timestamp_updated": 1479157193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26592974": {"recommendationid": "26592974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159758642", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507032512}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy recomendable,un poco corto,pero por 59 centimos...hubiera pagado hasta 3\u20ac.Muy viciante  y con un buena linea de progresion.", "timestamp_created": 1479086428, "timestamp_updated": 1479209091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26592926": {"recommendationid": "26592926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021789508", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479085924}, "language": "english", "review": "FUN game, with seek and click map items.\nGame is short, finished it in three hours.\nWould kill Dark Lord again\n", "timestamp_created": 1479086143, "timestamp_updated": 1479086143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26591467": {"recommendationid": "26591467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006573005", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479078360}, "language": "english", "review": "weirdly addictive, i got this for 60 cents with a 90% off and i cant remember the last time i was this ingrossed in a hidden object game, worth every cent and i am looking forward to replaying this\n\noh and after three hours i got all 38 achievements in my first play with the 140 eggs being the toughest one to get, check the cliffs and mountians as well to find them", "timestamp_created": 1479078508, "timestamp_updated": 1479078508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26590368": {"recommendationid": "26590368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012637964", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479073257}, "language": "turkish", "review": "1 Lira indirimdeyken c\u00fczdandan alm\u0131\u015ft\u0131m.

I was looking for something casual that wouldn't frustrate me with arbitrarily difficult mechanics. Six hours later, I'm exactly 15 mushrooms away from completing every \"achievement\" in the game (37 of 38). All the little side quests and object hunts kept me happily engaged and distracted, going back and forth through various areas to discover newly revealed items, and kept my completionist impulse throughly fed. For $0.59, the value can't be beat (even if, as I suspect, the game offers no replayability of substance).\n\nFulfilling the requirements to complete the major \"quests\" required at least a little thought and planning to ensure that I did everything in the right order and didn't run short of resources in the process. I agree with critics who say this game is not difficult. If you're looking for hardcore gameplay, this is not the game for you. Short of being so stoned that you fail to figure out the basic resource gathering / cash generation loop, there's no real \"challenge\" to speak of, no combat mechanics, and the game, while not putting you \"on rails\" completely, doesn't let you get ahead of yourself... you have to complete each step before new areas open up for exploration.\n\nI'm pretty sure it is impossible to \"lose\" the game, or to \"die\". The \"hint\" mechanism is helpful, but barely necessary... the game makes what needs to be done next pretty obvious, if you're paying attention. You're free to roam around within explored areas, and to pursue quests given in whatever order seems sensible (not all quests are immediately achieveable, you have to build up to them by gathering resources and generating \"fame\" through completing a large variety of simple side quests), but as indicated, unexplored areas can only be opened up by completing quests, and the mechanics ensure you complete the quests in the appropriate order.\n\nAll in all, a nice, satisfying, rewarding \"casual\" gameplay experience. 7/10, and that's not a complaint. No regrets about the six hours / sixty cents invested. Sometimes, you just want to \"play\", not \"compete\".

I reccoemnd this to anymore looking for a quick relaxing game with a fun storyline.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1478565022, "timestamp_updated": 1478565022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26480156": {"recommendationid": "26480156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266837910", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478558290}, "language": "schinese", "review": "2\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u901a\u5173\u3002\n\u5148\u73a9\u76842\u518d\u73a9\u76841\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u96be\u5ea6\u5c0f\u597d\u591a\u2026\u2026[spoiler] \u540e\u671f\u53ea\u8981\u75af\u72c2\u5356\u836f\u5c31\u597d\u4e86[/spoiler]\u3002\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u90a3\u4e9b\u5b9d\u7bb1\u554a\u8033\u73af\u6212\u6307\u73cd\u73e0\u5927\u5934\u9c7c\u4e0a\u54ea\u5356\u2026\u2026\u662f\u6211\u5730\u56fe\u8fd8\u6ca1\u89e3\u9501\u5168\u54170.0\n\u4f46\u662f\u603b\u4e4b\u8fd8\u662f\u4e2a\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u6740\u65f6\u95f4\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f0.0", "timestamp_created": 1478554796, "timestamp_updated": 1478554796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26423362": {"recommendationid": "26423362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167757942", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478294036}, "language": "turkish", "review": "OYUN G\u00dcZEL AMA NEDENSE A\u00c7ILMIYOR \u015e\u0130MD\u0130 DEL\u0130RECE\u011e\u0130M", "timestamp_created": 1478294093, "timestamp_updated": 1478294093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26414916": {"recommendationid": "26414916", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996273719", "num_games_owned": 758, "num_reviews": 146, "playtime_forever": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425903295}, "language": "german", "review": "[h1] Information [/h1]\n\nHero of a Kingdom ist eine Mischung aus Point and Click, Abenteuer, RPG und Wimmelbildspiele.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nDu hast bisher immer gl\u00fccklich und friedlich auf einem kleinen ruhigen Bauernhof gelebt.

Because that's really how I feel about this game.\n\nI don't hate it, but it really isn't very interesting either.  \n\nI don't mind the almost entire lack of graphics - graphics in the game pretty much consists of still painted scenarios.  \n\nBut there is really very little going on in the game.  Oh sure there are step-n-fetchit \"quests\", but the game is so entirely linear that its like reading a choose-your-own-adventure that somebody else has already gone through, and you have to follow in their footsteps.  There is really very little choice in the game.\n\nAlso this is THE GRINDIEST game I have ever had the misfortune to come across. \n\nOne of the major flaws in this game (so far) is that you are constantly being given \"quests\" that you have to spend your own money on - of which you have very little.\n\nAnd more often than not, these quests don't even make sense.  For example, once you join the army, you are given quest after quest that requires you to go out and hire workers, hunters, and soldiers, and buy materials, weapons, and supplies, to perform tasks for the army - and you are expected to pay for ALL of this out of pocket.\n\nIn what army are the privates and new enlistees expected to pay their fellow soldiers to do the jobs those soldiers joined the army to do, such as fight battles with goblins and bandits?  And in what army do enlisted personell go to the armorer and then have to PAY for their weapons, supplies, and armor?\n\nWhile there are mushrooms to pick and sell, and fish to catch, etc, these items quickly disappear and then you have to wait a long time for them to respawn.  So you can't really forage your way to wealth.\n\nThe only way I've found to make enough money to do the quests is to literally grind - grain into flour, then take the flour back to the baker and trade it for bread, then take the bread into town and sell it at the inn.  And you have to do that a looooooong time, over and over and over again, as you are only making a little over 1 gold per loaf.  \n\nSome of these early quests take THOUSANDS of gold worth of materials and hired help.  And you can't \"sell all\" - you have to click to sell each individual loaf of bread.  I literally have spent hours reading a book with one hand and methodically clicking over and over again to make enough money to do the stupid quest that I shouldn't have to pay for anyway because its the armies job in the first place.  What IS the general doing with all that money he gets from the royal exchequer?  He's sure not spending it on personell or supplies.\n\nOverall I'd not recommend this game.  People complained about Titan's Quest being too linear - they should take a look at THIS one.  This has got to be The Definition of a linear game.\n\nGrind grind grind.  And then virtually no choices anyway.  I don't see the point.\n\nAlso - the main character (who you are following around throughout the game) is pretty much of a jerk.  He self-proclaims his own heroism every time you turn around.\n\nActually, the more I think about it, I would not recommend playing this game even if you got it for free.

There are so many of them on Steam, and with debacles like NMS, it's easy to become a bit jaded. I typically avoid most hidden object games to boot, so when I fired up Hero of the Kingdom I expected something pretty boring and tedious. I'm happy to say that I was wrong - and what I found recaptured some old memories for me.\n\nRemember when you were a kid, discovering games for the first time, and letting your imagination whisk you away? I'm nearly thirty now, and that feeling is too rare these days. Hero of the Kingdom didn't blow me away, but it did help me remember that sometimes games can be like a cosy blanket that you settle into at the end of the day. A hot mug of tea and a crackling fire in winter - that's what this game is. The simple, rustic fantasy setting and verdant aesthetic, the gentle score and straightforward-yet-rewarding gameplay all combine very well to create a surprisingly immersive experience. The whole is much greater than the sum, I feel.\n\nYou start out with a pretty typical fantasy trope via your farm being burned to ashes by bandits, and your father going missing. From there, you embark on an adventure to capture all the krayfish and mercilessly steal eggs from nests. I mean, erm, 'helping fellow villagers'. These tasks range in importance...some are incredibly menial, some revolve around the livelihood of an NPC, and others up the stakes towards the prevention of an apocalypse. It's all quite homely, although the game doesn't shy away from generic soldiers getting killed. Essentially, the gameplay revolves around resource management in a point & click environment - collect materials, trade them, sell them for cash, and so forth. You're fairly well railroaded at first, although at around the halfway point you can elect to ditch the sidequests in favour of just buying everything, if you're happy to buy/sell accordingly and get an endless profit going.\n\nI was sceptical, but Hero of the Kingdom won me over from the outset. I beat the game in six hours, and I was thoroughly impressed. Well worth the cash when it's on sale, if only for being able to indulge your inner child for a few hours.

Hardest achievement to earn: 5000 gold in inventory, but that is where strategy and some grinding/ farming can come in handy. (There are a couple of ways to farm in this game though it is not really necessary unless one wants to earn lots and lots of gold early in the game but it will be tedious to do.)\n\nStoryline: Father leaves son at home on their farm.  Dad will be back in a week.  Day after he leaves bandits attack, burning all to the ground.  Intrepid son leaves home to catch up with dad, only to discovery dad's wagon has been attacked (by the same bandits the son suspects) and dad is no where to be found, alive or dead.  Hearing rumors dad was taken captive the son decides to find and rescue his father.  Once that decision is made the epic journey begins.  Along the way the son meets people, helps them, earns gold, learns skills and eventually rescues dad.  But wait that is only half way through the game.  The son learns about his father's past, his connection with the Kingdom's King, and how dark forces are once again trying to take over their peaceful Kingdom.  Good thing the son joined the army and made lots of friends because he has to finance this little venture of defeating the rogue wizard who now calls himself, the Dark Lord.  (Is there any dark wizard who does not call himself \"Dark Lord\" I wonder?) \n\nGameplay: Easy to understand icon driven quest adventure, and no actual swashbuckling fighting with controller or keyboard. (No frowning by those who are good at such melee combats.)  This game is more point and click without all the puzzle elements.  Every available thing to do in any area has an icon attached to it.  Need potions, look for the vial and have the asking price ready.  Need to gather flowers, a basket or sack plus a scythe is needed.  Need to fish, bait and fishing pole.  Talk to people with a speech bubble or exclamation mark.  Combat (for the frowners out there) is simple.  Buy the soldiers, weapons, healing potions, or whatever the icon indicates one needs then click the crossed sword icon when ready.  Swords clash, combat sounds, visual advance of the combat group, guaranteed win.  However the player will lose people, equipment, and any potions brought along.  It is very realistic in that way.\n\nOkay seems easy enough, but a lot of resource management strategy is involved.  Gold until the very end is not something one ever has a lot of, even in the end one may not have a lot.  Everything costs something, and there is a barter of goods for other goods or sleeping accommodations to replenish one's health.  People, however, all cost money, and soldiers cost the most and one will need lots of them.  The strategy of the game comes with the resource management of buying just what one needs and possibly a spare for certain things that are used a lot.  The idea is not to accumulate items but to gather and sell the extra.  One needs that gold for something else always, like learning to hunt better, buy the services of workman, equipment, supplies or funding an army.  \n\nTalking to people and doing mini-quest tasks is another money maker though in some cases an investment of supplies is needed.  One may talk to someone and know the task long before one is able to complete it.  Fortunately those people retain an exclamation point over their head until the task is complete.  However there are people without exclamation marks or icons over their heads, so people standing around alone somewhere might actually have a task for one to do or be someone one is looking for.  \n\nThis in an odd way leads us to the \"hidden object\" part of this game.  There are lots of hidden objects, eggs, lost crates and barrels, treasure, even a person or two to name some.  (See the achievement list found on the inventory screen for everything.)  First of all, the hidden objects are progressive.  What I mean by that is when one starts out there are no lost crates or barrels, but as one progresses in the game and learns new skills not only do new icons show up but more hidden objects show up too.  Certain things like golden eggs or treasure do not show up until one talks to the Master Hunter.  Or pearls when one pays to learn new skills from the Master Fisherman.  Basically hidden objects can show up again in a location that one has already scoured for objects.  I would guess after each new icon that appears like ones for flowers, fish or hunting a new set of hidden objects appear or anytime a new skill is learned.  Many of hidden object crates or barrels are submerged in water so look close and click on anything that looks promising.  If one plays on a small screen this might be a problem, the objects are small (or actually relative is size to the world they are in).  Eggs are found in bird's nests. A bird nest's in real life is small so a bird nest in this game having the same proportion to its world is tiny.  It is white which makes it easier to spot.  Mushrooms are small too and 4 different types eventually show up.  So the hidden object elements are progressive and show up as the story progresses so go back to every place and look for any new items.                    \n\nOverall, easy to play, simple to understand, relatively fast paced adventure quest storyline with side tasks to do (people and ghosts), lots of hidden objects to find, with some basic strategy and money/ resource management involved.  Can often be found on sale, in bundles, or on give-away sites.

I'd say it's well worth about 3 since you will enjoy it for 3 hours, if it's your cup of tea that is.\n\nSince the conclusion is what y'all look for I simply put it on the top. If you wanna keep reading then proceed to further thoughts. \n\nIf you want a challenge, look elsewhere. This game is more of an interactive storytelling and it's a good one. \nThe story isn't anything new, just a from boy to man kindoff thing going on. It's also just a point and clicker game, if you want to pick up mushrooms, click em and you got em.\nSo you will not do anything strategybased, the game really walks you through the whole thing without room for failure.\n\nAll this might sound like it's just plain crap, that's far from the truth. \nI'm gonna make a comparison to sandbox/survivalgames like minecraft here. One of the main reasons I don't care for such games is the timeconsuming thing about getting simple things done. This game does the opposite, though every quest in the game is a fetchquest of sorts. But I for one don't mind a fetchquest if it takes like 1 minute to complete and you're rewarded straight away with progression in the story.  \n\nThe game will not last much longer than 3 hours so keep that in mind when you throw money at the screen.\nProtip: Sleep in camps, you will thank me later! :)", "timestamp_created": 1468478489, "timestamp_updated": 1468478489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24304055": {"recommendationid": "24304055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063442824", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468447107}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430...", "timestamp_created": 1468447408, "timestamp_updated": 1468447408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24301279": {"recommendationid": "24301279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076328268", "num_games_owned": 894, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503247534}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gra, kt\u00f3ra udaje rpga (s\u0142abo) i strategi\u0119 ekonomiczn\u0105 (lepiej), a w rzeczywisto\u015bci jest przede wszystkim... przygod\u00f3wk\u0105 typu hidden objects (jak dla mnie).\n\nZ rpga s\u0105 niby questy, ale nie ma opcji, \u017ceby je wykonywa\u0107 na r\u00f3\u017cne sposoby. Plusem jest to, \u017ce mo\u017cemy si\u0119 nimi zajmowa\u0107 w dowolnej kolejno\u015bci.

Surowce trzeba zbiera\u0107 g\u0142\u00f3wnie ze wszystkich oznaczonych punkt\u00f3w. Czasem zachodzi potrzeba kupowania ich od handlarzy, ale nie wiem czy da si\u0119 w tej grze straci\u0107 pieni\u0105dze i nie m\u00f3c jej uko\u0144czy\u0107. Chyba nie. I tu jest g\u0142\u00f3wny minus tej gry - zbyt niski poziom trudno\u015bci. A w zasadzie to brak jakiejkolwiek trudno\u015bci.\n\nRozgrywka jest przyjemna, ale tak naprawd\u0119 nie stanowi \u017cadnego wyzwania. Jedyny problem polega na zaliczeniu wszystkich achievement\u00f3w, co wymaga klikania na wszystkie interaktywne elementy na mapie, a nie jest to proste, czasem wy\u0142apanie tych kilku pikselk\u00f3w na ekranie bywa\u0142o dla mnie uci\u0105\u017cliwe (ale koniec ko\u0144c\u00f3w da\u0142o troch\u0119 satysfakcji).

Je\u015bli kto\u015b nie przepada za takimi rozwi\u0105zaniami w gameplayu, to nie ma si\u0119 co przejmowa\u0107, bo do uko\u0144czenia g\u0142\u00f3wnego w\u0105tku chyba nie potrzeba niczego nieoznaczonego wyszukiwa\u0107. Gdyby gra pozwala\u0142a na pora\u017ck\u0119, czyli niemo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 jej uko\u0144czenia, to satysfakcja z jej przej\u015bcia by\u0142aby znacznie wi\u0119ksza i mo\u017ce zach\u0119ca\u0142oby to do ponownego jej odpalenia (jest raczej na jeden raz).

Der Protagonist der Geschichte bleibt quasi im Hintergrund und taucht nur als Erz\u00e4hler in Textform auf.\n\nAber nicht nur die gelben Icons lassen sich anklicken, sondern auch in der Landschaft versteckte kleine Objekte, wie zum Beispiel Krabben und Vogeleier. W\u00e4hrend man diese Dinge ohne Energie und zus\u00e4tzliches Material einsammeln kann, ben\u00f6tigt man f\u00fcr die Sachen mit den Icons in jedem Fall Energie, dazu teilweise diverse Beh\u00e4lter,  Werkzeuge und/oder Waffen. Diese Dinge muss man kaufen, daf\u00fcr kann man seine gefundenen und gesammelten Sachen im Laufe der Geschichte an entsprechende Personen verkaufen. Auch lassen sich einige Dinge weiterverarbeiten, zum Beispiel  Kr\u00e4uter zu einem Heiltrank.\n\nUm in der Story weiter zu kommen, muss man verschiedene Quests erledigen, die meistens klischeehaft aus  ,Tue dies, tue das, bring mir dieses, hol mir jenes\u2018 bestehen. Das ist aber nicht weiter tragisch, sondern verleiht dem Ganzen einen eigenen Charakter, da der Protagonist bei Annahme und Abschluss einer Aufgabe seine Gedanken dazu mitteilt.\n\nDie Geschichte selbst ist nicht besonders tiefgr\u00fcndig und in \u00e4hnlicher Form wohl schon unz\u00e4hlige Male zu finden. Es passiert etwas B\u00f6ses und ein mutiger junger Mann zieht aus, wendet alles zum Guten und wird zum Helden. Happy End :)\n\nAlles in allem fand ich das Spiel aber sehr unterhaltsam, es ist simpel aufgebaut und ich konnte mich fr\u00f6hlich durch die Landschaft klicken. Die oft einfach gestrickten Quests konnten ohne weitere Schwierigkeiten gel\u00f6st werden und die sp\u00e4tere Suche nach den restlichen versteckten Objekten brachte nochmal etwas Abwechslung.\n\nWer es also mal etwas entspannter angehen lassen will, dem sei Hero oft he Kingdom empfohlen :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1465168833, "timestamp_updated": 1465168833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23394101": {"recommendationid": "23394101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095247113", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465106578}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun casual game, a nice mix of RPG, strategy, and hidden object.

Vielleicht kann man es als storygetriebenes, recht lineares Ressourcenmanagement-RPG bezeichnen. Und das Ganze in Age of Empires-\u00c4sthetik.\n\nWir leben mit unserem Vater auf einem landwirtschaftlich betriebenen Hof. Eigentlich unspektakul\u00e4r. Eines Tages finden wir unser Haus von Banditen niedergebrannt vor und unser Vater ist unauffindbar. Ist er tot, wurde er entf\u00fchrt? Wir beginnen eine Reise in eine mittelalterlich gepr\u00e4gte, sp\u00e4ter auch mit Fantasy-Elementen angereicherte, uns noch unbekannte Welt, auf der steten Suche nach unserem Vater.\n\nDie Mechaniken sind recht simpel gehalten. Auf verschiedenen Screens k\u00f6nnen wir auf Icons klicken, die Aktionen oder Gespr\u00e4che ausl\u00f6sen. Aktionen kosten in der Regel Energie, manchmal auch Ressourcen. F\u00fcr erledigte Aktionen erhalten wir meist wieder Ressourcen. F\u00fcr erledigte kleine Quests, die meist mit Gespr\u00e4chen beginnen, erhalten wir meist Gold und Sterne, mit denen wir unseren Ruf aufleveln k\u00f6nnen, was uns dann wieder neue Aktionen erm\u00f6glicht.\nAn bestimmten Orten gibt es H\u00e4ndler. Hinzu kommt, da\u00df die Screens auch als Suchbilder fungieren. Es sind zum Beispiel kleinpixelige Pilze oder Vogeleier versteckt, die wir als Ressourcen einsammeln, indem wir draufklicken. Dabei kann man auch auf das meiste nur einmal klicken, dann ist es \"abgebaut\" und erledigt. \n\nEin einfaches Beispiel: Mit einer S\u00e4ge k\u00f6nnen wir vier Holz an einem bestimmten Ort gewinnen, das wir f\u00fcr die Reparatur einer  Br\u00fccke ben\u00f6tigen. Der Abbau kostet zwei Energie. Um die Br\u00fccke zu reparieren brauchen wir aber noch drei Arbeiter, die wir in einem Steinbruch gegen Gold anheuern k\u00f6nnen. Aber wir haben gerade zu wenig Energie zur Reparatur. Also k\u00f6nnen wir in einem Zelt schlafen und damit zehn Energie bekommen, was uns allerdings zwei Brot kostet. Nach der Reparatur erhalten wir Gold und Erfahrungssterne. Und so weiter und so fort.\n\nDie Ressourcen sind zahlreich, die Mechaniken allerdings einfach und nicht schwer zu meistern. Streckenweise wird das Game etwas grindig, ohne aber da\u00df die Wiederholungen zu anstrengend werden. Es bleibt stets machbar und simpel, denn nicht die Mechaniken, sondern die Geschichte steht im Vordergrund.\n\nUnd diese Geschichte funktioniert grandios. Sie ist sehr einfach, fast naiv erz\u00e4hlt und hat dadurch etwas m\u00e4rchengleiches, erinnert an die Gebr\u00fcder Grimm, an einfacher Bauersohn zieht in die Welt, erlebt Abenteuer und wird K\u00f6nig. Die (nicht vertonten) Texte schaffen es erstaunlich leicht, einen hineinzuziehen in diese eigene und doch irgendwie vertraute Welt. \n\nZudem stimmt einfach das Balancing zwischen Geschichte und Mechanik, das Pacing. Kein Part nimmt zuviel Raum ein und dadurch wird nichts wirklich langweilig. \n\nDie Grafik erinnert stark an Titel wie Age of Empires und das pa\u00dft herausragend gut.

At first I was worried because of the way it took me by the hand during the first 5 minutes or so. But my worries dissipated after the game and quests opened up wide to allow some interesting decision-making. It was just the right level of challenge to complete all of the achievements. The story, although not very original or believable, is imersive and entertaining. \n\nI see people complaining about 2 things and I'd like to adress them. \n1 - \"It's like a facebook game\". People say that because of the energy system and kind of exploration + completing quests gameplay. Yes, the gameplay is really an interactive story with exploration, hidden objects, collection and trading, so be aware. On the other hand, it does not have those annoying time limits, inviting friends and premium currency. You don't even have to wait for your energy to be low to recharge it - there's no limit to how much energy you can carry so although it's not realistic, you can rest repeatedly and build up lots of energy to then do your actions. Also, this game has an END. It does not have seasonal events and added content. So I see a monstruous gap between this game and a facebook one, I love this game and hate the ones on facebook. Huge difference.\n\n2 - \"The game is too short\". For the people who say that, I recommend a youtube video called \"in defense of short games\", from the channel Extra Credits. They explain it a lot better than I could write here. But basically if people keep on judging games only by the lenght of the gameplay, we will get longer games that provides us a poorer experience. Everybody knows at least one TV series of movie franchise that got streched to the point it became so bad it was not worth watching. We need to end this way of thinking. The lenght was perfectly fine for me. I finished the game in 2 sittings of about 3 hous each, reading every dialogue line and getting all achievements before ending the game. Isn't that enough gameplay? There are too many other games out there I'd like to experience before getting stuck with a single game that provides \"endless gameplay\" or something.\n\nIf I had to complain about one thing in the game, would be the pace of the action resolution sequences. Everytime an item drops, I need to collect it before moving on. Everytime I choose to perform an action, I need to wait until it is done to do something else. I'd like to be able to do several actions at once, clicking the next one before the previous one is completed, then collect their rewards. Or at least click several actions and \"queue\" them. It would make the game more dynamic. Also, the nighttime sequence is too long for something that will be repeated several times during the game.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1463339522, "timestamp_updated": 1463339522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23003497": {"recommendationid": "23003497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077700052", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454177098}, "language": "english", "review": "This simple game is just great.

"english", "review": "While this game is no RPG at all, it is worth the buy on sale. Full price is not really a fair buy, as the game is really short (I got all the achievements) and has no replay value at all. \n\nIt is essentially a casual clicker game with some hidden object dimension in it (more below). You go on from map to map, gathering food, objects, speaking to uninteresting NPCs, and accomplishing some dull quests for them. Yet, the game is catchy, and you can finish it in a row as it keeps being entertaining. You cannot die nor make mistakes, it is pretty easy, but it's fun. \n\nTo make some more money (necessary for quests) you can grab some objects hidden on the maps, such as mushrooms, fishes, crevices, eggs, and you can hunt animals. Strangely enough, becoming the Hero of the Kingdom also means plundering it from all its natural resources. This hidden dimension is nice as the objects have not been put randomly: eggs can be found in the forest or on cliffs, mushrooms are found near the woods. Everything makes sense. \n\nThe story has no interest at all. They could hardly have done a less interesting one. Too bad as it would have make the game better.\n\nFinally, the late game is tedious. You have to fish everything and hunt every animals, so you need energy and you spend most of your time sleeping. Repetitive fights (where a fight means gathering enough potions trhgouh trade and then automatically resolve it for a guaranteed win) are just utterly boring. Without the pleasure of discovering new areas as all the bad guys are found in already visited places, it looses all interest. \n\n\nConclusion: A good game to buy on sale and spent a relaxing and entertaining yet too short time.", "timestamp_created": 1462965915, "timestamp_updated": 1462965915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22903755": {"recommendationid": "22903755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067371748", "num_games_owned": 1547, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462912877}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished it in 5 hours, so for total game time, I'd say that's pretty much the time it takes to finish the game, and all the achievements. \n\nThat being said, shows a bit of replayability value. there isn't much to do once you're done. completely. Finish the last achievements, find some more mushrooms, sleep with meat a few more times, and trade until you have 5000 gold in total. \nBut, it's like finishing a pokemon game completely. Finding all the pokemon, and levelling them to the max. Restarting the game from scratch seems like a waste to the time it took, and the story/adventure won't change much.\n\nGraphic wise, it's quite good. Not too new of a graphics, but how all areas have small hidden things, like hidden pearls, and mushrooms in them (that you sometimes unlock by becoming a better herbalist) makes each area new, and abundant!\n\nThe story itself isn't too impressive. but it's fun, and not only can you quite often start doing side quests, and unlock special areas, you can also continue the story, and 2 screens further, another small bit of story is available, so almost all screens have a special story part. This means it's easily focussable on the next challenge, and you won't get lost in the quests and finding the solutions.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay in this game is what really drives the game itself forward. A lot of items that are clickable do not have an actually specific picture, like the trader, or a quest giver does. Sometimes, it's just a simple mushroom in the middle of a forest, that you can click. This means sometimes, boredly looking around actually rewards you. The actual movements aren't great, but it's kind of fun to see soldiers changing position, a few arrows all pointing towards a single enemy, and then moving on. Also, even though you're probably the same size as a normal npc in the game, the fact that you don't see yourself on screen kind of helps the immersion. YOU are the one that checks out the little clearing in the forest, to see if you can help save the lumberjack, and you are the one that decides to attack the boar. Strangely enough, if you would be a few pixels on the screen, you'd be too small to matter, but now, you really do.\n\nBasically, I recommend it. I think since it's not too high in replayability, it's probably better to wait for a sale, but there's no definitive need for it. It's just a fun little game, that you can enjoy, until you're completely done.", "timestamp_created": 1462924565, "timestamp_updated": 1462924565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

Problem is lack of replayabilitty, because you will exactly know what to do and replay could be som 2hour+.  And one more thing, from my opinion this is good game for kids - no blood, no \"bad language\", nearly no violence (you have to fight, but there is no \"show\" of fight etc..).

Bis auf den Endkampf hat mich das aber nicht gest\u00f6rt.

It's mostly a point & click adventure with some RPG-like quests and trading built in. I appreciated what depth it did have without having something convoluted or difficult built in just to try to extend the playtime. The story is not complex, and it's fairly typical of this type of game, but it provided enough to give a feel of progression. I completed the game in one sitting as I was completely immersed in it.\n\nI'm a big fan of this style of graphics. It has an older Ages of Empires or Stronghold feel to it. I enjoyed going between each area and completing quests just to see what all I'd see. The audio/music complemented the game well. It was just enough to make it enjoyable without being overbearing or out of place.\n\nThere is some backtracking to be done depending on what the quests require. Not everything is available the first time you visit a zone. The only annoying thing was the \"Gather XX of Something\" achievements. It just made it a grind and somewhat annoying, especially the eggs. It was like an Easter egg hunt without the color. Even so, I managed to complete the main quest and all of the other achievements within 7 hours.\n\nThe $5.99 price tag may be questionable for some. Casual is one of my primary game types, and for what this game has to offer, I could see paying it. However, I got this during one of the sales in 2014, and I don't regret buying it.

For a dollar value hour value, it lasted a little over seven hours which is right where I think a game should be priced. I don't play a lot of point and click games, so I took a chance on this one and was pleasantly surprised.\n\n     This is one of my favourite types of art-styles to look at, so I thought this game was absolutely beautiful the whole way through. The music was enjoyable to listen to all throughout. The gameplay was simple and crisp. You get energy by resting, then use that energy as a resource to complete other tasks.\n\n     One of my favourite parts of this game was as it introduced new things to you through tasks, you would be able to go back through previous areas and find things such as mushrooms or boxes hidden in the scenes. It was really quite fun to look through everything and complete the achievements, read the story, and play through this sweet little game.\n\n     To anybody who enjoys a nice casual game, or a rest from their competitive games for a while, I definitely recommend this game. As usual, if you can get this on sale, it's even more worth the price.\n\n     For me, this point and click game is a 10/10.\n\n~ Kyle", "timestamp_created": 1457352613, "timestamp_updated": 1463295097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21677054": {"recommendationid": "21677054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004598814", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457309045}, "language": "turkish", "review": "\u00e7ok zevkli bir oyun s\u0131rf ba\u015far\u0131mlar\u0131n hepsini a\u00e7mak i\u00e7in bile al\u0131p oynanabilir.", "timestamp_created": 1457310600, "timestamp_updated": 1457310600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21665395": {"recommendationid": "21665395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080612240", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457260636}, "language": "polish", "review": "Szkoda, \u017ce nie by\u0142a troch\u0119 d\u0142u\u017csza, bo jak do niej siad\u0142am i zacz\u0119\u0142am rozkminia\u0107 jak tu najmniejszym kosztem ogarn\u0105\u0107 zadania to naprawd\u0119 si\u0119 wci\u0105gn\u0119\u0142am :) Bardzo wci\u0105ga :)", "timestamp_created": 1457271884, "timestamp_updated": 1457271884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21645556": {"recommendationid": "21645556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149476294", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455995106}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u90e8\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6253\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\u3002\n3\u5c0f\u65f6\u5168\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u53ef\u60dc\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1457196649, "timestamp_updated": 1457196649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21644389": {"recommendationid": "21644389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009394366", "num_games_owned": 1709, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455489565}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Review in English/Spanish \nAn\u00e1lisis en Ingl\u00e9s y Espa\u00f1ol:[/h1]\n\n[h1] English: [/h1] \nAt its core Hero of a Kingdom is just a clicker game but unlike most is actually pretty darn fun, the story isn\u2019t anything to write home about but it\u2019s good enough to keep you interested.

It's something of an adventure game that gives you a birds-eye view of your surroundings and progresses through some simple mouse clicks. I have a hard time reviewing Hero of the Kingdom, because it's so forgetable. On the other hand, it is quite an enjoyable time-killer. \n\nLet me explain. Hero of the Kingdom is about a young man whose farm is burned to the ground--forcing him to journey out into the world to survive. From there the story becomes generic in almost every sense of the word. You'll fight skeletons, beasts and goblins before eventually taking on a dark wizard. While I can see that a lot of love went into this game, the writing could definitely be more original. \n\nThe gameplay involves a lot of trading. You'll essentially be roaming around the various areas searching for items to sell or animals to hunt so you can get gold with which you can purchase supplies you need to further the story. While I played quite a bit of the game several months ago (I don't remember how long I played, but I remember accidently leaving the game running for a while, so my time played is off) and I didn't manage to get myself to finish it until a couple days ago. For me, the concept of constantly trading like in Hero of the Kingdom becomes tedious. Especially when you unlock every area of the game and it gets tough remembering where certain merchants and points of interest are. \n\nI'm afraid I can't give any input on the sound. It wasn't long into the game until I just played my own music over it. Despite all of this, I'm still recommending it. This game is a great time sink. While it did repetitive after a while, the first hours were pretty entertaining. It was actually rather fulfilling to trade my way up to the items I needed. While it's just not a game for me, I can definitely see Hero of the Kingdom appealing to fans of the genre. It was certainly a good time sink for me if nothing else.", "timestamp_created": 1453772763, "timestamp_updated": 1453772763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Honestly though, for what I paid I feel as if I've ripped the developers off. It was a great game and worth every penny.

You move from one screen to another, interacting with characters, accomplishing quests and gathering various resources all over the map.\nStory is simple and naive, but there lies its charm. Young man, whose farm was burned by bandits, is trying to take revenge on this thugs and find missing father. This story offers no surprises, but develops logically and well designed.\n\nThere is open world, you can more or less freely move around the map. On the other hand, the world is very small and it is impossible to get lost here. Quests do not shine with diversity, they just fit into formula \"find something somewhere and bring it for someone\". There is no variations in dialogues and you can not choose answers of your character, events are completely linear. But, as i said, story is well designed, it is interesting enough to follow the storyline and completing the quests gives you a nice feeling of progress.\n\nThere is a lot of quests and sometimes i really missed something like journal where it would be possible to see the list of active quests and their description. On the other hand, as i said, the map is small and you can walk through locations in seconds so, if you forget what people asked you to bring, it is not difficult to find active characters again and re-check what you need to do.\n\nSometimes, game lacks logic. For example, to kill a boar you need a dagger. You do not have a dagger but have a sword and bow with arrows? Well, then you can not kill the boar, go and find yourself a dagger. Why i can not hunt this poor pig with arrows? Game offers no answer.\n\nEventually, your character will learn skills to collect pearls, hunt wild animals, gather algae and so on. There is plenty of hidden items that can be collected and sold to merchants - eggs, mushrooms, treasures, crawfish... all this objects are very small and usually are well hidden, so gathering turns into annoying and merciless pixel-hunting. This is bad for eyes for sure! Fortunately, if you do not want to complete all achievements then it is not necessary to seek for hidden objects.\n\nThere is no way to lose the game, i just can not invent a situation in which you can get stuck. Abundance of resources means that you will always find something that you can sell and earn some coins. Storyline can be completed in four or five hours but, of course, if you want to collect all the mushrooms, then pixel-hunting can detain you for long. After you had finished storyline, you can continue to play and solve incompleted quests and achievements. But there is no random events, enemies and resources do not respawn, so game offers no replayability.\n\nAnyway, game is very well designed and i can safely recommend it to anyone who seeks for relaxing and casual gameplay.

That's all the game is. Do story missions, run out of resources, do side activities for money and resources, rest to replenish HP, and repeat. To be very honest, this formula grows stale around the ending, even if it is a short game. \n\nSo is HoTK worth playing? Yes. There are no major points to review as pros or cons really and it is literally absent of bugs from what I experienced. If the features appeal to you then pick it up today. [b]The FINAL VERDICT[/b] will be based on its status as a GAME, not in comparison to Triple A titles that obviously out-do it. And for that verdict I'd give it an 7/10. It wasn't perfect, but it was fun. If it could have been a bit longer and had some extra gameplay mechanics it would have been better.

This feels like a point-and-click adventure, where the only thing you can click is progression (or a collectible). For me, at least, the point of point-and-click games is puzzling your way through it, rather than mindlessly clicking whatever bright gold sparkly icon shows up next on the screen. The little hidden object collectibles are interesting, and I think probably the thing that kept me playing the longest, since they respawn after enough time has passed.\nI would like to acknowledge that the music in this is actually pretty fantastic, though. There are definitely a few things about this game that are amazingly well implemented (fast travel through that map?

Davor wartete es bereits l\u00e4nger auf der Wunschliste, weil ich ein RPG f\u00fcr zwischendurch suchte. \nVor ein paar Stunden dann also endlich mal - Installation.\nStarten.\nDas Spielprinzip erscheint in den ersten Minuten offen gestanden ziemlich langweilig und eint\u00f6nig. (Prinzipiell ist es das auch. ;-) ) \nDennoch glaube ich, dass gerade in dieser Einfachheit eine gewisse St\u00e4rke dieses Titels liegt. \n\"Sammle hier und da dieses und jenes ein.\"\n\nHero of the Kingdom ist kein grafisches Wunderwerk, das sieht man an den Screenshots. Im Grunde genommen ist es eigentlich \"nur\" ein Wimmelbild/Point & Click-Adventure mit einem Hauch von RPG-Elementen. \nSo vage bzw. unsicher ich hier formuliere, so unsicher bin ich mir tats\u00e4chlich, warum der Titel definitiv seinen Reiz hat. Nach aktuell 3.8 Stunden ist das Spiel durchgespielt. Bis auf zwei der 28 Errungenschaften pl\u00e4tscherten alle anderen mehr oder weniger beil\u00e4ufig beim Spielen herein, ohne dass man sich gro\u00df h\u00e4tte anstrengen m\u00fcssen. \n\nIch denke, was das Spiel wirklich ausmacht, ist seine Story. Zugegeben, diese ist nun nicht wirklich innovativ oder mit vielen \"Aha\" oder \"H\u00f6rt, h\u00f6rt\" - Momenten gespickt, aber so wie sie pr\u00e4sentiert wird, ist sie glaubhaft (f\u00fcr RPG Verh\u00e4ltnisse) und der Erz\u00e4hlstil wird konsequent durchgezogen. Am\u00fcsant wie irritierend ist dabei die Art und Weise, wie die Story vermittelt wird. Ich war mir nicht sicher, ob ich gerade ein Spiel f\u00fcr Menschen von 6 - 10 Jahren spiele, oder ob sich die Erz\u00e4hlung selbst nicht so ganz ernst nimmt. \n\nSinngem\u00e4\u00dfe Aufgabenstellung eines Obst[u]h\u00e4ndlers[/u]:\n[i]\"Kannst Du bitte diese Lieferung Obst an den Besitzer des Gasthauses an der Kreuzung bringen? Ich traue mich nicht, weil ich es l\u00e4ngst liefern sollte. Ich habe Angst, dass er mich anschreit.\"[/i]\n\nSituationsbeschreibungen, Monologe oder Aufgabenstellungen wie diese lassen einen mehr als einmal schr\u00e4g schauen und mit gequ\u00e4ltem Grinsen das obligatorische WTF murmeln.\n\nDas sch\u00f6ne an der ganzen Kiste ist aber, dass dieser Stil derma\u00dfen konsequent und \u00fcberzeugt durchgezogen und durchgehalten wird, so dass ich das Spiel\n\na) f\u00fcr jeden RPG interessierten Nachwuchs zwischen 6 und 10 Jahren bedenkenlos empfehlen kann und\nb) als einhundert Prozent stimmig bewerte. \n\n\nWieder einmal sehe ich mich in meiner These best\u00e4tigt, dass es nicht die Grafik ist, die ein Spiel interessant macht, sondern die Spieltiefe. Wenn der Singleplayer-Modus eines Spiels in der Lage ist, mich zu fesseln, indem er mir eine stimmige Symbiose aus Story, logischem Spielablauf, Sound und Atmosph\u00e4re bietet - wer braucht da zwingend eine bombastische Grafik?\n\n\nLange Rede, kurzer Sinn: Wer was nettes f\u00fcr Zwischendurch sucht, dem kann ich Hero of the Kingdom auf jeden Fall empfehlen. \n\nLohnt sich der Kauf? Ich denke ja. Es gibt nicht zuletzt durch die erreichbaren ( noch ausstehenden) Errungenschaften einen gewissen Drang zum Wiederspielen... ;-)", "timestamp_created": 1445387159, "timestamp_updated": 1445387378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597970", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18591897": {"recommendationid": "18591897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152585930", "num_games_owned": 766, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447552446}, "language": "english", "review": "Real cool RPG/Hidden Object/Narrative game.

Part adventure game, part trading game, part hidden object game, it has a simplistic charm and a complete lack of urgency that makes it a joy to fool around with.\n\nYou play as some hapless farm kid whose father goes off to market. Bandits burn your farm down and kidnap Dad so its up to you to journey all the hell over the kingdom to save him. This involves a bit of fighting and a lot of trading goods, building things, and helping the mostly useless peasants out with their problems. The game plays out on static screens that look rendered right out of the Stronghold HD engine. New things to do appear as golden icons and can be anything from talking to people, hunting wildlife, gathering herbs, camping, scouting, battling, and so on. Every activity has a requirement in terms of energy (replenished by sleeping), gold (earned from jobs and such), and items found or bought. There are no time limits, no RNG, and every trade seems to at least break even for you, so there's no way to fail anything.\n\nThere's a huge amount of stuff to do as you progress, because you can earn yourself new skills that give you access to new activities. There's also a hint of hidden object game to it, because each screen has little collectibles like eggs and crates to click on for bonus resources. You can hunt for lots of \"secrets\" in the game that take the shape of items, quests, and even hidden parts of the map. It's not a terribly long game, maybe 3 hours or so to beat, but if you want to go completionist on its many achievements you'll get another few hours out of it. Hero of the Kingdom was a perfect way to wind down between more involved games and I'm definitely going to pick up the sequel sometime.\n\nOh, and there's a demo if you're still on the fence after reading this.

Lo siento. No, ese estudio del Instituto Nacional de Potatenburgo que confirma que \"los videojuegos aumentan el desarrollo del c\u00f3rtex prefrontal er\u00e9ctil\" no es m\u00e1s que un vano intento de camuflar la realidad: que la raza humana ser\u00eda colectivamente superior si a nadie se le hubiera ocurrido la idea de comercializar dos palitos jugando ping pong.\n\nLlegados a este punto s\u00f3lo tienes dos opciones: admitir que podr\u00edas mejorar como individuo y hacer de \u00e9ste un mundo mejor si dejases las maquinitas... o seguir revolc\u00e1ndote en tu propia autocomplacencia. Personalmente elegir\u00e9 la segunda.\n\nToda esta paja mental viene a colaci\u00f3n, porque Hero of the Kingdom es una p\u00e9rdida de tiempo. Pero una p\u00e9rdida de tiempo entretenida.

Digamos que mezcla los elementos m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicos de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas y los juegos de hidden objects, y a\u00f1ade un toque de estrategia con mucho trading.\n\nHotK cuenta la historia de un chaval que, aburrido de esperar a su padre en la granja, decide seguir un tutorial que termina con la granja en llamas por manos de unos bandidos. Ha llegado su turno de pasar a la acci\u00f3n, encontrar a su padre, salvar el mundo y hacer click miles y miles de veces.\n\nEl juego se divide en zonas, y en cada una de ellas habr\u00e1 una serie de elementos con los que interactuar: NPCs que te dar\u00e1n misiones y te vender\u00e1n/comprar\u00e1n objetos, plantas que podr\u00e1s recolectar, animales esperando ser cazados, y cientos de peque\u00f1\u00edsimas setas, huevos y cajas con los que tendr\u00e1s que ejercitar la vista como si estuvieras buscando a Wally.\n\nEl intercambio es la parte fundamental del juego. Casi toda acci\u00f3n en este juego te recompensar\u00e1 con objetos o progreso en la historia, pero siempre perder\u00e1s algo a cambio: Si quieres recolectar plantas necesitas gastar una cesta y algunos puntos de energ\u00eda, pero luego puedes usar dichas plantas para venderlas por m\u00e1s dinero del perdido inicialmente, o puedes usarlas para crear pociones espec\u00edficas, o para resolver misiones, etc. \n\nAntes de que te des cuenta, tu cerebro ya estar\u00e1 pensando en las maneras m\u00e1s eficientes de explotar el sistema, saltando entre vendedores mientras te frotas las manos con furia judaica. \n\nEs un juego carente de dificultad alguna y dura unas 3-5 horas dependiendo de si decides ir a por el 100%.

In fact I'd go so far as to say that it absolutely isn't an RPG as it doesn't have any hallmarks of the genre, yet, the Steam store tags it as one. Let's run down what it lacks:\n\nIt doesn't have a levelling system and at no point do you ever need to grind against monsters to level up, you don't customize your character in any meaningful way and you certainly don't make any worthwhile choices. The story - which is usually the saving grace of WRPGs with the most of mediocre of gameplay - is incredibly generic. It has your blank slate character on an adventure to save your kidnapped father. (With the sequel being about you rescuing your kidnapped sister. At least familial disappearances is a running theme in this series.)\n\nOh you want more? Well there isn't any. The game lacks any kind of lore and what little you can get come from side quests that don't exactly help fill out this generic fantasy world in your head. For being a farmer that lives out in the middle of nowhere, you for some reason live really close to a whole kingdom. \n\nEven at a base level of writing, this game sucks, with such quality lines as \"Now I know the weapon for the undead so I can kill them.\" or \"Be glorious our hero!\". With, ahem, *quality* like that and the main villain being known as the [i]Dark Lord[/i] of all things, this must have killer gameplay at least, right?\n\nWell... have you ever played I,Spy or any of those other hidden object games floating around on Steam? Then you'll be quite familiar with what you'll be doing. At the outset, you sort of feel like you are going on adventure - at first - but that feeling comes crashing down once you realise you're on quite the linear track with very little in the way of divergence as you try to find the little pixels on the map to click and then add to your unlimited inventory - you realise then you're playing Busywork: The Game, cause you get the run around from Point A to Point B, clicking the golden exclamation points to add another list of quests you have to do, collecting enough of Object 1 or 2, then either sell them to buy Object 3 or bring 20 of them to another quest giver with the biggest penalty you'll ever have is your stamina/hearts, which you lose everytime you do something strenuous and you gain back by resting - but not even resting works the right way, because as long as you have enough food items at the designated camps, you can regain as many hearts as you want, never truly having to rest again.\n\nWhile on this ever important quest to rescue your father, at certain points you're just fishing, collecting mushrooms and hunting animals just to make ends meet - but it never feels like you're actually accomplishing these tasks as everything feels predetermined - and that's because it is, as the only thing you have to do is bring the listed required items to wherever to progress further, and outside of selling items, you never feel like you're in control of your own destiny.\n\nI don't know what else to say - you click, read some banal writing, click again, then read more bad writing. That's it. It's not even a management game like you would hope despite playing a farmer - you never really farm or even try to fix your farm house to then farm some vegetables or something.

My mind went from thinking that everything was small scale and simple to, \"Oh my god this is going to take me forever to explore all of this.\"\n\nThere's quite a lot of easy achievements in the game if you're an achievement hunter. Overall this game is well worth the price. It doesn't really have any replay value, but it's worth the money especially if you get it in a bundle or when it's on sale. I'm very eager to play the 2nd as I enjoyed this one very much and will be looking for future work from this developer.\n\nThis game does a good job of giving you instant gratification and making you want to play from start to finish in one go. It might take some a bit longer, especially if they're trying to go for all of the achievements or if they're trying to reveal the story to all of the side quests instead of just trying to complete the main story. I wouldn't imagine it has any more than 10 hours of total solid gameplay though, but still well worth full price in my opinion. I have nothing negative to say about this game, it's just so well constructed in a very surprisingly simple weird way. I loved it.\n\nI highly recommend this game! I will be buying the sequal and will be looking for future games from this developer.\n\n- Crankage Games (Developer of Metal As P H U K)", "timestamp_created": 1438196647, "timestamp_updated": 1504791470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456296", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17285650": {"recommendationid": "17285650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143567302", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438193921}, "language": "german", "review": "sch\u00f6nes kleines Spiel !\nes hat mir Spa\u00df gemacht, wobei man ganz klar sagen muss\nwer Aktion sucht ist hier falsch, es ist eher ruhig\nman muss Gegenst\u00e4nde finden wie in Wimmelbildspielen\nansonsten wird man schon automatisch vom Spiel darauf hingewiesen was als n\u00e4chstes\nzu tun ist !\nAlso eher etwas um bischen zu entspannen und so vor sich hin \" daddeln \"\n\nIch habe es mir dazu noch im Angebot f\u00fcr kleines Geld gekauft, \nund kann es nur empfehlen !\n", "timestamp_created": 1438194509, "timestamp_updated": 1438194509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17285065": {"recommendationid": "17285065", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960303050", "num_games_owned": 868, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438191997}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, so as more of a hardcore gamer, I accidentally played this after getting it in a bundle (actually just left it open to earn the steam trading cards) and... well... played it to 100% completion in one session.

First of all, it can save you hundreds of dollars spent on a psychologist. Really, this game it's so simple and makes you so chilled that you forget about everything while playing it. [b]However, I wouldn't recommend it for everyone.[/b] Let's see it in more detail:\n\n[h1] This is a game unlike others [/h1]\nThis is the kind of game that you think about playing for a couple of minutes to give it a chance and before you know it, you have been 4 hours in front of the screen. Also, [b]the soundtrack is pretty awesome too.[/b] I don't know why people haven't commented on it, but I liked it a lot since it goes really well with the game. Basically, [b]the game is a point&click[/b] where you must help your father that has been captured by a bunch of thiefs and save the kingdom in the process. [b]It's simple, it's linear, it's athmosperic and it's awesome.[/b]\n\n[h1] It's not for everyone, though [/h1]\nThe problem with this game is that it may be too simple for some people. There's no much variety on it, [b]you can't die[/b] and there's nothing particularly astounding on the dialogue. [b]It's a simple game[/b]. You need to know it, because if you expect an awesome RPG full with dialogues and choices you will get disappointed, but if you don't hype it and play it for what it is, you will end up liking it. You should also know that [b]this is a short game[/b], I'm sure you can complete the whole story in about 4 hours and I personally collected all the achievements in about 9. And trust me, after you played it and collected all the achievements, you dont't want to play it again. It's basically the same thing over again, [b]so the replay value on this one is about zero.[/b]\n\n[h1]So, should I buy Hero of the Kingdom?[/h1]\n[b]Only if you are not looking for a challenge.[/b] This game offers just a nice, calmed, short story that can be awesome in it's own way.

I would characterize Hero of the Kingdom as a casual adventure game with some trading elements. There are no reflexes required, you simply need to click around the different maps to collect various items and turn them in to complete tasks. When you complete most tasks you beat the game. Overall you shouldn't expect to play this for more than a couple hours but it is a good use of time where you don't need to stress out. I found the story to be serviceable given the scale of the game.\n\nAll actions in the game are ultimately governed by its currency, which is gold. So if you want to do lots of things, such as stock up on supplies, get more hit points or hire more helpers, you need gold. This is where the trading part of the game comes in. There is only a finite number of resources you can gather before you run out, but you can manufacture more money by astutely trading the resources between various NPCs. I found this to be kind of interesting, but ultimately maybe not that constructive as the game actually gives you a good amount of money. I blame it on my RPG hoarding tendencies, but if you sell everything you gather (and you should! there are no missables!) you should only have to do a minimum of trade farming.\n\nLastly, many people play this game because it is easy to get 100% achievements.

However it removes all the stress and uncertainty associated with in-app purchases, as there aren't any! The story and graphics follow like an Age of Empires 2 spin-off, and that's no bad thing. There are also elements of 'Where's Wally' where you try and find things amongst the beautifully rendered landscape, and the game never tries to trip you up or be unfair. The constant rewards give you a real sense of accomplishment as you play.

This requires a careful management of gold (for tools to gather the resources with) and strength (which serves the role of time units). There is no combat or levelling: if you have the resources to pass an obstacle, you automatically do so.\nThe mechanics are decent, but not perfect: there are exploits to get infinite gold and strength (although slowly), and it is easy to get confused by the variety of required resources by the end.\n\nThe story is fairly basic: find abducted relative, find bad sorcerer, kill bad sorcerer. This simplicity works to its advantage though as it lets the game put more focus on the dozens of side quests, giving it a classic RPG feel. Still, most players will likely reach 100% completion status within 4-5 hours, making Hero of the Kingdom a short, but fun game.", "timestamp_created": 1430136940, "timestamp_updated": 1430136940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15558751": {"recommendationid": "15558751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062915224", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431709231}, "language": "english", "review": "I ussualy dont play such kind of games, clicking and searching.

There are very few faults i can pick and overall i really enjoyed it and i cannot wait for the next one to go on sale so i can buy it. (As i am way to tight to buy anything full price.) Though the sequel is so tempting to buy immediately.\n\nIt's actually a rather pretty game, at least to me it is. Yeah sure, it's not amazing or anything, but it does the job and gives you nice stuff to look at while you play. I find the point and click controls excellent, but then i am a huge fan of point and click games, but if you are not, don't buy this.The storyline is good, but it's actually a pretty generic storyline really, though that's not necessarily a bad thing. It can be a tad frustrating, especially trying to get all the achievements, but it's mostly fun and casual and the achievements aren't actually all that hard to get. I got half of them while doing the main storyline and then went back a while later and got the rest of them in a couple of hours.\n\nHowever once you have played it and got all the achievements i am not sure how much (if any) replay value there is, as i have only just got to this stage.

After your farm got burned down by bandits, you set out to find your father, helping people across the kingdom and becoming the adventurer you always dreamed of being.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]: This game is a light straightforward adventure. Each quest or encounter requires you to assemble a certain amount of money or equipment to accomplish. As you successfully accomplish goals, additional parts of the maps are revealed, allowing you to go to new location and get additional quests. You also advanced through three level of hunting, fishing and gathering skills, each stage revealing new quests or resources on the map, giving you a reason to go back to locations you didn't need to access anymore.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]: The entire game is a linear adventure, save side quests. If you have the required quantity if weapons, items or troops for a combat, you will win that combat, no action or strategy involved. The game is void of randomization: people are there where they're supposed to be, resources can be gathered once or twice and do not regenerate, enemies or hunting game don't respawn. There is no replay value to this game.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 - It's up to you\n\n[i]Hero of the Kingdom[/i] is simple, straightforward, and short.

The gameplay can be broken down to \"use thing A to complete task B\", plus a bit of hidden object finding.

Although it wasn't mentioned in the tags it kinda fits that genre very well. So if you don't like clicking don't get the game and save yourself from posting a rant.\n\nThe story starts with the life of a boy living a peaceful life in their farm. But, things starts to get chaotic when your father went missing and your house being burned down to nothing leaving you homeless. Now the boy must embark on a journey to find his missing father and find out the cause of the attack. You will be meeting different people from small villages along the way and experience the life of a traveler as you earn fame and make a name for yourself.\n\n[h1]My thoughts[/h1]\nThe game is overall fun. It is mainly about resources management and will make yourself analyzing and thinking but not to the point of frustration. There will be plenty of items in-game:this includes item such as food, weapons, crafting materials, and more. Acquiring items are earned by either completing tasks given by the NPCs or bartering with merchants. This works by giving a certain item from your inventory in-exchange of another of the same value. Ofcourse, the game also has a currency which will be a necessity later on. \n\nThere's nothing much to say about the game except for the fact that if you're not into too much action and just want to sit down and play relaxing game yet entertaining then, you should give this a try. \n\n--- [b]This paragraph[/b] might contains [b]minor[/b] spoilers. But, I'll put it here anyway for people who wants to know [b]what to expect from the game[/b]. ---\nThe game starts with a realistic story of a young boy as stated above. But, things get weird when you suddenly need help of mages from the guild who *obviously* can use magic. You'll start getting items that is related to alchemy too and you will have to fight fantasy-ish creature not much like at the beginning where you only fend off wolves.\n\nNow this may come a surprise to some people but it can be either looked at as positive and negative. I was expecting the game to be realistic until the end when the boy matures enough. Instead, it turned out that the entire plot of the story revolves around a certain wizard and it gets cliche from then on.\n--- [b]End of potential spoiler paragraph[/b] ---\n\n[h1]Rating[/h1]\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n[b]Graphics:[/b] \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n[b]Story:[/b] \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n[b]Sounds:[/b] \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n[b][i]Average:[/i][/b] \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606", "timestamp_created": 1427799129, "timestamp_updated": 1427799215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15137741": {"recommendationid": "15137741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047032125", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508706548}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly engaging", "timestamp_created": 1427793713, "timestamp_updated": 1427793713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15133382": {"recommendationid": "15133382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030769466", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427762641}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic little resource management game.

It is most certainly one of the top 3 which I eagerly gave myself an auspicious pat on the back for buying. At $1.49 (75% off) it is money well spent. Completion only took me two days totalling 8 hours or so (didn't bother to quit game when taking dog for a walk). The game play is therapeutic and healing as even with a generic storyline, the long but seldom arduous line of quests are gratifyingly addictive. [b]If you enjoy RPGs as I do and rarely skip side quests as it is half the fun[/b], then I highly recommend this title. \n\nThe controls are as easy as can be and I can't honestly admit this is a strategy game as it does not give the player a chance at failure as you will see if you play it. It isn't a game to test your gaming skills but a chance to relax from more demanding games. Out of games you can use to relax and enjoy like you used to enjoy games as a child, it never feels like a waste of time or is uncomfortable to play in terms of time or effort of lack thereof.  \n\n[h1]Hero of the Kingdom is my idea of a perfect holiday.[/h1]\nWhen I first booted this game (being my silly little self) I truly believed, despite the title being \"Hero of the Kingdom\", that I would be taking care of Father's farm for the duration of the game play as the atmosphere was immediately soothing. Luckily, this tranquillity is carried onwards as there is no concept of time and you can go as expeditiously or leisurely as you fancy. \n\n[h1]ACHIEVEMENTS, GUIDES & TIPS[/h1]\nDespised styles of achievements that I have become quite feverish about are those consisting of sending a player on wild goose chases where the goals lack relation to, or impact on the story. Luckily, this game is short, straight forward and sweet with every single achievement. You don't feel like you've wasted time [b]getting achievements for the sake of achievements[/b] as it tend to be with some games which take away from the enjoyment. You will have to finish close to all of the activities provided in-game to finish all the achievements. I dislike looking at guides so am usually much slower than other players at finishing any set of tasks in-game but this game didn't need any guides at all. There are easier methods of finishing the game which you will eventually find out on your own but every feature and quest is well thought out by developers that you will not have to look at any playthrough or spend an exceedingly long time pondering variations of. \n\nSpoiler Hints (It\u2019s likely you\u2019ll realise on your own like I did so won\u2019t need the info, hence the  format): [spoiler]You can buy grain, convert grain to flour, get bread from flour and sell that bread to a farmer's wife for minimum profit which will accumulate. Check this well written [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=310152016]guide by The Fox[/url] in the community hub if you\u2019d like to know more. When you progress farther and get to town you'll find a smuggler (in town to the right of screen with no indicating icon) which you can click on to buy poison from them, afterwards selling said poison to a master hunter in the woods also reachable at a later stage. This is a faster way of earning a profit through the market. The prices of items vary depending on who you're buying from/selling to, so keeping note of price ranges will add to the fun. When you start finding more treasure and jewellery which you can end up selling to one of the shops in town, you will no longer need to trade as much. Once you get to the \"let's hoard money\" part of the game which urges you to trade, it will ultimately feel less fun for obvious reasons (repetitive trading to add gold) so don't use it too much until you absolutely feel you need to.[/spoiler]\n\nYou will need to find a very small number of hidden characters that are in plain view, just without icons near them which you will have to manually activate (click on people and sometimes they'll talk back with no warning ;D ). There will be new items available to find across the map in the form of \"hidden objects\" so if you enjoy hidden object games, this will be a blast and quite easy. I have enjoyed my fair share of hidden object puzzles so it was extremely easy to keep an eye out for various types of items that I needed to find to finish achievements. It's different for each player but you may end up lacking 1 or 2 items of a kind etc and spend some time looking for them. This is only natural as it is with all hidden object games. The last or last couple you're looking for are hardest for you to spot which is why they'll end up the last ones. Don't fret and go through the map slowly a few times. Click on various areas that you'll become accustomed to as \"loot points\" on the map such as forests, cliff sides and lakes away from camps and village areas where people are stationed or reside in. It is definitely a game where you'd want to finish the achievements for the added content at least as the game itself is short. The challenges are not always a walk in the park especially if you do not use [spoiler]the easier trading methods for extra gold[/spoiler] but you will undoubtedly complete them like the way a fantastic game like this should be played. Btw, the blacked out parts are spoilers, not cheats as they do not exist and are thankfully unnecessary in this game (not that any should ever be used for any game). I do not finish any of my games quickly so the fact I finished it in two days adds to the realisation now that it was neither tirelessly demanding nor boring enough to put aside for a while like the majority of my library. It was such a simple yet entertaining 8 hours that I started writing this review after I finished it which also says a lot about how much I enjoyed the title considering my crowded backlog of games awaiting review (the majority of which I evidently did have fun playing). [b]When the words \"The End\" reached my screen, it crossed my mind that this game felt like a demo for it's sequel, [i]Hero of the Kingdom II[/i].

So if you have the resources you can fight (and win) and if you haven't got the resources you can't attack until you've got them. It's pretty simple and that's actually some of the appeal of this game.\n\nI'm not a power player but I like to hunt for achievements.\nIt took me 3,5 hours to complete the game with all the achievements.

It's a simple, short but quite well done little time-killer that might appeal when you are in the mood for something slower.\n\nYou progress through a series of reasonably pretty full-screen maps. Each one you visit might hold a handfull of missions plus perhaps a merchant, tradesman, somewhere to rest, etc and will definately hide a number of hidden objects to find. Once you unlocked each screen you can return at any time to use the merchants, finish side quests or pick up any hidden objects you missed.\n\nThe story is standard fantasy fare but is fine. The graphics are ok for a game so much about staring at the screen and set the mood well. The game play is good initially though starts to grate and grind a bit in the later stages even in a comparatively short game.

Otherwise there is no tension, you will go into the final battle knowing you will win.\n-Randomly clicking all over the screen is a legitimate strategy. \n-The story is absolutely forgettable and generic fantasy,  House burns down, chase after bandits, help villagers, rescue family, defeat big evil.   \n-Graphics are ok for a cow clicker, but there is no way you are going to be engrossed in the \"battles\"\n-It is very short.\n\nBeat it in one sitting.  Did I hate it? No.  Will I ever play it again? No.  I get the feeling this game is supposed to be padded out with \"freemium\" pay to play mechanics. \nThere simply isn't a lot of game here, and I can't reccomend it outside of it being heavily discounted. \n", "timestamp_created": 1426984729, "timestamp_updated": 1426984729, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14996221": {"recommendationid": "14996221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135516523", "num_games_owned": 1025, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426978511}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a fun to play point and click game, but you're done real quickly. I've played for 3 hours and then reached the end, but I decided to go for all achievements, so I got some more time in it. You can have more time in it than I had, because I skipped all dialogues and other text things. I think it's a game you play when you're either real bored, or you don't have a proper internet connection.\n\nIn the beginning they point out what you've got to do just to help you get on your main quest, later on you've got to decide what to do and where to go. Because of that, I got in like 10 different \"sidequests\" by just randomly clicking stuff. I lost track of all the quests and began to furiously click everyone with a green checkmark (fishes included).\n\nActually, the whole game you're just randomly clicking stuff, killing animals and collecting all the stuff you need and level up all your skills, then it ends in defeating some sort of dark wizard. After that, some people celebrate that you defeated that wizard and you can play the \"quests\" you haven't finished during the main quest.

Each task is simply given a set of resources necessary to complete it, and if you have those resources, you can clear the task. After all, of course the hero of the story makes it through, why pretend otherwise? The hidden objects on each map can usually be converted directly into money, or used to clear various unlock tasks, which are used to gain access to various resources you need.\n\nYou do end up feeling less than of a hero, and more of a military quartermaster, sourcing local materials and labor to win the campaign against the Dark Lord. But this is what makes the game so relaxing. No timing, no complicated clicking, just knowing where to get the parts you need to assemble your victory. It rewards remembering who sells what, and being able to find eggs in a forest map, rather than actions per second. Even the achievements are hardly difficult (though I really had to search for that last bird's nest).\n\nEverything about the game is very polished, as well. The soundtrack fits, the maps progress cleanly from one to the other, and you can always get the resources you need if you're willing to go kill and skin a few wild animals. Even if you sell something you need later in the game to get the money for an immediate goal, there's always someone who will sell it right back to you, usually for the same price you got in the first place.\n\nThis is a good game to spend a few hours relaxing with.", "timestamp_created": 1426867839, "timestamp_updated": 1426867839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14969410": {"recommendationid": "14969410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025543430", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509565538}, "language": "czech", "review": "Ve\u013emi dobr\u00e1 hra bez boja. \nZo za\u010diatku \u010dlovek trocha t\u00e1pe a m\u00e1 probl\u00e9my zohna\u0165 goldy.

The first way is to find quite well hidden objects on the screen. The second option is to trade with NPCs, there are many profitable transaction loops from NPC that can be used to earn money and buy the necessary items of the magazine. And here the game begins to draw a little from the economic strategy.\n\nThe narrative is extremely light and affordable, however, we will not find here abundant content like the games from the series The Elder Scrolls or The Witcher, where we can learn the history of the world and creatures that inhabit it. Unfortunately, although the narrative is not bad, it's easy to forget it\nGameplay is very well balanced, evokes a sense of continuous progress, when we perform tasks or move to the next zone, we do not fall into any monotony.\n\nThe game also offers some interesting achievements, which sometimes require us to notice a lot of perceptiveness.\n\nFor those who are looking for more intense game experiences, this game can be a bit boring.

The main change is that unlike Cookie Clicker or Candy Box, Hero of the Kingdom doesn\u2019t run by itself and has a (mostly) definitive end, tapped together with what could almost be considered a story and some minor exploration.\n\nBeginning on a secluded farm, you take up the mantle of the world\u2019s premier errand boy, poking your nose into everybody\u2019s business in the hopes they\u2019ll set you off on another menial task they couldn\u2019t be bothered to do themselves.Hero of the Kingdom, in everything it does, is a personification of every tedious fetch quest you\u2019ve ever done in an RPG, stripped of everything but finding and delivering the item and then being patted on the head and told you\u2019ve done a great service to the kingdom.\n\nI don\u2019t think developer Lonely Troops had any doubts about what they were making though, and have deviously engineered the perfect loop of turning mundane tasks into accomplishments. Thanks are given for every small deed you perform, unimportant numbers are always going up, and the achievements pour out like candy letting you know no matter how simple the job, you did a damn fine job clicking your way through it!\n\nAnd then before you know you\u2019ve constructed a profitable trading cycle, picked the country clean of mushrooms, and risen up in the ranks to where no one would dare refuse your prying questions. Hero of the Kingdom would almost feel nefarious if it didn\u2019t have a clear ending, so adept is it at roping you in and making it feel as if the entire game isn\u2019t just cleverly disguised busywork requiring no skill and barely any effort.\n\nBut for something that is fine letting you go after a few hours, I was fine indulging Hero of the Kingdom and its exploitation of a basic human need for self gratification. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good game, but it\u2019s an easy way to waste some time that won\u2019t hold you hostage past the point of some mindless fun (for lack of a better word).\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2015/03/18/hero-of-the-kingdom-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1426639672, "timestamp_updated": 1426639672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759740", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14928784": {"recommendationid": "14928784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075937391", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426332634}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Otimo jogo, tenho os 02 e posso dize com certeza que ambos vale a pena, divertido faz vc relaxar, recomendo otimo", "timestamp_created": 1426562878, "timestamp_updated": 1426562878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14917307": {"recommendationid": "14917307", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987270895", "num_games_owned": 818, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426502252}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one serious time-sink in veins of every Facebook game ever.

New abilities will allow you to find new items in your environment, so you'll want to revisit scenes often, and be sure to click on anything that looks unusual!\n\nWe lose energy (health) when we do tasks, and this energy can be restored by staying at one of the available camps.  At each camp you'll eat a different type of food before you go to sleep, and this means a varying amount of health restored.  At one point I had over 30 health, so I don't there's a cap on how much health you can have.\n\nDon't be thrown off by how easy everything is early on.  The game is pretty isometric when it first begins, but once you've explored a few screens, you start to have some freedom to choose your own tasks. Will you just chase the main storyline, or will you explore every nook and cranny and do all of the side-quests?  Will you try to get all 38 achievements, or only do what's necessary?

From the outlook, you may think it's like an old-school RTS, like I did. Reminds me of Stronghold.\nOnce you go into it, you'll realize that it's nothing of the sort.\n\nBasically, you travel around the land, buying, gathering and selling supplies, so that you can progress, by doing quests. It's... surprisingly compelling. On paper, I'd say this game wouldn't work! After trying it, though, it managed to keep me playing to completion. \n\nThere's an overarching story, but it's very clich\u00e9. It did nothing whatsoever to invest me, as there weren't any great characters or situations. It was [i]just[/i] there.\n\n[b][u]Presentation[/u][/b]\nAs I said, it looks a bit old. However, I really like this graphic style. I love the way the how old RTS games looked, and this is basically an higher resolution version of that. The [b]iconography[/b] in the game felt a bit out of place, at times, but it identifies everything well enough, so I won't complain.\nOther than that, the interface has a medieval feeling (especially the frames and the map) that fits the feeling of the game.\n\nThe [b]sound-effects[/b] were a bit too sparkly for me. They didn't fit the rest of the game, being more suited for a children's game, with a cartoony look. Regardless, they're otherwise functional.\nThe [b]music[/b] is open, I believe, but it was well chosen. There isn't much to say about it. It's pretty simple, fantasy-like background music, but it did its job of getting you into the game's atmosphere.\n\n\nThere were a few [b]interface[/b] issues I've had, but I've later found out that most of them could have been avoided, with a bit more explanation. Basically, everything requires 2 clicks -- [b]always[/b]. First, you click the objective or object you want to collect, and then there's some feedback, and a box appears with a \"V\" for you to click, to continue. This last step, in my opinion, was completely unnecessary. Also, the box appears in the object's place, so you'll often have to \"backtrack\" with the mouse, if you were ready to leave the screen, or something. \nThis is avoided by pressing SpaceBar when the box appears. That way, you can just press it and the box will go away, so it partially solves the problem -- this, however, was [i]never hinted at[/i], in the game.\n\nOverall, there are just lots of unnecessary clicks, in a game that's all about clicking. I believe that the visual and audio feedback was sufficient, but I may be wrong.\n\n[b][u]Story and Writing[/u][/b]\nAs I've mentioned, the story is completely clich\u00e9. Your farm burns, and you go on a quest to save your father and be an hero. Then, you find that there's a bigger evil on the world, and you want to eliminate it. That's about it. \nThere's isn't any real idea to be trasmitted by it, no interesting characters, nothing whatsoever. Bottom-line: [i]don't play it for a story[/i].\n\nThe [b]writing[/b] also felt very amateur, in general. The game just feels like it could be written by a middle-schooler. It's not awful, but there's nothing, at any point, that will surprise you or even amuse you. The phrasing is very simple, with not character having any personality... Meh. You can easily skip it and you won't miss anything.\n\n[b][u]Structure & Mechanics[/u][/b]\nIt's hard to separate this from the mechanics. This game is a [b]glorified spreadsheet[/b], and it's almost all structure, and no mechanics.\n\nBasically, you have a character whose main attribute is stamina. You lose stamina with every meaningful action, and you'll have to sleep on a camp to recover it. There are many camps spread around the map, requiring different resources for you to use them. Some are town inns, which require money, others will simply require different types of food.\n\nThen, you'll also visit several towns that specialize in different things. There's alchemy, fishing, hunting, etc. Each requires different tools, which the townsfolk sell you. In those towns, there are also side-quests, that give you money, honor, and resources.\nHonor is basically used for you to unlock certain quests, that require you to be more trust-worthy.\n\nDespite the existence of several different occupations, they're all the same. Once you have a tool and skill (that you get from a quest), the maps will now have a new icon over the resource that you can gather. Then, you click it and there you go. \nThere's no crafting per se. There are some vendors that give you a potions for herbs though, for example.\n\nEach action will require tools/resources, and stamina. Some of them also require Hunters, Repair-men, Soldiers, etc. You can buy these (as if mercenary) to help you. \n\nAs you can tell, the [b]whole game[/b] is about getting resource X and either selling or trading it for resource Y, so that you can do the next quest.\n\n[i]Hidden-objects Component[/i]\nIn every map, there are items spread around, but that are very small and often blend with the background. These are mostly optional, but they can also be useful. These include Mushrooms, Eggs, Lost Crates, etc. These won't be unlocked from the start, you'll unlock them progressively, when following the main quest.\n\n[b][i]Map[/i][/b] \nThe maps tells you nothing useful, but let's you fast travel to every location. So, instead of having to waste 2 minutes and 15 clicks, you'll waste 10 seconds and 2 clicks.\nThis is fine, and I think it helps the game substancially. However, it could have been much better. Has different areas have different vendors and quests, it would have been useful to have those marked on the map. Perhaps a little quest description and the person who gave it to you, the main vendors, etc. You can very easily get lost, since you take to memorize everything. \n\n\n[b][i]Cumbersome systems[/i][/b]\nEverytime you gather a resource, hunt, etc. you'll lose stamina, and also have a chance to break your tools. If that happens, you'll have to go buy another. Eventually, I just bought every tool twice to avoid backtracking. However, it's very cumbersome, in general. Especially with the later tasks, everything may cost up to half of your stamina. So, you'll travel, do 2 minor things, and have to go back and get more stamina. \nI think it's mostly unnecessary, how you constantly have to go back and forward... \n\n[b][i]It never lets go of your hand -- Too Linear[/i][/b]\nThe tutorial is very typical of mobile games. You have to click this very specific icon, or else you can't advance. This goes on for a while. While the game opens up [b]a bit[/b], it's also holding you hand. \nIf I had focused only on the story line, it would have bored me to death, probably. It's like the game tells you its story through instructions. \"Do this. Now, do that. Good, now get that to achieve this! No, no that-- this! Here! This shiny button!\" ... It's very, very restrictive. The sidequests help a bit.\nRegardless, it's never an adventure of your own.\n\n[b][i]Progress and Achievements[/i][/b]\nThis is the trick about this game. There's an achievement for every meaningless task. It's annoying and patronizing. However, it's one of those psychological tricks that keeps you invested. Everything feels like progress. Also, every field will disappear after being gathered \"x\" times, so there will come a point when you've literally completed the game. And I think that's the strangely compelling thing about this game!\nIt keeps you going for far longer than I'd have guessed. The game has nothing interesting about it, but it still grabs your attention, for those 3 hours!\n\nI would [b]not[/b] recommend this game, in most circumstances. It's very bland, and has nothing interesting about it. However, it's still compelling. Besides, it provides a good formula. If you can integrate a [b]good[/b] story, and some mechanics into it, perhaps a great game can be made!\n\n[b]Please, be very aware of what you're getting into[/b].

Ebenso der Sound der lediglich zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig ist. Er passt zur entsprechenden Situation bzw. zum entsprechenden Gebiet ist aber sehr simpel gehalten. Die Grafik ist auch sehr schlicht, fand ich aber vollkommen ausreichend, da es meiner Meinung nach eben in erster Linie ein Wimmelbild-Spiel ist.

Sometimes you have to kill stuff (animals, villians), find things hidden-object-style (eggs, mushrooms, sheep) or collect (and/or buy) the right resources to build buildings or equip an army. There are even some [b]professions[/b] to master (fishing, herbalism).\n\nStill these things are so simple, that [b]literally anyone could succeed to finish the game[/b] in a reasonable time. Optionally you can also try to collect all 38 achievements, which include finding a big portion of all hidden-object items.\n\nUnfortunately, even if you try to 100% the game, it [b]only takes about 3-4 hours[/b] to do so. But that might even be a good thing, because otherwise the simple gameplay could get boring and repetetive after some time.\nAlso [b]you have to know, what you\u2019re getting with this game[/b]. If you\u2019re expecting a much deeper, complex game, the game will most likely disappoint you. But fortunately [b]there is a demo available[/b] to test the game and see if it is for you.\n\n[b]Overall, I think, this is an awesome game, that can be fun for ANYONE: Casual players as well as actual \u2018gamers\u2019, who don\u2019t mind simple gameplay and a shallow story, can enjoy an addicting medieval adventure with a decent atmosphere. Granted: The game might be short, but the price isn\u2019t to high (6$), especially on sale.

Sometimes it's nice to play something simple and pleasant. \n\nAlso, the main character solving a lot of problems by being a pretty decent carpenter was oddly refreshing.

The fetch quests, and other various side quests are pretty much what you would expect from an RPG game. \n\nThere are a couple annoying features such as not being able to buy/sell items in bulk, and running out of strength after a couple battles, but this doesn't deter you from enjoying the game. The one feature I would like to see in the sequel is for the collectible hidden object side of the game, they need to add a completion meter for each map so the player is not having to use a magnifying glass to find the last couple of missing items. \n\nThe game is short and can be completed in about 5 hours if you are trying to 100% the achievements.

This is a very casual and relaxing game, albeit a repetitive one.  I got it for less than two dollars on sale, and to be honest, I wouldn't pay more than that.  There are a couple mechanics the game never properly explains to you, such as finding eggs, mushrooms, crates, and the like.  (You have to click on the tiny little pictures you see on the map; they don't have icons like almost everything else.)  On top of that, a game this simple could have benefited from a marginally more unique story.  I'm not saying you have to construct an epic tale, or anything, but man, you could have attempted SOME sort of a unique plot twist.  I mean, I guess there was one, kind of, but it was the sort of thing you've probably seen a million times before.\n\nOne of my biggest problems in this game was how hard it is to make money.  One of the hints I was given at some point consisted of doing tasks for people, which would have been all well and good, if it weren't for the fact that pretty much every single task required some sort of payment up front.  Occasionally, you'll get a somewhat sizable-seeming sum, but since everything is so expensive, it'll probably be gone very quickly.  Eventually, I ended up trying to gather and sell all the herbs and fish I could, but none of that stuff ever respawns, as it turns out; once you gather all the herbs and fish at all the fishing spots, it's gone forever.  So if you need that stuff later, as I did, you'll be buying them from the store.\n\nWhen I say I recommend this game, bear in mind that I only recommend it if you can get it for two bucks or less.

The player begins as a farmboy and goes on an adventure by essentially completing errands by interacting with various hotspots on a beautifully drawn map.  More screens are unlocked as one progresses through the story.  In addition to the main story, there are various hidden objects such as mushrooms or lost crates scattered throughout the game world.  These objects blend in well enough that they are not all immediately spotted, but if you should choose to find them all, it's by no means a pixel hunt.\n\nSomeone looking for an extremely non-challenging and casual gaming experience may enjoy this title.  In fact, I somewhat enjoyed it as something to do while watching television.\n\nHowever, I am unable to recommend this game because of its incredibly short length.  I was able to 100% the game in about four hours. Most of those four hours were spent backtracking.  For instance, while fishing, you may run out of energy.  You must then backtrack to the inn to rest.  You then return to the lake to continue fishing, and you run out of bait.  You must then backtrack to purchase more bait.  And then your rod breaks.  You get the idea.\n\nIn short, Hero of the Kingdom is not all bad by any means.  It's a decent little game that looks and sounds good, even if it is simplistic.  However, the writing is not so hot.

To do so would be a disservice to the gamer and to Hero of the Kingdom, as there is a lot more under the surface than what first appears, and through the course of a short story, you will become, the Hero of the Kingdom.\n\nIf you enjoy your gaming more casual, and less intense, Hero of the Kingdom definitely has a lot to offer. The game interface is simple and intuitive, and yet it is also never obtrusive. All gameplay is directed by mouse clicks. The action takes place on simple overhead maps, and your mouse clicks naturally will flow as the story and the gameplay layers on.\n\nThe complexity of Hero of the Kingdom comes in its economy and the use of selling items of value or to trade for items of usefullness. Should your character require to pass a bridge that is broken, they may need to sell unrequired items to obtain the help, rope and other necessities to move further on. You will gain skills such as fishing and hunting, with simple mouse clicks taking all guess work out of the equation. You either have the equipment to do the task, or you don't. There really is no challenge here.\n\nThis laid back notion is continued with the minimal music and sound effects. Both are equally pleasing, but ultimately forgettable. There is nothing about the game, from the gameplay, to the audio, that really stands out. It is all as inoffensive and flavorless as can be possible.\n\nIn many ways, Hero of the Kingdom feels like a slightly improved Facebook game, without the social interaction. Certainly the gameplay harkens back to that mindset, and without any kind of graphical flourish, could easily be mistaken as one. Where it succeeds is that it layers on additional systems through hunting, fishing and flower collecting, while telling a simple story about a long forgotten evil that is uniting various minion cliches in order to hunt down the good people of the kingdom.\n\nHero of the Kingdom is a fun diversion that requires so little of your attention and so little of the gamer that one could forget that they were actually playing a game here and not an interactive click-a-thon. There is enough gameplay here to recommend to the casual gamer but only to this subset of gamer might there be some enjoyment found. \n\nHero of the Kingdom is by no means a bad game, in fact, I rather enjoyed my short four hour journey. But there are a great many alternatives for your gaming dollar that demand more from the gamer, and the gamer should demand more from the creator. Hero of the Kingdom wouldn't be out of place being hosted for free on some website, perhaps with a banner ad - there just isn't enough gameplay to fully justify a purchase.\n\n5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1417271662, "timestamp_updated": 1417271662, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700313", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13139874": {"recommendationid": "13139874", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988966423", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417095629}, "language": "german", "review": "Cooles Spiel, zwar schnell durch macht aber Spa\u00df.", "timestamp_created": 1417262340, "timestamp_updated": 1417262340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13132747": {"recommendationid": "13132747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001462963", "num_games_owned": 586, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457398021}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game if you need a break from challenging FPS or grueling strategy.

If you do this for a while you'll be able to afford tools, food and other various items you need in the upcoming areas. One reviewer said that he barely had enough money to get to new areas but the whole point of the game is to see it from the character's perspective, he has to go between villages and barter to make a profit to continue on his journey.

I hate Harvest Moon and all games that mimick it.  I've also grown very tired of RTS games that have you tediously farm or have a race of efficiency with someone else--and yet I love this game.  Hero of the Kingdom starts out very poorly as a mediocre and unimportant casual point and click game, but immediately becomes interesting and more complicated after a tutorial-like prologue. \n\nYou play out a semi-interesting medievalish story in older graphics, in which there is little to no animation.  This may seem lackluster, but this type of minimalism is what I found pretty charming.  The gameplay itself constitutes a balance of resources alongside a \"where's waldo\" approach of farmig for free resources.  So you will spend resources to build structures, learn new ways to find resources, and to complete quests with resource rewards.  On every part of the map you will also keep your eye out and pixel hunt for small objects you can pick up for free like eggs, lobsters, and random crates.  This simple gameplay, very casual sound and look, and being able to solve the problem of balancing the moderately complicated resource balance makes for a very pleasing experience.\n\nA casual and simplified Age of Empires meets \"Where's Waldo?\"", "timestamp_created": 1416522072, "timestamp_updated": 1416522072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13010616": {"recommendationid": "13010616", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966436747", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416439285}, "language": "german", "review": "WoW konsequent weiterentwickelt: Einloggen, Achievement, Abspann", "timestamp_created": 1416439317, "timestamp_updated": 1416439317, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13007606": {"recommendationid": "13007606", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986432154", "num_games_owned": 4187, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505691595}, "language": "czech", "review": "N\u011bkolikahodinov\u00e1 klikac\u00ed hra s hloup\u00fdm p\u0159\u00edb\u011bhem odehr\u00e1vaj\u00edc\u00ed se na zhruba dvaceti hern\u00edch obrazovk\u00e1ch.

I was pleasantly surprised by Hero of the Kingdom, and was happy to have given it a chance.\n\nIf you like super casual, short, adventure games that are less action-oriented (the game's main mechanic is item/resource management), then you will enjoy this game. It is easily beatable in less than 2 hours, and within 4 hours I had farmed all of the achievements. \n\nThe aesthetics are nice - the backgrounds are well-done and the menus/feedback are non-intrusive. The music and sounds are good, adding an appropriate feel to the atmosphere. The story and pacing of the game allow for a very mindless, non-taxing gameplay experience. After playing through a lot of time-intensive, mind-numbing games, having casual alternatives like Hero o the Kingdom is always appreciated.\n\nThe controls are extremely simple, as everything is done through mouse clicks. The tutorial is quick and painless, and the learning curve is mostly minimal - the most difficult element being proper item/resource management. It is pretty challenging to actually \"fail\" in the game, as there are always options for you to acquire more resources, even if you find yourself suddenly depleted of everything.\n\nGameplay is mostly linear and follows a straightforward formula - in order for you to progress to area X, you need items Y and Z. Item Y can be obtained by either buying it directly with gold, or by harvesting and crafting components A and C, Item Z is a side-quest reward. Variations of this formula occur, but the general concept is to have the appropriate items for each mission. Any form of resource harvesting (ex: farming, hunting) requires health points (and usually some other item(s)), and you are able to accumulate an infinite amount of HP if you keep resting. \n\nFor achievement hunters, this game is pretty easy to achieve 100%, however, a large amount of time will be spent finding small objects (mushrooms, crates, etc) on the screen. I had to do this in bursts, as my eyes and brain would get tired of searching through each level.\n\nIf you want a casual, non-demanding break from your typical games, then definitely give Hero of the Kingdom a try. I've played web-based games on sites like Newgrounds and Kongregate since I was a child, and this game has similar appeal as the quality titles you can find on there. \n\nI normally try not to mention game price in my reviews, however, I would recommend most people to wait for this one to go on sale, or at least be bundled (as it happens often).\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/djsfsroguereviews]@DJSF's Rogue Reviews[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1415832064, "timestamp_updated": 1415902521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620401", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12909661": {"recommendationid": "12909661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113683239", "num_games_owned": 616, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416632106}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u041c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438.", "timestamp_created": 1415789494, "timestamp_updated": 1415789494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12894907": {"recommendationid": "12894907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068832110", "num_games_owned": 809, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425717296}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f.\n\u0413\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 - point & click. \u041d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e - \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0451\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433, \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0443.", "timestamp_created": 1415748381, "timestamp_updated": 1415748381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495272", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12883343": {"recommendationid": "12883343", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990833248", "num_games_owned": 3627, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 1041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424400843}, "language": "english", "review": "A very enjoyable casual game.

This game is a little bit too slow as a causal game. I used to sleep only when I have to. But later I found I spent so many time searching for a camp or hotel, because one sleep can give you 10~20 points of heart and one hunting takes me 8+ points. So later I found out I can sleep consecutively to have more than 200 points. It makes this game unreal for me. Besides, the same thing goes when you need to make money.\n\n- \u8282\u594f\u6162\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f11\u95f2\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u4f3c\u4e4e\u8282\u594f\u592a\u6162\u4e86\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\u6211\u672c\u6765\u53ea\u5728\u8981\u7761\u89c9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u7761\u89c9\u3002\u4f46\u540e\u6765\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u6211\u8bdd\u592a\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u627e\u8425\u5730\u6216\u65c5\u5e97\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b21\u7761\u7720\u80fd\u7ed9\u4f6010~20\u70b9\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e00\u6b21\u72e9\u730e\u80fd\u6d88\u8017\u4f608+\u70b9\u3002\u4e8e\u662f\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u6211\u5c31\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u4e0d\u505c\u7761\u89c9\u6765\u5f97\u5230200\u591a\u70b9\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u7684\u786e\u8ba9\u6211\u611f\u89c9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u3002\u51b5\u4e14\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u5237\u94b1\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u4f60\u4e5f\u4f1a\u611f\u89c9\u5230\u6e38\u620f\u8fdb\u5ea6\u504f\u6162\u3002\n\n- Achievement. OMG! I played it for more than 5 hours, but it took me 30 minutes to make money and more than 1.5 hours to find mushroom, egg and box to unlock all achievements. I seriously doubt how can you guys finish this game with 100% achievement for about 3 hours. The last 1.5 hours makes me frustrated and this is probably the only difficulty you will have for this game. This game should have scored 6 if I had not experience the last 1.5 hours.

I AM GREEDY! :)\n\nGet the game, have fun for some hours, or for 1/2 hours for some days, no problem you can always leave and come back.\n\nThe short description would be:  Do chains of quests.

It's basically a point and click adventure game, but instead of puzzles, you have resource management.  You find/collect various resources in the world and use them to create/craft/barter for other items that may not be as easy to come by.  As the story progresses (a simple story, old as time, but it moves things along), you open up new areas of the map in which to hunt, forage, and take on side quests for various NPCs.  \n\nAll of the backgrounds are static, with icons representing the types of activities available - picking flowers, hunting bear, fishing, and combat animations are little more than a few 2D sprites wobbling back and forth.  But that doesn't detract from the enjoyment.  There is just enough of a \"new stuff to get/see\" drip, and the pacing is done well enough, that it never gets boring.  You may find a vendor selling things you don't know what to do with yet, but it won't take long until you figure it out, or the story progresses to the point where it makes sense.  There is a bit of a grind at the end of the game if you want all the achievements, but it's not a big deal.  \n\nThe major story beats are advanced by having the right amount of particular resources - soldiers, healing potions, a weapon of some sort - to take on the battle or quest in front of you.  Sometimes, finding the right resources is a little troubling because the map doesn't identify where anything particular is; however, the loads are fast enough, and you backtrack enough that you get used to where the crucial stuff is anyway.  \n\nIt has a demo, so I'd check that out.  It hooked me and I ended up getting all 38 achievements (most of which can easily be done by playing through it).", "timestamp_created": 1414172893, "timestamp_updated": 1414172893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622400", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12612060": {"recommendationid": "12612060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157259558", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413992919}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego curioso y divertido. \n\nCortito (3-5 horas) pero con una gestion de recursos sorprendente y con una historia fantastica medieval bien llevada.\n\n6.4/10", "timestamp_created": 1414166903, "timestamp_updated": 1414166903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12610431": {"recommendationid": "12610431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062327248", "num_games_owned": 893, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424540567}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Oyuncu Aran\u0131yor!\n\n\u0130stenilen \u00f6zellikler:\n\n-Point & Click oyun oynayabilecek \n-Gen\u00e7 bir delikanl\u0131yla babas\u0131n\u0131 kurtarmas\u0131 i\u00e7in \u00e7\u0131k\u0131lan yolda kendini orta d\u00fcnyan\u0131n karanl\u0131\u011f\u0131nda bulsa dahi sorun etmeyecek \n-\u0130n\u015faatlarda \u00e7al\u0131\u015f\u0131p, bitki toplabilecek, bal\u0131k\u00e7\u0131l\u0131k yapabilecek, toplumun ihtiya\u00e7lar\u0131n\u0131 kar\u015f\u0131lamak i\u00e7in g\u00f6n\u00fcll\u00fc \u00e7al\u0131\u015fabilecek\n-K\u0131sa oynay\u0131\u015f s\u00fcresini dert etmeyecek (~6-7 saat)\n\noyuncular aran\u0131yor.

BUT please do buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1414142665, "timestamp_updated": 1414142665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 140, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843089", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12605200": {"recommendationid": "12605200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095677874", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424634819}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442-\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0438\u044f. \u0418 \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a, \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439, \u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0448\u0430\u0444\u0442\u0430 - \u043e\u043a\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432 \u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f - \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e!\n\u041f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0430, \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0451 \u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0439\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0435\u0435. \u0412\u0430\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0451\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0437\u0430\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043c\u0438 (\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u044f, \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f), \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0448\u0430\u0444\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u0432\u044b \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445, \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u043e\u0442\u044b\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u044f\u0438\u0446.\n\u0412\u0441\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0443\u0445\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f. \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0445.\n\u0412 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a.\n10 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10. \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c. \u041f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b)", "timestamp_created": 1414121397, "timestamp_updated": 1414121397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12603517": {"recommendationid": "12603517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069566192", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486850239}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game.

This one though is fully in 2d, which I personally like a lot, cause it still manages to deliver more slick, more detailed and thin-lined drawings, opposed to 3d muddying of features caused by texture requirements and antialiasing. I'd argue that 3d engines still aren't capable of producing such fine lines as simple and clear as 2d drawing/sprite and this game uses that fact to the full effect. The visual presentation is, again, clear, colorful and full of small details. \nSo far I'd played for some 2 or 3 hours (ignore the Steam stats, I don't understand why it didn't record the last session) in one sitting and the experience was delightful, the flow of quests and tasks slick and satisfying and gameplay varied enough to still feel interesting, though in the beginning you solely click on few points on screen and manage few basic stats like food and building materials. Slowly you get involved with you character, though his actions aren't described in much verbouse prose, but later when he manageas to learn few skills and has some successful quests uder his belt you do start to care and do notice when he starts calling some officer HIS captain, since he recently enlisted in land's military. The progres from a naive farmboy to adventurer to ultimate hero is a familiar tale, but it's nicely done and somewhat beliveably depicted - in slow careful stages. In this case journey is more satisfying than the end and slow exploring of map, solving quests and \"leveling up\" (though the only stat connected to that is reputation) makes a nice calm romp. \nSo my overal oppinion is that it's competent and surprizingly fun casual P&C adventure.

Ovvero affronterete le varie quest dovendo cercare alcuni oggett/persone, e questo pu\u00f2 essere fatto in varie maniere.\n\nLa prima \u00e8 interagire con le icone che sono ben evidenziate nello scenario, qui probabilmente dovrete avere nell'inventario altri oggetti che vi permetteranno di interagire con essi: ad esempio per raccogliere dei fiori dovrete avere comprato/trovato dei cesti di vimini, magari comprandoli dai venditori o trovandoli come ricompensa in altre quest.\n\nLa seconda \u00e8 cercare gli oggetti nello scenario, tipo \"oggetti nascosti\", alcuni oggetti compariranno man mano che diventerete pi\u00f9 bravi in alcune skill. Ad esempio i funghi: all'inizio ce n'\u00e8 un solo tipo, man mano che andate avanti nelle varie quest png vi faranno avanzare in varie skill, quindi diveterete pi\u00f9 bravi. A questo punto compariranno altri tipi di funghi che prima non c'erano. Questo sistema funziona anche a volte per trovare oggetti/persone smarrite, e l'unica indicazione che avete \u00e8 quella di seguire le indicazioni contenute nei testi e aguzzare vista e ingegno (niente di complicato comunque). Anche la caccia ai tesori funziona in questo modo.\n\nLa quest principale va avanti da sola, alla fine si tratta solo di avere il quantitativo giusto di oggetti richiesti per fare quell'azione: ad esempio per fare una certa battaglia avrete bisogno di un tot di soldati, pozioni etc. Stessa cosa per aggiustare strutture rotte etc. La cosa pi\u00f9 \"complicata\" \u00e8 ricordarsi chi vende cosa e dove. La storia \u00e8 abbastanza standard, ma interessante e raccontata bene. Forse ci si immedesima troppo poco nel personaggio dato che praticamente non lo si vede.\n\nL'audio \u00e8 di contorno ma non da fastidio, le musiche dipendono semplicemente dal posto in cui siete in quel momento, fa il suo dovere.\n\nGraficamente \u00e8 piacevole, anche se \u00e8 tutto molto statico (a parte l'acqua), magari qualche animazione qua e l\u00e0 in pi\u00f9 non avrebbe guastato, anzi.\n\nL'avventura \u00e8 breve, si finisce in poche ore, anche con quest secondarie, caccia ai tesori e achievements compresi, ma tutto sommato si vuol vedere come finisce o come va avanti, e questo penso che sia positivo. Credo che valga la pena giocarci comunque, anche se forse non a prezzo pieno.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\nDiscovered by chance at the end was interesting, absolutely not complicated, maybe a little more if you want to get all the achievements, but nothing trascindentale, just make it more interesting.\n\nThe game is basically an adventure, but achieved in a different way from usual. Or you will face having to look for some quests Subject / people, and this can be done in various ways.\n\nThe first is to interact with the icons that are well highlighted in the scenario, here you'll probably have to have more inventory items that will allow you to interact with them: for example, to collect the flowers you should have bought / found some wicker baskets, perhaps by buying them at the vendors or finding them as a reward in other quests.\n\nThe second is to look for the objects in the scene, such as \"hidden objects\", some objects will appear as they become better at certain skills. Such as the mushrooms: in the beginning there is only one type, as you go forward in the various quests png there will advance in skill variety, then yuo'll become most talented. At this point will appear other types of fungi that were not there before. This system also works at times to find objects / people lost, and the only indication that you have is to follow the instructions contained in the texts and sharpen vision and intelligence (nothing complicated anyway). Even the treasure hunt works this way.\n\nThe main quest goes on by itself, in the end it is just to have the right amount of items required to make that action: for example, to do a certain battle you will need a certain number of soldiers, potions etc. Same thing to fix broken structures etc. The most \"complicated\" is to remember who sells what and where. The story is fairly standard, but interesting and well told. Perhaps there is too little empathizes with the character since practically do not see it.\n\nThe sound is boundary but do not bother, music simply depends on the place where you are at that moment, does his duty.\n\nGraphically it is nice, although it is all very static (other than water), maybe some animation here and there in more would not hurt, in fact.\n\nThe adventure is short, you end up in a few hours, even with quests, treasure hunting and achievements including, but overall you want to see how it ends or how it goes forward, and I think this is positive.

The game was developed by Lonely Troops, a Slovakian Indie studio consisting of 2 brothers.\n\n[b][u]STORY[/u][/b]\nWithout going too much into detail, the story is pretty generic weak-boy-saves-the-world material. Bandits burn down your house and kidnap your father, so you set out on a quest to rescue him, find out what the bandits' motives are and put an end to all evil to make the kingdom a peaceful and safe place again. Add magic, ghosts, talking frogs, goblins and lizardmen to that and, well, there you go. Nothing spectacular or innovative there, but gameflow-wise it keeps the boat afloat, so that's at least something.\n\n[b][u]VISUALS[/u][/b]\nGraphically, the game may as well be from the 1990's era of simulation games such as Anno 1602 or Age of Empires, which isn't a bad thing at all. The enviroments have loads of details that you often only see at a second glance and it's quite cool to discover new things in areas that you have already visited many times. However, do note that the enviroments are absolutely static - they are basically drawings with quest/action markers on top of them, so you won't see cows eating grass, fishes swimming around or anything like that. The best you get is some minor animation effects for water and smoke, but that's about it. If anything changes in the enviroment like, say, a NPC is moving from A to B, he slowly fades out on A and then slowly fades in on B, so there aren't any actual animations for anything. While that's no deal-breaker for me personally, it surely would've been awesome if the game felt a bit more alive and actually more like a sim rather than a P'n'C game with rendered backgrounds.\n\n[b][u]GAMEPLAY[/u][/b]\nThe game is basically a Hidden Object game where you can freely move around between the various locations to explore them and hunt, collect and harvest goods that you'll eventually need for quests, trades or tasks. All items that you gather will be put into your inventory and you decide whether you want to sell them for gold or trade them for other items that you might need for a certain quest.\n\nAll interactions such as hunting, fishing, harvesting or fighting cost resources in the form of knifes, arrows, bowls, fishing rods, swords, shields etc. and if you have a bow but no arrows, you can't go hunting. While the various tasks require various resources, all tasks require a certain amount of health points (similar to Action Points in turn-based games). They basically represent your stamina and if you have depleted your health, you can't finish any tasks until you replenish it again. This is easily done by taking a nap in a tent, camp or inn. The different resting places require different resources: while you need fruits or meat to sleep in a tent or a camp, you need hard gold to sleep in an inn. In return, you get rewarded with the most health points out of the 3 resting places because it's more restorative to sleep in an actual bed rather than in a tent, obviously.\n\nGenerally, managing your resources is an important part of the game as you need to think ahead and estimate whether you might need certain items later down the road. If you sell everything right away, you most definitely will have to re-purchase the items in order to complete tasks or quest. On the other hand, if you keep absolutely everything in your inventory, you might not be able to purchase required items that are only sold for gold - simply because you didn't earn any gold by selling stuff you do not need.\n\nOther than that, it's basically back and forth tracking between the different locations to look out for new or updated quests and new activities, which often only spawn after certain quests are completed.\n\n[b][u]PLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITY[/u][/b]\nBeating the story took me roughly 5 hours, however, the largest chunk of playtime is dedicated to finding the large amount of hidden objects/resources and doing various tasks to gain even more resources. The actual story itself makes only a small piece of the pie.\n\nFor me personally, the game has only very little replayability. Once you've beaten it, you've beaten it. There's no real point or incentive to come back to it again, especially since it's easily doable to get 100% of the achiements in a single playthrough if you just take your time and don't rush from quest to quest.\n\n[b][u]CONCLUSION[/u][/b]\nHero of the Kingdom isn't flawless, but the visual appeal, the relaxing atmosphere and the simple yet interesting gameplay makes this a decent game for a casual evening when you're not in the mood to shoot and kill things on the screen.", "timestamp_created": 1412201768, "timestamp_updated": 1412201768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635998", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12317979": {"recommendationid": "12317979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027814305", "num_games_owned": 2884, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430197029}, "language": "english", "review": "Normaly I do not dig hidden object games\n\nBut this one is fun and kinda nonlinear with rpg like feel (ne real rpg involved :))", "timestamp_created": 1412195648, "timestamp_updated": 1412195648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12316785": {"recommendationid": "12316785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077040728", "num_games_owned": 469, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412274124}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud074\ub9ad\uac9c\uc778\ub370 \uadf8\ub0e5\uc800\ub0e5 \ud560\ub9cc\ud568.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1412189280, "timestamp_updated": 1412189280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500440", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12316440": {"recommendationid": "12316440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080564679", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393862629}, "language": "german", "review": "Gutes Spiel!", "timestamp_created": 1412187347, "timestamp_updated": 1412187347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12311475": {"recommendationid": "12311475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043646249", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414105948}, "language": "english", "review": "This game surprised me.

It's just a simple point n' click adventure, but it still incorporates elements to make it seem like a RPG, too. \n\nYou start off as a farmer, but a group of bandits burn down your farmhouse, and you end up going on a huge adventure and become a hero. Unlike other games of this type, you  don't become said hero by just fighting a bunch of monsters. You have to trade with people to get the proper items to help other people. It's a nice way to show that not all heroes have to be big and brawny or do huge tasks to be considered a hero. \n\nI've read some of the others reviews for this game, and it seems that a lot of people would agree with me when I say that this little game is surprisingly addictive, and most don't regret playing it. The only negative comments I have about this game are that the music gets a bit bothersome after a while, and the game could've delved a bit deeper in order to make the game last longer, but other than that, I think it's pretty solid.\n\nPros:\n-Addictive\n-Simple\n-Nice perspective on heroism \n\nCons:\n-Music gets bothersome\n-Could've been longer/more in depth\n\nScores:\nGameplay: 8/10\nSoundtrack: 5/10\nStyle: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nAttractiveness: 8/10\nOverall: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1409685761, "timestamp_updated": 1409685761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504892", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11956179": {"recommendationid": "11956179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025440721", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1395873582}, "language": "italian", "review": "This is great, really a great idea !\n\nI hope in many sequels :-)\n\nThanks !", "timestamp_created": 1409654655, "timestamp_updated": 1409654655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11937948": {"recommendationid": "11937948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065634345", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407191764}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Hero of the Kingdom is simple and cool game to simple gamers", "timestamp_created": 1409508578, "timestamp_updated": 1409508578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11934847": {"recommendationid": "11934847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063582789", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409496347}, "language": "english", "review": "A very solid fun for a Sunday afternoon for whoever likes adventure mixed with mild strategic resource management.", "timestamp_created": 1409492561, "timestamp_updated": 1409492561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11913759": {"recommendationid": "11913759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008522548", "num_games_owned": 621, "num_reviews": 174, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409405411}, "language": "english", "review": "Neat little game.

Instead of hacking and slashing your way through the world, you become a hero by doing quests and tasks for others.

You have to purchase the sacks, baskets, fishing rod and bait, etc, but it's fascinating to play. I sat down for a good couple of hours, just absorbed in the gameplay. \n\nAlso, the following stunned me: It made me think about what we define as a hero. Is it only a chap in armour, slashing his way through the countryside? Or can it mean someone who improves the areas he travels through in a constructive, helpful manner? You are a communicator, a problem solver, the solution to social problems. I'm either very tired or this game got under my skin in a good way.\n\nIt's not the longest game, but I don't think it has to be (look on the forums if you want to know how long a playthrough lasts, I haven't finished it yet).

It is longer than you might expect, and tracks the story of a young boy  on his journey to save his father.

The bulk of the challenge is simply juggling the barter system to obtain the objects you need or working out how to get enough gold to proceed.\n\nThat said, the game is moderately entertaining as a short-term time-waster and actually tells a surprisingly decent, if shallow, story of how your ordinary farmboy rises up to become the savior of the land. It's not original by any means, but it's very back-to-basics. If you're a completionist or achievement hound then there are a fair few challenges to kill time, but I beat it with 100% completion in about 4 hours at most (quite a lot of which was spent searching for those DAMNED last few eggs). I can't in good faith call it a \"good game\" but I don't have the heart to give it a downvote- even if plot and gameplay were both very shallow, it was cheap and it entertained me for a while and it had a peculiar charm to it.

When looking at the screen shots I got the impression this was going to be a medieval RTS similar to Strongholds, but more casual. I was wrong, but it turned out to be a good thing. \n\nHero of the Kingdom is a click your own adventure game. You start out as a never described boy that must make his way through an epic journey to save his father and ultimately the entire kingdom. You play within a static background and must click on various elements to get loot and proceed to other static screens. There are lite crafting elements. You get herbs and wheat and must turn these into goods for profit or to further the story. The quests are not linear. Yes there are some story quests you must complete to proceed, but not all the quests are that way. In terms of quests I would say there are roughly 20 to 30. I would say the average gamer would beat this in 4 hours, but total play time should not exceed 6. \n\nThe story is mediocre, the writing is actually kind of silly, (reads like it was written by a teenager) the amount of clicking is ridiculous, there's no challenge to the game, there's even a hint button that will literally tell you exactly what to do to proceed. Honestly, this game is well suited for young teens and children more so than adults. However, there was just enough fun from all the clicking, crafting, and reading that I didn't mind finishing the game. Actually, I finished the game, realized I hadn't got all the achievements and played it all over again! \n\nBottom line: This game is not for adults, but it's fun enough to keep you playing till the end.

Das klingt f\u00fcr den ein oder anderen vielleicht \u00fcberhoben, aber nein, dass meine ich wirklich so. Am Anfang des Spiels klickt man sich erst einmal linear von einer Position zur n\u00e4chsten, was aber nicht weiter schlimm ist, denn die Erz\u00e4hlweise des Spiels, also die netten Dialoge und die damit kleine verbundene Hintergrundstory \u00fcber einen verlorenen Vater, lassen euch in eurem Bann ziehen.\n\nAber nun wirklich zum Spiel:\n\nDie Optik des Spiels l\u00e4sst vermuten, dass es sich hier um ein reines Aufbau- Strategie Spiel im Sinne von Age of Empires handeln k\u00f6nnte, dem ist aber nicht so. Wenn Man versucht dem Spiel ein Genre zuzuordnen, wird man feststellen, dass man nicht so richtig wei\u00df, das Spiel einzuordnen. Man k\u00f6nnte es vielleicht So beschreiben:\nAdventure, Strategie, RPG, Click and Point. Irgendwie sowas. Und das trifft auch wirklich zu.\nWir bestreiten eine abenteuerliche Geschichte, in der es gilt, den eigenen Vater wieder zu finden, der verschwunden zu sein scheint. Dazu m\u00fcssen wir immer wieder Quest bestreiten, die mit ein wenig strategisches Management in Verbindung mit dem sammeln von Items einhergeht. Und so kommen wir auch schon zum Click and Point Part, denn es geht eben nicht darum in Echtzeit eine Figur per Controller oder Tastatur zu bedienen, nein, in Abenteuer Manier sucht ihr per Mausklick nach diversen Items, die euch im weiterem Spielverlauf weiterhelfen.\n\nMein kurzes Fazit:\n\nDieses Spiel hat etwas vertr\u00e4umtes, dazu verhilft wahrscheinlich auch die gut ausgew\u00e4hlte Hintergrundmelodie.

Good game for easy achievments, bad game if you pay more than 2 bucks. \n\nHero of the Kingdom is a point and click adventure mixed with a resource manager. You travel through different overview screens, visiting villages, mountains, forests and so on. On your way, you pick up items either by clicking (said \"Search those 5 pixels\"-moments) or by buying/trading/questing at NPCs. The more you progress, the more resources you have. For example you need Energy to fight (a boar or wolf costs X energy), which you replenish by sleeping. You can sleep when you pay gold at inns or in the wild, if you have enough food on you (different camping sites ask for different kinds of food). You can also carry items, which hold longer (Weapons and tools, though they might break sometimes)\nSadly, the system is kinda broken after a while for those, who notice how to milk endless gold out of the resource cycle. Maybe a patch would help here?\n\nThe artwork is pretty good, I expect the designer to give us a full course of his abilities in the future. Everything looks very detailed and alive and every screen carries a different kind of atmosphere with it The background music is nothing outstanding, but it doesnt kill the atmosphere either. \"Generic\" comes to my mind here.\n\nStill, seeing as this is an endless orgy of clicking and searching I can not recommend it at its current price of 6 Euro. Maybe some mini-games and riddles would have helped to add simply MORE CONTENT to this game. In the end I just played it to gather all achievments, having absolutely no interest for an ending (and there is only one. Why not make different endings, depending on how you choose to solve quests and stuff?

It uses an isometric 2D view with a bit of animation in there as well. The story isn't all that fancy, or important, but it fits the casual nature of the game.\n\nIt's kinda hard to explain the gameplay because it involves a lot of clicking. You'll be accepting quests where you have to find certain items scattered across the map, defeat enemies, build things, sell things, buy things, you name it. There's plenty to do here, but remember, it's all about clicking stuff, so you will only use your mouse. Besides the isometric 2D view there's not much to look at. There are only textboxes and trade windows here. \n\nBut this game is just so damn fun and addictive. It's no good for you if you suffer from OCD, because you will want to complete most of the stuff this game throws at you, it's *that* fun (but casual).

It's a very unique game. Basically you're presented a top-down isometric screen that looks a little bit like Age of Empires 2 or HoMM3 or something. You click through text prompts on the screen in a sort of combination text adventure and hidden object game. You become a hero of your kingdom by moving through screens and helping people out. Maybe someone lost their son, so you hidden object find him. Nothing is difficult, it'll just be like you see a patch of mushrooms, and you click it so you get mushrooms added to your inventory. Or you are on your boat and click a barrel underwater to salvage it. So not really hidden object, more like click-to-acquire. Maybe a farmer needs someone to go to town to sell his flour, so you get flour, click to switch screens to the town, and sell the flour to a merchant. Your inventory has dozens of different types of commodities that you manage, flowers, eggs, swords, handymen, antlers, pearls, etc. Across the world various merchants buy and sell various commodities. There's no actual difficulty in that it seems like it's impossible to make a bad transaction. If you just keep buying and selling stuff and foraging and fishing and hunting you'll eventually get enough of what you need or enough money to buy what you need.

He gets to do all sorts of jobs from woodcutting to burning to healing wounded people. Gameplay is simple: clicking a marker will give you a short written description (no voice-over here) of your character's thoughts, what you can (and therefore should) do and what you need to accomplish that. You need many kinds of resources in the form of food, vitality, gold and tools.\n\nWhile the gameplay is a casual adventure, you also have to manage the said resources. You'll gain vitality by resting, which requires food that is acquired by foraging or hunting, which in part require tools and skills. Many parts of this chain could have been removed to smooth the gameplay: with them, however, it is an adventure RPG game, not just a barely visual novel.\n\nThere are also many details in the areas that turn out to be significant later on. Some of them are \"hidden\", though, meaning that you just have to click them to see if they react: stuff like collectable mushrooms and lootable barrels form this category.\n\nThe narration is casual and easygoing, containing little to no fancy words. In effect, it would be quite suitable to be played with young children who can't read yet, assuming English proficiency. Like so, the story is rather traditional with the evil dark wizards and all. It's still nice enough to keep in its grip for the while it lasts.\n\nFull completion would have lasted about 4 hours, but I went for all the achievements. This added about an hour to the playtime because I just couldn't find several last mushrooms and hidden caches.

It looks like an old-school isometric rpg, but there is no character to control - instead all actions are performed by clicking on object like in a point&click title. The basic rpg premise is still here (slight spoilers!) - an ordinary boy on a quest to find his father turns into a hero that saves the land from dire evil. Yeah, like no one expected that, spoilers over. The boy learns skills during the adventure - hunting, herbalism, etc - in order to get closer to his goal. As if the mix wasn't unusual enough the game adds in some Hiden Object elements - there are treasures and extra items hidden around in the bushes, rivers, barrels. \n\nVisually the game has nothing to be shy of, it's a simple but well drawn style. Map elements are clearly distinguishible and even the hidden items are fairly easy to spot with a little practice. It's overall easy on the eye even for longer sessions. The audio is pleasant enough too, can't say much in detail about it personally but at least it feels right. Sadly, there is very little, if any, voice acting and that might diminish the enjoyment for some players - while lots of detailed text and dialogues can be enrich the world it might also bore the player.\n\nPersonally I find the mix pretty entertaining, then again I enjoy casual games so take what I say with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, the story moves at a good enough pace to keep boredom away and it's easy to enjoy this in bite-sized portions if so desired. Time-wise the game takes around 5 hours for a relaxed playthrough, dipping to maybe 3-3.5 for a speedy run and climbing to approx 8 for a single 100% run. At L5 that is pretty good value for anyone who likes a more casual adventure. \n\ntl;dr: At \u00a35 it's a good mix of point&click, adventure, and casual gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1391291772, "timestamp_updated": 1391291772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8935371": {"recommendationid": "8935371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001395593", "num_games_owned": 1256, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392322864}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice, relaxing and interesting game.

There's no avoiding those.\n\nTo sum it up, the entire gameplay consists of jumping between the chunks of the world map, helping the elderly, picking up pretty flowers, hunting for pixels, wild animal genocide and occasional Bad Guy slaying. That's it, really. The (heavily linear) story is like something straight out of a children's book geared towards ages 5-7. No replayability value, unless you're into meaningless grinding and achievement hunting.\n\nSo why in the blazing hell am I still recommending this?

Well, there's more, but you should see by yourself! :)\n\nThe story was quite good, but nothing extraordinary, pretty standard fantasy with many cliches. I would say, concerning it's simplicity, the story is rather for young than adult, but I still enjoyed it.

There are 3 skills - Alchemy, Hunting and Fishing, and nothing more - that's not RPG game with shitload of stats. Whatsmore, providing simple economy system, you can buy and sell some stuff. Gameplay is for no more then 4 hours.\n\nThe biggest problem with Hero of the Kingdom was the unsophisticated story - and that's all.

It's a bit odd to describe it, as the game wants to seem like an adventure but it comes out as something fairly unique. You start as a simple farm lad trying to find where your father went off to after bandits ransacked your farm, and end up being, as the title says, the hero of the entire kingdom.\n\nTo achieve this end result, you must click, and click, and click! This can be from anything as simple as delivering a letter from clickable person to clickable person #2 to defeating various armies of villainous foes by gathering troops and supplies. There's also objects in the background that, when clicked upon, give various items relating to what they are. These can be very helpful for trading for what you need or selling to get extra gold, though none of them are necessary typically and are just there to make the game last longer.\n\nSpeaking of length, it took me 3.3 hours to beat the game, including all my clicking of the extra objects (of which I got about 95%). I was somewhat annoyed to find that I couldn't go back and clean up the last few objects I needed once I had beaten it, but this will only affect you if you're a completionist or achievement hunter. If you are, just be wary of that.\n\nThe story is very basic of course, even just basing it on the summary I gave, but it's a quaint little adventure-sorta game.

Where's the recommendation part? :P\nWell, the truth is, that despite the game's obvious casuality and simplicity, or maybe in a way thanks to those elements, the game *IS* fun to play. At least it was for me. \nI hear some people moan and complain that a game like this shouldn't cost money. Well, if that is what you think - don't pay for it, just pass on it and move on. Personally, I think paying $5-$6 for such a game is an okay deal. Obviously not a bargain, but not a bad deal either. Sometimes a game like this is exactly what I need to relax and unwind.

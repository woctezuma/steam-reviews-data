Buy it, like, yesterday.\n\nReview: This is the best CYOA game to be released by Hosted, bar none. It continues where the first game, Sabres of Infinity, left off, following the rise (or fall) of the protagonist, a dragoon officer. The writing is largely reminiscent of Napoleonic fiction, and I wouldn't be surprised if the author had a stack of Bernard Cornwell's novels at hand for reference in writing the material. That being said, the game world is wholly original and incredibly immersive, and I always enjoy coming back to the richly detailed characters and locales.\n\nImportantly, the gameplay is much improved since the first game, particularly in regards to balancing. Where one found min-maxing inevitable in the previous installment, the choices offered and their influence on the main character in both stats and relationships is far more nuanced and a bit more forgiving in this game. That being said, you can find yourself in no-win scenarios if you plunge your character into deeds of daring far beyond their capabilities, which I enjoy.\n\nIf you need a military-fiction fix, or are thinking about trying a CYOA game for the first time, this is your best bet.", "timestamp_created": 1504587090, "timestamp_updated": 1504587090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34182307": {"recommendationid": "34182307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086955333", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500227829}, "language": "english", "review": "The Infinity Series features a wonderful content-rich story set in a complex and convincing world. \n\nI especially appreciate that the series presents a flavour of authentic imperial history (barring the infrequent mentions of magic). \n\nThis series sold me on choice games.

Guns of Infinity improves over Sabres of Infinity in the following ways: it provides a more dynamic experience, with diverting or flavorful mini-storylines, new characters and romances, and considerably more nuance.\n\nThe first game, Sabres of Infinity, was largely a linear experience. You went from one battle to the next, with two chapter changes if you didn't make promotion. Guns of the Infinity follows your substantial decisions, writing four chapter changes (8 unique choices) for their divergences. If you retreated in the last game, you have a whole unique arc.\n\nBut this can also result in brevity. The game is long, but unless you replay or read the scenes, you won't see all the stops.\n\nTo help with replayability, the author has provided some flavor-enhancing storylines. This include a family, selective pasttimes and causes. But there are some caveats. Your family, in theory, provides more Austen sensibility, but with the amount of choices over your siblings, mother and father, effectively reduces to a money-bleeding vanity. Some decisions, like beatifying an old officer, do not show their full effect in the game.\n\nThe stronger additions are the romances. (When I replayed Sabres, I combed the choices for nearly an hour, before I realized the war-time romance was in Broadsides.) Your choices include an Adlerian spy filly and a fur-lined Duchess. (It looks like there was plans for knights-and-idealism Elson, but not moody-venerable-bryonic-hero Sir Cassius.) One note of caution though: only the spy has the full arc.\n\nGuns still has a small cast like the first game. This is both detrimental and advantageous. In Sabres, you focused nearly entirely on your two friends/rivals/distant chums. This resulted in two strong characters. But I had no idea what my second-in-command did during the day. (Probably slept until I woke him up like Alfred.) The newcomers have more plans and preferences and ideas (and more importantly investments!)\n\nThe strongest is the spy. So if you do want to romance her, remember that there isn't much recourse in romance after the first (your character's plans for her) choice. It is easier to break up than choose intellectually and fall in love later, or go from friendship to love.\n\nFlavor and love-at-first-sight decisions notwithstanding, Guns excells in its nuances. In Sabres, it was guns blazing into the quiet sun. Guns plays like Empire to a New Hope. Your commanders express their weariness at the loss of war more often. You get more inner dialogue.\n\nTo people familiar with war novels, the diatribe between the romance and cynicism of war may seem old hash. But the only way this story works is in its sense of time. This story is part 2, of a long campaign, and game. Whether your character goes for the war is hell mantra, or God save the King, is irrelevant. You make choices to a changing and growing world. Some choices are meaningless, a few vital, and others numbing in their repetition, (didn't I already make Theoden's charge?) but they are all cumulative.\n\nWars are made by the composite of many, many events, not any one shot.\n\nYour decision to play this game is by the sum of all parts.", "timestamp_created": 1459437230, "timestamp_updated": 1459665571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780804", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22158063": {"recommendationid": "22158063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059612072", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465778733}, "language": "english", "review": "I found this game delightful and was thoroughly enjoying it.

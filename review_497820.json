An accident has taken place at a futuristic bar, and you can shift back and forth in time and move around among the characters to watch the events unfold in any way you want.\n\nI really like this concept. It's passive, and there's no real reason why it should be in VR, but it does feel much more immersive viewing the events in first person when you're in VR. It feels like those new theatre experiences popping around that let you move around among the actors and go from room to room watching the play unfold.\n\nThe intro makes it sound like like you're an investigator and you're supposed to solve the mystery of how the accident happened. The truth is that there's no interactive element here. You're not solving anything, you're just watching a series of events from a variety of starting points.\n\nThe short story that takes place isn't much, it doesn't really make sense and is very unbelievable (four stories are taking place at once and they all culminate in the same instant), the character animation and voice acting are nothing impressive, and the winding of time back and forth can be tedious because you can't speed it up past 1x. This was made with Unreal VR and it looks very blurry.\n\nI still enjoyed it. It's worth experiencing once, just to admire the concept and think of how it can be further developed by other teams.

The concept of the game revolves around the control of time to view a scene from multiple perspectives.  The player is just a ghost in the scene that can't interact with anything, but your goal is just to observe.  The closer you observe, the more you will get out of the game because attention to detail is pretty high.  Even though the game only technically consists of one room, since there are five distinct interactions going on at the same time, the amount of content will last you at least 30 to 45 minutes.  You can't really \"win\" at the game in any sense.  You just get the personal satisfaction of fully understanding what was going down.  \n\nTo the devs, I'd suggest the addition of a time-slider for rewinding and fast forwarding of the scene to a specific point.  Often times, you have to watch the scene unfold from one perspective for a minute or two, then wait a minute or two while you are reversing time back to the start to see the scene from a different perspective.

This to me seems like a futuristic investigation game where you use time controlled features to find clues and figure out a conclusion to your case. The premise is very good for a VR game and being in a 360 degree 3D world just makes it even better. The graphics are a little blurred but look good enough to be enjoyable. The characters look like clay but that is also something that can be over looked right now. I am sure if this does get made into a real game then the devs will work on polishing up the graphics a bit. Try this out. You will surely like the short experience.

His biggest desire throughout the game is to go to the moon, and you have to find someone who\u2019s willing to help you get there. But no one will talk to you, because apparently, the other Lumpos don\u2019t like strangers. None of these guys are happy to see you\u2026 except for one, of course, because otherwise, there\u2019d be no game.\n\nThen starts a chain of events, all of which involve taking a character\u2019s hat in order to talk to other characters. But all of them want you to do favors for them\u2026 because video game logic. The tasks themselves are relatively simple. There\u2019s one in particular that I like. Lanuno wants you to get her wand back from her brother Wizupo. But to get it, you have to do a bunch of gravity-inverting puzzles. They\u2019re not really hard, but I did end up getting bounced around a bunch of times.\n\nThis game is very calm and peaceful. There\u2019s no violence, no enemies, no weapons, and no traps. The only way you can die is by falling out of the bottom of the screen. This game is also very pretty. I like the glow of the moon against the dark blue sky. It\u2019s quite pleasant to look at. And the soundtrack is so relaxing.\n\nI find the controls a little bit strange. Usually, if \u201cX\u201d is to interact with stuff, then \u201cZ\u201d would be the button to jump rather than the spacebar. But whatever.\n\nThere\u2019s this one door in a cave that doesn\u2019t take you anywhere. I know the sign next to it leaves a hint, but I can\u2019t figure out how to make the door work, if it\u2019s supposed to work at all.\n\nThere\u2019s also this one guy who has a flaming hat that he claims makes people hate you. But that guy wasn\u2019t kidding. Seriously, if you wear his hat, not a single one other character likes you one bit. Not even the king will talk to me.\n\nThe king is the last character you have to talk to, and he agrees to help you get to the moon. But you have to set sail for another island for someone else to help you. But this is where things get quite different than what you\u2019d normally expect from a video game. But I don\u2019t wanna spoil it. So I think now\u2019s an appropriate time for me to end my review.\n\nSo far, I have no complaints about this game. You should totally check it out. It may only be an hour and a half long, but it\u2019s got an interesting ending, and it\u2019s also a good game to play if you simply just want to relax.", "timestamp_created": 1489016921, "timestamp_updated": 1489016921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502760", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29779512": {"recommendationid": "29779512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147997217", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486276077}, "language": "english", "review": "Trading hat simulator xD \n\nIf you want to talk with others you must have hat...xD", "timestamp_created": 1486553307, "timestamp_updated": 1486553307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29734360": {"recommendationid": "29734360", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996800920", "num_games_owned": 1048, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486352929}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a perfect game, but a lot of fun.

A stranger to town, he needs to do the other furry NPCs favors to find someone to help him achieve his objective. The first NPC gives you a quest that rewards you with the NPC's own hat upon completion. This hat grants you instant rapport with the next NPC, as clearly if you deserved a hat, you deserve to be trusted. Thus ensues a short (less than an hour) 2D platfomer. There aren't any enemies, just a string of NPC to appease in a linear fashion. It is relaxed, has beautiful art/environment and *really* good music, there are several tracks which is surprising considering the length of the game, and they are all good.\n\nWhile I do recommend this as an easy inoffensive palate cleanser between games, it did leave me slightly unsatisfied. I couldn't shake the feeling that this is more of a prototype than a complete product. It felt like the developer created this setting, mood, good 2D platforming mechanics, and then cut the project short. It doesn't help that almost all the doors you run into in the game are locked, adding  to the feeling that there was something more there that was left incomplete. I would have liked if this had more content: more NPCs, a bigger town, more tasks, etc. Just to give the entire quest some weight.\n\nP.S.: Found it cute that the developer dedicated this game to his two daughters, I hope that one day I am able to dedicate something beautiful like this to my children :)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1483151984, "timestamp_updated": 1483151984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506034", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28556083": {"recommendationid": "28556083", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986952100", "num_games_owned": 596, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482489004}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cute and very short.

Man schl\u00fcpft als Spieler in die Rolle eines kleinen Wesens, dessen gr\u00f6\u00dfter Traum es ist, einmal zum Mond fliegen zu k\u00f6nnen. Da er dies aber nicht allein schaffen kann, ben\u00f6tigt er Hilfe von den Bewohnern einer kleinen, an einen Wald erinnernden Lichtung. Aber da die Bewohner gegen\u00fcber Fremden \u00e4ngstlich sind, muss man ihr Vetrauen gewinnen, um Hilfe zu erhalten. Das tut man, indem man einige kleine Aufgaben f\u00fcr sie erledigt, wie z.B. N\u00fcsse sammeln.  Die ohnehin schon wundersch\u00f6ne Atmosph\u00e4re wird durch den riesigen Mond im Hintergrund noch um Weiten versch\u00f6nert. Au\u00dferdem wird man durch das ganze Abenteuer hinweg von entspannender Musik begleitet.\n\nFazit: Es ist ein sehr gelungenes Spiel, dass man sich durchaus mal genauer ansehen sollte!

Er hat nur einen grossen Traum: Zum Mond zu reisen! Jedoch ben\u00f6tigt er daf\u00fcr die Hilfe anderer. \n\nAuf seinem kleinen Abenteuer begleitet man Kinubo durch eine toll gestaltete [b]Atmosph\u00e4re[/b]. Man befindet sich in einem kleinen Dorf, bestehend aus H\u00e4usern, grossen B\u00e4umen und einer H\u00f6hle. S\u00e4mtliches Spielgeschehen findet in einer herrlichen Nacht statt. Die ganze Zeit ist der Mond sowie funkelnde Sterne im Hintergrund oder Schmetterlinge am Boden sowie viele andere sch\u00f6ne Details zu sehen. Man f\u00fchlt sich wirklich wie in einer wundervollen Sommernacht. Die Dialoge zwischen den Personen sind sehr humorvoll geschrieben und oft wird auch die 4. Wand durchbrochen. Lachen wird man also nicht zu wenig. :D\n\nDie [b]Grafik[/b] ist im gelungenen Retro 16Bit Stil gehalten. \nZusammen mit dem romantischen Ambiente der [b]Musik[/b], welche perfekt zum Spiel passt, erlebt man beim Spielen eine sch\u00f6ne, in sich stimmige Welt. \n\n\nDas [b]Gameplay[/b] ist sehr simpel aufgebaut. Der kleine Kinubo ben\u00f6tigt hilfe, um sein Traum vom Flug zum Mond zu verwirklichen. Die Bewohner des kleinen Dorfes sind jedoch sehr \u00e4ngstlich und skeptisch  Fremden gegen\u00fcber. Kinobu erledigt f\u00fcr sie kleine aufgaben, gewinnt mehr und mehr das Vertrauen der Leute und bekommt als Belohnung ihre H\u00fcte, als Zeichen der Dankbarkeit. \n\nDie \t[b]Steuerung[/b] ist ebenso einfach wie das Gameplay. Links, rechts, Springen und interagieren. Mehr kann Kinubo nicht. Die Ganze f\u00fchlt sich sehr solide an und das Springen ist pr\u00e4zise und nicht schwammig. \n\n[b]Einstellungsm\u00f6glichkeiten[/b] bietet das Spiel f\u00fcr den Umfang Gen\u00fcgend: Audiolautst\u00e4rken, Aufl\u00f6sung als Multiplikator und flexible Steuerung. Kritikpunkt ist, dass die Sprache nur auf Englisch ist. Jedoch ist die Sprache selbst f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger relativ einfach zu verstehen. \n[b]Der Schwierigkeitsgrad[/b] ist eigentlich nicht vorhanden. Es ist ein Spiel f\u00fcrs Zur\u00fccklehnen und Geniessen.\nDie [b]Spielzeit[/b] bel\u00e4uft sich auf 1 bis 2 Stunden.\n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\nMoonlight ist ein sch\u00f6nes kleines 2D Story-Platformer Spiel zum geniessen und entspannen. Mit 1 bis 2 Stunden Spielzeit und einem Preis von momentanen 3 CHF (Euro) ist es jedoch relativ teuer. Hat man jedoch einen Gutschein oder ist es rabattiert, ist es definitiv ein Spiel, welches man sich mal kurz g\u00f6nnen sollte.

Ich bin Kinubo und mein gr\u00f6\u00dfter Wunsch ist es, den Mond besuchen zu k\u00f6nnen. Kannst du mir dabei helfen?[/h1] \n\nDas Spiel mit dem Titel \"Moonlight\" (dt. Mondlicht oder Mondschein) ist anfang 2016 f\u00fcr den PC erschienen, und wurde von nur einen einzigen Mann, namens \"MonkeyMaw\", entwickelt und gepublished!\nVom Genre her wird es in die Kategorie des 2D-Indie-Platformer eingeordnet.\nDer Protagonist im Spiel ist ein kleines, kuschelig aussehendes, m\u00e4nnliches Gesch\u00f6pf, namens \"Kinubo\".\nKinubo's gr\u00f6\u00dfter Wunsch ist es, eines Tages den Mond besuchen zu k\u00f6nnen.\nDoch leider wei\u00df er nicht, wie man zum Mond gelangen kann.\nUnd somit macht er sich in einem fremden Dorf auf die Suche nach jemanden, der ihm bei seinem Vorhaben unterst\u00fctzen k\u00f6nnte.\nIm folgenden Verlauf m\u00f6chte ich gerne n\u00e4her auf meine Wahrnehmungen und Empfindungen eingehen.\nSchon von der ersten Minute an, hat mich das Spiel in seinem Bahn gezogen!\nDie Umgebung wirkt durch das Sehen, und das H\u00f6ren vom Soundtrack, sehr friedvoll, beruhigend und niedlich!\nDie Welt ist auch nicht allzu gro\u00df entwickelt worden, somit habe ich mich also niemals verlaufen, oder f\u00fchlte mich auch nicht erdr\u00fcckt/erschlagen von einer zu gro\u00dfen Spielwelt.\nSelbst die Sprung-, und R\u00e4tselherausforderungen waren alle sehr gut machbar, und nicht zu schwierig.\nDes weiteren f\u00fchlt sich das Springen sehr dynamisch, und nicht schwammig an.\nUnd genau das ist es, was der Entwickler wahrscheinlich damit bewirken wollte.\nEr verfolgt die Intention, dass das Storytelling im Vordergrund steht.\nDer Spieler sollte entspannend und angenehm eine Geschichte miterleben.\nVor allem sind die Dialoge der Charakteren wirklich witzig gestalten worden.\nSomit bleiben selbst die Neben-Charaktere einem im Ged\u00e4chtnis.\nDie Spieldauer betr\u00e4gt ca. 2 bis 3 Stunden.\nHierbei empfehle ich auf jeden Fall, sich f\u00fcr dieses Spiel die 2 Stunden beiseite zu nehmen, und die Geschichte an einem St\u00fcck zu erleben.\nAls ich dieses Spiel gespielt habe, hatte ich keine negativen Eindr\u00fccke empfinden k\u00f6nnen.\n\nZusammenfassend ist also zu sagen, dass \"Moonlight\" ein kurzes, aber recht feines und niedliches Platformer Spiel ist.\nAlle im Spiel vorhandenen Charakteren sind mir, trotz der kurzen Spieldauer, bereits ans Herz gewachsen.\nIch bin froh dar\u00fcber, dass ich auf dieses Spiel gesto\u00dfen bin, da ich einige moralische Werte f\u00fcr mich selbst mitnehmen konnte.\nDeshalb empfehle ich dieses Spiel an jedem weiter, der gerne mehr Wert auf Story, als auf Herausforderungen, legt.\nF\u00fcr den niedrigen Geldbetrag, bekommt man wirklich ein kleines Meisterwerk!

That's alright though, for as silly as the story seems to be, it does grip you quite unexpectedly. \n\nThe design choices are excellent. The art is well thought out and executed for a cute, simple look. The music however, is the thing that makes this game come together. It's relaxing and sets a great mood for the game. Moonlight might just be one of the only games which soundtrack I loved through and through. \n\nAn excellent game. Highly recommended, especially for winding down after a busy day.

However, a friend had me play this and for that I am thankful. This was an incredible experience. While it was a short game, within that time, I felt like I begun to care for these silly little characters. The music was absolutely incredible and truly made the game work. The developer made a good choice in the composer. Also, I felt warm inside from reading the credits. Seeing what inspired this game made even more special. In the end, I felt like I had a good journey and got to know an interesting world. Overall, I would say that this game is worth the purchase.

Moonlight is a very short, yet rewarding game, or so it was to me. It's a story driven platformer with a few light puzzles implemented into it. Once I loaded the game in you are greeted by the calm atmospheric tones of this absolutely beautiful soundtrack that just fits the entire game perfectly. Which brings me to the art style of the game, the art style of the game for me on a personal level is just amazing. I'm a huge fan of 2D/Bit games like these, add a little platforming and I'm sold. But the art style in general is very calming, thought the entire game (except one area) you have the Moon looming over head, always in sight casting it's glow on the \"land\" you walk, the blue over tone fits it all to perfectly and just makes it a calming theme. During your adventure you meet several characters in the village, some you might like at first, others might have to grown on you, but none the less the very short few minutes to spend helping these characters leave a lasting effect in your heart. You really start to feel attached to them and really want to hang around them more, but you must move on in your adventure. I'd like to say as much as I can about the ending without spoiling anything, but to be honest I can't think of anything I could say that wouldn't spoiler it. You'll just have to play it yourself and find out. I paid $4.99 for this game, for what I played and the enjoyment I got from it, I'd pay $10 easy for this game. I strongly recommend picking up and trying Moonlight out for yourself, oh and explore as much as you can, there's little hidden things here and there. \nAll in all, if I was a professional game reviewer I would give Moonlight a 10/10, to be honest I'm sitting here trying to think of some flaws this game has, sure there might be a few things that need fixing, but nothing game changing or anything that will change your experience.\nThanks!", "timestamp_created": 1460321250, "timestamp_updated": 1460321250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500048", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22313520": {"recommendationid": "22313520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044423356", "num_games_owned": 1556, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460184700}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a delightfully charming game. \nIt may be somewhat on the short side, but it is enjoyable the entire way.

Per ovviare a questo problema si metteva a coltivare gli ortaggi pi\u00f9 vari, e una volta raccolto il frutto del suo duro lavoro, organizzava un banchetto per gli altri animali, con il risultato di ingraziarseli tutti e diventare ben accetto. Tralasciando il fatto che fui l'unico in classe a commentare (passando da persona problematica) che il coniglio aveva fatto male, perch\u00e9 l'amicizia era un valore che non si pu\u00f2 comprare con cose cos\u00ec materiali come un paio di ortaggi, mi sembra chiaro che Moonlight - breve platform dalle pretese artistiche - si ispiri a un simile immaginario, scaturito da una mente infantile (fatto confermato nei titoli di coda) e soprattutto adatto a un pubblico infantile. Avete presente The old tree, un puzzle game ftp scaricabile qui su Steam? Entrambi i titoli parlano di un'entit\u00e0 non meglio definibile spinta da un irrefrenabile desiderio verso l'alto, immotivato, magico, magnetico; entrambi puntano sull'avere un'atmosfera unica e ben riconoscibile. E' in questo che Moonlight brilla: lo scenario notturno creato \u00e8 cos\u00ec addolcito, quasi lisciato direi, da una colonna sonora rilassante e struggente, nonch\u00e9 da suoni ambientali fluidi e \"umidi\", che pare denso, palpabile, sicuro. Fa venire in mente nella sua limitatezza un parco giochi vissuto a pieni polmoni, con i sensi acuiti dall'infanzia, e questo va considerato un traguardo eccezionale, dato che riesce a mascherare benissimo una realt\u00e0 in cui la contenutezza \u00e8 solo un'imposizione degli scarsi mezzi. Tuttavia, se The old tree si fermava qui, Moonlight si spinge a creare una cornice, dei personaggi, addirittura un contenuto. Ed \u00e8 questo che risulta profondamente deludente. Ci sono alcune esperienze sempreverdi in ambito videoludico, dei linguaggi universali capaci di essere colti e interpretati in maniera differente a qualsiasi et\u00e0. Nintendo ha fatto di queste un impero. Moonlight invece NON riesce a dire niente al giocatore adulto: la caratterizzazione \u00e8 infatti totalmente rivolta a un immaginario giovanissimo, con battute che sembrano uscite da un'improvvisata storia della buonanotte. Il modo in cui si sfonda la quarta parete \u00e8 brusco e immotivato, non aggiunge profondit\u00e0, sembra solo essere l\u00ec per far vedere che \"si pu\u00f2 fare\" a un audience inesperto; il momento dell'addio non riesce a essere commovente, non al di l\u00e0 del tema di per s\u00e9 che da sempre colpisce particolarmente il bambino: il cambiamento. Quando ormai mi ero convinto a fare la mia parte, e, presa carta e penna, ho iniziato a decifrare il messaggio finale del gioco immaginando con quale serena curiosit\u00e0 questo potesse essere fatto da un figlio insieme ai genitori, sono rimasto letteralmente di sasso: non so se ho interpretato bene, ma non mi sembra veramente una buona idea gettare un velo di angoscia verso la fine di un'esperienza simile. Contenuto a parte, il gameplay \u00e8 abbastanza rifinito e vario, le meccaniche di salto funzionano anche qui \"accennando\" a temi ormai classici del genere (vedi le bolle di Squirreltopia, l'inversione di gravit\u00e0 di VVVVVV) e rimanendo a livello cos\u00ec epidermico che un'analisi approfondita, se possibile, sarebbe ridondante. In definitiva, Moonlight \u00e8 un gioco che si vergogna troppo del suo target, decisamente preadolescenziale. Esattamente come Nihilumbra esclude nettamente dal suo universo di riferimento i non adolescenti, nei temi di Moonlight \u00e8 molto difficile \"entrare\" se si \u00e8 adulti. Tuttavia l'eccellente livello estetico di superficie, aiutato da un po' di sforzo mnemonico di emozioni e pensieri, rende palese a tutti la genuinit\u00e0 del prodotto, un vero e proprio pegno d'amore di un padre verso la sua prole.", "timestamp_created": 1457390612, "timestamp_updated": 1457390840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21655658": {"recommendationid": "21655658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044602606", "num_games_owned": 5348, "num_reviews": 247, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465515002}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute little combat free platformer where you are simply trying to find a way to the moon with the help of a bunch of hat loving little critters.

The tone, artwork and music are all lovely. While short (I beat it in 2 hours), it was a lovely experience.\n\n---- PROS ----\n- Great Artwork\n- Lovely UI, Menus (yes, I notice stuff like that)\n- Good dialogue with the characters\n- Characters that have a lot of charm and personality. I particularly liked the clear emotions of the characters at different parts of the story.\n- Beautiful calm, atmospheric music\n- Simple to understand gameplay (all you do is jump and talk to people...though it gets a *bit* more complicated than that) ~_^\n\n---- CONS ----\n- Short. While lovely, the game can be beaten in about two hours. Know that going in. :)\n- There were a few grammatical errors in the dialogue (I believe the dev said they're working on that, so that's good)\n- I didn't like how the game defaulted to using the directional pad for movement instead of the left analog stick.(I think both should work right away.) Regardless, in the settings I was able to change movement to left analog stick. I still had to use the 'X' button to talk to people instead of the 'A' button (which I prefer), but it wasn't a big deal. I got used to it pretty quickly.\n- This is sort of a nitpick with the trailer, not with the game itself. At over 4 minutes long, I think it shows too much. I mean, 'Moonlight' is not a long game, so as much of it should be preserved for the player to experience. I would think a minute long trailer - maybe a minute and a half showing a variety of gameplay (and nothing past the hot air balloon) - would be cool. Just a thought. ^_^\n\n---- TL; DR ----\n\n'Moonlight' is a calm, atmospheric platformer with a great look, soothing music and interesting characters. While short, it does what it does very well and I look forward to further work from the developer. \n\n---- FINAL GRADE ----\n8 out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1454999955, "timestamp_updated": 1454999955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593800", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21065883": {"recommendationid": "21065883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014909945", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 141, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479100678}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the most *shiniest* gem I've ever seen on steam!\nNote: This is one-time experience (repeating this feels... empty)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1454981443, "timestamp_updated": 1454981443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21060518": {"recommendationid": "21060518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282019228", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454962752}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never really got into steam truth be told, but after watching my girlfriend and her friends playing this game on the tv, I wanted to try it for myself. I created an account just for this game basically. Although I'll get more I'm sure. Now, I could have played her game, but I wanted to really play it through and give my opinion.\n\nI'd like to start with the only con that I can come up with, content. I'm not saying that I didn't get my money worth either! This was definitely worth my money. No, I'm talking about wanting more content. I sincerely wish, that there was more of this world. I wish there were more locations, more characters, more hats, more of these puzzles, and please ... more of this art and atmosphere!\n\nWith the one con out of the way, I can sum up this game's art and atmosphere pretty well with, simply beautiful! I tend to like detailed pixel art, and that isn't the case here. It's rather clean if you will, but there is just something about it. The details are not in the art itself, but more of a combined entity? It's all so very smooth and I don't know, it just makes you really enjoy the enviroment. The trees, especially the big one, is just something else! You can barely tell in some screen shots, but the light on the edges of all the bark is just awesome! The character art is very cute and charming. I do believe a little variation would have been interesting, but it feels hard to complain about it too much.\n\nThe music is phenominal to say the least. There is a media player in the game's menu, or I guess it is called the jukebox. Apparently there are only six tracks, but none of it is repetitive as the tracks are fairly long. It has a unique kind of sound, it's kind of oriental sounding in a way. It might not be something you would listen too outside of this game, but with the game's feel, it works well.\n\nThe story is also not something to be ignored, especially since the game relies on it heavily. The story as a whole is not the game's strongest point though, and without some very key elements, it would be dismissable. The key elements, are the characters telling that story. Each individual character seems to have a very real personality. You cannot help but create voices in your head for these little guys. Obviously Buko for the win, but all the characters seem to matter in their own little ways. The only gripe is that Kinubo, the character you play, has what seems to be a changing personality. He's all over the place some times. However, once I saw the ending, I think I get it. He's the player, he is the culmination of many different types maybe?\n\nI want to wrap this up, but there is one thing I have to finish with, and that is this developer. I emailed him with a few questions about the game, and how many people worked on it etc. With the production level in this game, the art, the lack of any real bugs, I assumed it was a few people at least! It was interesting to find out that he is the only one. His \"type\" is something we need to see more of as well. He is extremely polite, helpful, and he even gave me a few keys for friends!

Everything is cute and light-hearted. This is a very well-made indie game, it flows well -- even my old office desktop computer can handle it.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]: There were mechanics that surprised me at some points, namely the way to jump high. Pressing X & C took some getting used to. There were no points where I got stuck or the game crashed. A+ for that.\n\n[b]Story & Humor[/b]: Good, I like the way you interact with the other characters, it reminded me a little bit of Super Mario Sunshine, one of my favorite childhood games. In the end I think this game goes pretty deep into society but that's just my interpretation, I'd like to think that it does.\n\n[b]Let's Playability[/b]: Super, there were no spaces for me where I couldn't put commentary, it was great to make the characters have different types of voices and personalities, hopefully in a way that you (dev) intended. Thank you for making this game, I had a fun time recording it for my channel.\n\n[b][u]Recommended[/u][/b]? Yes. One of the better indie games that has come out. If you have a Youtube channel and you're looking for something to play for it, this game is a perfect choice especially if you do story-driven or cute games. Otherwise, if you're a (casual) gamer, you'll still enjoy the story and the gameplay a lot.

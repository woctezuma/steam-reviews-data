The graphics are mostly 2D drawings that do not move, though there are some places where this changes quite a bit. Many things on the screen do not drastically stand out from other objects. This is somewhat ironic, because the game is the absolute opposite of typical point-and-click games where the interactive items stand out.\n\nIn fact, nearly everything on the screen can be clicked to generate many different outcomes. Some are traditional, such as text descriptions of items or dialogue with characters. While others may cause weird events to occur, generate sounds or jokes, affect your UI, and so on. The game tends to break the 4th wall quite a lot in its sense of humor and peculiarity. There are really weird creatures to meet, or funny easter eggs for real life or other literature, for instance.\n\nHowever, there is a main plotline to the game that is quite serious, even if a lot of the jokes and oddities might throw you off track. Many people might start off like I did, thinking that the game would just be a silly adventure into weirdness.\n\nAnd while the game indeed keeps its quirkiness throughout the entirety of its time, the dialogue with characters and the storyline of the Fortunate Isles shows a real conflict over life and happiness. The Sea Will Claim Everything is filled with real life issues over government, news/word-of-mouth, work/employment, wealth, murder, philosophical beliefs, identity, and more.\n\nYou may continue to encounter bizarre scenes that make you look at the game as if it is crazy, but if you also focus on many serious encounters in the game, you will realize that there is something quite direct and real about the fantasy world you are visiting.\n\nThe Sea Will Claim Everything grew more interesting as I played it, though I will say that I did not read every single word or humorous scene that I encountered. I heavily focused on the plotline and more serious scenes, though I enjoyed many of the silly easter eggs along the way. The game's description on the Steam page notes \"Walls of text\" and it is very true. If you actually look at every single item description and read every single conversation word-for-word, your play time could be 3 times as much as mine, probably.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the game's art style is mostly 2D without animation, with the exception of a few areas or specific scenes in the game. The art style still stands out as very nice, showing that a lot of work was put into it. There is an extremely large amount of areas to navigate in the game, and none of the exploration or backtracking ever felt boring to me. Part of that is owed to the game's ability to fast travel, and also the fact that  navigating between different areas is almost instantaneous.\n\nMany of the places you explore also have their own distinct music, which further stands out as very interesting. I was taken aback at the number of songs in the game and the fact that many, many of them have a lot of quality work.\n\nThe Sea Will Claim Everything turned out to be an adventure that I unexpectedly loved.

How wrong I was. \n\nThis game has amazing worldbuilding. Despite its somewhat basic graphics, every scene has a lot of interactible elements, most of them rewarding you with strange creatures and items descriptions, puns, or twisted references to real-world things. There are sentient flowers and mushrooms (beware of the communist varieties), weird food and potions, technological plants (the game's UI is apparently made from them, and clicking its various doodads, that might look like they're just for show at first, will actually activate silly effects), and many more. The book titles in particular are great, whether they're referencing classics, fantasy and sci-fi, political and economical essays, videogames (particularly Morrowind, if you've ever played it you probably remember its peculiar literature), made-up authors or Greek writers I've never heard of. There might be a bit too much pseudoscientific stuff (\"Revolving Protonic Chrono-Accumulator\") and fantasy name salad (\"King Xekmurg from Alkhirg\") for my taste, but it's only a minor complaint. It all amounts to some kind of Frankensteinian setting, made of parts that should not work together but actually do. If you've read Harry Potter and wondered how Rowling managed to create an interesting setting while at first it seems she just threw every fantasy clich\u00e9 ever into a soup, you'll get a similar feeling here.\n\nThe scenario is mostly used as a way to discover the world, although it's easy to spot it also delivers a social and political message (read: a left-winged political message, so you might not agree with it if you're leaning towards conservatism), since there are obvious nods to the Greek crisis and the Arab Spring. Despite the characters being mostly quest-givers and quest-receivers, they all have their little stories to tell, their own views on the world, and I ended up deeply caring for them (but it's easy to get hold of my emotions when you put cats and lizards everywhere).\n\nGameplay-wise it's a typical adventure game, click on things, get items, talk to characters, move the story forward. The few puzzles in there aren't particularly complex, or illogical (thankfully), and there's a quest log to keep track of what you need to do. It still has a few surprises in store, like the alchemy system.\n\nWhile at first glance the graphics may look like they were drawn by a five-years-old, they're actually pretty competent in their use of coloring and shading. They give the game a peculiar atmosphere, somewhere between an illustrated book for children and an old PnP RPG manual from the 80s. \n\nThere are other games in the same setting available from [url=http://landsofdream.net/games/]the authors' website[/url]. I haven't played them yet, so I can't say if they're as good as this one, but I'll mention their existence anyway.\n\n+ Excellent worldbuilding\n+ Likeable characters\n+ Great writing\n+ Quirky UI and alchemy mechanic\n+ Many hidden things to find\n\n- Political message might rub you the wrong way\n\n9/10 It presents itself not as a videogame, but as a portal to another world.

Point-and-click adventures, obviously, but also puzzlers, simulators, and even FPSes if you go by the classic line about sniping being a point-and-click adventure where the only puzzle is Use Gun On Head. I bring this up because of all the clicking to be had in the gaming world, The Sea Will Claim Everything might be the most fun I've ever had clicking on things. Not because it's particularly pretty or complex clicking, but because what you get for it is so delightfully rewarding.\n\nTSWCE is posed not as a game, but as a portal into the fanciful Lands of Dream. A fellow by the name of The Mysterious-Druid has grown this techno-organic interface for you so that you can help him solve a few pressing problems in his picturesque realm, namely the foreclosure of his equally techno-organic home, the disappearance of his girlfriend, and the political unrest threatening the Fortunate Isles. Luckily for you this portal functions much like a point-and-click adventure, with static scenes to click around, key phrases to initiate dialog with, items to find, combine, and use, and some other less-useful but plenty interesting features.\n\nIt's a cheeky premise for a game but you can't really appreciate how well it works until you get to that first scene and start clicking things. It's not a particularly strange scene, just a druid in a cave with a bunch of books and boxes and computery-things. But every single thing you click has a different, quirky description. And I mean EVERYTHING, every single book, every single mushroom, every single button, and every single bit of decor has something to say about its philosophy or political alignment or life goal or something equally irreverant. Scenes in this game brim with secrets where the reward is a clever line that's more than likely going to make you chuckle.\n\nThe Room and its sequel have long been my high-water mark for enjoyment just from clicking things, with every single switch and key and object having Blizzard-levels of tactile quality to clicking them. But TSWCE is an entirely new paradigm of clicking enjoyment, where every scene is full of things you just can't wait to click on because you'll be instantly regaled with loads of charm. That's really the key to making a great adventure game, giving players a world that is irresistible to explore, and while others have achieved that through graphics or story, this title does it through masterful writing.\n\nThat's not to say the story isn't a draw here, of course. The creativity and attention to detail that starts you off with a dimensional window in a techno-organic habitat extends fully to the rest of the game. The Fortunate Isles lie in the Lands of Dream, where goat people and elves and talking skulls and philosopher trees live and work side by side. Every one of them is a grounded, realistic character for what they are, fascinating to converse with without ever wearing out their welcomes. As your quest to aid The Mysterious-Druid unfolds you'll find a thread of plot that strongly echoes the hardships of our very real world, held aloft by subversions of myth, challengers of intellect, and some of the best writing to be found in gaming.\n\nIt took me a bit to warm up to the pace and style of this one, but rarely have I been so well-rewarded for sticking it out. Every element of the game is woven together with masterful artistry, from the detailed window that itself is used in puzzles to the random crafting experimentation that rewards you with more charming writing and secrets. You will never run out of discussions and descriptions to revel in, full of clever puns, thoughtful symbolism, and heartwarming plot. The Sea Will Claim Everything is a true treasure, a game of magnificent prose presented as rewards for exploring a rich and colorful world.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Occasionally you will need to find things in the environment and pick them up by clicking them individually. It's not common, and they're usually in your face. The rest of the game is really done through talking to characters and helping them so they can help you. Early on, I felt sort of pressured to click everything so I wouldn't miss anything important or funny.. there were tons of things to interact with. Eventually, after the first area, it's not so bad. There's also a ton of character that you may meet all at once, but the world layout makes it easy to run around quickly.\n\nI really enjoyed the art style; it's cartoony, whimsical and colorful. I thought the music was superb as well, fitting the themes of the areas. The overall feel of the game is extremely calming, but it can feel kind of slow at times.\n\nThe game is best played alone with no distractions, as you do have to keep track of things you need to do. I would generally explore all the new areas before going back and completing the \"quests\", and a couple of times I found myself with too much to remember. There is a quest scroll you can look at that sums up what you have to do, but sometimes it's not descriptive enough... if you forget who you need to talk to, or where they are, you can spend a lot of time \"lost.\" I got pretty far in the game before getting stuck... characters kept talking about a certain person that I was positive I never actually discovered in the world. I only ended up running into them by misclicking the navigation arrows. A couple of other quests seemed vague but didn't stop me up as much.\n\nMy biggest complaint is having to click the navigation arrows to move around. I wish I could use the arrow keys for this, so I wouldn't have to move my mouse around as much. Otherwise, the UI is quirky, but I feel like it added to the feel of the game.\n\nI ended up enjoying the game more as it went on, and I really appreciated the small little details here and there. I don't think this game is for everybody, as there isn't a \"twist\" or anything crazy that happens like most games. It's simply an interactive story most of all, and a social commentary of the world secondly.

I have been a long-time player of adventure games, games with lots of text, interactive fiction, and as such felt very at home inside the \"window\" of the interface. It is possible that not everyone will share this level of comfort, but I'd encourage even such skeptics to consider trying it, or at least trying one of the free Lands of Dream titles. I really do think there is a place in everyone's life for games like this: something slow and thoughtful to savor and ponder.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why I liked this game, and the other reviews on this page do a good job of explaining them, but I will reiterate for emphasis. The music in this game is wonderful and really, really adds a lot to the experience. The tone of the writing ranges from extremely silly to extremely poignant and somehow still feels like a unified whole. The characters you encounter are twenty different varieties of delightful, and I found myself caring about their stories much more than I expected. There's a point near the beginning of the game where (if I recall correctly) you are reading someone's journal to discover a crucial yet mundane piece of information to solve a puzzle. The entries continued on beyond the point when I learned what I needed to, and by the end I was overwhelmed and misty-eyed over this person's story--and they don't even appear anywhere else in the game. That's when I knew I was playing something really special.\n\nSo, I'd say the thing I liked most about this game was the characters. Actually, as I played through the game I started to realize that essentially everything in the game's world is a character. Every rock, every flower, every box, every mushroom. Some of the beings you encounter just talk to you more than others. And this struck me as a very lovely idea: that life is a kind of fractal, that everything has its own story and experiences, that some kind of universality connects even things that seem utterly disconnected. And the game has a great many more ideas.\n\nI am not sure I have anything particularly negative to say about my time playing. There were two places I got stuck: once because I hadn't searched an area exhaustively enough, and once because I forgot about certain capabilities I possessed. But overall the level of frustration was low. \n\nIn summary, I think people who know they like this kind of game will really like it.

Nel farlo, ci avventureremo anche all'esterno, nelle tre isole di cui \u00e8 composto il mondo di gioco, incontrando personaggi bizzarri, risolvendo i loro problemi e scontrandoci nel mentre con i poteri forti che governano da quelle parti.\n\nNonostante l'apparenza soft e fantasy, TSWCE \u00e8 in realt\u00e0 un gioco fortemente caratterizzato da una critica sociale al capitalismo, ai soprusi esercitati da amministrazioni locali corrotte, alla politica ottusa e cieca ai problemi della gente, insomma, avete capito. Ci sono temi molto impegnati, evidentemente molto cari all'autore e ben evidenti nel sottotesto del gioco, ma intelligentemente mascherati dietro una storia tutto sommato semplice e fiabesca. \n\nLa colonna sonora si compone di una manciata di brani orecchiabili che caratterizzano alla perfezione ogni isola, mentre ogni schermata \u00e8 splendidamente disegnata a mano.

The game is *insanely not for everyone* but those who like it will find a lot to love.\n\nThe hand-drawn interface is primitive, but the music and writing have more than enough maturity to make up for it. Its sense of humor tends toward the \"quirky\" side but it usually stays clear enough of forced \"randomness\" to stay endearing. There are some light puzzles but most of the content is experienced by talking with the inhabitants of the Fortunate Isles and carrying about ideas and conversation topics from place to place. Two puzzles that have to be brute-forced telegraph this in advance. Overall, puzzles are fair. \n\nBut it's the story that makes TSWCE worth your stay. As a trans-planar visitor to the Land of Dreams, you find the Fortunate Isles in disarray, shaken by economic turmoil and a rightward-creeping kleptocracy. If you know what that means, you're in the right place. If you don't, TSWCE is loaded with sympathetic characters who make the politics of the Fortunate Isles concrete and real. You'll get more out of it if you know the basic contours of the Greek Debt Crisis, but even if you don't, you'll easily figure out who's on the side of common people and who's lining their pockets off the misery of others. You'll use wild biotechnology and come face to face with creatures of myth and legend as you learn about what can be done to save the Fortunate Isles.\n\nIt's a short game but an absolutely one-of-a-kind experience and if you take your time to read and enjoy this dense heap of words, it will return so much of the love that was clearly put into it.", "timestamp_created": 1483787577, "timestamp_updated": 1484628821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667004", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29046241": {"recommendationid": "29046241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057930620", "num_games_owned": 609, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483656429}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f, \u0447\u0435\u043c-\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f companion of xanth, \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u043b\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044b. \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u043e\u0439. \u0410\u0431\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0432 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043a, \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u041a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0448\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c. \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c pdf \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. :)", "timestamp_created": 1483655260, "timestamp_updated": 1483655260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524193", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29023312": {"recommendationid": "29023312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068844254", "num_games_owned": 954, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483581318}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego que m\u00e1s bien se trata de una novela interactiva, con unos pocos puzzles que requieren cierta interacci\u00f3n. Est\u00e1 magn\u00edficamente escrito y abunda en detalles y referencias, el autor es el guionista de The Talos Principle, un juego que se ha ganado una buena reputaci\u00f3n en un mercado m\u00e1s amplio que el p\u00fablico al que puede llegar The Sea Will Claim Everything.\n\nEl juego est\u00e1 ambientado en la Tierra de los Sue\u00f1os, una ambientaci\u00f3n donde el autor ha dado rienda suelta s sus obsesiones, sus pensamientos, sus ideas y todo tipo de influencias de su vida. Desde los libros que m\u00e1s le han interesado a su ideolog\u00eda pol\u00edtica. Y esto queda muy claro tras jugar a TSWCE, ya que todo el juego es una enorme par\u00e1bola sobre Grecia, la crisis, Europa, los mercados, la Primavera \u00c1rabe y otros conflictos recientes en Oriente Medio; as\u00ed como un manual revolucionario que incita a pensar por s\u00ed mismo, a perseguir cambiar el mundo a mejor, a no cerrar los ojos ante las injusticias y a enfocar de una forma madura que las acciones tienen consecuencias y no debemos temer pasar a la acci\u00f3n en lugar de lamentarnos constantemente.\n Este juego es uno de esos pocos que dejan un buen sabor de poca al terminarlo, un sabor duradero y emocionante, con un final que se extiende durante una larga media hora, opcional, en la que puedes ir despidi\u00e9ndote de todos los personajes que pueblan las Islas Afortunadas. Algo que se echa mucho en falta en una enorme cantidad de t\u00edtulos.\n\n El apartado gr\u00e1fico, si bien tosco, tiene cierto encanto. Ilustraciones hechas a mano por la misma autora, entre lo naif de un cuento infantil y el horrore vacui de las obras m\u00e1s barrocas que se pueden imaginar. Pese a no ser unas buenas ilustraciones, en mi opini\u00f3n, uno no tarda en cogerles el gusto y en verlas de un modo algo adecuado al tono del juego.\n La m\u00fasica es magn\u00edfica y es uno de esos juegos que no he querido cerrar a veces por dejarlo sonar de fondo. Un sobresaliente en este apartado.\n \n Finalmente, sobre el modo de juego en s\u00ed: no conviene coger este juego como un juego tradicional. Se trata de una interfaz tosca donde ir curioseando en los elementos, leyendo una gran cantidad de texto y adentr\u00e1ndose con cierta ayuda de la historia y el tono de las ilustraciones y la m\u00fasica en un mundo de fantas\u00eda donde por una parte se ven ecos de nuestro mundo de una forma muy clara y por otra  sirve como c\u00e1psula de escpae donde evadirse y leer tranquilamente. Si vas a jugar a este juego, hazlo como si leyeses un libro.\n\n Como nota aparte, el autor tiene un blog tem\u00e1tico sobre la Tierra de los Sue\u00f1os, http://landsofdream.net/ que recomiendo visitar si te gusta el juego. Una gran cantidad de historias brillantes, entradas desternillantes y todo tipo de reflexiones en las que anima al lector a ignorar a los padres que se opongan a que sus hijos jueguen a sus juegos, ya que el aspecto puede ser infantil, peor en \u00faltima instancia, el contenido no lo es.\n En esta web se pueden encontrar los dem\u00e1s juegos que ha hecho tem\u00e1ticos sobre este mundo (The Sea Will Claim Everything ser\u00eda en orden el \u00faltimo hasta la fecha, aunque el orden se sit\u00faa de un modo que.. es mejor verlo en la web), muchos de ellos gratuitos.\n\n Finalmente: el juego est\u00e1 totalmente en ingl\u00e9s y no tiene pinta de que vaya a estar disponible nunca en castellano, avisado queda quien est\u00e9 interesado en el tema del idioma.\n\n Pese a lo cutre que pueda parecer, The Sea Will Claim Everything es uno de los juegos m\u00e1s intensos y hermosos a los que he jugado nunca, y cuyo siguiente juego (The Council of Crows, en desarrollo a d\u00eda de hoy) comprar\u00e9 seg\u00fan salga.", "timestamp_created": 1483582441, "timestamp_updated": 1483582441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29010091": {"recommendationid": "29010091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099356013", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483542871}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1][b]Champi\u00f1ones comunistas, camaleones disfrazados de camale\u00f3n y deuda sudeuropea[/b][/h1]\n\nHay veces que hacen falta muy pocos recursos para llegar a la parte m\u00e1s profunda de nuestro interior.

Un juego con unos puzzles muy interesantes pero sobre todo con una narrativa escandalosa, algo muy por encima de lo habitual en el mundo de los videojuegos. Busqu\u00e9 qui\u00e9n hab\u00eda escrito esa barbaridad y apunt\u00e9 el nombre mentalmente. Se me olvid\u00f3 al tiempo, por supuesto.

No, en serio. Esto aparentaba un cuento infantil con una interfaz arcaica y propia de principios de los 90 m\u00e1s que algo rompedor y por encima de lo habitual en el mundo de los videojuegos. A\u00fan as\u00ed, pues bueno, esper\u00e9 la ocasi\u00f3n en que me sobraran unos cuantos euros para hacerme con \u00e9l. Todo para descubrir que estaba en lo cierto: que es un cuento infantil con una interfaz arcaica y propia de principios de los 90. Y, \u00bfsabes qu\u00e9? Que es maravilloso.\n\n[i]\"Sometimes I wonder whether we haven\u2019t accepted too many injustices simply because the sunshine makes us feel good despite our poverty.\"[/i]\n\nEs maravilloso encontrarse con una pieza tan surrealista, plet\u00f3rica de humor y vast\u00edsima en tantos detalles. Busca una ilustraci\u00f3n. M\u00edralo todo bien. Hay muchos libros, como 100 al menos. Pulsa en cada uno de ellos y descubre que todos tienen su t\u00edtulo propio, y es m\u00e1s, que todos ellos son tremendamente divertidos. Oh vaya, aqu\u00ed hay muchos champi\u00f1ones. Unos est\u00e1n formando una familia. Otros est\u00e1n leyendo el Ulises de Joyce, pero la versi\u00f3n le\u00edble, no la otra. Otros est\u00e1n no, espera, estos son camaleones disfrazados de champi\u00f1ones. Otros conspiran contra el gobierno.\n\nContra un gobierno, elegido por el propio pueblo, que ha creado una deuda ileg\u00edtima y que en pos del progreso ahora ahoga al mismo pueblo que lo ha elegido. As\u00ed, sin darte cuenta. De repente, una historia de lo m\u00e1s surrealista va cambiando, como el agua de los r\u00edos, hasta convertirse en algo m\u00e1s, en una imagen real del sur de Europa. Y ese gato que vende pescado en el mercado, ese peque\u00f1o rat\u00f3n que tiene una peque\u00f1a taberna para ratones a las puertas de la taberna para humanos, ese pulpo que da el acceso al faro de la isla desde la que se divisan las costas, as\u00ed de repente, todos ellos cobran una humanidad tan grande que es dolorosa.\n\n[i]\"I\u2019ve been told that I need to change to being a man, because that would be preferable in a guard.

Ese que hace que conectes con tu parte m\u00e1s infantil, esa que tienes cerrada bajo llave no sabes muy bien por qu\u00e9, quiz\u00e1s porque alguien dijo que no est\u00e1 bien para un adulto ser un ni\u00f1o. Y que, desde esa sensaci\u00f3n a infancia, realices un peque\u00f1o viaje astral al mundo de los adultos. Sin perder tu conciencia actual de mayor, pero desde tus ojos de ni\u00f1o. La vida cobra terribles significados, y esas cosas que te parec\u00edan muy alegres ya no te lo parecen tanto. Y no entiendes muy bien qu\u00e9 ha pasado para que los mayores hayamos tomado esas decisiones tan malas. Y haciendo eso, [i]The Sea Will Claim Everything[/i] juega con maestr\u00eda soberbia. En disociar cuerpo y mente, a trav\u00e9s de ilustraciones infantiles y di\u00e1logos hilarantes, en conversaciones sin sentido alguno para que sin esperarlo recibas un duro golpe de realidad y te preguntes, \u00bfc\u00f3mo hemos llegado aqu\u00ed? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 hemos permitido esto?\n\nLa verdad, no s\u00e9 muy bien qu\u00e9 decirte.

I can't really fault this game for being what it is.  But what it is maybe just isn't for me, and that's because I'm me.\n\n[h1]-Story-[/h1]\nThe story of this game is that you-the-player are a guest in the Land of Dreams.  You run around various isles helping the whimsical pseudo-philosophical people with their troubles and trade items around to solve some puzzles.  A lot of people are oppressed by their more serious skeleton governors and an evil skeleton general, and you help them make the bad guys go away.  Its not presented in a childish manner as my description might seem (and by childish I mean overly sanitized), and there's some deep language / concepts being presented... but I think really the problem is that I've grown up.  Its a bit [b]too[/b] abstract and whimsical for me.  I am someone who is very open and self-analytical about his thoughts and feelings, so what's presented in the game feels like an invitation to something I have explored quite well already.  Abstractions about change and the future and identity and hard times and all, I see it and nod my head not in dismissal but in recognition.  Its also the way it goes about it, as I just dont find that insightful figures of speech and deep metaphorical quandaries as useful as directly thinking about the topic in question.  So this might be a very good game for someone who hasn't so thoroughly explored themselves, but not for me.  \"You can always explore yourself more!\" you might say.  And that's probably true for adults who haven't got a good grasp of themselves and their own beliefs (and boy are there a lot of these).  Maybe it sounds arrogant but believe me, I know myself.  I've done that.  So the game just doesn't have that much for me.  All that being said the game wasn't a complete bore or anything as I might seem to be implying.  Some characters had some dialogue that I nodded my head in recognition of and in general I agreed with the tone of the story.\n\nThe other problem is that the game carries the kind of humorous tone that I have never liked.  I don't have a great word for it, but I always call it the 'Hitchhiker's Guide humor.'  Basically, random nonsense descriptions or dialogue added just to be random because nonsense is humorous.  Its not for me.  Saying that an eyeball plant loves to play Borderlands with a character first name 'The' last name 'Mysterious-Druid', or that a drawer is full of water with a family of sardines inside, or a dog that talks like can haz cheezburg, or random dialogue about plants chatting happily or conspiring about something mysterious whatever isn't funny to me.  It never has been, and never will be.\n\n[h1]-Gameplay-[/h1]\nThere's not a whole lot to get in depth with about gameplay.  You talk to NPCs, follow what they ask you about and generally fulfill their requests without much puzzling about.  If there's any gripe its in a few nitpicks of game design for the benefit of the player.  \n\nOne is if you walked away from the game and came back you might end up horribly lost as some NPCs don't repeat dialogue that gives hints and you need a collection of items from them to complete the game.  These are lumped in under one objective (collecting tokens) without more information so the details will be lost on you if you dont keep the game fresh in your mind.  You'd have to talk to a lot of NPCs again to figure out what you were looking for.\n\nAnother is that its possible to miss a few items and not know where to find them.  For example, 'Tremendous toadstool' is one such item.  There's a lot of mushrooms in this game.  Eventually I just stopped clicking on them because they only gave Hitchhiker Humor quotes for doing so, and thus I ended up passing by this item and having to resort to a guide because it didn't ever occur to me that this one which doesn't appear to be exceptional in any way might be an item I needed.  I could see this occurring for someone with other items too, or not thinking to revisit one or another NPC and getting a bit lost, or forgetting how to turn off the screen for the Unspeakable Cave.  Going back to The Mysterious-Druid for a clue might have been useful for the mushroom, I'm not sure if other NPCs give hints for the cave and so on.  I also had to use the guide to find the fireproof gloves as I had somehow missed the safe key needed to acquire them, thinking I had explored the Underhome completely.  Hunting every room all over again would have been a small chore.  Once again, asking The MD would have been helpful here as they would likely know where the key to the safe was.\n\n[h1]-Performance-[/h1]\nSuffice it to say this game will not tax your computer in much any way that I can imagine.  No bugs that I could detect and the game never crashed.  Music was blaringly loud even when set to lowest in game and 1/100 on my headset.  I had to resort to speakers instead.  Playtime is about 2.5 hours, but I got this in a bundle somewhere over a year ago probably for around the price of almost nothing.  I think the length is fair for the game, you could definitely take the game a bit slower.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game is kind of passable, its not meant to impress as much be a visual cue, which is fine.  I've played other games like that which I thoroughly enjoyed, although this game did not greatly grow on me.  The music is okay, not unpleasant to listen to so that's good.\n\n[h1]-Summary-[/h1]\nThis again where I wish I could give more of a neutral recommendation.  I really just don't know what to think of the game.    I would probably say that its okay for others to play it for an introspective angle, but I'm sure a lot of people would be turned off by the graphics and not let themselves get much into the game and the genre (hidden object/p&c) isn't a popular one these days either.  [b]Ultimately, I dont recommend the game even if I don't have a good reason to recommend against it.[/b]  It just wasn't a game for me.\n\nEDIT: Reading the PDF that comes with the game gives some more insight into the thought that went into making the game.  The story being an expression of the personal plights of the developer does make sense.  Those plights arent trivial, and that insight does improve my feelings on the game somewhat, but making a game about a personal story isn't by itself enough.

Firstly, it took me about four hours to complete, more or less doing everything possible, and since it's more of an interactive novel than a game, I doubt you can get much more out of it.\n\nI enjoyed the game, but there is a caveat and that's the completely unsubtle political overtones to the game.

One is called Angela Merkel, or close to it, and there's even a Hitler reference in the game. It ends with the Germans about to declare war on the Greeks because they had the temerity to stand up to German bankers.\n\nIf you think all this sounds fabulous then go right ahead, but if you aren't Greek, or have a more nuanced view of how macroeconomics works, you might think that the authors are maybe being a little bit racist-y.", "timestamp_created": 1480709271, "timestamp_updated": 1480720802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529049", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28123404": {"recommendationid": "28123404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007094560", "num_games_owned": 695, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499176042}, "language": "french", "review": "Parler de ce jeux n'est pour moi pas \u00e9vident puisqu'il est clairement tres engag\u00e9 politiquement et je ne me sens pas vraiment a l'aise pour analyser cette facette du jeu, mais je peux parler du reste de ce que j'ai tant aim\u00e9 dans cette petite p\u00e9pite alors essayons :\n\nPour 10\u20ac, on se retrouve face a un curieux objet videoludique, un Point&Clic enti\u00e8rement en anglais  demandant un bon niveau puisqu'il faudra lire (beaucoup), des graphismes fait mains peu attrayants au d\u00e9part mais qui ont leur charme une fois accept\u00e9s et une dur\u00e9e d'approximativement 5h/6h\n\nPour rentrer plus en d\u00e9tail on peut parler de son interface plutot originale, lancer le jeu correspond a lancer un fenetre vers un autre monde, celui des \"Fortunate Isles\", un monde exotique, plutot satirique et pourtant familier dans ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences et ses enjeux que je vous laisse le plaisir de d\u00e9couvrir. \nCette interface/fenetre permet de communiquer et d'interargir avec les diff\u00e9rents habitants qui sont \"conscients\" que vous n'etes pas de leur monde et qui ont grand besoin d'aide.\n\nSi \"The sea will claim everithing\" suit les codes basiques du point&clic dans son histoire et son gameplay, l'\u00e9criture et les descriptions de ce monde m'ont enchant\u00e9 a chaques instant, on se retrouve a cliquer un peu partout dans le d\u00e9cors pour en d\u00e9couvrir un peu plus sur cet univers.\n\nOn y trouve des champignons (beaucoup) et d'autres curiosit\u00e9s telles que un techno-druide passionn\u00e9 de biologie, un homme arbre philosophe et de nombreuses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences culturelles geek et communistes.\n\n\nPour finir en attendant la prchaine aventure, quelques mot-clef que ce jeu m'inspire :\n\nChampignons, Science, Bienveillance, Partage, Refus, Alchimie, M\u00e9lancolique, Libertaire", "timestamp_created": 1480614091, "timestamp_updated": 1511627752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27920448": {"recommendationid": "27920448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000608288", "num_games_owned": 1867, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480309913}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.  I *LOVE* this game.  It always sounded interesting and quirky, and I never had a clear idea of what it was about; recently I decided to fire it up and take a look.  And I *love* this GAME.  \n\nRight off the bat, I have to say: it's not going to be for everyone.  It's gentle and thoughtful, and there's a lot of reading.  It's a game that wants patience, and we won't need our guns and shields here.  The story is dense and rich and peopled by curious daffy folk: ancient trees, talking animals, dwarves and elves and leprechauns and Greek mythological beings.  They're not drawn from a single universe, they're drawn from many, so our elf in the market greets us \"Mae gevonnen,\" and our Mysterious Druid, from the long-lined Mysterious-Druid family, is more a hippie organic Let-It-Be sort of fellow.  His partner does science experiments with her Quadricorder.   \n\nWe start in the Underhome, five floors and a cellar of tree-like habitat.  We have no idea what's going on, and The Mysterious-Druid isn't much help.  A little, but not much.  Thugs from the Mayor have been over, threatening foreclosure, and they broke some stuff and upset the tree - they even ripped up the rug, which I gather really held the room together.  We'll need to get to the bottom of things, but first we'll need to calm and repair the Underhome enough that it will open the door and let us out into the world. \n\nThere are mushrooms and books and organic machines all over the place - and every mushroom, every book, and every flower in the game has individual text when we click on them.  Every one is a hoot.  The book titles range from real to hilarious to fanciful, with references scattered through fandoms of every sort.  The mushrooms and flowers aspire to this and that, and some are communist.  There are several islands, which we can't visit until we find a compass and a sextant.  The sextant is hard.  We need to break into a tomb, and find the roots of the corruption, and of course tend to the Underhome and its garrulous, helpless residents. \n\nThere's a political message about brutalism and corruption stealing heart and life from the good and various citizens running strong through the game; I gather it specifically alludes to the collapse of the Greek economy within the EU, but these days many of us will find that the details may have changed, but the overall picture has not.  The message, ultimately, is one of wise and weary faith in the decency of time and the resilience of people.  I found it ultimately really beautiful, and this game is my nominee for the \"I'm Not Crying\" category in the new Steam awards.  \n\nSo I'll call it \"quirky,\" but it's so much more than that.  Better to say that it's bursting with personality, that creativity is leaking out at the edges.  It's booky, geeky, lovingly wise creativity, spread though the wild and static characters who live on these islands.  Frankly, I couldn't ever quite put my finger on it, and I was always eager to see what leap of fancy would come next.\n\nFirst run took me about 8.5 hours; I had to go back to catch up on a missing achievement, thus my longer total time spent.", "timestamp_created": 1480313376, "timestamp_updated": 1480313691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27345673": {"recommendationid": "27345673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018578028", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482454363}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the only game I've ever described as beautiful.

There isn't really a clear set of rules that comes through; instead it's a flight of whimsy whose philosophizing is so ever-present that the game fails to hide its true purpose as a delivery system for these ideas.\n\nI really find it a shame that such a gifted writer is so solidly steeped in one philosophy in particular, making references again and again to every communist thinker and writer from the likes of Marx all the way down to China Mieville. It's so much more interesting if the writer isn't so eager to reach his conclusion, instead presenting problems with multiple possible answers and allowing his audience to salt to taste.\n\nBut make no mistake -- this is a message game, and so I must address the message.\n\nKyratzes waxes poetic on the unnaturally destructive nature of debt, on capitalism as destructive force, etc. But the problem is that communists -- including Kyratzes -- again and again attack capitalism for the sins of corporatist mercantilism. Debt is destroying nations from Greece to the US because central banks fix interest rates so as to allow their governments to pay low interest on national debt. But this also drops the price of debt for everybody.\n\nMeanwhile, oligarch kingpins -- the proverbial robber barons of old -- turn from very successful businessmen such as Jeff Bezos in to corrupt plutocrats like Rockefeller (or Jeffrey Immelt, frankly) by using their resources to corrupt the laws, writing new ones to destroy their competition through regulations that benefit them at the expense of other businesses.\n\nThis is not capitalism. This is corporatism and it's mercantilism.\n\nCapitalism must have law as its foundation -- that is, the rules of the game must be the same for all players. This way creativity and innovation is rewarded. We can see this in the video gaming industry. Without publisher gatekeepers a more liquid market has emerged allowing guys like Kyratzes to compete with big developers on merit rather than market buying power.\n\nCapitalism is necessarily tied to republics, because the nature of republics restricts the legal powers of the government, creating enough stability in the law for people to invest their money and start businesses. \n\nOur (the US) republic has been corrupted for many years, the law weakened and co-opted for oligarchs' benefit. This happened by replacing many foundational laws under the banner of direct democracy, or majority rule. The majority is bought with money via media, and the crumbling law allows mercantilist oligarchy to take its place. THIS is the devil that communists point to and eroneously call 'capitalism.'\n\nMeanwhile, Kyratzes' Greece is experiencing the wrath of bond markets looking at a fiscally insolvent country that cannot bail itself out by printing money. Greece is experiencing the effects of european central control, not the effects of capitalism.\n\nCommunism is unworkable for two simple reasons:\n\nFirstly, man is not omniscient. There is no possible way a committee of experts can accurately predict the actual number of boots demanded by a people. The only way this can actually be done is via the price system that market economies use. But a communist system hasn't any prices, and so planners must guess at this, thus creating regular and inefficient shortages and gluts.\n\nSecondly, equal income for all actually means a vast underclass with an extremely small ruling class. This is necessary because somebody has to decide goods production levels for the society, and the man who does this holds absolute power over everything. How many boots should be manufactured? Of course, this man will need a number of political appointee experts to assist him. Thus an extremely small, fabulously wealthy ruling class that decides the fate of everybody else. No income gap is the same as a VAST income gap. And it follows that communism is necessarily ALWAYS tied to oligarchy, because somebody has to make the production decisions. The idea that economic systems and political systems are discreet and separate is plainly absurd. \n\nCommunists like Kyratzes have a fantasy that personal freedom can exist arm in arm with communism, but this is an impossibility. Command and control economies require command and control governments to operate them. A republic under this system is a republic in name only. Representatives bow to the wishes of the heirarchical bureaucratic planners who bring the bill to the legislature, and the planners -- who control the fates of all and thus hold all the power -- ensure that the reps who are elected are those that play ball.\n\nFurther, the idea that personal and economic freedom are separate is again illusory. The freedom to make something and sell it is fundamental to the freedom to speak, to write, to live. The planners in a socialist system can simply remove the appointed job from any dissenters. And private profit -- an alternative way to make a living should one lose his job -- is illegal.\n\nThe simple fact remains that while governments never REALLY care about personal freedoms that don't threaten them -- like the freedom to dance, or the freedom to praise the government -- it is controversial speech and controversial action that must be protected.\n\nUnder a capitalist republic naive intellectuals like Kyratzes are free to promote their wrong-headed thinking, and disseminate their views unimpeded. But in a communist society ideas of liberty and markets see dissenters on the wrong end of a rope.\n\nKyratzes is clearly a brilliantly contemplative person, and I imagine he would present the counter argument as well should he have heard it. But contemporary intellectualism is often an echo chamber, and I doubt that Mr Kyratzes has read F.A. Hayek, or Mises, or Garet Garrett, or he might present both points of view and leave his readers to decide for themselves.\n\nThat said, Kyratzes' brilliant writing makes this game the most pleasant proselytism I can imagine.

Even today, the only consoles in the house are a Wii and a DS Lite, each with just a handful of games. It started with regular visits to Club Penguin and Miniclip, then Nitrome, and, as my desire for innovation grew, Casual Gameplay @ JayisGames. I subscribed to JayisGames on Google Reader (RIP) and once every few weeks, I scrolled through and clicked on everything interesting. This is how I discovered the work of Jonas and Verena Kyratzes.

If I had to pin down what attracted me to those games, I would say \"emotional payoff\" -- these games, unlike most others, gave me an indescribable feeling somehow related to beauty. This feeling would cause me to babble on to my best friend for days about the games, especially The Infinite Ocean, its ambiguous plot quite the exercise for my 13-year-old brain.

I even wrote a story in the comments once to counter him, but I'm afraid to dig that up, haha.\n\nThe Sea Will Claim Everything was the Kyratzes' first paid game, and being that I was a Kid With No Money, it was a several years before I bought and played it.

The graphics are hand-drawn, and charmingly so. The story is well-written, with engaging characters and surprising depth. It's one of those games where you actually care about the people in it. Almost every tiny thing in the world can be clicked on to read a description, and everything is so wonderfully quirky, you actually want to click on every last thing and read the details. There are so many hidden surprises to be found, exploring the world is worth the price alone. (In fact, it's worth trying to click on everything in the game window, as there are several weird and unexpected results.)\n\nBecause everything in the world is detailed in such a wonderful way, it can be easy to overlook how well the simple gameplay suits the genre. In classic adventure games, there are often multiple modes for the mouse cursor, but TSWCE doesn't need a cursor that switches between a hand and an eye and so on -- if you can pick something up, you will. If there is an interaction to be had, it occurs. It allows you to focus on the immersion without worrying that you missed picking something up or turning something on.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the game treats you like a person. This may sound a weird thing, but it's a wonderfully weird game, and one that's worth playing after you've \"beaten\" it and solved the main plotline's problems.\n\nIt really is a special game and a special experience.

It'd probably be easy to dismiss it as 'just an adventure game', merely describing the story or features wouldn't change your mind on that, but it's ultimately more than the sum of its parts and an experience that is both entertaining and thought provoking.\n\nIt's not entirely without flaws, but the faults I have with it are minor, pedantic at best, and don't detract from the overall quality in any significant way. My only real criticism would be that it's somewhat short, although not in a way that the story felt rushed or not long enough, moreso that I just didn't really want it to end.\n\nWhile it may not appeal to everyone, The Sea Will Claim Everything is a game that deserves far more attention and one that more people should try.

There are two roadblocks near the beginning that restrict where you can go, but beyond those, you can do nearly everything in any order you want. There are a lot of objectives to accomplish, which can get overwhelming. Since the explorable area is quite large, it's sometimes difficult to find what you're looking for. The puzzles themselves are easy, so anyone should still be able to finish the game with enough patience.\n\nThe graphics are nice and colorful. You meet several imaginative characters along the way, all of which are well illustrated.

There\u2019s also obscene amounts of flavor text for things such as every book and mushroom in the game. The writing is filled with corny jokes and silliness that while it may not always hit is still really endearing. The game also has a really strong fairy tale/children\u2019s story aesthetic and the music is great too. TSWCE is also a political fable, being very critical of the economic policies that led to the Great Recession of 2008 as well as reactionary ideologies in general. Philosophy is also a major part of TSWCE and the some of the game\u2019s major themes are the dangers of ignorance, greed, and strict adherence to dogma and that one of the most important ways to make the world a better place is for people to be open to change and have an understanding and empathy for the people and world around them. This all done well and a major reason why is because the setting and characters have so much care put into them so that the message doesn\u2019t envelop the narrative and instead works alongside it and they enhance each other.\n\nGameplaywise it\u2019s more of a point and click game, the magic screen is your UI and most puzzles are more simple stuff such as item gathering, talking to people, and exploration.

There is no rush, the game says. Come, sit down, have something to eat. Let\u2019s just talk and watch the world in its endless beauty for a while.\n\n\nIt\u2019s an easy one to pigeonhole: a first-person, fixed-perspective point-and-click adventure game with a heavy emphasis on dialogue and some mechanically light but clever puzzling. Populated by weirdos. Childlike art, lots of words, copious amounts of deliberately groanworthy puns. Moderately long. There we go: the Urizen within us is satisfied.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s more than the description of its moving parts. Perhaps most of all, it\u2019s a game about reading cheerful nonsense while listening to achingly beautiful and soothing music; it\u2019s silly and playful and aware of itself and aware of you. It\u2019s a love letter to Greece as it exists in the imagination. It\u2019s a game about the wonders of the world, about the awe and joy of being alive, at this point in time, in this place, for now and forever. But it\u2019s also a game of profound sadness, the sense that something is ending and the future is uncertain and scary, but even if we one day look back and see that some of the stops along the way were bad, we\u2019ll know the journey has been worth everything we had.\n\nConstantly weaving between hilarity and melancholy and everything in between, wearing both its childish wonder and its world-weariness proudly on its sleeves, but in the end always joyful, even in the face of tragedy, that\u2019s what TSWCE is like. Unhurried, contemplative, happy. A drinking white wine in the sun kind of game: a rare and beautiful animal.\n\nBut also very, very silly.\n\n\nThe game is part of the Lands of Dream cycle, but knowledge of the other stories is not at all required for understanding the plot. You know what, though? If you\u2019re even moderately interested, give [url=http://landsofdream.net/games/the-fabulous-screech/]The Fabulous Screech[/url] a try.

I have not been able to get through a single point and click adventure game as an adult. I find myself easily distracted, and after a long day of work, I have little patience for figuring out puzzles, or reading large block of texts in a video game. But this game, with my Friend, I enjoyed. I found myself sad when there were no more problems to solve or large blocks of text to read  and   the game ended. \n\nOver two weeks, sitting in my room, huddled by the computer, reading the walls of text out loud to each other, we played this game. It has no voice acting, but make no mistake: the characters have voices. We took turns bringing them to life with our voices, and we would try on each other's voices and make new voices. We got pretty Fancy with it.  This review is not about how good our Fancy character voices were, although believe me, the warthogboy outside Darragh's voice was :fire emoji: :fire emoji: :fire emoji: Fancy. \n\nI lied, this review is about how good our character voices were. They were Good. They were so Good. Things got musical too! 10 stars.   \n\nalso good: The music (I downloaded the soundtrack on spotify!), the game's specific sense of humor, the music again, the inventory mouse, and the Truth of the characters and their problems- more than once, my Friend and i would stop reading and mutter something like \"damn... that's some real sh*t right there...yeah.\" \n\nThis game is political, but don't worry- it's the good politics.  \n\nI can't be sure I would have had the patience to play this game on my own, and that's on me and my sh*tty brain, not the game.

In it, you explore the Fortunate Isles in Lands of Dream, a mysterious fantasy land taken over by Lord Urizen. The game revolves around helping the inhabitants of the islands with their problems, all while the game depicts the inevitable problems of authoritarianism and right-wing ideologies.\n\nThis game is a unique gem between point and click games, as it has some very distinct differences. There aren't really any puzzles in this game, it's quite wordy and there is an incredible amount of detail and thought put into the game, as every book in a library, every mushroom in a cave, every small detail has a unique description. Reading everything is quite time-consuming, yet to me it felt very rewarding as there are some brilliant jokes all around.\n\nThe game's story is a very political one, yet it didn't feel forced. Instead of having everything blatantly focus on politics, this game rather choose to place its attention on individual people and their lives. Even though the outlook is grim, there is a strong feeling of community within the various locations in the game. The story, for the most part, is also left in the background, leaving more space for exploration of the world and the characters in it. The small bits of story that appear here and there are brilliant and thought-provoking.\n\nArtistically, this game is unlike anything you can find out there. The writing by Jonas Kyratzes is incredible and manages to present the different points and events of the game in a very natural flow. As for the graphics, everything is hand-drawn by Verena Kyratzes, who manages to give the game a one-of-a-kind presentation, capturing the feeling of Mediterranean lands and culture in a way I hadn't ever seen before. And the soundtrack is done by Chris Christodoulou, an incredibly talented greek musician who you may have heard of from indie titles such as Risk of Rain and Deadbolt.\n\nThis game somehow manages to be as philosophical and political as it is comfy and light-hearted. I have high hopes for this developer's next game, the Council of Crows, and I definitely recommend this game if it seems like your type of deal (though it is very niche).", "timestamp_created": 1519118401, "timestamp_updated": 1519118401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40077157": {"recommendationid": "40077157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135604942", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518564647}, "language": "english", "review": "When I bought this game, I was in the market for a good casual humor/fantasy game, or novel in the style of Brian Jacques (I was searching at both Indigo and Steam).

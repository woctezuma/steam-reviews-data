Had me looking at the walk through several times because I just couldn't figure out what was required. The typewriter clock thing .. just awful. How could anyone figure that out and even after looking at the walk through it was still darn near impossible. Puts me off a replay to be honest which is a shame because it's a great narrative. I found myself floundering for what to do next way too much as well. Sometimes you'd know something had opened but the game doesn't show you where.

You awaken in a room, trapped in a dungeon. You\u2019ll walk down a lot of very long hallways, at a very slow pace, hearing a lot of scary noises. You won\u2019t be able to see far and the ambiance sets the mood of the game well. The game includes a tutorial \u2013 despite it being a fairly simple game to learn, it\u2019s always nice of a developer to include. The lighting is not too harsh as even when your lantern is \u201coff\u201d, it still shows a decent amount around you. As far as creatures, I\u2019ve definitely seen(or tried not to look at) and heard a variety and looking at some screenshots of the game, I imagine there is still quite a bit left to the imagination about what the game will throw at you.\n\nWhen you begin Dreadhalls, you are presented with a screen warning you of fear and images of horror and the game does deliver. An added touch to this horror is the protagonist breathing heavily when something scary is \u201chappening\u201d nearby. Its a good audio clue to know if something might be behind you and accept your fate or run like hell. Playing around the game, I was collecting coins which seemed to pay for \u201criddle clues\u201d about your past and history. It seems there was effort put into lore which I know some gamers do appreciate(like the people who read the codex entries in Mass Effect games vs those who don\u2019t.)\n\nDreadhalls is a game of options also including varying locomotion options and even a gamepad or keyboard and mouse if you prefer. I enjoyed using the locmotion option with the thumbpad to move slowwwwwwlly and it felt natural without any nauseating feelings. The game supports a rotation with the thumbpad also which I have not noticed in a game up until now or just haven\u2019t used it before. It\u2019s nice as you can turn without REALLY turning although I prefer to REALLY turn but it\u2019d be nice for those of you who don\u2019t want to.\n\nOverall, I can recommend Dreadhalls with a warning: It seems like the \u201cmain story\u201d isn\u2019t very long. In about 30 minutes, I had the first two eyes and I was kinda stumbling around(estimated 2/5ths done). Luckily, there is a \u201crandom map generator\u201d which creates maps on the fly that you can attempt. This is a nice rogue-like element added to give the game life. It really depends if you\u2019re ok with a non-story driven/rogue like map to stretch out your playtime further. Dreadhalls could be a good game to introduce others to VR but it might be a little complicated with the menus and controls for a beginner \u2013 it seems more suitable for an experienced VR user.", "timestamp_created": 1510649207, "timestamp_updated": 1510649207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36348292": {"recommendationid": "36348292", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962416583", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509833096}, "language": "english", "review": "Dreadhalls is tense, scary, and it was a game I couldn't imagine really caring about if not in VR.

So you need to walk past with your back turned, which is intense as hell the first time you do it.\n\nI was originally skeptical about this game because I knew it was an Oculus-only non-roomscale game when it first came out, but the roomscale and motion controller support work fine now. The motion controls are very simplistic; just point and click style interaction, but it doesn't matter. The fun in this game is walking around the dungeons in VR and learning how to avoid and run away from the different monsters.\n\n\nI did get a little bored on my first play through after a while, because things got pretty repetitive. I didn't finish it yet because of this. You basically just have to explore different dungeons to find key times that unlock the next dungeons.

What makes one person wet their drawers elicits yawns from another. But this is definitely a game that I think most people will find genuinely scary. \n\nDespite having graphics that look like they were designed for a cellphone (they were), Dreadhalls utilizes several very clever tricks and design elements to create one of the scariest experiences I've ever played. I'm wary of overhyping the scare factor for anyone who might be interested in buying this but I honestly cannot remember the last time a game made me jump or scream and this game has made me do both several times. Best of all, it doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares like several AAA titles I can think of. \n\nThe minute-to-minute gameplay is reminiscent of old school dungeon crawlers only without combat. Instead, be prepared to run. Or sometimes to stand perfectly still. Or maybe avoid looking at the enemy. Oooor don't look away. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. \n\nI don't want to say any more for fear of giving away the surprises but the level of immersion and the feeling of presence this game achieves is top-notch and it deftly avoids the trap many horror games fall into of having the same enemy type repeat over and over. Horror games tend to lose their chill factor once you figure out all the rules that the AI abides by; I still haven't worked out how some of these enemies behave and I'm not itching to have enough encounters with them to do so. \n\n The levels are randomly generated each time you play so you never become too familiar with your surroundings. If you die, you have to go back to the start of the area you're currently in and the map resets. You also have the option of loading up a random map from the main menu, which gives the game a good amount of replayability.

Controls are perfect with FREE LOCOMOTION - no teleporting needed - and the control system itself with Vive controller tracking and room scale support works just lovely.\n\nI have only played for around an hour so far, but already almost sh*t my pants a few times - the jumpscare scenes are great, but the best part is that the game is scary even when nothing is happening for the moment - and that's how a good VR horror game should work. Its all about the atmostphere, sence of presence and immersion in the game. \n\nAll in all, I just love Dreadhalls so far - and I would recommend this to anyone out there with a Vive! Price is low, so its definately a must-buy if you enjoy horror games - and if you dare to play them of course :) \n\nCheers\nSweViver", "timestamp_created": 1489167914, "timestamp_updated": 1489167914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30429419": {"recommendationid": "30429419", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965034307", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492716485}, "language": "english", "review": "just got the game and played for about ten minutes. glad it didnt cost much because im not sure i can bring myself to play it again! scared the hell outta me and ended up running into a wall :'D", "timestamp_created": 1489165268, "timestamp_updated": 1489165268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30424014": {"recommendationid": "30424014", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988533180", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489340922}, "language": "english", "review": "Freshly blazed, 5:30am, alone.

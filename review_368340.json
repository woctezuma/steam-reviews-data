I enjoy the puzzles of this game, the RPG elements, the combat styles, but I absolutely hate the controls on PC. Why does it seem lately all games aren't designed for PC's? The answer is because they aren't. This game needs easier controls, it doesn't make the game more fun when I have to do triple cancel jumps, it just upsets me. As a result in its current state I give this game a 3/10.", "timestamp_created": 1514664950, "timestamp_updated": 1514664950, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score":

Has a surprising amount of platforming for a 2.5D game like this and its impressive that they have made it very fluid and natural.\n- Skill trees are complex with each element (fire, earth, ice etc etc) having its own subtrees.\n- Side quests are super fun and rewarding to say the least.\n\nFor me, the most impressive thing about this game was that i never got bored even for a single minute.

Auch bin ich froh \u00fcber eine deutsche \u00dcbersetung, die scheinbar noch nicht abgeschlossen ist. Manchmal sehe ich auch ein paar Fehler wie das Buchstaben verdreht sind. Das Wort \"nicht\" z.B. ist dann mal \"nicth\" und einige S\u00e4tze sind nicht gramatikalisch korrekt. Einmal habe ich gesehen das wo \"ihm\" stehen sollte \"im\" stand. NPC Dialoge haben oft spontan in Konversation einen Wechsel zu englisch woran man sich erst gew\u00f6hnen muss.\n\nDas Gemeplay ist dann nat\u00fcrlich wie in einem MMO. Das hei\u00dft Quests erledigen um Sachen f\u00fcr den Spielchara zu bekommen. Die Gebiete bieten einiges zu erforschen und es ist ebenfalls gut, dass die Monster nicht permanent im Kampfmodus sind. Da man sich beim Betreten neuer Gebiete definitiv in den Ortschaften neu ausr\u00fcsten soll. W\u00e4hrung bekommt man durch das Besiegen von Monstern oder den Verkauf von erntebaren Materialien und nat\u00fcrlich als Questbelohnung. \n\nBis jetzt habe ich bis nach den ersten gro\u00dfen Dungeon gespielt. Dieser hat mir gut gefallen. Ich mag die Denkaufgaben bei denen die L\u00f6sung zumindest f\u00fcr mich nicht immer offensichtlich war.\nNur der Boss war vielleicht etwas unbalanciert oder ich war hier wirklich schon gut ausger\u00fcstet und gelevelt. Die ersten beiden Phasen waren leicht und in der dritten war ich dann bei den ersten Versuchen durch diese Minenbomben so schnell erledigt worden. Ich wusste im ersten Moment nicht mal was mich getroffen hatte.\n\nAls ich das W\u00fcstengebiet dann erreicht habe war da wieder dieser Questgeber mit seiner Sonde. Auch die Art wie man das neue Gebiet erforscht l\u00e4sst das Spiel in dem Punkt ein wenig formular wirken. Du erreichst ein neues Gebiet erforschst es und versorgst dich durch Aktivit\u00e4ten wie B\u00e4ume und B\u00fcsche looten und Questen mit dem n\u00f6tigen um die Ausr\u00fcstung zu verst\u00e4rken. Das ist so ziemlich was ich vorher auch tat nur die Umgebung und Monster sind anders.\n\nDie angedeutet Offenbarung \u00fcber den Hintergrund von Lea als Spielerin in der MMO Welt fand ich etwas zu schnell abgehandelt. Es war hier mehr wie eine schnelle Erkl\u00e4rung f\u00fcr den Spieler und das Verhalten von Lea hat sich nach dieser Offenbarung nicht ver\u00e4ndert. Man k\u00f6nnte meinen sie w\u00e4re ein wenig ernster danach oder w\u00fcrde irgendeine Ver\u00e4nderung im Verhalten zeigen.\n\nWenn die Avatare aus dieser Matiere bestehen und in der realen Welt existieren \u00f6ffnet das in der Theorie irgendwie die M\u00f6glichkeit, dass der Avatar mit dem tats\u00e4chlichen \"Spieler\" dahinter interagieren k\u00f6nnte. Kommt ganz darauf an wie der Zugang in dem Spiel nach CrossWorlds funktioniert. Also wie die \"Spieler\" die Avatare steuern.  Es muss zumindest einen Grund geben warum das nicht einfach auf Basis einer virtuellen Realit\u00e4t funktionert.\nAm Anfang dachte ich Lea sollte so eine Art k\u00fcnstlicher Intilligenz Prototyp sein und sie m\u00fcsse daher die Sprache und alles lernen. \n\nAch ja \u00fcber die Charaktere. Ich finde man sollte \"Monsieur Grashaar\" zumindest in Bergen zu sehen bekommen, da dieser Level halber nicht zu weit von Lea entfernt gewesen zu sein scheint. (?) Ansonsten w\u00e4re der PVP auch nicht balanciert gewesen. Was ist mit dem passiert? Und der lila Typ aus dem Intro hat scheinbar vollkommen das Interesse verloren. Wo ist der geblieben? Und ich frage mich was es bringt Mitglied dieser Gilde zu sein.\n\nMan sieht schon, dass dieses Spiel mein Interesse sehr geweckt hat. Also:\nAn dem Spiel wird wie ich sehe flei\u00dfig gearbeitet und (ich sch\u00e4tze durch den fr\u00fchen Zugang) ist es auch preislich \u00fcberraschend niedrig.

have ever played. Fast paced, challenging, great world design, great and memorable characters, good humor, great pacing through the game, and what is honestly probably a 5/10 story is presented in an at least 8/10 way.\n\nThe game is a series of dungeon crawls with very elaborate puzzles, similar to Legend of Zelda. As of version 0.9.8, there are 6 (including the beginning tutorial dungeon) which are very creative, challenging, and very impressive. The Zir'vitar Temple is definitely in top 3 best puzzle/action dungeon thingies that I have ever played. \n\nIn between the fantastic dungeons, you experience a much faster-paced MMO. About 3-5 quests between each dungeon, none of them really feel like you've done an inconceivable many amount of times previously, and it's a very expansive and intricate world. There are a lot of NPC's with flavor text to occupy the world, the world itself is surprisingly very pretty (what with it being a pixel art game and all), and it never feels empty. Each area feels very unique, and there are many organic and very impressive selection of neat characters that are just [i]great[/i] to have around. \n\nThe combat is fantastic. Yes, very click heavy and you do not have a history of button-mashing and your index finger is not comfortably swole, then you will become a tired baby person with a sore index finger. It offers a smooth and seamless transition between ranged and melee combat. There is also a dodge and a block, the dodge you will definitely learn to use to its full extent. It also has super moves for Dashing/Melee/Ranged/Guarding abilities, and they're fantastic and look really awesome. VERY fast paced. Very good, very solid, love it. One recommendation that I do have is that you bind a side mouse button or something to be your dedicated melee button, as the default method of switching between ranged and melee attacks can be difficult to keep up with.\n\nAll in all, very good. Satisfies the need for puzzles, adventure, action, and good games. Very great to see such a nice game and that it's still being developed and that the progress for development has been very solid and consistent. Good soundtrack and made in HTML5. Still getting localizations to other languages (most recently Japanese and Korean). Played through it four times and still not bored, albeit with each run spaced out between updates. Easily 9/10 game.

The characters feel like they do have their own reasoning to their actions. Sometimes you meet the same background characters again and again as time progresses, which is really nice if your into wanting to immerse yourself and absorb the lore of the world.\n\nMain character is charming and often provides great comedy relief due to their wide range of expressions. I really enjoy seeing her reactions to the world and it really builds her character up, whether frustration or being smug. Or even the expressive reactions of her companions.\n\n\nIn terms of gameplay mechanics, it can be a bit of a mix of a bullet hell and emphasis on timing, you have several actions available to you and they gain extra depth as you start exploring new combinations and possibilities. You can run around, slash things up close or engage in ranged combat, while guarding against either from foes, as the game puts you into a class in the story's MMO which has strong emphasis on skill and wits to use well.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles in the world and dungeons.

Sometimes it's possible to cheese or find alternate solutions, which can make you feel quite clever or skilled, either because of the mechanics possible or because you have become really adept on

Einfach eins der besten die ich je gespielt habe.\nFangen wir mal an mit mit Contra\n\nContra's: .. keine!\n\nPro's:\n- jeder kann so spielen wie er will im Kampf (es ist f\u00fcr jeden Spieltyp was dabei)\n- Es hat eine richtig gute Story! (noch nicht vollendet da sie noch in Entwicklung ist)\n- Die R\u00e4tsel machen spa\u00df. Von leicht bis schwer ist alles dabei!\n- Die Bossk\u00e4mpfe sind aufregend und gut gestaltet (ist nicht immer einfach nur draufhauen)\n- Vom Aussehen her l\u00e4sst das Spiel jeden Retrogamer/ Pixel-Liebhaber das Herz in die H\u00f6he springen\n- Das Spiel l\u00e4sst sich sehr fl\u00fcssig spielen\n- Es hat keine hohen Anforderungen\n  und vieles mehr..

It is a full game stated 'early access' presumably because some features are still not yet 100% finished (eg localization, language translations, and finishing end-game content), however there is more than a full day's worth of content within! 24 hours+ of content, a fully fleshed out storyline, every detail and graphics done in hand-drawn pixels, and the free demo was first seen on Newgrounds in 2015 and was a hit ever since.\n\nWhile my playtime may look little, as I've only played it online to be able to write a review for it, I've had my eye on this ever since it appeared as a 'free flash game' on Newgrounds back in 2015 (It is still up there for anyone who wonders), a long time before anything about it on steam occurred--it was a hit back then, and I am very happy to see the consistency that stuck carry over until now. Back then, CrossCode was swamped with high rating reviews focused on the effort and detail thrown into it, as all its art is done by hand (by the mouse), inasmuch as everything else (writing, characterization, concept), and all that time in creating this reflects in its quality. One personal sticking factor is its smoothness even on low-end or 'old' computers (like mine); it runs with visuals as smooth as videos running on 1080 HD; videos that struggle to play with stutter or lag at the same quality in many other games of that graphics. This smoothness follows in your playstyle and gameplay too--when you get hit, the responsibility is onto yourself, rather than anything with the controls (although one can blame the bullets because they are speedy too :P). And with these graphics, it avoids the annoying 'garish' levels of 'too much' graphics that would cause eyestrain or irritation after a long while too. The NPCs and characters are similar to many RPGs; some have lines that repeat or are linear to repeat after it gets exhausted, but a difference is they live with the world rather than act as static characters at different times.\n\nThe game comes with subtitles for everything, and even its art has been updated time and time again (from the generic shaded NPC, to a personalized grayscale NPC for more characterization--the developer team didn't need to do that, but they did, and this is the point of quality which drew me back over the years, pining to save up money to buy this when I could.)\n\nThe developers are responsive to the community too, and overall decent people. Aside from that, even at the time of writing this, the game is in 'early access', much of the news has clearly stated the goals and present/future content (although there are gift codes that anyone can get online by search engine, these aren't noticeable with the game unless people search for it), and it is technically a finished product at this point with its potential being unravelled as it goes. This was also a factor way back when all everyone knew about CrossCode was 'flash game on this website'; this attitude of consistency remarks a lot about both this game, and the ones developing it.\n\nThis is pretty much staying within my favorites as far as I'm reading (and having finished as much content as released at the moment), and has filled my nostalgia back to older games where pixels were done piece by piece, and thoughtfulness was placed in the framework of the whole set. And the good thing is, there is still a lot of space for growth.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it, even if it says it is \"Early Access\". It has hours of fun stacked inside it, with a deep story and characterization, also somewhat humoring classic MMO games. Personally--this \"Early Access\" means you get to see it grow.\n\nEdit: Apologies ahead for my English or punctuation!", "timestamp_created": 1511444130, "timestamp_updated": 1512410278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37058590": {"recommendationid": "37058590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347511846", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509553974}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u559c\u6b22\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u683c\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u7d27\u51d1\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1511442927, "timestamp_updated": 1511442927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37053737": {"recommendationid": "37053737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089937150", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509886832}, "language": "english", "review": "A F#cking masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1511442038, "timestamp_updated": 1511442038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37052030": {"recommendationid": "37052030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096975589", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510985453}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u671f\u5f85\u7740\u5b8c\u6574\u7248\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u8fde\u6e38\u620f\u90fd\u4e0d\u6562\u6253\u5f00\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1511441731, "timestamp_updated": 1511441731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37046700": {"recommendationid": "37046700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256210156", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511888225}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Cada actualizaci\u00f3n es mas impresionante que la anterior, que ganas tengo de que este finalmente acabado.

like action, if you like skill trees, if you like immersive worlds with challenging enemies CrossCode if for you.  This game elegantly replicates all of the fast pased hack and slash action of your favorite action RPGs like Tales of Symphonia or Kingdom Hearts and combines it with some of the the patience and que-reading required for Games like Dark Souls; all presented in a gorgeous 16-bit style.  The controls take a little getting used to due to the nontraditional configuration but  feel tight and responsive after a bit of practice.  Level progression as you move from area to area is right up there with Golden Sun.  Enemies are challenging but teach you to use different skills as you get them.  Bosses are pretty difficult and will probably beat you the first time you face them, but it never feels cheap.  It never feel like the game cheated you out of a win.  More like shows you that your skills can improve which just drives you to focus a little harder and be more patient.  You rarely feel underleveled when going to a new area if you fight most of what you come across as you backtrack or explore.  And OMFG is there exploration.  There are enough treasures and pathways between area hidden throughout each land to give you that metroidvania fix!

Try the demo. I can only share the opinion of another review: this game is pure gold, best action adventure I've played in recent years.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n- Very polished gameplay that's even more fun and diverse than the gameplay of great action-adventure SNES-games such as Terranigma, Secret of Mana, Zelda - A Link to the Past, and Illusion of Time. CrossCode presents an example of brilliant gameplay evolution.\n- Art design and animations. Just as polished as the gameplay. \n\n- Personalized, hand-crafted content with great care to detail. CrossCode looks and plays like the developers really wanted to create a great game. From background dialogues to small puzzles in areas you're accustomed to just run through because other games leave them empty, there's creative details in many places.\n- Story and characters. It's not finished yet but what I've seen was a treat. \"Story driven\" isn't just an empty marketing phrase in this case, even the tutorial's been skillfully tied to the plot. Besides, in comparison to the grimdark settings of most current action RPGs (e.g. Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, Dark Souls, Witcher 3, etc.), CrossCode's balanced setting stands out and is refreshing. The devs also did a great job to convey the atmophere of the game's world: NPCs are far more active than in traditional 2D action-rpgs, they run around as if on a mission or lounge around at interesting quest areas, bantering or hinting at hidden objectives or treasure.\n\n- Loot. Somewhat reminds me of Ragnarok Online, where you're encouraged to hunt a specific monster's items, gathering valuables along the way, instead of just digging through loads of random trash loot. Specific items can then be traded for special gear, for example, which adds direction to the experience, even if you should decide to \"grind\".\n- Amount of polish and design in general. For an early access version, a lot of the features seem carefully thought through, adding to a greater whole instead of just adding loose features on top of what's already there.\n\n\n[h1]Cons(tructive criticism):[/h1]\n- Menus seem a bit convoluted (especially \"Trophies\" and \"Synopsis\") as of yet, in contrast to the otherwise very user-friendly and unobstrusive UI.\n- Balancing, pacing of challenges and missions. In the starting area, some optional quests require perfect aiming and timing, e.g. the training with \"Master Sensei\". If or when you finally complete these quests, the other starting missions are too easy.\n- Since the game is so good you wish there was even more great stuff, enemies, and shiny items :)\n- Other than that, I just hope the devs don't burn themselves out and continue to refine this rare gem they've created.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nCrossCode reminds me of the reason and significance of indie game development: the inspiration which led people to create videogames in the first place. On the one hand there's fast-food games built by an industry and built for consumption, on the other hand there's games like CrossCode where creative folks found a way to build on their own experiences, express themselves, and realise their concepts of a great and fun game.

steam. I pirated this game at first, loved it, so I bought it. It's that good. Here's a list of Pros and Cons I can think of so far:\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n-Looks amazing\n-Story-driven\n-Once you get a handle on the controls, you get pretty powerful and can pull off some pretty dope stunts.\n-\u266b[i]Laser Briiiidge[/i]\u266b\n-Fun parkour and puzzles- for the most part, that is\n-You just keep getting new cool things\n-I love how you're a player playing a high-tec game in the future (like SAO sort of)\n-How long it takes you to level is pretty well set\n-Item drops are set so you don't get too over powered gear when you're a rookie\n-Store is based on item drops AND money, so the entire economy isn't just \"grind up money,\" it's also \"grind up legendary trade items\"\n-Unlocks as you level make you feel OP and badass (First Cut Dash Art just feels OP when facing a slower but high HP target)\n-If you like Skill Trees, this is the place for you. You get 1 \"CP\" per level, which you can allocate to different skills, some minor like a permanent 6% increased ATT, and some major like your \"Art Skills.\" You start off with a single skill tree, not too much to look at, but the more you play, the more you unlock, and I [i]promise[/i] you, the unlocks are always great surprises and are very exciting.\n-[spoiler]Once you get your elemental powers, they each have their own amount of CP which is set to what your level currently is. Say, you get fire at level 18, you get 18 credits [i]immediately[/i] into that skill tree which is hella exciting and gives you a whole new set of skills to play with.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n-Some grinding. (It's very possible without the grinding, I'm just a grinder, it's harder without the grind)\n-I can only play this game for 8 hours at a time. I'm used to 9.\n-You don't realize it, but after a while, when you're running around, the screen is slightly choppy, as if it's locked between 30-60fps. I'm not 100% sure about this, but I know that most of the time, when I stop moving for a moment, or a cutscene starts, my eyes notify me how stressful the movement was.\n-It's an \"MMORPG\" that is single player, but has no real MMORPG crafting to it, such as smithing, cooking, alchemy, all sorts that you'd expect when item dropping is so relevent in the game. This is by far the biggest disappointment this game brought to me, being one that usually focuses in Alchemy in these game types, and can see that these systems could be pretty well implemented with the items the game has to offer.. Instead it's more of a \"go gather 4 of these and 2 of these, and you can trade them for a healing potion,\" and I would much rather \"gather 4 of these and 2 of these, and then put them into a cauldron and make my own healing potion, but if I put in 1 of [i][b]THESE[/b][/i], then I'll get a 2% ATT increase for two minutes.\" but sadly, I don't think I could see this being implemented, unless I learn HTML5 and make a mod for it when the game's released. ;-;\n-[url=http://forum.cross-code.com/viewforum.php?f=2&sid=5917effe25806d9f3f332fd560a72c54] Their forums are dead.[/url]\n-Some puzzles just leave you pissed instead of feeling like you achieved something (Bergen Monks)\n-Being Early Access, not every quest you get is complete. One of the FIRST quests you get is incomplete. It's optional, but now it's permanently grafted into the open quests I have, and is impossible to hide. As well as the \"discover the Flora\" quest, where we really don't need to actively see it to remember \"Hit the plants,\" being you learn quicly to, [i]hit the damned plants[/i].\n\n[h1]All in All[/h1]\nIf you're looking for a great game to play which gives you hours upon hours of great fighting/puzzle content and a story which draws you in, then I highly recommend you at least [i]try[/i] this game.

I'm loving the party chat, combat and puzzles so far.\n\nI only have a few complaints thus far:\n\n1.) Pressing the left and right stick down on an Xbox controller marks the previous or next quest for tracking. This causes my tracked quest to change frequently; being able to disable this would be very helpful..\n\n2.) I think they went overkill on tutorials. There's three tutorials which take you through the basics. The first one is on the cargo ship, then you've got the noob dungeon and then you get quests to practice that stuff again. I don't think a game like this needs tutorials at all; the noob dungeon alone would be great and then maybe have tutorials accessible via the menu for those who like or need them.\n\n3.) I'd prefer to be able to jump manually. People love running around and jumping just for the hell of it.\n\nThere are some negative reviews that are based 'solely' on the fact that this game is in Early Access or that it's been in EA for two years and have nothing to do with the game itself, so CrossCode should have an even better rating than it already does (97% positive right now). It doesn't 'matter' how long a game is in EA. What matters is whether or not they are developing a fun, high-quality game; and these developers definitely are. CrossCode is already worth full price.\n\nTL;DR: Recommended, as shown above.\n\nEDIT::\nI just realized there's a built in Language Editor so players can easily point out typos to the devs. In a world where the number of people who care about the English language and not looking like a fool continuously dwindles, this was really nice to see.", "timestamp_created": 1508034351, "timestamp_updated": 1508055712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35734400": {"recommendationid": "35734400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086496750", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509134480}, "language": "english", "review": "it is good game\n", "timestamp_created": 1508033014, "timestamp_updated": 1508033014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35730233": {"recommendationid": "35730233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024161543", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508017365}, "language": "english", "review": "What kind of jerk reviews a game they haven't played?!!!?

specifically, like secret of mana - but the puzzles are more advanced & intricate than anything from that time period. it's... it's just a perfect game for someone with serious 16-bit nostalgia. this is so damn wonderful.\n\n\nedit: i'm a little further into the game now, and a lot of the charm for me comes from it being a single-player game set in an MMORPG, which, for a dork like me who likes MMOs in concept but doesn't want to ever actually deal with another person while playing video games, is, like, the ideal situation. also the level-up system is super cool and i'm enjoying the hell outta it. just... so much about this game is cool and fun and innovative, it's really a great game. \n\nlike, my only complaint would be that a lot of the bosses are just more powerful versions of enemies you've already faced in the previous level, but that's just a pet peeve of mine and not something that reflects on the quality of the game at all. it's super good, man", "timestamp_created": 1507952530, "timestamp_updated": 1508716929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488320", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35704574": {"recommendationid": "35704574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094052019", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "last_played": 1514405829}, "language": "english", "review": "Just wanted to say, I played the demo a year or more back, and was floored by the game. Now I finally got the funds to ACTUALLY support the game. \n\nACTUAL REVIEW -as good, or as bad as I am at it-\n\nGOOD:\n\nThe premise of the story thus far is interesting, though I wish the characters had a bit more depth to their architypes. \n\nThe graphics remind me of Secret of Mana for the SNES with an exceptionally detailed map. \n\nThe game CAN be a bit of a grind, but that can become fun in itself, given the unique combat style.\n\nThe game isn't difficult in an unfair way. I've had much ease with some side missions, while others were frustrating either due to my own mistakes or due to the quest being a \"drop\" based mission. I will say sometimes THAT can be a little annoying, dealing with combos, ranks, and ensuring you have the right variant of enimies, but again that is not by any means unfair.\n\nI love the sound track, from the BGM right down to the sound effects.\n\nBAD: \n\nI know it's been mnetioned before but I think the narrative would be easier to digest if you had some VA talent.\n\nI do wish there was some kind of phsycal changes to your character, through things like equipment, or element being used, or special costume items. \n\nAlso, I do wish we could up the levels of earlier enemies to help the grind along a bit.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nI would reccomend this game to retro, and modern gamers alike. Am I saying this game is for everyone? No. But I would reccommened everyone at least TRIES the demo, cause there is a lil something for a lot of different people. \n\n\n\n\nLooking forward to the fiinished product!\n\n\nUPDATE: With the Choice award around the corner, I nominated this game for the write in category \"Beautiful Blend of Now, and Then\"\n\nWhat do I mean by that? I mean, I feel like this game was ripped right out of the 90's, but somehow also feels like an up-to-date current gen game.

They first give you easy basic ones with one idea, then develops on that idea - evolving into challenging yet very doable puzzles. It's very polished and it's clear they put a lot of care into their puzzles.\n\n    Combat: 5/5\nAside from the feeling I got that melee build is lot more powerful than ranged, it's pretty good. The combination of butter-smooth movement and satisfying hitting sounds make a great combat system. Every enemy has their unique attack you should watch out for, and weakness you can exploit.\n\n    Story: ???/5\nIt's not particularly good, but not bad either so far. I mean, the storyline isn't even released fully in this early acess version. I personally hope they could tone down the \"Ancient\" lores and \"Master Sensei\" vibes a bit.\n\n    Visuals: 4/5\nThe pixel art part is absolutely beautiful. characters, worlds, enemies... the illustrations are bit plain. Their faces are in good balance between being cute and realistic, but the attire designs show the limits of concep artist(Sorry devs!).

Simply traversing the terrain at times can be a puzzle but that's not to imply that its neccesary to do so. \n\nCrosscode also exceeds gameplay wise.

I don't find any of them lacking or too annoying.\n- Contols feel great on keyboard as well as on controller.\n- Has great mechanics. This game mixes slasher with puzzles perfectly. \n- Puzzles are not too difficult to do, although still require some time.\n- Skill tree and the elementals system are great. Every elemantal has its weaknesses and advantages.\n- Graphics look beautifull. Abilities are flashy and cool, locations look very nice and character sprites are good.\n- Demo version.\n\nCons:\n\n- Game is still in progress, and about half of story and locations are not avalible.\n- If you want to get better items, you have to grind quite a lot since precentage of dropping for better items is quite low.\n\n\nOverally, this game is a very good rpg with it's only con being the storyline that's still in progress.

I do feel there is a lot of time and effort spent with this game. The developer definitely has produced a quality game, even in spite of it being Early Access. Lots of content, pretty solid controls, interesting story, and pretty much everything else that has already been said at length. The only thing I could add to this is that unless you like really like puzzle platformers, you might find yourself...wanting...for a more even handed approach. If you like a challenge, this game will definitely challenge you. Echoing what has already been said, you will require a lot of skill to progress in this game. There are certain, quests, where I became almost certain that the developer was a sadist. Cleverly made puzzles and challenge are one thing, and this game does have it. But there are certain side quests that force you through some extremely difficult challenges. If you just want to complete the quest and skip that...you can't. It's built in. For me I would prefer these kindof challenges to be optional in a sense of where I come to them on my own terms when I want to. Not have it tied to a quest that I wanted to finish, and you will never know ahead of time which quests are like this. Because these quests are always multi-stage, and will always have you do some menial task first. So you won't know which ones to put off till later, until after you've done them already. Not saying these quests are impossible, they are completable. However I feel these sorts of challenges should be left out of quests. I've been completing them up to this point, but...for me it just seems out of place. Though I must reiterate this is a personal preference of mine, and is not in any way shape or form, a strike against the game itself. I feel I need to put this here because I know for sure there will be people who will misinterpret what I am saying, and begin with the malicious fanboyism. Yes, this game has fans, and with good reason. But every fanbase has those, how shall we say, vocal components?

Secret of Mana.  Hyper Light Drifter.\nCrossCode is the result of taking the very best mechanics and design philosophies of these three excellent games, and it never feels like an unispired clone of any, never resting on these laurels, for it never completely replicates these games.  \n\nStory: 7.5 ( While they play with tropes, there are still too many )\nThe first noticeable difference when you start playing is the setting / narrative as a whole.  The plot of CrossCode shares almost no similarities to the plot devices of the other games.  That isn't to say it's completely original, which it isn't.  As it draws from the best gameplay mechanics of the three games already mentioned, so to does it draw from, or replicate the best concepts and themes of existing franchises, creating something better in the process, while managing to feel unique regardless of similarities.  \n\nSome might compare it to the .Hack series, but in truth it is more similar to that of the high fantasy series Otherland, novels where people are becoming trapped within it's virtual cyberspace, comatose in the real world. And just like in the Otherland books, CrossCode has a diverse amount of areas, all with important and well-thought out narratives, quests, and characters, each one totally different from the next and never staying on one genre setting, stretching across the fantasy and science fiction genres.  It isn't just a science fiction story and world, and it isn't just fantasy.  It does a great job of balancing the two.  Unfortunately, it still uses tropes that have been repeated ad nauseum in this industry, and that's the anmesiac protaganist.  On the other side of the coin is the developers played with this trope a bit, making your character mute because the code of the MMO she is in isn't working properly with her avatar, causing you to slowly learn phrases over the course of the game.  You get flashes of dreams and visions as you progress throgh the story, but none do a decent job of really hinting at Lea's origins, almost as if the developer cares more the world's story than the character's, but this is only from the perspective of where the story goes to now, as there will be much more to come.\n\nBecause it's Early Access it's hard to judge how compelling the narrative is, or might become.  As it stands now, the areas you do get to explore that are essential to the playable story sequences feel like a patchwork at times, with a lot of dense activity in one area but not much further away it feels completely empty of gameplay of any sort.  Fortunately, in these areas you can easily see where something might be added.  Finally, in regards to the story is the Guild that you join, as well as other factions' quests. To put it simply, the Guild is my favorite part of the story so far, has the most promising of the main narratives, and the amount of quests you can find throughout the world that aren't even connected to the guild but to other factions, and even many that are completely unique, is very impressive, especially considering much more will be added.\n\nGameplay: 8 ( Great Combat Action / Horrible, Micromanagement Economy\n\nThe second thing that helps CrossCode stand apart from the other games, where gameplay is concerned, is the by having a combat system that has more depth than what you would except from a game of its kind.  Within the game-world, Leah is considered a Spheromancer class, which is the jack-of-all-trades.  There are five elements, one being neutral, each with their own skill trees and combat arts that you unlock throughout the game, and then switch back and forth between them.  While every element you use has the same type of combat arts ( Melee, Guard, Ranged, etc ), the skills for each of them changing depending on the mode, so you have a nice degree of flexibility in playstyles.  The four elements you get to use are capable of overheating after a fashion, so it forces you switch between attack styles and keeps you on your toes.  Finally, when you unlock a new element and skill-tree you will discover that you have the same amount of skill points to allocate as you did for the others, so every style will always feel equal and not underpowered.\n\nWhile I applaud the combat and action in general, there are other areas that hinder the game from being truly exceptional.  The first of these issues is the economy and how acquiring gear, items, and materials work.  To be frank, it's obtuse, unintuitive, and downright awful.  It simply becomes a chore of trying to keep track of every material you need to trade for more of another material for more of another, to get a piece of equipment or a certain amount of item.  On top of which you still you need to spend your hard earned money as well.  It makes no sense to have a bartering system where the NPCs charge you for buying items that also require the several different types of materials.  They always require several types of materials, usually multiple of both, and many of these can only be found by trading other materials to vendors at a completely different part of the game-world.  Because materials are the only form of loot, meaning all equipment and items needs to be found via the economy and chests, their is a severe progression problem.\n\nThe gear that you do get after the hassle is actually a highlight, as besides the normal attribute changes, they almost always come with unique passive traits.  A gear might give you a bigger time window for making a perfect guard and counter attack, or make it quicker to aim, move faster, more critical hits, etc.  There are a lot of traits to be discovered, which can make a noticeable impact.  It is just unfortunate the amount of unneccesary backtracking and micromanagement needed to acquire items and equipment.  Even for consumables work in this fashion, where you need two to three types of materials, and typically several of each.  When you discover that some of the consumables, be it defensive gains or strength-based ones, come in three degrees of strength and a few degrees of length, the longest being sixty seconds, you will most likely not go through the hassle of acquiring them or will hardly use them because you will want to hoard them, despite them not being all that important.\n\nYou will acquire AI-controlled teammates which is a great addition to the game, and also a very perplexing one.  This is where, besides the graphics, the game resembles Secret of Mana the most.  You set tactics for your companions and that's all the control you have over them.  Their addition drastically impacts the gameplay for the better, each companion being a specific class and having their own unique abilites.  Which is where it gets perplexing, and in all honesty, disrespectful to the player / consumer.  The game goes to great length to explain six other classes that exist in this MMO game-world only to force the player to be the jack-of-all-trades.  You cannot switch classes at any point and there are not sub-classes.  The closest thing to a subclass is using particular companions, but so far in the game you basically only have two unique class-based companions available to you.  The reason is balancing issues, which is inexcusable when they basically tease you that they are there and you can't play them.  To be fair, it's more disrespectful than ruinous gameplay.\n\nGraphics: 9\nSound: 7\n\nOverall: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1504855077, "timestamp_updated": 1504855077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34809294": {"recommendationid": "34809294", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972855328", "num_games_owned": 398, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511596817}, "language": "english", "review": "Once this game finishes I may have to put it at the top of my fav RPG's pushing down FF6,Crono Triger and FF4.  poor FF4 fallin off my top 3  a sad day indeed.

Since this my first review I'll put it in Lea's (main character) perspective. \"Hi\" :D  \"..Lea\" :) \"...Why\" :/  \"Bye\" :( . Oh oops kinda forgot the speech problem. Ok ok time for a actual review. First a quick one then a more detailed review.\n\nPros:\n1. intriguing story I was hooked just from the demo\n2. Fun battle system\n3. intresting characters\n4. lots of thnigs to look at and do\n5. They don't coddle you and smother you with unneeded tutorials\n\nCons:\n1. Enemies act like they'er some kinda homing device (they can be hard to dodge... or I just stink at playing)\n2. Timed puzzles can get really annoying fast\n3. Quests need variety ( but I know they'er working on that)\n4. They don't have a place where I can see how to execute special moves ( I forget how to use them and can't remeber)\n\nOk that was a little longer then I was expecting, anyway onto the more detailed part.First this game is set in a setting where you can play as an avatar in an other world. Key word \"an other world\" meaning people are able to play on Earth as an avatar that will physically be walking and talking on a distant planet in space some where. Every person starts on a place called the bridge where you go through a tutorial so you know how the game is played. At least everyone is supposed to start there... Any way you first play through a prolog? maybe? kinda thing as a girl named Shizuka. She's trying to get to her brother and has to fight aganist some mysterious guy and his robots. When she finally does get to her brother, she gets there in time to see him.. well I'll let you play that part your self. Any way you wake up as a amnesic girl named Lea, who is at the bottom of this big ship (where first time avatars or avatars in general aren't supposed to be). While you are there a guy named sergey begans to talk to you via some kind of personal link connection that he has set up with Lea. We find out that Lea has speech issues with her avatar and sergey will have to help her with a work around for her speech. After the troubles he'll help you get through a tutorial and later on you meet some of the crew. You are finally let off the ship and put back where all little good avatars should be, a place what they call the playground where all the avatarsa are. You find out that since Lea has lost her memory that maybe if she played the game once again that maybe she'll regain her memory. And thats basically what you have to do the more you play the game the more mute Lea remembers. It gets more intense as she remembers more, and frustrating as Lea trys to get her memories out with the speech problems she has. I'll leave it at that so you can play the game yourself. Its fun and a challenging game. From mystery to puzzles. Its an all around good game. Also thumbs up to the developers who made this game. From playing as a girls perspective who offten sees fan service (girls protrayed as a sex symbol) or trying to make a political purpose/ stand, I find Cross Code does niether. It's just a game where I can play and not have to worry about that junk. Even Lea made the same face as I when one of the quest (bull on fire) ask you to put a bovine down and the man said he knew she'd fell bad about doing it but it had to done. She just made a yeah right face it was funny, anyway I said all that to say Lea is relatable and not some fan service poltical mess. Even though it's EA I can tell you devs will hold to your promise.\nBuy the game people it's worth it. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1504308769, "timestamp_updated": 1504308769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34637695": {"recommendationid": "34637695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186945027", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508943386}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly a great homage the classic SNES days with the distinct 16bit artstyle, great music (specifically Bergen Mine with distinct hints towards games like Dragon Quest 9: Sentinels of the Starry Skies), great combat with a good emphasis on accuracy and movement, along with a colourful cast of characters and an amazing storyline.

This includes bosses, side-bosses, and just general mooks to be cleaned up. There is no difficulty setting either so you can't make the game harder on yourself to counter act this.

A big part of me reacts to this game, I feel so nostalgic that even as I write this and think about CrossCode.. It feels like I'll just go lie down in my bed and play this on my GameBoy afterwards.. It really feels that way and that's why I think PC doesn't feel right.\n\nI guess it's just nostalgia, someone who hasn't played handheld console, at least not these type of games on one...

il est n\u00e9cessaire d'avoir une bonne ma\u00eetrise de son personnage pour vaincre les boss.\n-Les d\u00e9veloppeurs sont tr\u00e8s actifs et les mises \u00e0 jour du jeu sortent assez r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement.\n\nOn notera seulement quelques petits probl\u00e8mes:\n-les effets de profondeurs sont parfois dificiles \u00e0 dicerner (ce qui n'ent\u00e2chera cependant pas votre plaisir de jeu).\n-Le jeu n'est pas en fran\u00e7ais et les textes anglais sont parfois dificiles \u00e0 comprendre.\n-La qu\u00eate principale n'est pas compl\u00e8te.\n\nEn bref, un bon jeu plut\u00f4t original dans ce qu'il propose o\u00f9 vous pourrez facilement passer des dizaines d'heures \u00e0 vous amuser si vous aimez les RPG.", "timestamp_created": 1503132025, "timestamp_updated":

interesting puzzles, a fun combat system, and a varied world within which one finds a very interesting story. \n\nALL OF THE NEGATIVES:\n- The later available sections can suffer from grunt spam (i.e. they throw an overwhelming number of small enemies at you instead of having more varied enemy types)\n- The enemies can sometimes go a bit overboard on the attacks that track you\n- Depth can be a bit tricky sometimes\n- There is one room in the game (only one, mind you) in which the camera is a bit irritating\n- There are a few minor grammatical and spelling mistakes in various places (most of which are to do with singular/plural confusion)\n\nIf it seems like I'm nitpicking, that's because I am; this game is fucking great and, if it looks at all interesting to you, you should buy it as

Give it a shot.\n\nExcellent combat - Mechanically shallow with sparkling visuals typical of the \"beat-em-up\" style. It shines in how fluid it is, the developer's description of \"butter smooth\" does it justice.\n\nEnthralling story - My perception is probably colored with my personal experiences, but the story is really gripping. It has the typical cliches but caters to them well. The front line NPC's feel human, while the unimportant ones (but important enough to be unique) fall into personality archetypes, none of them feel grievously corny. The story is made of several sub plots that exchange time in the spotlight without ever fighting for attention giving it an organic flow tightly linked with progression.\n\nGood music, standard sound effects - The music design is rather good, I won\u2019t be buying a sound track any time soon but it matches environments perfectly and is a joy to listen to. I never felt myself annoyed by its presence and I never found myself forgetting it's even there. The sound effects are fairly bland. Like vanilla icecream, sweet and enjoyable, but sorta meh. It fits very neatly into the world and is everything that should be expected, but it feels as if it fits too well. The sound perfectly matches the 16-Bit love story the devs have crafted, but seems flat in comparison to the more robust effects found in other games. Not good, not bad, just, vanilla.\n\nGraphical Wonderland - The game looks amazing. The sprites and tilesets (assuming their engine uses tilesets, no clue) are bright and flowing. As you play through the game the graphics meld with the game play as the very physics heavy platforming turn minute details into intractable ledges and platforms. Everything about the look of this game is bright and fluffy, it compliments every other aspect from combat to platforming to story. Everything is crisp, intense secret hunting isn\u2019t hindered by muddled obfuscated pathways hidden from view, everything is right there waiting to be seen, the spectacle of it all makes the little things hard to find.\n(The jungle could feel more jungly, it feels like a shady forest atm. I never found myself in an \u201cin the weeds\u201d moment you would expect from a jungle area.)\n\nHARDCORE PARKOUR! (sweet guitar riff!) - Nothing is greater than seeing a chest up on a distant ledge only to realize that it is the reward for a zone wide multistage parkour puzzle. Overboard? Yes. A little aggravating at times? Maybe. Rewarding as all get out? Hellz YEAH! Jumping puzzles fill the overworld as you look and hunt in every nook and cranny for my loot boxes, rare plants to harvest, or hidden caves. The trials are tough, the physics are fair, I am rather bad. I found myself failing time and again trying to get those elusive boxes due to terrible user error not mechanical failure on the game\u2019s part. My only complaint, I also see as a good thing, was the eureka moment when i realized that I could climb up the little edges of these ruined buildings i needed to traverse. Harkening back to the 16-bit era, a half wall used to act like a full wall tile, this game does not function like that. It also does not tell you that and you never run into an occurrence when it\u2019s an issue until you're about halfway through and you run into these ruins. Realizing my massive convoluted round about way of getting to a platform to run along the tops of the ruin walls and get the box I was going for was cut down by about 90% because of a little half wall I could jump up and then run up the destroyed bit of wall next to it was at first rage inducing (I had been working on the problem for about 15 min) but then a big ol AH HA as i started realizing where I could apply this elsewhere.\n\nIn it\u2019s unfinished state I would give this game a 6.5/10\n-This is made with the assumption that the story would fall flat in the end\n-If the story pulls off the finale that it promises and feels like it is building to I would gladly give it a 8.5/10 there is just so much left to do, I hope it pays off.\n", "timestamp_created": 1502679373, "timestamp_updated": 1502679373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34191086": {"recommendationid": "34191086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025864827", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510338891}, "language": "english", "review": "basically every battle/puzzle:\n\"you need me to throw balls at you guys? cause i got all kinds of balls\"\n\"dude you gotta stop charging those balls\"\n\"i can't stop man these balls are on fire!\"", "timestamp_created": 1502543790, "timestamp_updated": 1502543790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34183300": {"recommendationid": "34183300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129123547", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502672422}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game", "timestamp_created": 1502512339, "timestamp_updated": 1502512339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34181665": {"recommendationid": "34181665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059376322", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499201394}, "language": "english", "review": "Even if updates take a while, the devs throw in plenty for you to do in the meantime.\n\nSome of the best game design I've seen in quite a while, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1502505030, "timestamp_updated": 1502505030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34173891": {"recommendationid": "34173891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045401057", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503077113}, "language": "english", "review": "Being the type that doesn't actually write reviews, i couldn't help but make an exception in this case.\n\nFirst serious-ish review. [strike]I guess you could say I got balls.[/strike]\n\n\nAn impressively good game! The pixelated graphics looks very good, and this comes from someone who is not a particular fan of the genre. The RPG feeling is well crafted, having an large range of features including the standard menus equipment, quest, items, and others. What i found interesting is that you can call, when possible, NPCs in your party in order to help with grinding or quests. The maps? So much exploring... as well as returning to previous maps in order to uncover the secrets and other things. The jumping off platforms makes an oddly satisfying, and puzzles are well crafted, making you love and/or hate them. \n\n\nThe combat system is unique and surprisingly intense, featuring a combination of melee and ranged fighting topped off with dashing and blocking. Imagine combining all of them against enemies which don't actually wait for anything when you are engaged. The results are very satisfying once the battle ends. Additionally, you can change between 4 elements during the battle, and adapt the skills to your playstyle.\n\nSoundtrack is great, and definitely helps with the immersion. it has been updated and the new battle theme is bae, as well as other songs being added.\n\nThe storyline is great, and it is best experienced, so I will refrain from talking about it. But damn son, this game managed to keep me hooked non-stop! It draws some parallels with other Anime MMOs however the characters and the overall premise gets more interesting as the game progresses. It is worth noting that the story is incomplete, yet there is plenty of progress to be made as of now. At the time of buying the game, the story ended relatively short from me. After a story update, and long time in exile from this game because i did all that could be done before, it managed to catch me back immediately.\n\nSpeaking of which, the game is indeed in early access and therefore incomplete. After you reach the end of the plot in its current state, you can explore the areas you wish and continue playing like you did before. This means that there are some areas that are available beyond the plot limitations, and if you complete a dungeon before the progress reaches that dungeon, the dungeon would stay complete. At least that's what happened to me.\n\ni am not sure how these fancy steam reviews are supposed to work, but these are my two cents about it. For an incomplete RPG of this type, it managed to pull off (at the time of this review) a good 44.7 hours. Taking time and unnecessarily over-grinding tallyho!\n\nThis is a very very good and polished game, even in its current incomplete state. Buy it. It's offers a great and enjoyable experience at all times, and the updates only improve it as the game goes on. There is a demo ready and waiting if the reviews are not enough, but this game has managed to offer an amazing experience well worth the money. \n\nOne of the only games which managed to make the word 'hi' and sandwiches rather symbolic...", "timestamp_created": 1502475022, "timestamp_updated": 1502475213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633931", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34166433": {"recommendationid": "34166433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034341606", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502447944}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed the early content in CrossCode with a few minor frustrations with the cliff levels and the quest system being pretty barebones, however I found myself enjoying it less and less as the game progressed. The combat was quite enjoyable with a combination of melee and ranged and being able to switch between the options on the fly. However, I found as the game progressed I grew more and more frustrated with the enemies, with a lot of enemies required you to wait for them to use a specific attack in order to actually inflict damage. I found myself straight up avoiding combat in a game where a good chunk is intended to be about combat. \n\nA less significant frustration I had with the game was with the dungeon puzzle design. It's pretty good sometimes, but I found myself figuring out how to do a specific puzzle pretty quickly, but missing the actual action to complete it a couple of times and having to spend more time just going through the motions again. This was mainly in the timed puzzles with things like missing jumps due to icy ground or missing a shot and having to wait a few seconds to retry. A minor sidenote to this was how many puzzles you have to spend a few seconds to line up a shot up, although I can tell that the devs have tried to make this less annoying with the rebound puzzles in particular.\n\nI ended up just giving up on the game partly into Farjo Temple (10-15 hours into the game if you like to complete most of the quests in an area before moving on) just because I found myself playing just because I'd already put in so many hours with several frustrations with the combat and puzzles just piling up into enough of an issue for me to not see the story through to the end and just play something else, which is a real shame because I was really interested in seeing how things panned out and the different town areas (which were really well done and very interesting to walk around in).\n\nOn a positive note, Crosscode has beautiful art and music throughout the portions of the game I played, and the character dialog is well written (I really liked the protagonist interactions in particular). I really enjoyed the towns, and that there were almost always things waiting for you to find if you just spend a little time exploring them. There are also a lot of little details (like party chatter and NPC conversations) scattered around the place that really nail the MMO world setting the game takes place in.\n\nOverall, I have to say give this one a miss unless you think the art, music, and story is good enough that you can look past the issues with the combat later in the game and the other frustrating things scattered throughout

I'm usually a turn-based RPG kind of person, and I generally hate real time combat. However, this game does it so well that even I enjoy the fighting. I love having both melee and ranged attacks, and really like that guarding and dodging are side-by-side \u2013 allowing for various styles of gameplay. The sprite art is gorgeous, the combat is enjoyable, and the areas are overall cleared with skill rather than levels or equipment. Even though I hate parkour (I have very shaky hands), it's manageable, even if the jumping is a bit finicky. Thankfully, there's no real penalty for falling off edges or into water besides losing hp, which regenerates outside of combat anyway. The regenerating feature and most of the fights being player-initiated are my favorite parts. It's so nice being able to go through the main areas without being ambushed. And thank GOD for quick travel. Although CrossCode is gameplay based, the story is interesting as well, and makes it much more worth playing.\n\nOverall, amazing game, even though it's early access. Still more than worth the 20 bucks, and I can't wait until the full game comes out. Even as it is now, it's beyond worth playing. If you want to wait for the full game, that's fine, but you won't be disappointed with it if you buy now.\n\nPros:\n\n- Customizable playstyles\n\n- Challenging but enjoyable combat\n\n- Engaging story\n\n- Great soundtrack\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Some things, like aiming, are difficult to pull off with a controller\n\n- Jumping is a bit finicky\n\n- Unfinished", "timestamp_created": 1501472920, "timestamp_updated": 1501472920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513997", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33908540": {"recommendationid": "33908540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021148462", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503390292}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u592a\u597d\u73a9\u4e86\uff0c\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u80fd\u591f\u79fb\u690d\u5230switch\u4e0a\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1501431955, "timestamp_updated": 1501431955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642853", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1501487281, "developer_response": "\u60a8\u597d\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u6211\u4eec\u4e13\u6ce8\u628aPC\u7248\u672c\u5148\u505a\u597d\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6709Switch\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4f1a\u53ca\u65f6\u901a\u77e5\u5927\u5bb6\u7684\uff0c\u5c4a\u65f6\u656c\u8bf7\u7559\u610f\uff0c\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff01"}, "33903969": {"recommendationid": "33903969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281797768", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507644069}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u73a9\u585e\u5c14\u8fbe,\u4f46\u662f\u6ca1\u6709ns\u3002\u90a3\u4e48\u6211\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u4f60\u8d2d\u4e70\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1501418516, "timestamp_updated": 1501418516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33898616": {"recommendationid": "33898616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219850913", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 321, "last_played": 1514350084}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Linux version 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1501398277, "timestamp_updated": 1501398277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33896915": {"recommendationid": "33896915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038868571", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514153615}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommended!!\n\nWas looking for something with the snes zelda feel... and this game nails that and goes well beyond with unique gameplay, well developed characters, challenging puzzles, beautiful 16 bit art and hours of gameplay.\n\nPros:\n- Nails a unique single player experience by creating a psuedo-mmo where you play with well developed NPCs that have believable personalities.\n- Gameplay mimicks the better action RPGs, but creates many options and circuit system that recreates talent based play that can be changed mid battle.\n- THE BEST early access game as far as content is concerned. The story is a bit behind the dungeon development, but what is in place is seemless and addictive.\n- Some of the more challenging dungeon puzzle rooms that I've played, while still being doable.\n- The audio tracks become more plentiful and better with every release. Have owned this game for some time now and seen every aspect improve exponentially.\n- Armor system becomes unavoidable, as level alone will not allow you to defeat enemies past a certain point. This could be a con, but there are many ways and options for upgrading armor that add to the game, creating a need for strategic spending and weighing of options (Feels like I'm searching for the best option between 3 online shops).\n\nCons (I hate to say anything bad, but it is honest feedback)\n- Certain rooms and challenges that require precise orb slinging seem more catered to mouse play. I had to switch to keyboard and mouse for some areas. This may be because I'm not as adept with a controller, but it feels like getting the precision to nail things with orbs across a room quickly and then get moving is much easier with a mouse and keyboard.\n- I sat here for 30 minutes trying to think of another Con, but there aren't any.

I find the gameplay to be fast pased and the controls (gamepad for me) to be tight which makes for a good skill based game, meaning that you can overcome being underleveled or under equipped by the user playing the game better.  The game maintains throughout a good rate of increasing difficulty in congruence with equipment availability and unlocking more skills that make a real difference in gameplay.  In addition to this, you can use the combination of skills and equipment to really change how you approach battles, so you can play in a way that feels most natural to you.  Dungeon battles, not just bosses, are often challenging and require you to be well versed with your style of play.  Enemies also have a \"break\" state that often require a specific timing or procedure to \"break\" them for a short time, but allow you to do a significanly higher amout of damage making battles much easier versus brute forcing your way though them.  This creates diverse and engaging combat, especially when there are multiple types of enemies you're fighing at the same time.\n\nDungeon puzzles start off easy, but late in the game become quite difficult at times, but not impossible, and rewarding when you're able to figure them out.  Where puzzles in many games fail to nail the right level of challenge, this game succeeds.  Many of the late game puzzles are beyond brilliant when you consider how many levels there are to the puzzle yet managing to cram all of those levels into a concise space where many environmental features double or triple in their usage.  I would honestly like to shake then hands of the people who created them.  There are always subtle environmental elements that lead you in the right direction or give you just enough of a hint to figure out what you're supposed to be doing.  I cannot praise this enough as most games focus on creating an environment purely for the sake of immersion and fail to make the best use of the space available to them to enhance the manner in which the player interacts with the game.\n\nPlatforming is smooth and jumping is automatic thereby removing jumping fustrations common in many platorming games.  The one exception to this is the rare occasion when you can't tell exactly the height of a platform even after throwing a ball at it making it difficult to judge if you can make the jump to it.  Finding treasure boxes in the world by figuring out the often complex jumping path to get there makes for a great change of pace, though the rewards for doing so are often lackluster.\n\nIf you choose to do all the sidequests available to you, you don't need much grinding, if any at all, to keep up in level to where the game has been designed for you to be.  If however you are the type to focus on the storyline and skip a lot of sidequests, grinding will likely be needed on a continual basis depending on how skilled you are at overcoming the power gap.  Also, for those who are less patient when getting into a new game, the \"tutorial-ish\" section (tutorial + practice dungeon) is just a bit long (about 3 hours) before the game begins to open up.\n\nI feel the graphics, sound effects, and music are all well above average for what it's trying to be; you can easily check them out for yourself above.  But if you don't like them, you don't like them, I'm not going to argue that you should.\n\nAt the time of writing this, the story has not been finished, but so far, to me, the story is kind of meh as it uses a slightly overused plot, especially so if you've watched mmo based animes.  However, each of the main characters provides a unique and interesting personality which is engaging in its own right and contributes to a game that succeeds in creating an immersive experience.\n\nThe amount of content in the game is good for probably 25 hours up to 50 depending on how good you are and how you decide to play it and the game isn't even finished yet.  It has a fair number of completionist elements, but has little replayability.  I really wish the game would offer online co-op as it is tailor made for it, but it doesn't sound like that will ever be an available feature.\n\nFor me (someone who has played video games most of my life), the level of challenge in battle and puzzles are perfect, but may be too difficult for others.  This is what I wish most of the 2D Zelda games were (apart from storyline/lore).\nOne of my favorite games ever.", "timestamp_created": 1501254566, "timestamp_updated": 1501254893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33809433": {"recommendationid": "33809433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006572187", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501120226}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u521d\u611f\u5b98\uff1a\u50cf\u6781\u4e86.hack \u7684\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\uff0c\u6253\u51fb\u611f\u6781\u5f3a\u3002\u5267\u60c5\u76ee\u524d\u770b\u6765\u5e94\u8be5\u4e0d\u9519\u3002\u539f\u4ef7\u5165\u4e0d\u4e8f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1501078421, "timestamp_updated": 1501078421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33798444": {"recommendationid": "33798444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330957103", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504331354}, "language": "english", "review": "This is just plain amazing and I love it! <3", "timestamp_created": 1501031664, "timestamp_updated": 1501031664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33795752": {"recommendationid": "33795752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367739791", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508864490}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "FODA DEMAIS JOGA A\u00cd QUE VOC\u00ca N\u00c3O VAI SE ARREPENDER", "timestamp_created": 1501019370, "timestamp_updated": 1501019370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33795701": {"recommendationid": "33795701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116517782", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513379866}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "bom jogo otima mecanica s\u00f3 falta historia mesmo que ta em progresso", "timestamp_created": 1501019203, "timestamp_updated": 1501019203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33780252": {"recommendationid": "33780252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242164446", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501386677}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Jogo excelente!\n\nArtwork sensacional, sistema de combate divertido e variado, com elementos de RPG e action adventure.

Is that allowed? Yeah? Well, it is. I first got this game midway through its early access stages in 2016 and it's still in early alpha to date. Don't let that detract you from buying it. Never have I seen such a genuinely engaging and involved plot, such seemingly simple combat but with hours of simply managing your skills and playstyle to explore. The first third or so of this game that's currently completed is worth much more than the $20 steal price, even with its holes and bugs. This isn't just a rare gem of a game, this is the freakin' Triforce of indie RPGs. If you have ever played an RPG, ever, at all... you need this game. Right now.

Everything from the combat system to the visuals and music are well put together, impressively so.\nThe biggest con is the sheer fact that the game is incomplete, hardly something you can fault the developers for. I greatly look forward to the completed product.\n\n[h1]Slightly longer[/h1]\nThe developers have delivered an extremely polished experience, even if half the story is still missing (I'm guessing, we don't know where the story is going :D)\n\nThe combat system is challenging but visually clear. Openings and attacks are telegraphed but timings and damage numbers can have you sitting at the edge of your seat.\nPersonally, I found the game very challenging, but this is also something I'm personally drawn to. Your own experiences may vary.\n\nThere seems to be quite a bit of depth to how you approach your character's skill development and usage in combat encounters. Most encounters, however annoying, will have a weak spot you can exploit to push the fight in your favour.\n\nVisually and aesthetically, I felt the game reminded me a lot of the Mega Man Battle Network series. The setting of an MMORPG gives a sense of life to the game, as other characters will always be running around you, doing their own quests and having their own adventures. It's simple, but gives the world a sense of being much larger than yourself.\nA lesser gripe might be the fact that changes in equipment aren't visually represented in the game (so much so that an NPC comments on this fact during the storyline). Conversely, it doubles down on establishing a dverse set of main characters, colour scheme, contour, and all.\n\nThe worst element within the game strikes me as the equipment system. Despite the developer's efforts to make this part of the game more approachable, I still can't get my head around matching a character's level to appropriate equipment. In the end, I ended up slapping on the pieces that gave the biggest boost to the stats I wanted to work with. It's a shame,\n\nIn essence, despite a few gaps in the system, CrossCode delivers a beautiful and polished experienced, even at this point of development. If you're a fan of twitch-heavy combat, high difficulty and an anime-inspired art style and storyline, [b]I highly recommend this game[/b].", "timestamp_created": 1500449948, "timestamp_updated": 1500449965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33646294": {"recommendationid": "33646294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059462552", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1513738965}, "language": "english", "review": "It's one thing to draw on the past, and another to actually make history.", "timestamp_created": 1500449408, "timestamp_updated": 1500449408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580686", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33637351": {"recommendationid": "33637351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352794255", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511913922}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8dea\u6c42\u4e91\u5b58\u6863\u554a\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\u6bcf\u6b21\u6362\u53f0\u673a\u5b50\u73a9\u90fd\u8981\u62f7\u8d1d\u5b58\u6863\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u9ebb\u70e6\u3002\n\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u597d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u7684\u89e3\u5bc6\u90fd\u522b\u5177\u5320\u5fc3\uff0c\u4e00\u73af\u6263\u4e00\u73af\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u4ee5\u524d\u73a9GAMEBOY\u89e3\u5bc6\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u3002\n\u4f46\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u7ebf\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u505a\u5b8c\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u65b9\u9762\u5c31\u6709\u70b9\u4e91\u91cc\u96fe\u91cc\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u5e0c\u671b\u4f5c\u8005\u80fd\u5c3d\u5feb\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1500408856, "timestamp_updated": 1500408856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503147", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33633693": {"recommendationid": "33633693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119357682", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513466101}, "language": "german", "review": "Nachdem ich jetzt den ersten Dungeon (und einige Nebenmissionen) abgeschlossen habe, verfasse ich nun eine kurze Review.\nAls erstes m\u00f6chte ich sagen, dass Early Access in diesem falle wirklich, wirklich gut funktioniert.

And while I've only just made it to the first \"real dungeon,\" I have a lot I can say about it. Keep in mind this is still in early access so all of this is subject to change.\n\n[h1]First the good:[/h1]\n \n[olist]\n[*][b]The art style is beautiful.[/b] It captures that retro feeling while having some of the best sprite art I've ever seen. You can feel real emotion in the dialogue sections, even if your main character can only nod and say her name. The detail in the world is great. I love how little sections of the world disappear to reveal passageways and secrets.\n\n[*][b]The combat.[/b] The combat is fairly difficult, and at times feels a little overwhelming, especially when dealing with multiple enemies, but never unfair. I really enjoy the break system to counter really powerful attacks. I love how fluid the combat feels. Transitioning from ranged attacks to melee is smooth and simple. Dodging feels natural, and pulling over cool tricks with the arts system (I think that's what it's called?) is amazing. I also really enjoy how you can switch between the branching talents at any time for no cost. Additionally, while some stats may seem a little vague, there's an extensive help screen that extensively explains anything you click on in a menu, which I find really helpful.\n\n[*][b]The puzzles.[/b] From the dungeons to the little puzzles hidden throughout the zones, each one feels fair and fun to complete. Probably my favorite puzzle so far was the little monk quest right before the first dungeon, which was a test of your shooting and blocking abilities. I especially like the little jumping puzzles you need to complete in order to get to certain areas of the map. While I'll talk about some of the pitfalls (hehe) of the jumping system later, finding your way through the map feels great. \n\n[*][b]The feel of the game in general.[/b] It feels like you're playing an MMO, which is fantastic. The characters you meet feel real and talk about the game itself without making it seem too forced and game-y, if that makes sense. The flow from quest to quest feels great, even if some of the quests are a little boring, but that might be because I'm still in the second zone. I think having a game that feels like you're actually playing an MMO is one of this game's biggest strengths.\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]And now for some of the bad stuff[/h1]\n\n[olist]\n[*][b]Jumping.[/b] I'd say the jumping system is about 80% good at the time of this review. Some jumps can be difficult to judge. There have been countless times where I thought I'd definitely be able to make a jump only to have it actually be slightly too high, where it looked like it'd be the same layer. I think a good idea for the devs would be to add a toggle-able layer in-game that shows what height you're on and what else is at that current height.\n\n[*][b]The tutorial.[/b] The opening section of the game can really drag on a bit. I think you get to the first real open section about 3 hours in? The tutorial is packed with story and guidance, though I can see why this might turn some people away.\n\n[*][b]Some UI elements.[/b] When you have a quest tracked on the main screen it can obscure your vision of that area. There's no way to resize it or change it's opacity as far as I know. Also the way the stats menu is set up sometimes makes me think the value is for the stat that isn't directly across, but one below that. That's entirely due to the design of the menu and I would like this changed to avoid further confusion.\n[/olist]\n\nOverall, I think CrossCode is a fantastic game despite its few minor flaws.

Hier sind die Spieler eng mit allen Sinnen ihrer Avatare verbunden und haben die Aufgabe, dem \"Pfad der Urv\u00e4ter\" zu folgen. So erinnert das ganze ein wenig an Sword Art Online.\n\n[b]Zur Story:[/b]\nVorab, ich habe die Story bei weitem noch nicht durchgespielt und befinde mich noch relativ weit am Anfang. Doch bereits hier war ich bereits von Anfang an gefangen! Die Charaktere sind sympathisch und der Dialog ist exzellent geschrieben.\nIn diesem Spiel, spielt man als Lea, einem Avatar. Lea hat ihr Ged\u00e4chtnis verloren und kann au\u00dferdem, aufgrund einer Fehlfunktion ihres Sprachmoduls nicht mehr sprechen. Man glaubt, dass man ihr Ged\u00e4chtnis wieder herstellen kann, wenn sie CrossWorlds spielt und so beginnt die Reise.\nVielmehr m\u00f6chte ich garnicht verraten, aber ich kann best\u00e4tigen, dass die Story es wert ist gespielt zu werden.\n\n[b]Zum Gameplay:[/b]\nDas Spiel kann man mit Maus und Tastatur oder mit Gamepad spielen, jedoch bevorzuge ich das Gamepad, obwohl auch die Maus und Tastatur Steuerung sehr gut funktioniert. Das Spiel hat ein [b]Echtzeit, Action Kampfsystem[/b] und man kombiniert Ranged und Melee Angriffe und seine Skills um seine Gegner Stilvoll zu bezwingen.\nDa hier ein Spiel in einem Spiel simuliert wird, hat man viele [b]Elemente aus MMORPGs[/b]. Jedoch ist der MMO Teil nicht echt ;). Alle anderen Spieler sind NPCs und dienen dazu die Atmosph\u00e4re eines MMOs aufzubauen. RPG Elemente gibt es jedoch genug, wie etwa neue Skills, Buffs, Perks, Ausr\u00fcstung, etc. Zuletzt ist meiner Ansicht nach die Balance zwischen Haupt- und Nebenquests sehr gut gelungen.\n\n[b]Zum Sound:[/b]\nDie Musik ist sehr angenehm und die Soundeffekte sind gelungen, jedoch nicht herausragend.\n\n[b]Zur Grafik:[/b]\nDas Spiel hat einen [b]gro\u00dfartigen Artstyle[/b], der dem Spiel so eine besondere Atmosph\u00e4re verleit. Weiterhin sind die Charakter-Portraits auch sehr gelungen und sehen super aus. Auch wenn man mit Art dieser Art nicht so viel anfangen kann, lohnt es sich dem Spiel eine Chance zu geben.\n\n[b]Fazit:[/b]\nDas Spiel sieht super aus, das Gameplay macht Spa\u00df und der Sound ist gut!

Knowing nothing about her past she is thrust into an adventure of discovering what events have lead to her current situation.  Although a common cliche of RPG's the silent protagonist is pulled off in a unique and amusing way and later dialogue choices are unlocked.  The characters you meet are decently written and the dialogue does a good job entertaining and telling the story.  I just finished the first major dungeon and I can't believe I have almost 15 hours logged (and this just unlocked the first of 4 skill trees!).\n\nThe pacing is moderate.  A more experienced action RPG enthusiast looking for a steep challenge can rush through the areas with what equipment is available or you can digest the areas and take time to appreciate the out of the way treasures tucked all over.  The game keeps track of your treasure completion rates and even after sinking 4 hours into the \"mine\" dungeon I'm still missing 2 chests... how is this possible... what trickery is this!???... \nNeedless to say for a completionist this game will keep you busy and it does a good job teasing your brain with many solutions requiring planning out from several maps away or looking at puzzles in a different light.\n\nThe quests are decent.  Some of the dialogue is charming, for example one quest sends you on an information gathering mission... which proves difficult with your mute characteristic.  Several spirtes for your portrait are in the game and you can watch your characters frustration grow with your own.  Overall the quests add some meat and lighten the mood while providing useful items to advance the main story.\n\nThe sound in the game is decent.  It doesn't elicit any strong emotions, but it's enjoyable enough that I can listen to it while trying to hunt down all of those chests without getting annoyed by it.\n\nControls are suprisingly natural.  I played with a mouse and keyboard setup which seemed to work well.  Aiming with the mouse for projectiles was particularly satisfying since I knew exactly where my shots would land right away.\n\nCombat is fairly challenging.  Even with an average gear level and a good level many fights proved extra challenging and make sure that I'm not dozing away while hacking aimlessly.  Many enemies have weakenesses that can be exploited such as returned projectiles.  The character has a progression tree that allows them to focus on defense, dodging, ranged, or close quarters combat.  These trees expand when the elements are obtained.  This feature isn't fully complete at this time but already adds a good level of customization that lets you feel the effects during combat, sometimes by modifying an attack or adding a perk (regeneration!)\n\nExploration: There is a platforming element with many objectives that require timed and precise jumps and there are time attack courses.  The puzzles also take some thinking through and feeling your way through them unlocks items so that you feel rewarded for your time investment.\n\nI feel like that is a ton more I could say but this has already dragged on long enough.  For a small development team this project is polished and enjoyable.  The game plays well and is challenging.  Reccomend it to everyone except for those that have a hard time with moderately difficult games as even with gear stacking there are some areas that will take skill to beat without being crushed by frustration.

You have to be prepared to grind like an MMO to make progress, particularly since most equipment of value needs to be crafted from those rare drop materials.\n\n2. This is a parkour game. Chests need to be jumped to. Crossing many maps means jumps. Even the second city is one big maze of multi-level jumps. Quests have you jumping to hard-to-reach platforms.

I have to say that I am more than satisfied with my purchase even though the game won't be finished until next year.\n\nThe story is very engaging - you are playing as a person who is, themselves, playing an MMO in the distant future. You've also lost your memory, which while a bit cliche is handled quite well, and your server connection is glitched so that you can't speak beyond a couple of hard-coded words which to me is the best implementation of a silent protagonist I've seen in ages. Despite being an entirely singleplayer game, CrossCode manages to create an experience immersive enough to feel like an actual MMO - \"other players\" can be seen running around on basically every map and have exactly the kind of dialogue you'd expect an MMO player to have. Your party members are accessed via a contacts list and can be called and dismissed more or less at will, but only if they're online and you aren't in an instanced area.\n\nThe combat system is pretty great. The best way I can describe it is that it's something of a mixture of Torchlight and Dark Souls. You have access to blocking and dodging from the start of the game and will need to use them constantly to have any degree of success in the game, but the game's forgiving enough that you can take a few hits and still be okay. You have both melee and ranged attacks, and there are enemies that will force you to use both kinds of attacks as early as the first overworld map. Projectile bouncing in particular is a fundamental mechanic of the game and is used in almost every puzzle. Enemies all behave differently and have their own attack patterns and weaknesses, which you will need to learn in order to beat them effectively. If you can stay in combat long enough you boost the drop rate which is very helpful (sometimes necessary) for gathering items, but this comes at the cost of not having access to out-of-combat regeneration. As you progress you unlock elemental modes, which change your damage type and available attacks, as well as your abilities. More on that below.\n\nThe gear system is mostly based on trading items with NPCs - these can be found as drops from enemies or destroyable objects, from chests, as quest rewards, or as part of a chain of deals. Each traded item has its own stats and its own special effects, usually up to 2 of them per item, and there are a [i]lot[/i] of special effects in this game. You could, for example, have improved invulnerability frames on dashing, reduced aiming time, improved damage when hitting an enemy during its attack, added health regeneration during combat (which starts at 0%, so it's actually very useful even at low values), and another 8 or so effects, and this is just from equipment. Gear provides most of your stats, so it's important to keep it upgraded or you'll probably get wrecked when you try to go to a new area, but you should be able to get most of the items for at least a couple pieces of gear just from doing side quests.\n\nThe level-up system is a node-based skill tree rather like a simplified version of Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid or Path of Exile's passive tree. You start with a non-elemental skill tree - its passive abilities are always active but lose 50% of their potency when you're in an elemental mode. As you progress through the game you will gain access to elemental skill trees, which are only active while their respective element is active.\n\nSome parts of the skill trees involving your active skills have two tracks - only one track can be active at a time but you can swap branches whenever you're out of combat and both branches merge back together after 3 nodes. Very few of the active skills feel useless, though some are more situational than others and every player will probably develop their own set of favorites as they play. (One of mine is the non-elemental single-target dash move, which is exceedingly effective at damaging most bosses and conveys a period of invulnerability when its charged version connects that has saved my life on more than one occasion.)\n\nThe dungeons in the game are Zelda-style dungeons, and are instanced so you can't take party members with you. The story dungeons are surprisingly long, almost too much so - they're probaly around 1.5-2x as long as what you'd expect from an actual Zelda dungeon. Each dungeon has quite a lot of puzzles, which is most of why they are so long, but they are extremely well designed and build on each other masterfully. In the first dungeon, you go from throwing bombs at rocks/blocks/enemies, to throwing explosives spawned by enemies, to shooting explosives to make them rocket off farther than you can throw them, to throwing and then shooting explosives to get them around corners, to throwing and shooting explosives around corners to launch a block in various directions while you're standing on it. There are also various smaller side dungeons scattered around, most of which are involved in a quest and are usually more challenging than the required dungeons.\n\nThere are some jumping puzzles as well, which can be a bit hit or miss as it can be hard to tell whether something can be jumped to or not. The most reliable way to tell is usually to fire a projectile and see how close its shadow is when it passes over your destination, or if it bounces off. When they work, though, they work very well - some of the jumping puzzles are just ingenious.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes action-based RPGs. The story is great, the combat is great, the gear and leveling system is great, the dungeons/puzzles are great, and there are even some obnoxiously hard but not entirely unfair parts for the people who like that sort of thing.\n\nAt the moment (version 0.9.5-3), the story content ends about 25 hours in but is supposedly 30-40% of the way through the game, so you can expect to be playing for 80 hours or more on a first playthrough.

But still, accomplishing these moment feels great! It is even crazy how they have made it so that you develop a close bond with the NPC's you meet in this game. There are some downsides though, like the quest tracking. In the beginning I got really confused when I accepted to many quests at once. So I didn't even know what to do. And it is hard to tell where you have to go some times (if you aren't familiar with the town yet.) the other downside are the cliffhangers and waiting time for the next update, but that's just because it is still early access.

It looked really interesting but I wasn't really willing to shell out $20 for it since most early access games have disappointed me in the past. Now that the steam summer sale is here and the price dropped I finally decided to give it a chance. I am only about 4 hours in at the time of writing this but let me tell you, this game is amazing!\n\n The soundtrack for this game is absolutely perfect and, in my opinion, is possibly the strongest point of the game. I have also found myself liking most of the characters that have been introduced in so far and the combat is very fast paced and rewarding. When I first looked at the game I thought the combat would be similar to a hack and slash. Easy, button mashing nonsense. I am very pleased to see that this is definitely not the case. While I definitely wouldn't call it a complicated system it does take some practice to get the hang of it. The game rewards skill and punishes mindless button mashing (at least in the parts I've seen so far). The hardest part, for me at least, is learning the fighting patterns of the new creatures you encounter, especially if you end up fighting a mix of several different monsters at once. The monsters themselves also do a fair amount of damage if you do get hit so it definitely pays to learn how to dodge early. Of course, I do have to mention that the graphics are very nice. Colorful, sharp and just generally pleasing to the eye.\n\nMy only complaint is that the start of the game is very slow paced and holds your hand for a bit too long for my liking. On the bright side, once it's over you're free so there's that. I also understand what many other people have said about the quest system. It can definitely be a bit of a nuisance trying to find out where exactly you are supposed to go but it would be a real stretch to say it takes away from the game's quality. Since I like to take my time and explore these kinds of games I usually end up finding my way sooner or later. \n\nOverall I would give this game a 9/10. Excellent music. Engaging combat system. Great graphics. Likeable characters. Challenging gameplay.

The respective color schemes for different areas match really well. Music is fun, whether it's the combat theme or the area theme. Overall, the visual aesthetics are really clean. I just wish 80% of the npc sprites weren't generically grey.\n\nThe characters in the game are limited, but are expressed fairly well. There's a couple of characters from the introductory chapter (who probably never make another appearance) that I actually liked a lot.\n\nCombat in this game feels really good. It's actually insanely good relative to other games. It's fast, responsive, and impactful. The game does a good job of stretching your combat capabilities to their limits without being too frustrating; I tried to play a lot of the early parts of the game without ever using my shield. Bad idea.\n\nI have OCD, so I spent a ton of time doing parkour trying to collect all the items in the various areas. It pissed me off. Is it good parkour? Probably, but I spent too much time frustrated to appreciate it.\n\nPuzzles in the temple areas were fun. Parkour puzzles, less so :[\n\nMissions were actually pretty fun. There's a nice variety in mission types, so plenty of different things for you to do. Rewards are pretty hefty too.\n\nThe game at this point is still in early access, so don't expect a complete product. The most significant portion of the game that seems to be lagging behind is the story. The most interesting story setup and development somehow all happened in the introductory chapter. Pretty disappointing.\n\nI'm going to give it a 7/10 at this time, but I'm ready to change that as the game continues to develop.

Begriffe\n- die Musik ist zwar nicht die Allerbeste, unterh\u00e4lt und unterstreicht dennoch sehr gut das Spielgeschehn\n- die Mmorpg-Elemente sind hammer gut umgesetzt; viele Featurs (humorvolle typische Questgebung; andere Player laufen einem \u00fcber den Weg; Sozialelemente via Gruppeneinladungen und vieles mehr (will nicht zu viel spoilern)  \n-> ein sehr gro\u00dfes Lob\n- die Story (bis

schwerer bei Jump and Run RPGs)\n- ein bis jetzt sehr umfangreicher aber nicht un\u00fcbersichtlicher F\u00e4higkeitenbaum\n- einfache und dennoch umfangreiche Men\u00fcgestaltung der Enzyklopadien (Bio; Charackter; Monster; ... etc.)\n\nEs mag vllt. im ersten Moment abschreckend sein, dass sich dieses Spiel in der Early-Phase befindet (dank anderen tollen Vertretern diese Phase); dennoch

Everything here is amazingly well polished, interesting and made with love. So much so that even all the announcements are worth reading just due to the amount of care put into them. \n\nBut ok, why is this game so good? I might be a bit nostalgic here as this really reminds me of Megaman Battle Network series even though it's quite a different game. Yet it does have some things that do make that a valid connection - the characters are lovable, the mystery of the main plot and the plot itself are fantastic, there is also the concept of a connection between real and cyber life that is, like the rest, really well made.\n\nBesides those things the game has a ton of stuff to offer - it's a great Action RPG with both elements executed amazingly well! The mechanics feel extremally responsive, partially thanks to the fantastic animations, and the RPG elements are engaging and clearly made with a lot of though put into them. There is a ton of side quests that feel more like easter eggs than anything else due to both humor and the way they need to be completed.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic as well... just... like, you get my point I think, this is one of those really special gems. \n\n\nThank You devs for making such a wonderful game!", "timestamp_created": 1498687324, "timestamp_updated": 1498687324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32956121": {"recommendationid": "32956121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142998543", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511380596}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No suelo escribir rese\u00f1as de ning\u00fan tpo, pero llevo apenas unas horas jugando y puedo decir que es de lo mejor que me he encontrado en steam.\nUn juego bien hecho, cuidado hasta el m\u00ednimo detalle, con una jugabilidad bastante \u00e1gil y digno de un gran apoyo.\n\nSi tienes la oportunidad de comprarlo sin descuento, \u00a1h\u00e1zlo!

"language": "english", "review": "This game man.\n\nOh man what do I say\n\nFirstly, if you like games like Kingdom Hearts, Dark Souls, Hyper Light Drifter or are a fan of that metroid-vania genre, this game will be right up your alley, and if you're a fan of that 16-BIT asthetic, then most certainly give this a look\n\nEven in early access, there's alot to do in this game, I've spent 6 hours and I don't even think I'm 10% done with it, and they're still adding more stuff! It's crazy. However, those 6 hours may account for alot of optional quests, which at first glance, seem skipable, and I can certainly say some of them are, all of them help to develop one's own understanding of how the mechanics and tools the game gives you, especially when every skill and attack has a different purpose, each suited for better situations more so than others\n\nThe combat is FAST. But not impossible to manage. The combat is part Kingdom Hearts part Dark Souls, in terms of how dodging and melee attacks function with a larger emphasis on the ranged attacks having monsters built specifically for the ranged attacks. And then there's the consumables with the heals and the buffs and what not, y'know, that good ol' RPG item shtuff\n\nMusic is also pretty nice, fits each stage and fight pretty well. Honestly whether you think the music is good or not is up to you, but the only way to find out is buy the game ;)\n\nVisuals are pretty, but the first sorta section is kinda repetitive, the second being much better and having several distinctive set pieces. Hoping the rest will to\n\nThe story is also pretty intruiging, and while the whole 'amnesia' case is worn out at this point, the way its implemented into the MC works pretty well. Side characters are pretty well characterised, never really felt like any of them overlapped with each other. Wish some of the recurring NPC's had portraits, so they didn't feel so empty\n\nI don't even know why I'm telling you this, there's a demo, go play it and make up your mind if you want to give the dev crew some dosh to make the goooooood shit\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1498649877, "timestamp_updated": 1498649877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32927671": {"recommendationid": "32927671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303288121", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511439602}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u96d6\u7136\u76ee\u524d\u5167\u5bb9\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u5e38\u671f\u5f85\u5f8c\u7e8c\u5287\u60c5\n\n\u5feb\u9ede\u51fa\u4e0b\u4e00\u500b\u7ae0\u7bc0\u62dc\u8a17~~~\n\n----------\n\n\u7ae0\u7bc0\u6301\u7e8c\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u63a8", "timestamp_created": 1498647925, "timestamp_updated": 1511439735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32910625": {"recommendationid": "32910625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311995320", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502250825}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u5c31\u60f3\u95ee\u4e00\u4e0b\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7b49\u4e86\u597d\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1498624105, "timestamp_updated": 1498624105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32901990": {"recommendationid": "32901990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082641876", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506980103}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favourite games to date.

the CrossCode world\n\ni can't even believe this game is singleplayer, it felt like i was playing with other player...the NPCs is not like NPCs...i mean its like they all have they own characteristic.\n\nEven our partner have they own Conversation and Comments in every intresting place, like commenting about the enemies, the point of interest, etc\n\nThe combat is so fluid and unorthodox, cant ask more about it, however, playing on gamepad is more comfortable for me then playing on keyboard for some reason...\n\nCharacter Building in this game is almost the same like some MMORPGs out there, so you should be familliar with it, i mean, Skills Building, Stats, etc\n\nThe game is a bit Grindy, so prepare your time for leveling so you wont stuck at main quest\n\nThe SubQuest on this world is soo much, so don't bother to finish your main quest in a hurry, take your time and finish some subquest.\n\nThe Soundtrack is so amazing that i stopped in some area just to

So I figured that instead, I'd focus on some minor foibles you may have with it.\n\n[u]Unorthodox Combat System[/u]\nThe combat system's definitely a strong point for me, but it's certainly a bit unusual. Positioning your cursor is critical, and it determines in which direction you attack, guard or dash, all at once. Switching between these actions is very fluid once you get the hang of it; nonetheless, it may throw you off initially. Going purely by keyboard is not recommended.\n\n[u]Grinding[/u]\nYou don't have to grind an ounce if you don't want to, but there's plenty of optional quests that have you do so. If you're like me in that you find sidequests of higher priority than the main storyline, you'll have to figure out some techniques to farm plants and enemies. CrossCode handles this in quite an interesting manner with its combat rank system, but grinding it is, so be prepared for it if you're a completionist.\n\n[u]Experience Progression[/u]\nAny game with sidequests has to balance their rewards to not render the player too powerful for the main quest. CrossCode makes a decent attempt by diminishing quest experience as you overlevel them, but does not resolve the problem entirely.\nI enjoy rather difficult games, so overleveling is quite a concern for me. Characters will even comment on your excessive level if you come across a dungeon a bit too well prepared. It's therefore a pity that there's no way to freeze your experience. You can inhibit yourself by purposely equipping bad gear, but the fear remains that I'm not experiencing everything as the developers intended me to.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, if you're along purely for the story and ignore everything else on your path, you may find yourself in some tougher fights than you're bargaining for.\nThis is honestly more of a minor gripe with the genre as a whole than with this particular game, but it does suffer from it slightly.\n\n\nNonetheless, this is likely the best thing I've seen in Early Access thus far. Plenty of others have sung the praises I have, but suffice to say: strongly recommended.\n", "timestamp_created": 1497985761, "timestamp_updated": 1497985761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32593811": {"recommendationid": "32593811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120964663", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483481259}, "language": "english", "review": "I started off with the Demo on Gamejolt and when I saw it was on Steam, I bought it instantly because it's so good.\n\nI love basically everything about it except I sometimes get confused on where I'm supposed to go and it can get boring grinding sometimes, but these are small issues when seeing how amazing the game is overall\n\nI give it an 8/10 :)", "timestamp_created": 1497969665, "timestamp_updated": 1497969665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32582340": {"recommendationid": "32582340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108193497", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498569240}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f18\u79c0 \u7cbe\u5f69 \u8bda\u610f\n\u753b\u98ce\u6000\u65e7 \u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u6d45", "timestamp_created": 1497928499, "timestamp_updated": 1497928499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32581156": {"recommendationid": "32581156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022858087", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498332642}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game.

Just reading some of these reviews you'd assume the game desended from the heavens on a golden chariot to lead all the chosen people to the promised land. After about 5 hours of gameplay I was ready to rule this out as people being overzealous; the game was good for sure, but I didn't see any golden chariots around. I'm glad I didn't review the game at that point... Since then my appreciation of this game has done nothing but soar higher and higher. The game is so much deeper than I thought.\n\nPros: (There are so many)\n-> Core gameplay is dynamic and interesting. There is a huge variety of skills to master and you can form different gameplay patterns based on how you want to play the game.\n-> Enemies are incredibly well balanced. At no point have I ever felt something was too easy or insurmountable. Strong enemies will almost always take several tries while you discover their weakness and learn to exploit it.\n-> Death isn't punishing. Feel free to sack a life to understand more about your opponent. It won't set you back and you'll get back to the action quickly\n-> Boss design is incredible. They look and feel intimidating and make your victories feel hard-earned and satisfying.\n-> The dungeon puzzles are very well done. Nothing seems obvious. It's very much in the spirit of old zelda games, but because you have different abilities than Link the puzzles are new and interesting.\n-> Everything about the game is incredibly well polished: menus, facial expressions, fast forwarding cutscenes, help tips. It all exudes a feeling of \"some guy really spent a lot of time on this, good job\".\n-> The game is VERY deep. There's so much to it to explore and optimize. At the same time, how well the game is balanced let's you work around this complexity if you don't want to be bothered or pick and choose what aspects are fun to you. For example: I couldn't give a toss about the crafting system and don't feel like purusing the traders for slightly more optimal equipment/temporary stat boosts... So I didn't. I completed side quests to improve my stats adaquately through leveling up and played more of a Dark Souls style of 'git gud' gameplay.\n\nCons:\n-> The story at this point is very weak... I know the devs are still working on this, but it has to be mentioned.  Almost 20 hours in and the main protagonist does not seem to have a strong driving motivation. She knows she's lost her memories and that playing the game might help her remember and thus far she hasn't remembered anything of consequence.

Start of the game is too slow and feels really boring.\n2. Quest tracking is really old fashioned. There's no mark on the map, you gotta find. Sometimes it's really tidious cause there's too many side quests.\n3. Battle is tiring. It's really coold system but then you gotta dodge most of monsters attaks cause it hurts alot, even from start of the game.\n4. Continue'd from #3. Battle is too hard. Not just a system, monsters often has really annoying patterns like running away and then shoot high-damage attakcs from ranged... It starts even from the first map you'll start to hunt monster\n\nI would give 7/10 to this game. It is well-made in many ways. Just really un-friendly and too old-fashioned for nowadays.\n\n-Updated\n\nWow, I wasn't expecting comment back from developer.. Since I got a reply, I would provide more detailed versions of my complainants.\n \n1. If it\u2019s connected story, I can\u2019t complain much there. But... some dialogues you put to makes character more vibrant, sometimes it feels just another yari-yari-yada skippable blah. Could be it's just my problem.\n\n2. I would appreciate little more detailed location, yes. But right now sometimes it\u2019s really vague and maps are complicated already.. And you said already recognized that problem. So i'm hoping to change it one day.\n\n3 and 4. \"Challenging\" fight is always a good excuse to use. If you\u2019re targeting the certain group of players (which are skilled, into challenge), then yes. But the game doesn\u2019t warn people that \u201cChallenging\u201d game play is must to new players. I wouldn\u2019t mind if the battle is hard. But then battle is already hard and also there's \u201cannoying\u201d monsters. Even \u201czako\u201d enemies have really annoying patterns, like running far far away and snipe you. I do not think all the battle have to be challenging constantly. (Also, to snipe back, character\u2019s basic ranged attack sucks really hard. It almost feels worthless to use until certain point.)\nIn my opinion, that annoyingness is problem. Reasonably-challenging game is good. But If it\u2019s just annoying to play, constantly, then it's just pile of stress. Not a stress reliever.\nMy suggestion : Easy mode. Monsters use less pattern. Some people just wants to have fun, without too much challenge and stress.", "timestamp_created": 1497677512, "timestamp_updated": 1497731420, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.345523", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1497777676, "developer_response": "Thanks for the feedback. I wanted to give a few responses to that\n\n1. Unfortunately changing the beginning right now is difficult since it's strongly connected with the plot. If you can give us more details which part exactly you thought was boring, we may be able to adapt a few things\n2. Quest marker are unfortunately very difficult for us to implement at this point, but we plan to at least provide more detailed location names for Quest NPCs. You'll still have to lookup map names, but it should still help\n3. CrossCode has purposely challenging fights where dodging and guarding are essential. We wanted to avoid generic Hack'n Slay Combat. It probably isn't for everyone.\n4. Again, this is intended and also an aspect that a lot of our players seem to appreciate. Note that upgrading your equipment is essential to keep fights manageable - that's a fact that's currently rather poorly communicated and we're working on that."}, "32493212": {"recommendationid": "32493212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056675851", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513279761}, "language": "english", "review": "Very few Early Access Games are this good...I mean it's better than the few E.A.Gs that I've played before anyway.

The puzzles and lay out of the fields and dungeons is great for someone that gets bored with games real easily i can say i was never bored. The questing could use some work with navigating but other then that this game is a gem, I sat here for days wondering if i should but 20 dollars down on this game and after playing through alot of it i wonder why it took me so long.

It has fast paced, action combat and gameplay with strategic elements to it, but it still has that good old retro RPG feel to it with the music and charming graphics.  Lots of puzzle solving making it have a Zelda feel as well.\n\nWhen I first bought the game I was a bit worried on how I would use a keyboard in this type of game.  It started off rough, but as I got used to it I'm actually really enjoying it.   It's basically using WASD to move around and then mouse clicks to attack and defend in whatever direction.  If you are close range you'll melee and at long range you'll shoot.    Holding down mouse buttons will do overcharge attacks.  There is a skill tree to choose branching skills, etc\n\nThe thing that makes this all come together is that most of the enemies have unique patterns of attack that you have to figure out how to approach them, especially in the boss battles and other mini quests.   It makes for some boss fights where you may die multiple times before you win making it more satisfying.   It also helps that the loading time after you die is so fast that it doesn't derail from the game much at all.  I really appreciate that about it.\n\nNow obviously with it being in Early Access the story is not complete.   As of this review it seems like it may not even be halfway there.    That being said I do really like how it is going so far and can't wait for more updates.  I could see myself playing for another 10 hours easy though on what is available as far as quests and such though which would give me almost 40 hours(maybe more) in a game that is at best halfway complete.  Not too bad IMO and well worth its pricetag  especially if can get it on sale at all.", "timestamp_created": 1497231807, "timestamp_updated": 1497231807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32353313": {"recommendationid": "32353313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091499489", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 255, "last_played": 1514696531}, "language": "english", "review": "I know the game isn't complete yet, but so far, I've played through all of its available content in several different versions, spanning over a year now.\n\n\u2022TL;DR version\u2022\n[b]This game gets a solid 9 / 10 from me.[/b]\nIt respects your time by allowing you to save anywhere, it's overall easy to learn, the combat is fast paced, fluid, and not overwhelming, The characters are adorable. The pixel art is really good and the soundtrack really blends in with the ambient.\n\n\u2022Actual opinion version\u2022\n[b]\u2022All the good things\u2022[/b]\n\nEverything in general pretty refined. The difficulty has a nice pace, It doesn't overwhelm you. The 1000 exp for level up system works pretty well, making lower level enemies give you less experience as you level up, somewhat forcing you to move on forward. The destructible plants also help sell the character's abilities, because everything is linked to the combat.\n\nI'd say that the puzzles, world exploration and combat are masterfully woven together, and I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes to beat up some baddies and scratch your brains to solve some nice puzzles. It has very well adapted controls for a modern audience (as opposed to older games with stiffer controls and 8 way directional movement), and the pixel art is just to cry for.\n\nThe story is simple and accessible, all the characters are likeable (so far).\n\nEmilie really helps breaking some of the monotony by talking to you every once in a while when you're sometimes just walking around to previous areas, getting some S ranks, trying to get all the materials you haven't got yet, or just whacking some plants.\n\n\n\n[b]\u2022Minor complaints\u2022[/b]\n\n-The amount of initial quests that are given to you can feel a bit overwhelming. Specially for someone who is new for this kind of game (which is not the case for me), but I can see a few people getting a bit confused with switching between which quests are going to be showing up in your HUD initially.\n\n-When I got into new areas a couple of times I couldn't tell the height of some of the platforms to jump onto, but that's a limitation of the camera angle itself (and probably some lack of shading of taller platforms ). This was very very rare but it definitely happened. I got kinda frustrated because it broke my \"flow\" of jumping around as i got Lea's face smacked against a wall and fell into the water.", "timestamp_created": 1497219660, "timestamp_updated": 1511565450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32353070": {"recommendationid": "32353070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044882712", "num_games_owned": 917, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512692379}, "language": "english", "review": "OMG!!!

The only issue I have with this game is that some of the quests can become extremely frustrating. For example, the challenge of aspiration, trial of progression, and so forth. If you get frustrated or annoyed easily, then I wouldn't recommend this game. And if you have anxiety, then I probably won't recommend this game either. If you're looking for a challenging game with a great story, then this game is for you. :) It can be pretty fun at times, especially when you complete areas on the map and progress to the next village/town. Also, some of the quests can get repetitive, and some enemies and bosses can be pretty hard to beat right away.. so you're forced to farm and grind for better gear and for higher levels, but that's

frustrating mess that I wanted to love, but honestly it's just not fun. Go buy something else.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are actually a lot of great things about this game. But it is very far from perfect, which one might think based on the very high approval and reviews it gets here on steam.\n\nMany, many, battles are long, repetative, boring, and frustratingly difficult. I see many people say they are 'hard', but these battles are just poorly optimized. You know what else is hard ? Lifting heavy rocks, but that doesn't make it fun.\nIn battle, you have to continue to make near perfect moves and one slip up can often cost you 70-100% of your health...resulting in you having to replay the battle from the beginning (of the first phase of a sequence of battles, as will often happen) and you having wasted ANOTHER 5-10 minutes of your life (depending on end boss, or whatever you're fighting).\n\nThe challenges are equally frustrating and I've found myself having to replay each one so many times that by the time I complete it, I can speed run through it. That's the type of profeciency they require to simply move on. It's absurd.\n\nHealing also takes an absurd amount of time. Like 2 seconds of having to stand still during the heat of a fast paced battle. It's ridiculous. Honestly, when using a health in battle I often am hurt 80-150% of how much a full heal accomplishes. Meaning, a heal will usually result in a very small amount of health gain, or more often than not you actually lose more than you gain from having to stand still and getting injured.\n\nI have other gripes too, and may edit them in later.\nThere's a lot of potential, and I do understand that it's early access (rightly so), but it has a lot of optimization problems to deal with, especially in main battles (which consists of 90% of the game since they take so stupid long to finally win).\n\nIn a lot of ways though, it has potential to be a really fun game, but I honestly don't understand why it has such a high rating on steam. It's good, but no way is it that good. So I wanted to give a honest, contrasting opinion to all these 'best game ever created' reviews.\n\nSo, while overall I do enjoy aspects of the game, and think that it has the potential to be a great game. It falls flat. It is simply too much of a grind and not an enjoyable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1496613916, "timestamp_updated": 1496630210, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423627", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32183416": {"recommendationid": "32183416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306798471", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498113862}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u89e3\u8c1c\u90e8\u5206\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d,\u6218\u6597\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u96be", "timestamp_created": 1496604548, "timestamp_updated": 1499555769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32177136": {"recommendationid": "32177136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203042850", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 196, "last_played": 1513506508}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u53e3\u6c14\u73a9\u4e86\u4e8c\u5341\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6   \u6211\u597d\u957f\u4e00\u53e3\u6c14  \u597d\u73a9  \u76ee\u524d\u662f\u4e3b\u7ebf\u5267\u60c5\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u70b9  \u8fd8\u662f\u86ee\u60f3\u770b\u5230\u4e3b\u89d2\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8   \u8fd8\u6709 \u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u600e\u4e48\u8df3\u7684\u66f4\u8fdc\u554a~~~\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9 \u6211\u8df3\u4e0d\u4e0a\u53bb~~   \u6211\u662f\u8d81\u7740\u6253\u6298\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4e70\u7684~", "timestamp_created": 1496585130, "timestamp_updated": 1496585130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32175777": {"recommendationid": "32175777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020328946", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1514216809}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u505a\u7684\u5f88\u7cbe\u826f\u7684ARPG\u6e38\u620f\uff01\u5c31\u662f\u89e3\u8c1c\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u663e\u5f97\u6709\u70b9\u592a\u5197\u957f\u4e86\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u5730\u56fe\u90fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e32\u8054\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u53c8\u7279\u522b\u7684\u9e21\u808b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u5f88\u65e0\u804a\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1496580917, "timestamp_updated": 1497159022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32175659": {"recommendationid": "32175659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126443977", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511282352}, "language": "english", "review": "HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLY SHIT BEST GAME EVER (after undertale) but its hard very hard AND I LIKE IT.

sidequests... much. They 'can' be a nice distraction but they're mostly platitudes and abusive of some of the most ancient cliches. That said, changes have been made where there are fewer of them, and even some of the ones that reamain, are quite interesting. Most noteably is the sub-arc about the girl whose kindness is exploited by a guild to bring in 'Seekers' to help with grunt work for some diabolical plot of this guild..... that hasn't been revealed yet.\n\nBefore the change the game was already a 10/10 in my eyes, now it's more like 11/10. I cannot get enough, and I cannot say enough good things about it. It's not just RPG in the level grinds, you can surpass obstacles a variety of ways, including a skill tree that actually makes the character feel powerful, and equipment that can be customized for several different playstyles.\n\nThe story starts out with this kind of 'anime' style opening, hooking you with a mystery, a sequence of action-packed events that just leave you wondering what's going on. But there's a catch: Lea is introduced as an amnesiac, surrounded by people who seem to know more about her than she does. This includes the main villain. I won't say any more than that, so as not to spoil, just give an idea of what to expect.\n\nEvery character is colorful and loveable. Emilie is a faithful sidekick, perhaps a bit ditzy but not in an annoying way. She is actually my favorite supporting character, an endless source of adorable. Apollo is definitely an over-the-top rival, the kind of obnoxiously righteous punk but fun to be around in doses, which is exactly how you're treated to him.\n\nBut by far the most important thing in any video game is the gameplay itself. And CrossCode delivers immensely. Switch between melee and ranged combat seemlessly; dodge attacks gracefully or put up a directional shield; use circuits to buff your abilities and add a variety of new ones; use elemental attributes to exploit enemy weaknesses. Almost everything flows in this beautiful dance and you can always learn a new technique or adjust your patterns. And if you use a gamepad, you will be delighted by how buttery smooth Lea can move.\n\nSeriously cannot wait for full release. If you value 'fun' and respectable challenge curve more than pretty graphics, buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1496446058, "timestamp_updated": 1511516273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32138677": {"recommendationid": "32138677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166682780", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511656924}, "language": "english", "review": "Hi", "timestamp_created": 1496439899, "timestamp_updated": 1496439899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32136441": {"recommendationid": "32136441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156069466", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496433179}, "language": "english", "review": "Game play is good.

Likewise, you don't have markers to quest NPCs and similar things. We're aware that this makes questing less comfortable. Unfortunately improving these features at this point would be very difficult to do, which is why we don't want to make this promise.\n\nFor Quest NPCs we try to always tell you the name of the room that you can look up on the map. That means you only have to find the room on the map view (you can easily see names by hovering the room) and afterwards search the NPC within the room. It's less comfortable than a marker, but you don't have to search the whole area that way.\n\nAs for the control scheme: a lot of action like attacking, guarding and dashing can and often must be executed while aiming with your right analog stick. That is why face buttons simple are not an option for these actions. Despite that we plan to add support for Face buttons for actions like \"close combat attack\" and \"guarding\" in addition to the shoulder buttons with the next release.\n\nYes, the control scheme of CrossCode is somewhat unique and therefore not the most intuitive, but overall the feedback for it has actually been very positive."}, "32110557": {"recommendationid": "32110557", "author":

estar\u00eda mal que sus desarrolladores lo traduzcan al espa\u00f1ol, le dar\u00eda un gran plus y un gran auge para todas aquellas personas que a\u00fan no se deciden en comprarlo, ya sea porque se

This game is just so fun.\n\nI have no hours on record on Steam because I pirated it first to see if it was any good.  I'm reluctant with 8/16-bit games as I've been burned too much in the past.\n\nThat said, I got to the \"current end\" of the game as it is in that copy I got.  I was floored.  This game is amazing.  The combat feels so good and so rewarding.  The story is adorable and it pulls you in rather quickly, I am actually upset it isn't finished.  It takes place in a fictional world called CrossWorlds.  You are an MMO character named Lea and you meet friends along on the way.  There is something different about your character, but none of your \"MMO friends\" pick up on it.  I almost felt like your fictional friends were real people.  The world feels alive with random NPCs dashing around.\n\nIt feels like Diablo and Chrono Trigger had a child and this was the game.  I normally hate A-RPGs, but something about this game just feels so rewarding when you play it.    \n\nThe only cons I can think of is the quest interface and questing, and the vendors.  To trade pretty much any item, you don't just trade Gold/Credits and receive the item.  You also have to trade components from around the world.  I am not a fan of that.  If I grind the money, I'd like to just buy the item without any additional items needed.  That was frustrating.  And the quest interface leaves a lot to be desired.  A mini-map with directions would be nice, you get pretty overwhelmed with the amount of quests in the early game and trying to clear them all out is a hassle because of the interface it gives you.\n\nOther than those two gripes, if you are on the fence, pick it up so you can also be disappointed when you get to the \"end\" of the current iteration of the game and just want more more more.  I'll be keeping my eye out for the official release so I binge play it for days on end.", "timestamp_created": 1496248407, "timestamp_updated": 1496352707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472937", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32089343": {"recommendationid": "32089343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310148892", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496246662}, "language": "schinese", "review": " \u8bf4\u5b9e\u8bdd...\u8fdb\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u524d\u534a\u5c0f\u65f6\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u60f3\u7740\u9000\u6b3e..\u4f46\u73a9\u4e86\u4e00\u5c0f\u65f6\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u83ab\u540d\u5176\u5999\u7684\u559c\u6b22\u4e0a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5973\u4e3b...\u89e3\u5bc6\u5c31\u89e3\u5bc6\u5427...\u6211\u4e70\u4e4b\u524d\u4e00\u76f4\u4ee5\u4e3a\u5c31\u662f\u4e2aarpg...\u8981\u662f\u88c5\u5907\u80fd\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6765\u5c31\u597d\u4e86...", "timestamp_created": 1496248353, "timestamp_updated": 1496248353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32089334": {"recommendationid": "32089334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242461232", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496424033}, "language": "english", "review": "Did the opposite of No Man's Sky.

experiencing (and I've played a lot of games: consoles, handhelds, and the ever-loving Master Race :D). The combat is extremely fluid and it's always fun running around murdering hordes and hordes of hedgehogs and mole rats (is that what they are? imma just call'em diggletts). For an early access game, there's not quite a lot of the story implemented in the game yet, but the number of side quests are enough to keep you busy until you ACTUALLY have to get whatever parts of the story are in the game done and be sad cuz the whole thing aint there yet. Some quests which require finding items may be a bit of a chore but there lots more interesting side quests to do. Although the game is good enough to play already (and I haven't encountered any sort of glitch or bug, lucky me :D), I suggest waiting until the full game is released which is pretty soon (I remember it to be this year but I could be wrong) but if you want to support the dev's in this endeavor, go on ahead.

is totally worth the $20 in my opinion! \n\nIt's an extremely charming game right away and had me hooked within the first few minutes. I actually didn't know that this was an early access game until just now. \n\nPros: \n- Super charming art style and solid character dialogue\n- Great music (although some of the songs are a bit silly/repetitive, overall I think the music perfectly fits this type of game)\n- Fairly indepth character progression system with skills, gear, powerups to level up, etc. \n- Cool story so far\n- Interesting puzzles that help to keep a variety in the gameplay. I think they were going for a \"Zelda\" type of feel with this game, and they totally nailed it. \n\nCons: \n- A few minor things are \"missing\" from the game (but it's early access). These aren't anything major that take away from the gameplay, or story, and I haven't experienced bugs or crashes so far. Just a few minor \"immersion\" type of things are missing. \n- I found the quest system to be mildly confusing at first, but quickly figured out how everything works.", "timestamp_created": 1495153703, "timestamp_updated": 1495153703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31831319": {"recommendationid": "31831319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054499148", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495150646}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] CrossCode is a fun game that is far from being completed [/h1]\n\nCrossCode is has some great gameplay, that's very difficult but satisfying due to the tight nature of the controls.

RPGs before this one (unless you count the pokemon ranger games) and i went into it not knowing what to expect. fortunately, i noticed the free demo as i was about to click off and thought: \"hey, what the heck, i'll give this a go.\"\n\nfrom then on, as soon as it booted up the title screen, i was hooked. the combat feels really great and the dodging is just as offensive as it is defensive, allowing you to pull off range-melee-special (in that order) combos and do massive damage in seconds.\n\nafter i finished the demo (if you're unsure go play that) i immediately bought the full game, even though it isnt finished. i didn't care, the combat was so good, there is light bits of humour every now and then too, the characters were lovable, the story was better than i thought and i rarely play games for story (thats a lie, i own \"to the moon\"), and the world was awesome. now, the story goes (dont worry i aint spoiling anything) that you are a girl called lea who has been hacked into this mmo to try and get your memory back, now while it isnt an mmo, i remember myself constantly thinking: \"if this was an mmo, i would play the heck out of it,\" because the world was really well designed. now as you travel through this world you meet new characters, the main side-character is called emilie and she accompanies you mostly throughout your journey in your party (yes there is a party system, i heard those are pretty common in RPGs), but whether she is or isnt available depends on if she's online, MORE WORLD BUILDING which is really cool cause it makes you feel like you're playing an actual MMO. \n\nthe sidequests are mostly pretty good and save you from grinding if you do them before you over level and the amount of exp you get from them becomes negligible. the dungeons are well designed and the bosses look and feel cool. especially the first one which is just the \"hit the enemy crab in its weak spot for massive damage\" https://youtu.be/kF8POaO-9TY?t=135\n\nin conclusion, whether you're going in for the story, the characters, the awesome combat or just because the art style looks nice, i would highly recommend this game and even more so when it comes out of early-access. it has introduced me to the world of RPGs and you can be sure i'll be looking out for more in the future.\n", "timestamp_created": 1494061759,

The overall quality of this game is top-notch, with its attention to detail going above and beyond. The feel and pacing of the combat, the ingenuity required to solve some of its puzzles, and the ability to synthesize new techniques based off skills you've already learned in order to more overcome and solve new situations and obstacles. CrossCode does all of that, and nearly flawlessly.\n\nThis game is as puzzle-heavy as it is difficult with combat. Every nook and cranny in the game has some sort of adventure and treasure behind it. This makes the game's progression a bit predictable, but this kind of game style also isn't for everyone, as it can be \"too\" much in that direction for some players. I think CrossCode does this all really well though, and I was really really impressed playing the game.\n\nThe layout and aesthetic of each puzzle in CrossCode is top-notch, particularly the path-finding ones around Autumn's Rise and Bergen Trail. The colors, intricacies, and layout of each area take hold on your thoughts as you try and piece meal it all together. Almost all of CrossCode's secrets felt fair and worthwhile, and so I did them all without any real hints. Visually, later on, you'll encounter a really lush, dense environment that reminded me of the scene of stumbling across Tesla's 'castle' in The Prestige.\n\nThe music tracks are very relaxing, which was really nice. The game keeps a sobering pace with the appearance of 'tough' enemies: just as you think you've come out an area, something far more brutal to your life and your party's comes into your attention. The combat is varied and easy to get into, with different strategies required for almost every new enemy encounter. As well, Radical Fish Games has put a lot of effort into giving the player a really meaningfully clear and seamless transition to navigate, peruse, and switch out and use your gear and health items.\n\nOne thing I wish could have been explained a bit more was the saving system: The game saves whenever you change screens or visit a new area. This means that if you spend 20 minutes in one area killing baddies and searching that one piece of treasure, if you die, you lose all of it! But once you figure that out, saving becomes pretty quick.\n\nTo make this a perfect game for me I would want to see Radical Fish Games add in a little bit of a bigger splash of spontaneity into the game. There are a few areas where they have done something like this already (Pumpkin Funland???), but I want to see this spontaneousnes grab CrossCode by its horns and say \"Hey! Don't forget about this!\" Something to keep player thinking after they have already solved the game. But CrossCode isn't finishd yet; we have yet to see how the story and all its characters will play out.\n\nThe first time I accidentally aggro'd two friendly-looking enemies later in the game, they wiped my team and me in under 3 seconds. Those kinds of moments were some of the best, An enemy I initially hated grew to be one of my most liked after a particular encounter forced me to take them more seriously than I had before.\n\ntl;dr it's as if Dark Souls took its combat and wrapped it in the clothes of Secret of Mana. 5 Stars, highly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1493693188, "timestamp_updated": 1496216788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673265", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31497325": {"recommendationid": "31497325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101403339", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493700403}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game, Honestly, I havn't had time to play it that much but for the time i did i had a great time playing it", "timestamp_created": 1493684387, "timestamp_updated": 1493684387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31480463": {"recommendationid": "31480463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049111494", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501409112}, "language": "english", "review": "Combat feels great\nCharacters are fun and have depth\nStory is engaging\nPuzzles are awesome and make you think\n\nThis games is amazing and I love all of it.", "timestamp_created": 1493622113, "timestamp_updated": 1493622113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31479021": {"recommendationid": "31479021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152398388", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513948742}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ef7\u683c\u65b9\u9762\u5728\u72b9\u8c6b\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5165\u624b\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u4f5c\u54c1\u8d28\u91cf\u5b8c\u5168\u914d\u5f97\u4e0a\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u6211\u751a\u81f3\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u6bd4\u89c6\u9891\u5c55\u73b0\u7684\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\n\u7ed9\u73a9\u5bb6\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fdc\u8fdc\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u6e38\u620f\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u4e16\u754c\n\u7279\u522b\u63a8\u8350\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\u4e2d\u6587\u7ec8\u4e8e\u51fa\u4e86\n\n\u75af\u72c2\u5b89\u5229\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\u53ef\u60dc\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u8fd9\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4efb\u52a1\u7b80\u76f4\u6076\u5fc3\u6211\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u82e6\u624b\u4e86\u3002\u3002\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u6e38\u620f\u706b\u4e86\u4ee5\u540e\u6709\u5927\u4f6c\u7ed9\u4e2a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u653b\u7565\u5427\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u6c42\u4f60\u4eec\u4e0d\u8981\u8bf4\u4ec0\u4e48\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u8d35\u554a\u503c\u4e0d\u503c\u554a\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\n\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u6765100\u591a\uff0c\u597d\u50cf\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a110\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u964d\u4ef7\u523088\n\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u6e38\u620f97%\u7684\u597d\u8bc4\uff08\u672c\u6765\u8fd898%\u7684\uff09\u5c31\u6446\u5728\u8fd9\uff0c\u5927\u5bb6\u90fd\u662f100\u591a\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u4e70\u7684 \u90fd \u7ed9 \u4e86 \u597d \u8bc4 \n\u7b2c\u4e09\uff0csteam\u590f\u5b63\u7279\u60e0\u5feb\u5230\u4e86\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b49\u6253\u6298\u5165\n\u7b2c\u56db\uff0c\u6ca1\u4eba\u903c\u4f60\u4e70\uff0csteam\u73b0\u5728\u90fd\u5df2\u7ecf\u6709\u9000\u6b3e\u4e86\u4f60\u8fd8\u72b9\u72b9\u8c6b\u8c6b= =\u4e70\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u5c31\u9000\u597d\u4e48\n\n\n\u4e70\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u662f\u770b\u8d35\u4e0d\u8d35\u800c\u662f\u770b\u503c\u4e0d\u503c= =\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5/27\n\u5c45\u7136\u662f\u672c\u5730\u5b58\u6863\u7684\u4e48\u3002\u3002\n\u4eca\u5929\u521a\u6362\u65b0\u7535\u8111\u7ed3\u679c\u53ea\u80fd\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\n\u5fc3\u75bc\u81ea\u5df1", "timestamp_created": 1493614659, "timestamp_updated": 1495854684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782961", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31431924": {"recommendationid": "31431924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130254745", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508348156}, "language": "english", "review": "Best ARPG in human history (only a personal view though). The maximum discount is 15% (16% in Chinese yuan), so feel free to purchase it whenever you want.\n\nLet me introduce the element of this game:\n\n[h1]Background[/h1]\n\nThe game is set in a far future, where human colonize among the galaxy. A big corporation have been used a planet as a playground \"CrossWorld\"for their players, using \"instant matter\" to build artificial bodies \"CrossGear\"safe upon destruction, for players to log in.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nA girl who has lost her all memories wakes up in a CrossGear on the ship the game corporation owns. The staffs advise her to play in the crossworld to regain her memory. The girl called Lea even has speech problem in the crossgear - but luckily she meets a nice and outgoing French girl Emilie, who teams up with her and takes her to a friendly guild.\n\n[h1]Music and Graphic[/h1]\n\nThe game has two kinds of fighting - outside in the nature, where the heroine and her friends teamed up to smash hostile and innocent monsters; and inside the dungeon, where Lea must rely on her own to solve puzzles, and use the environment (such as barriers, bombs, bubbles, lightnings) as advantage, to fight alone with techniques.\n\nWhile in the nature, there are different biomes, with gatherable items, each with a group of music with styles. What I personally like best, is the oasis area in the Maroon Valley, where dragonfly like creatures fight with their flames, also \"palmapples\" and \"cactones\" to harvest.\n\nInside the dungeon, there are more asethetic decorations, corresponding to the theme of the whole dungeon (like the 4 elements - cold, fire, shock, wave). At the fire themed dungeon, there are even a beautiful sightseeing platform to let you rest for a bit.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nFeatures:\n[list]\n    [*]Teleportation: As you are playing in a story based \"online game\", you can technically teleport to every landmark at any time, instead running for a long time.\n    [*]Trading System: You can trade botanic fibres, loots, existing equipments, for gems, unique food, better and even legendary weapon and armor. Which is more realistic than a crafting system.\n    [*]Skills - they are implemented as \"circuits\" - which contains many branches. You consume CP gained at leveling, to activated the modules you want - and you can reset the circuit anytime for a small fee. There are 4 kinds of combat arts - dash, throw, melee and guard, also 4 element modes gained by finding in dungeons.\nPuzzles - I have to admit there are too many puzzles, which can make the player fatigued  - but it's worth it - given the powerful loot (outside) and the perks (inside, in dungeons) you gain.\n\n[/list]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1493443093, "timestamp_updated": 1493443093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31409986": {"recommendationid": "31409986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114921911", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496115050}, "language": "english", "review": "So far I am very early in the game, but...\n\nArt: Awsome\n\nCombat:Awsome\n\nCharacters:Awsome\n\nStory:Awsome\n\nIf you are thinking about getting it, Just do it...", "timestamp_created": 1493361694, "timestamp_updated": 1493361694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31403341": {"recommendationid": "31403341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025915416", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509272435}, "language": "russian", "review": "Hi!\n...\n[nods]", "timestamp_created": 1493332086, "timestamp_updated": 1493332086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31402009": {"recommendationid": "31402009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134788522", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508115270}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.

You play as Lea, A mute sphereomancer with amnesia, she got hacked into the game because it was beleved she could get her memories back from playing the game. So now you are playing a singelplayer simulation of an mmorpg that feels more like a true mmo than other big titles in the gangre.\n\n[h1]Begining of the game:[/h1] The game begins with a tutorial level set on a cargoship where the story is gradualy revealed to you as new game mechanics are introduced, After geting introduced to the core mechanics of the game you meet the captain of the ship, he explains your situation you are in and tells you to have a look around the ship.\nAfter talking to the crew of the ship your final test before geting to crossworlds begin, You need to destroy a turret to prove you have understood the games core mechanics.\n[spoiler]While fighting the turret a mysterius figure apears and attack the ship claiming he knows who you are, however to test if you are ''Worthy'' you have to figth a gigant crab made of scrap, this is the actual final boss of the tuorial.[/spoiler]\nAfter all of your tests you finaly get to crossworlds where you encounter you main rival called Emmelinator, You then encounter your first dungeon where you are finaly allowed to experience the real game, You clear a few interesting puzzles, fight some lesser minions and fight another boss, After that you unlock the circuit (otherwise known as your talent tree).\n\n[h1]Main Game:[/h1] \n[list]\n    [*] Combat: Crosscode uses Action combat with quick thinking and fast reactions. The game gets hard quickly and you will have to learn how to use the combat system in your favor, Your character plays the role of a  Sphereomancer, Sphereomancers uses small projectiles known as viritual ricochet projectiles and quick movement to confuse your oponents. You also have 4 unlockable abbilities based on each of your core functions (Shield, Dash, Meele attack and range attack). Some monsters and bosses are a combination of puzzles and combat because you have to solve a problem when fighting them. The game handles combat great and i never reale feelt cheated by an enemies abilities.\n    [*] Elements: Over the duration of the game you will unlock elemental combat, there are 4 elements in total (Heat, Cold, Shock and Wave) excluding your neutral attacks. Elemental abilities are more powerfull versions of your basic combat kit and they all bring a new mechanic to the table. However because these elements are so powerfull you have a special restriction called Elemental overload. When you're using elemental abilities you gain overload, after your overload is maxed out you reach elemental overload making you unable to use elements for a while so only use elements when its requiered for a puzzle or to combat specific enemies. Elements overall brings a more diverse combat system to the table and gives you more of a choice in combat.\n    [*] Circuits: The main circuit is divided into 4 major paths (Health, Defence, Damage and Utility) and in my experience all of them are usefull in their own areas however i feel like a balance between all of them is the best way to go since all the paths give you special abilities that are almost required in combat. There are also a circuit for each of your elements, these however are not as linear as the others and they're all over the place, i would much rather have the main circuits 4 paths in all circuits because i just end up spending my points randomly becuase there realy isnt any way to specify in an area of gameplay when you are using elements. \nThe circuits overall help you develop your own playstyle, atleast in the main circuit. There is still a few issues that i think could be easily fixed but it's still a very interesting way to handle a talent tree.\n    [*] Puzzles: The puzzles are by far my favorite part of the game because they are so cleverly done, they are difficult enough for it to be a chalange but it's so well made that no puzzles realygets frustrating. Most of the puzzles work together with the games core mechanics in a way that makes them both shine. There is not much i can say about the Puzzles, They are great and by far the best part of the game. If you like puzzles i would realy recomend this game to you.\n    [*] Trading and Equipment: The trading system in CrossCode is quite unique in the sense that you don't just buy equipment and consumables with money, you also need the to own the required resources to craft for the itesm you want. As an example, if you wanted to buy a rookie helmet you might need 200G, 5 petals and 7 scrap. I like the crafting system because it doesnt just let you buy gear and blaze trhough the game, it somewhat slows dont the story and introduces grinding to the game, Sure grinding isn't realy a good thing but i think that in small amounts it gives you more content even though some people might argue it's Bad content. Overall the trading system is prety solid even thoguh it takes some time to get all the materials you need.\n    [*] Secrets: The overworld is covered in secrets both big and small, it couldbe a secret path that leads to a chest or a whole new are that you had to find by yourself. Anywhere you go there might be secrets o keep your eyes open. Some secrets take understanding of the game to reach and some just arent avalable until you find a new element. It seemed like i found a new secret every time i went through an area, sometimes you dont procede with the story just because you realy want to kill a secret boss or finish a special quest. Secrets give you something else to do other than just doing quests and folowing the main plot.\n    [*] Social: During the game you meet npc's that are created to act like other players of the game, These character cover all of the other classes that Lea can't be, These characters can be invited to the party and are very usefull if you need help with killing a monster. These characters can not participate in dungeons however so don't get to dependent on them, The first character you meet is called Emmelinator. [spoiler]She is your main rival in the game, she is a french girl who gets in trouble alot because she plays Crossworlds with Lea instead of working.[/spoiler] I like Emmelinator, She is very competetive and gives you a nice early companion to play around with, she is also very usefull in combat and can tank damage for you, she plays as a Pentafist wich is prety much a brawler class.\nThe game also includes guilds where you can meet other npc's that you later might be able to invite to your party. The guild is also good if you get stuck because they will give you info about the game so can easily procede.\n    [*] Graphics and sound: Im not realy one to care about the graphics in a game but i realy like Crosecode's theme and artstyle, The game is a 2D retrostyle game with a 3D enviroment, For instance there are elevated surfaces that you can ump from and that kind of creates a parcour like element in the game.\nThe music is realy solid and i dont have any problem with the diferent soundtracks, the only issue i have is that the songs get a it repetetive at times but it realy isn't that big of a problem.\n    [*] Story: [spoiler]The story in Crosscode is devided into 2 parts (Lea's story and Crossworlds story). Lea's story mentions that she lost her memory and was found by a group of people who though she might get her memory back by playing Crossworlds, While venturing through the game you start to relize that Lea is part of a bigger sceeme. Meanwhile in Crossworlds the players are folowing the path of the ancients. The path of the ancients is the main quest line in Crossworlds and it makes the players walk in the footsteps of the creators of the world to figure out what kind of people they where and what secrets they hid away.

But every so often, a game comes along that deserves an early review. CrossCode deserves just this. Despite being unfinished as of yet, this game stands out.\n\nCross code is a game that will not hold your hand. It will teach you the controls, but from then on, does not hold back ethier. \n\nDespite having clear snes insprations, this game has an identity of it's own. Fights happen in real time and leave you to figure out how to solve them. It's not a \"mash this button to win\" kinda of deal. Knowing when to dodge, when to block and when to fire abilites is critical.\n\nWhere CrossCode stands out especially well for me is it's writing and presentation. Despite having some things that still need work, the \"game world\" feels vibrant, immersive and fairly well polished. \n\nThere are witty comments and asides on the nature of gaming in general hidden all throughout. Party members comment on what your doing in a non-intrusive, often character driven way. Even random NPC's in the game respond in a way that seems to imply they have their own lives.\n\nHonestly, the characters in this game each appear to have a personality of their own, with great moments of well placed facial expressions or moments of mystery. This even extends to the char you play, named Lea. She is unable to speak much, but is far from your typical slient hero, coming off charming despite barely saying anything.\n\nNow, being early access this game does have a few issues. Particularly there are some balance issues to overcome. Sometimes the puzzles or boss fights can be overly punishing, expecting you to do near perfect to achieve a goal, or having some obscere angle that is required to pass an area. Platforming in this game is a major factor, and while working well most of the time, can be frustrating.\n\nThere is no \"jump button.\" Walk to an edge and you'll jump, weither you want to or not.. meaning if you are trying to line up your character, you might instead jump before your ready and have to repeat the whole thing. Upgrading gear isn't too straightforward ethier, meaning you'll be farming for an upgrade for awhile many times, or will come across bosses that can nearly one shot you.\n\nThen too, at this time, it should be mentioned that being an unfinished game, the story line is NOT complete. Despite these frustrations though, the game overall feels rewarding and fun to play. The RTS elements mean each fight is engauging. Even trash mobs take some forethought, such as how many you can take on and who is doing what when.\n\nIndeed, while there is some rough edges to the game, the care that has gone into it is appearent. The game tries a few things to give some variety to the standard \"beat up this to win.\" For the most part, this is done sucessfully. Also, the devs are active with their game and their community, with proper reasons why something is going to be happen. They have clear goal in mind, but are also not beneath having some fun with the masses in the process.\n\nI am glad I purchased this game and dispite it's early acess status, I do recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1492910796, "timestamp_updated": 1492911759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649754", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31308489": {"recommendationid": "31308489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274472677", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486313254}, "language": "english", "review": "Really nice Game!

This game has great potential. So far? It's been pretty good. Let's get into it!\n\n\nStory: (?/10) Can't rate the story since it's not finished, but thus far (8/10)\n\nYou can't talk. You can't remember. You make funny 'ha-ha's' with your 'why?' (..Not gonna spoil that too much, but it made me laugh a bit). That's pretty much it. A story of self-discovery for the most part. Oh, right.. and you have a creepy blue avatar stalker senpai.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\n\nWhat I played was good. Fast, responsive, tactical, impactive and hard (depending on the situation). My most memorable events in this game would be taking down Apollo without a single scratch, and taking on the 'lighthouse' when it was just a 100 monster room without healing items. Got all 100 in a single go, but it was a decent challenge.\n\nWhen enemies out level you, you'll definitely feel it though. They hit like bricks. Barely take any damage, but there's a single great thing. The quests, and story itself. It feels like a good mix. There's your super serious quests, and the funny ones. Take the Legendary Bunny one as an example. It has a decent mix.\n\nThe monsters are rather interesting. From raging bulls (of doom!) to snowmen (of doom!). To the cute little bunnies, sorry bunnies but I needed those exp points.\n\nHope you like puzzles, because some of them require a bit of thinking.\n\n\nSounds: 7/10\n\nThe music is amazing, the sounds for the attacks, and various other things are great. The splash sound when you purposefully jump into the water. However, this was made only better by the most fabulous voice acting (during april fools, doesn't affect my score). The songs were catchy, though... maybe Lea should get her own unique them? I mean Apollo's got that thing going on. \"Hi... Hi.... Hi... Bye...Hi..\"\n\n\nGraphics (?/?)\n\nSorry, while the game looks amazing, I do not rate games on graphics. To be frank though, I'm still waiting on a giant rat boss.\n\n\nOverall (8.5/10)\n\n\nThis game has the potential to be something great. For the first time in a good long while. This is a game I don't want to have an end, and go on potentially forever. Of course, all great things must come to an end. This game, fortunately, will still have some surprises for me. Hopefully, the game will have quite a bit more story after collecting all the elements, but time will tell.\n\n\nNow, the big question. Is it worth the twenty dollars in its current state? Quite frankly? Yes, it's worth every penny. Despite not being entirely done, even if it doesn't (you better >.<). You still get an amazing experience for the value.\n\nAs of 11/25/2017.

For me who only played it until the the latest dungeon (current version: 0.9.1) it was amazingly gorgeous and couldn't help but to ask for more. Now we know that this is currently an \"Early Access\" title and that I shouldn't give too much praise but nonetheless I'll praise it as much as I can even if it's an \"Early Access\" title.\u00a0CrossCode is an retro-inspired game with a unique gameplay mechanic (throwing balls) and was created by Radical Fish Games. \n\n[h1]Story: How to make a reason that the main character is (almost)\u00a0mute [/h1]\nOk so the story is that you are a girl named Lea, an avatar from CrossCode which is both the name of the game and the name of the game they are playing (a game inside of a game). In the 1st chapter, skiping what I call is the prologue (because there isn't much to discuss about \"Shizuka\" and her brother \"Satoshi\" yet.) There is this avatar named Lea as she awoken to a mysterious room. There she met Sergey and Carla, both notices that she can't speak, the reason why is because there is a [b]\"Voice Modulation Error\"[/b] (an elaborate reason to make her mostly mute) but she can respond via head shaking. In that same place she learned how to throw [b]\"Virtual Ricochet Projectiles\"[/b] or [b]\"VRP's\"[/b] (or basically just balls) and learned how to use the [b]\"Virtual Proximity Impact\"[/b] or [b]\"VPI\"[/b] (or basically just a ring blade.). After learning that and talked to a bunch of people, and solve room puzzles.\nThe story is engaging from the start but loses its pace later on down the line, though curious about Lea's past and why did she have amnesia it falls down shortly (expecting the dev's will make the later parts of the game be interesting as hell) . Not saying that it is not interesting more like it is kind of a slow paced story.\n\n[h1]Gameplay: Throwing balls + fast paced action + RPG elements + TLOZ like puzzles = a very fun game[/h1]\nThis is just my opinion but, this game is surprisingly fun.The \"throwing ball\" mechanic works here with a good physics system. The 5 elements (currently just 4, neutral, heat, cold and shock) have their own strengths and weaknesses like a normal RPG has. The 5 elements gives you buffs take heat for an example, it increases your cold resistance. These elements will give your \"balls\" and your melee weapon (obviously) said elements but there is a catch to using these elements. Use too much and you will have an \"Elemental Overload\" which basically is just a cool down of the element you are using. Your default element is \"neutral\". The melee combat feel nice and rewarding, though sometimes awkward because you have to point your mouse near Lea to use melee which is fine by me. There is an exploit in using the melee and I'll let you guys find that out for yourselves.\nThe most RPG like element is the circuits and leveling-up, you can collect CP (or Circuit Points) to unlock a skill or increase your attack, defense, etc. The circuits have 5 panels corresponding to each element. To collect these \"CP's\" you will need to level with each level up's you will get 1 CP, some skills are required 2 or 4 CP to unlock therefore it is recommend that you finish the side-quests in the game as well as the main mission, or grind your way to level up or just do all of what I have said in one swoop (which I did).\u00a0\nOh there is also guarding in this game, it works fine to say at least. It feels just a bit awkward from dashing to guarding while defending yourself from hordes of enemies from all directions. The jump in this game is auto so you need to place yourself\n\n[h1]Graphics: Pixel art at its finest[/h1]\nFrom start to end the graphics looks amazing, it stayed true to its 16-bit style while adding more \"spice\" to it with the help of current knowledge and skills of modern day technology. From Rookie Harbor to So'najiz Temple the game really feels alive from my perspective (immersion), because the detail of each \"art\" was detailed. \nWhen I say detailed I really meant detailed, the expressions of Lea are truly remarkable, and a nice way to send her emotions to the players around CrossCode and us players in real life. \n\n[h1]Music: Retro, 16-bit music with a flair [/h1]\nDo you like retro, calming, and hyperactive music? Well this soundtrack is for you. Each stage has its own unique music and it really fits in. Passing by an autumn themed world with calming music to take in the world, then only to switch into a battle sound music with an enemy fighting you. I really like the music because it adds up to the immersion of the world of CrossCode and some of the soundtrack can be used for other things in real life like reading a book.\n\n[h1]Characters: The \"life\" of CrossCode[/h1]\nLea is one thing (after all she IS the main character) and the other main cast like Sergey and Emilie. Like Lea, when Emilie is on your party she reacts to new things that you are doing and what you see and Sergey helps you behind the scenes and is one of the main plot movers (he gives Lea new words to speak). Most of the time if you are going to do the side-quests you'll be dealing with the characters in CrossCode, Each has their own wants and needs, what I noticed is that what they say if they are the players in CrossCode and not the NPC's is that it reminded me when I am playing in an MMO, so there a bit of chucks and giggles here and then. Most of the people (or creature) I talked in CrossCode has been interesting even with the cliches.\n\n[h1]Overall: A great Early Access Title[/h1]\nDev's here are giving their best to complete the game and I respect them for that. Though I am praising this game too much there are some flaws too (like the auto jumping even though I don't really have any problems with it I just want to feel like I'm controlling my jumps the way I wanted it to be) but those flaws don't stop me from having a fantastic time playing this game.\nSo in result I give this game a [b]9 out of 10 [/b]\nIs it worth your money?\n\"Kinda\" if what I had said here fits your taste then don't hesitate to buy it. Even if you're not sure there is a demo on steam and their official website (http://www.cross-code.com/en/start)\nHopefully more and more updates will come and we get to see the story more.",

The game is still in EA so it has a lot of problems though. -You'll have to get used to the controls and that the characters jumps automatically. \n-The game is punishing and you'll have to redo a lot of things if you fail. Water deals damage to you and teleports you out of it. Backtracking is also a thing here. You'll see 'secrets' around the map but you cant access all of them right away. You either need an item or an ability to access them. \n-Some quests are confusing because you dont get an arrow that points to where youre supposed to go, especially if you dont play it for a couple of days. \n-The skill tree is a mess. It gives you a lot of options that are similar like single stat improvements. \n-Getting better equipment is also pain in the ass. The vendors dont require money no, they want items. Like 20 of 4 different items for one sword. Cant be bother to remember all of the requirements and where am I supposed to get them from. Some of them are just from a vendor next to them that sells that item but wants different items in return. These item chains are just dumb. The only thing you can buy with the ingame currency is average gear. \n-Dont know why they put those lines like that on the stats screen. Stat's name and value are not on the same line. its confusing for no reason. Also, there are no tooltips for the stats. Cant understand why... \n-Your sword has a weird stat you dont understand?

If you're a fan of Secrets of Grindea or the Secret of Mana series, you'll probably enjoy this game very much. However, most reviews cover the positive points of the game fairly well, so I'd like to focus on the negative aspects of the game in this review. There are two big things that I want to touch on: The environment unnecessarily being used as a puzzle, and enemies that make me wait.\n\n[h1]The Environment[/h1]\nThe backdrops and enemies are well-made, the character designs are pleasant, attack animations are fun to watch. The main issue I have with the design of this game is that it can sometimes be difficult to navigate the 3D landscape with the 2D camera. Many of the puzzles/hidden areas of the game are reached by finding climbable areas and platforming across an area, but sometimes the geography isn't completely clear. More than once I found myself walking back and forth between areas trying to find a ledge I could jump on in order to jump across the level because there was a small ledge that I'd been missing that just looked like a cliff. Other times, I try to jump from one cliff to the next, only to find that that cliff is actually higher than the one that I'm on, it just [i]looks[/i] like it's on the same level.\nAlthough I do enjoy the platforming aspect of CrossCode -- climbing around the map on different tiers of the environment is a cool way to segment areas and encounters -- this design often feels more like a puzzle that the game leans on rather than exploration. Finding paths to treasure or quests rarely feels organic. It's fine to have 'hidden' areas, or treasures that aren't [i]easy[/i] to access, but more often than not, a quest or progression quickly becomes frustrating, because I'm spending time backtracking through levels to try to find the ONE ledge that I need to climb in order to jump across the entire level.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nThe combat system is fun and compelling, the inclusion of twin-stick shooter aspects alongside the beat-em-up melee mechanics keeps things varied, while the 'circuit' system gives you a couple different special abilities to play with. The problem is that although the combat [b]system[/b] is fun, the combat [b]itself[/b] often drags. As you progress into the game, you begin running into enemies that require a lot of waiting around. The first such enemy you run into is some kind of mole/gopher/groundhog that runs away if you close into melee range; that's easy enough, the game is teaching me that sometimes I need to use my ranged attack. I get it, that's cool.\nBut eventually, you start running into enemies that are armored. Your damage to these enemies is negligible at best, so you're often left waiting for them to use a certain attack in order to Break them, at which point you're allowed to do damage. A lot of these enemies are only armored on one side, so theoretically you should just be able to get behind them to do damage, but in practice, the way that the enemies lock onto you and track your movement, this is next to impossible until, as before, the enemies use a certain attack that leaves them dazed or facing a certain direction. I hate this. I hate waiting around for these stupid goats to shoot their stupid horns at stupid me so that I can kill them. I've got places to be, I don't have time to wait on these jerks. Maybe I'm dealing with armored enemies the wrong way, and there's a lesson I missed at some point, but right now, as much as I enjoy the Break system, I cannot stress how much I [i]dislike[/i] waiting around to use it in order to be allowed to progress in a completely routine encounter.\n\n[h1]Closing Thoughts[/h1]\nOverall, CrossCode is a very fun throwback to the golden age of RPGs. I'd like for the story to be revealed a [i]little[/i] faster; I'm 15 hours in and I still have no idea why I'm [spoiler]stuck(?) inside the game[/spoiler] or how the introduction scene ties in to everything. I don't have an easy solution for the level design, because that's just kind of how the game is made at this point. For the combat, I'd like to see either a built-in counter system (one that doesn't require me to accrue SP to unlock it at the cost of something else) or some other mechanic that allows me to bypass armor, even if it's just temporarily -- some sort of default skill-based mechanic that can be used as an alternative to waiting to use the built-in Break system.\n\nOn a positive note, I do want to mention the text editor feature. I [b]love[/b] the fact that the developers have built a tool into their Early Access game that allows me to provide direct feedback to them regarding the game's dialogue. Sometimes it's a little confusing (is this written wrong or does this NPC have a dialect or speech quirk?), but as a grammar freak, I [i]really[/i] appreciate this tool, and I wish it was included in more games.\n\nOverall, great game, I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1492416110, "timestamp_updated": 1492416110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31170974": {"recommendationid": "31170974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283879697", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506106042}, "language": "english", "review": "BRILLIANT!!!!!

They of course give you a taste of this in the Demo which you should for sure check out. and then buy this game.\n\nThe strongest part of this game is the puzzles around the world and in the dungeons. They are tough, but very rewarding to figure out, it's like 2D old school Tomb Raider Mixed with Zelda, IMO.\n\nThis is an EA title, But as stated, it's got a demo, just try a little...", "timestamp_created": 1491257772, "timestamp_updated": 1491627372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30931794": {"recommendationid": "30931794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077099570", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491263685}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is, even after just only an hour in, incredible. as i said, i'm not very far in, so i can't say much about the story, but every aspect of the gameplay is incredibly smooth and crisp. it's quite satisfying. if i remember, i'll come edit this review once i can say whether or not the story is good, but if you don't care much about the story, i highly recommend picking this up.", "timestamp_created": 1491257677, "timestamp_updated": 1491257677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30927879": {"recommendationid": "30927879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357801978", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495460640}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u89e3\u5bc6\u8981\u7d20\u591a\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u7565\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u65e5\u540e\u80fd\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1491242762, "timestamp_updated": 1491242762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30923848": {"recommendationid": "30923848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058651293", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499157915}, "language": "schinese", "review": "We need Chinese language~~~\n\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u52a8\u4f5cRPG\n\u753b\u9762\u989c\u8272\u8212\u670d\n\u6e38\u620f\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u505a\u5f97\u4e0d\u9519\n\u4eba\u7269\u7acb\u7ed8\u8868\u60c5\u751f\u52a8\u6709\u8da3\n\u5973\u4e3b\u662f\u65e0\u53e3\u5c5e\u6027\u5374\u611f\u89c9\u5f88\u9017\n\u6218\u6597\u624b\u611f\u6d41\u7545\n\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u89e3\u5bc6\u8981\u7d20\n\u4e2a\u4eba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6e38\u620f\u503c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c", "timestamp_created": 1491229689, "timestamp_updated": 1491229689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30918429": {"recommendationid": "30918429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314966311", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505207502}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u8d85\u7ea7\u68d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u73a9\u7684\u4eba\u8fd9\u4e48\u5c11\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\n\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u88ab\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u8981\u7d20\u975e\u5e38\u591a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u73a9\u5f88\u4e45\n\u4eba\u7269\u523b\u753b\u548c\u5267\u60c5\u90fd\u662f\u5230\u4f4d\u7684\uff08\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd8\u662fEA\u9636\u6bb5\uff09\n\u573a\u666f\u89e3\u5bc6\u975e\u5e38\u68d2", "timestamp_created": 1491209240, "timestamp_updated": 1492616517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30911940": {"recommendationid": "30911940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365916872", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509405449}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game~!

Trigger?  No, there is no time travel or parallel universes (that we know of, this game's story is only at the start of the beta, the rest is just gameplay) but the visuals and the music make it feel very much like it.\nIs it Legend of Zelda? No, but the puzzles and dungeons require players to pay attention to the controls and push the game's physics and their own understanding of the game's limits to advance.\nIs it Guardian Legend?  No, there's no flight, but Lea is very much inspired by the NES heroine, and her 'spheromancer' abilities make her very adapatable to your own play style (Like melee? Increase your melee and defense stats.  Like range? Increase your attack and HP.)  Like Guardian Legend, the game looks fun as a spectator, but is deceptively harder than it lets on.\nIs it Final Fantasy X?  No, but the circuit system is very reminiscent of the Sphere Grid.\n\nIt's a well thought out 2D Platformer mixing together what works in a lot of games into one cohesive RPG.  And it's enough to forgive the 'grindy' nature of the quests and missions.  Yes, there's a lot of defeats on mobs needed to collect 7-20% chance drops of items you need, but with a diversity of quests to choose from, a lot of the missions overlap, so progress on one mission helps another without you realizing it.\n\nAnd yes, the jump puzzles can be frustrating.  But that's because they're EVERYWHERE.  Crosscode loves hiding things in plain sight.  If you walk past a location on a map to head from Point A to Point B, you'll ignore the shrubs and bushes hiding items.  You'll miss where the screen scrolls past a drop-off to a hidden cave.  You'll miss treasure.  And Lea's jump ability can't really be enhanced.  You're just as capable to find these places at the start as you are at the end.\n\nAnd like Metroid, Crosscode is meticulous in it's 'fencing'.  Without earning 'shades', you can't get past fences to high-level encounters, so there's little chance of stomping into a place where a Robo-Goat will kick your teeth in.  Certain areas, you'll need elemental powers to bypass barricades.  If someone can figure out a way to 'cheat' these barricades, you kind of have to respect them for doing so, as again nothing in this game is easy.\n\nI fell in love with this game on GOG and I bought it a total of three times to support it... (once on GOG to play it, twice on Steam: as a gift to someone else, and again to write this review for you) that's as good of an endorsement as I can give to Crosscode.

O jogo conta com puzzles, sistema de rank nas batalhas, \u00e1rvore de habilidades com 5 elementos naturais, sidequests, uma enciclop\u00e9dia bem vasta que cataloga desde inimigos at\u00e9 bot\u00e2nica e mem\u00f3rias da protagonista. \u00c9 Early Access, mas \u00e9 muito completo e rende muitas horas de jogatina.

Dia desses peguei essa beleza pra dar uma chance, j\u00e1 que tinha na biblioteca parado, como muitos outros. Para a minha surpresa, CrossCode resgatou o mesmo sentimento que tinha jogando Legend of Mana e Digimon World 3, ambos para PS1. Tem v\u00e1rios fatores que contribuem pra sentir esse abra\u00e7o virtual de um jogo, mas alguns s\u00e3o fundamentais e CrossCode certamente os carrega. S\u00e3o eles: a [i]imers\u00e3o do jogo[/i] e a [i]soundtrack[/i]. A OST tem muitas vezes uma pegada meio sintetizadora que lembra bastante os sons de Megaman X4, que corroboram a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o futur\u00edstica. Mas \u00e9 poss\u00edvel encontrar alguns ritmos diferentes, como uma bossa nova dando boas-vindas na primeira cidade do jogo, te deixando mais \u00e0 vontade que as musiquinhas de supermercado pela manh\u00e3. \n\nO cen\u00e1rio, por sua vez, casa com a soundtrack e d\u00e1 a base perfeita que voc\u00ea precisa para imergir no jogo de cabe\u00e7a, de ponta, com a m\u00e3o no bolso. At\u00e9 porque, a jogabilidade se encarrega do resto. Eu explico: CrossCode basicamente \u00e9 um jogo single player com tem\u00e1tica de MMORPG. \u00c9 como se o seu personagem de Ragnar\u00f6k fosse o personagem principal de todo o enredo, s\u00f3 que em CrossCode voc\u00ea n\u00e3o cria algu\u00e9m do zero. Voc\u00ea controla Lea, uma quase silence protagonist (a explica\u00e7\u00e3o disso \u00e9 inclusive bem divertida). O mundo de CrossCode \u00e9 realmente um jogo [dentro do jogo] onde as pessoas est\u00e3o logadas, ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea encontra muitas refer\u00eancias interessantes e t\u00edpicas de jogadores. Isso se torna mais bacana ainda nos dias de hoje, j\u00e1 que esse g\u00eanero ficou para tr\u00e1s. Ou seja, quem viveu a \u00e9poca desse g\u00eanero, vai se divertir com as refer\u00eancias, e quem n\u00e3o viveu provavelmente vai desenvolver uma certa curiosidade. Al\u00e9m desse mote, os elementos visuais s\u00e3o muito caprichados. Tudo se mistura! \u00c1rvore com circuitos, bodes com patas mec\u00e2nicas, tendas de vendedores com displays de hologramas... \u00c9 uma mistura muito bem feita para justamente mostrar aquele aspecto de fantasia clich\u00ea de MMORPG de maneira amig\u00e1vel. Ah, inclusive os personagens d\u00e3o Log-out de CrossWorlds (o MMO) no decorrer da hist\u00f3ria.\n\nO gameplay consiste em voc\u00ea recuperar a mem\u00f3ria de Lea jogando o MMO. Para isso, voc\u00ea segue a hist\u00f3ria principal e linear de CrossWorlds e conta com sidequests de escolha optativa. O combate tem ataques de curta e longa dist\u00e2ncia. Voc\u00ea pode dar uns slashs em quem tiver perto ou mirar para jogar umas esferas nos imigos, ocasionando maior din\u00e2mica na jogabilidade. Lea tamb\u00e9m conta com uma \u00e1rvore de habilidades de 5 elementos que \u00e9 constru\u00edda com pontos adquiridos nos avan\u00e7os de level e conforme a hist\u00f3ria caminha. Nas batalhas h\u00e1 um sistema de chain igual em Devil May Cry, onde s\u00e3o atribu\u00eddos ranks que influenciam na raridade do loot que voc\u00ea recolhe dos inimigos.\n\nNa minha opini\u00e3o, CrossCode \u00e9 f\u00e1cil demais. Como em Legend of Mana, a personagem sai ilesa em casa combate, tornando os itens us\u00e1veis um pouco obsoletos. [i]Por\u00e9m[/i], alguns puzzles podem dar um n\u00f3 na cabe\u00e7a, algumas rotas podem n\u00e3o parecer t\u00e3o \u00f3bvias (o mapa \u00e9 gigante!) e o grind vai ocupar bastante seu tempo. Com a lore simulando um \u00f3timo MMORPG, CrossCode tem como diferencial a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o e experi\u00eancia pessoal de cada jogador, indo mais al\u00e9m do que somente batalhas e constru\u00e7\u00e3o de habilidades. Para n\u00e3o ser duro, admito que houveram quests e bosses que [strike]me tiraram do s\u00e9rio[/strike] demandaram um tempinho pra vencer.\n\n[h1]Recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o[/h1]\n\nCrossCode conta com um gabarito excelente e \u00e9 um joga\u00e7o! Normalmente sou descrente de jogos com [i]Early Access[/i], mas esse da\u00ed me pareceu muito completo, mesmo n\u00e3o finalizado. Tudo \u00e9 caprichado e est\u00e1 me rendendo horas de jogatina. Se voc\u00ea se encantou com o trailer e screenshots e n\u00e3o tem certeza se realmente vale a pena, pode se perdoar. O jogo \u00e9 realmente isso tudo! Agora pega aquela sua toca do Poring que voc\u00ea nunca teve coragem de usar em p\u00fablico, pluga o joystick, abre o cheetos lua de parmes\u00e3o e uma Pepsi bolada, n\u00e3o necessariamente nessa ordem, e confira essa obra de arte que ainda promete trazer muitas novidades! :)\n\nD\u00e1 [b]AQUELA[/b] jogada em CrossCode!!", "timestamp_created": 1490737761, "timestamp_updated": 1490793950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621622", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30801718": {"recommendationid": "30801718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012126098", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489835880}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing combat, catchy story, character build.

The developers feed on the rage of the players. Without our agony the developers cannot succeed.\"\n\nI almost cried reading that, and I understood why.\n\nI have been looking for an actual RPG game for a while now and CrossCode filled that void. A great story, great combat, and a very pleasent developer team. Being a fan of the whole variety of games, CrossCode was a bit of a shock when I realized the game wasn't just another cut out of the RPG cloth.\n\nIt carries elements from several genres:\nRPG (Obviously): Giving into the classical feeling of a Megaman or Zelda-esk stlye CrossCode has an \"almost\" cliche story involving Amnesia and a broken voice module. Avoiding the classic silent protagonist and going with an almost silent one (Who by the way has a very wide range of reactions even without most of her speaking abilities) allows for solid communication and in most cases relatability.\n\nRTS: The entire combat system is Real time, and YOU have the decision to keep going on your fighting streak. (Although the terminology BLOOD LUST comes to mind) The games fighting aspect is not easy either, most enemies require a specific strategy to deal damage, and in some cases, won't even take damage unless you perform a set of actions before hand. (I'm looking at you Phoenix, I have a special set of words for your ice dungeon BS)\n\nStory-Driven: Or if you'd prefer a visual novel. Every character you interact with has a personality, random people hanging out nearby, random people in the combat areas, every single NPC. There isn't a single NPC who doesn't feel unique from the other, and the developers have done an amazing job at upholding this level of seriousness. Your party members feel like real people, they have lives outside of CrossCode and it works as a solid excuse to pause the game and add to the building story of Lea. Oh yes, Lea, you amnesia ridden woman you. Besides having amnesia, Lea has a speech problem, apparantly, in which is made up by her sense of humor expressed through her responses. \n\nGrinding: I LOVE BL2 and grinding was a huge part of it, so to face a small amount really didn't phase me much. This game does have a grinding aspect (It has a mission literally built on grinding, but more on that later.) but it isn't as bad as some RPG games would make it. The chances of things dropping are relatively high, and if you are willing to search, you will find what you need.\n\nPuzzles: NYEH....Thats dead now.\nTo put it simply, this game has a major play on the puzzles aspect, and is the thing that the dungeons are built on. If you play this game, don't go in not expecting your brain to be challenged, because I can promise you, you will not get away without feeling slightly aggervated at one puzzle or the next. Don't worry, you'll figure it out, it might take you a few days, but I totally believe in you. (Please make guide on how to puzzle, these developers abuse my puzzle privledges.)\n\nIn all, CrossCode, is it the next big thing?\nPossibly.\nIs it a definite success?\nPretty sure it already is.\nIs it worth my money?\nYep, if you want it in early access that is.\n\nNormally, this would be the point I go on some rant about early access but I cant help but praise the developers on this.\nIn two years they succesfully stayed on track for updates and releases, and I have yet to see them fail.\nSo, congrats on being an actual succesful early dev team, you just outdid 90% of the other teams.\nGood luck on release day, I see this game exploding on that day, its got a wonderful community and a great team to keep it together, and I look forward to seeing whats next in your work.",

start.\nI'mma start at the fundaments of this game, while trying to not spoil any little thing.\nThe design of the game and it's mechanics.\nIf you've played lots of Zelda games in the past, like me, you'll soon realize that CrossCode feels very reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda's Dungeons, even though they are far from being alike.\nAnd I can tell you why that is.\nPLAY stands in the center of this game.\nWhile these days, most titles like the Uncharted series or Outlast have the common theme of having a set story in mind, where a game is designed around, which is not bad don't get me wrong-\nCrossCode is wholely designed around it's base mechanics, which are a well balanced, quick paced with a smooth feeling action combat system, simple but hard to master movement, an easily learned level-up and skill system, latter one being called \"Circuits\" in this game and the means to balance all that out.\nWhat this game does is work out a basic mechanic for whatever place you're in and build the entire world around it, placing tricky but great puzzles throughout your way, making those progressively harder to ease you into using your abilities, while also offering a fantastic pacing.\nDid I mention how great the puzzles are in design and theme?\nI dare say they even outmatch the ones in classic Zelda dungeons.\nNow, with that out of the way, let's address the Characters, World and Story.\nThis one will contain very, very mild spoilers about the basic idea of the setting.\nCrossCode places you inside the world of the online game \"CrossWorlds\", which is basically an enhanced version of a VR game, where you control a virtual character in a physical enviroment.\nIt's not actually a multiplayer game for you, though.\nThat's just the story.\nThat concept itself isn't THAT new, I guess, but it's put out in a very charming and appealing way.\nThe characters are a bit stereotypical, but also that- in a very charming way.\nThey all have their very own, intriguing personality and I must admit that they kinda grew onto me while I played through the several parts of the yet unfinished story.\nThat story by the way, I'm VERY eager to see how it ends up. \nWith what's in the game so far, I'm super excited to experience more of it.\nAnd before you worry about the game never being fully finished, you should check the release-schedule for the game.\nYou can find that in the forums here on steam, or on gamejolt.\nThat being said, the game devs are ever working on this beautiful masterpiece and it's steadily growing bigger and better.\nAll in all, I could not NOT recommend this game to everyone.\nYES, it is unfinished, but it's SO GOOD!\nFrom both, a personal, and an objective and substantial point of view.\nDo not miss out on this game, you would

These boss fights allow for the player to learn the bosses attack patterns and how to beat it in the best way possible, even if it takes a couple of tries.\n+Devs are active\n+Beatiful retro graphics\n+Very interesting concept of a singleplayer game about an MMO, but you can even invite the \"players\" to your party. I think this will be really cool in the finished game\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Although I am going to list some, I do not think these cons actually apply, seeing as the game is in early access and is still being developed.\n\nCons:\n-There is no way to mark quests on the map yet, so turning them back in can be difficult, especially if you have bad memory (me)\n-Tutorials for skills are a bit buggy, but again, early access\n\nOverall, I think this is a great game, even in early access.\n", "timestamp_created": 1489776975, "timestamp_updated": 1489776975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30571180": {"recommendationid": "30571180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118380123", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489813823}, "language": "russian", "review": "Cross Code -

I have not completed the game, and some parts of this review will be out of pure speculation. I will update this review at some point to reflect the final version.\n\nCrossCode is a top-down hack-slash RPG that takes place inside an MMORPG. And it is awesome and immersive. No seriously, at times, I actually felt like I was playing CrossWorlds, the MMORPG that CrossCode is set in. Players (as in \"you\") play the role of Lea, a mute amnesiac who was a former player of the game but, due to the amnesia, had to start over (with the help of the game's programmers), which unfortunately caused problems with her voice module (making her mute). Her eventual goal is to get to Rhombus Square, which was the place she last was before she lost her memory, in the hopes that that'll fix things. Along the way, she partners up with a player named Emilie and another player named C'Thon.\n\nOh right, you want to know about the gameplay. Alright then.\n\nCrossCode is, as I've said, a top-down hack-slash RPG. Lea has three main attacks; a melee swipe, a quick projectile throw, and a slower, charged projectile throw. As you defeat enemies (which respawn periodically around the map, and usually don't attack you if you just leave them alone), your rank goes up (rank functions like a combat meter), and a higher rank gives you better item drops and more XP/currency. Accruing enough XP allows you to level up, which allows you to unlock skills, abilities, and upgrades via the in-game skill tree. Currency is used for buying and trading items, which will further serve to strengthen Lea's stats.\n\n(It should be noted that while you only need 1000 XP per level to level up, the XP gains of everything decrease per level. It helps to think of the XP gains as permillages of the required XP to level up.)\n\nAt the start, enemies in the game are fairly easy to beat and require no skill or thought at all; just mindless attack-attack-attack. However, this soon gets thrown out the window with the first boss, which requires you to be able to dodge attacks well. A fair amount of the game's combat is based around dodging, at least if you're not strong enough to completely pulverize everything in your path and/or tank the damage; often in the game, you can end up in a situation where you fall prey to a short series of high-powered attacks from different enemies and have half your lifebar depleted.\n\nBesides the dodging, almost all enemies seem to have a different strategy for tackling them. This is most pronounced with the bosses, which are often armoured, and usually require you to attack them from behind, or hit a weak-spot enough times to stun it before going in for the kill. However, many non-bosses also follow a similar pattern; attack them at just the right time (usually when they're charging for an attack), and you can completely stun them for a bit.\n\nThe aforementioned skill tree allows you to unlock skills for use in combat. One skill allows you to do a giant whirling slash with your blade; another allows you to fire a quick volley of projectiles in a narrow beam, and so on. These \"combat arts\", as they are called, require 1 SP each to use (out of a total SP of 4). The first SP recharges over time, but the other 3 SP need to be gained by attacking enemies with normal attacks.\n\nThe game has four different \"elements\" you can use when in combat, plus a fifth no-element. Each element can damage some enemies more than others, and each has their own specific combat skills. That giant whirling slash? That's now a whirling slash, ON FIRE. However, it should be noted that using an element in combat for too long results in \"elemental overload\", which forces you into no-element combat for a cooldown.\n\nEmilie and C'Thon, the two other members of your party, will naturally fight alongside you. You can command their combat behaviours (e.g. which enemy they attack) via an in-game menu (which also allows you to use healing items, as well as point out key items/NPCs/enemies on the screen). If either one dies, they come back into battle after a minute or so; if you die, however, it's game over and you start from the very beginning of the room, having lost all your loot and XP from said combat session.\n\nIn short, the combat is very smooth and, in a way, therapeutic. It is, however, not easy; especially in some areas of the map, where your party members aren't with you. It can be easy to get complacent with letting them do the work, until you stumble upon such a region and everything becomes three times harder.\n\nIn addition to the hack-slash gameplay, the world also has some number of puzzle dungeons with switches in them (I think four, but I'm not too sure as I haven't get played that far). Said puzzle-dungeons are Legend-of-Zelda-like, in that they first introduce some new mechanics that work with the tools you already have. Then you're given a new tool (which also grants you an element to use in combat), and presented with some puzzles involving that. Overall, the puzzles can be very difficult at times, but all are fair.\n\nInterspersed within each puzzle dungeon are a number of combat sections (without Emilie and C'Thon), which must be passed in order to progress. I'm not a huge fan of these as I'm not quite so great at hack-slashers, but I'm sure many people do need breaks from puzzling (unlike me), so while I personally might not enjoy these sections, I'm sure others won't mind it.\n\nThere are multiple \"secret\" crates scattered around all the levels, too. These are usually tucked away in locations that aren't easy to reach; oftentimes you'll need to jump up a few ledges, then parkour your way across the map to get to said crates. Later on, you'll need to hit switches to open up paths so you can keep parkouring. Said crates contain useful loot, like health/quest items or weapons.\n\nCrossCode, being an RPG, obviously has sidequests. These can be of the form \"acquire these set of items\", \"find these things on the map\", or \"defeat these enemies\". Each sidequest comes with a recommended level, so you know when a quest is out of your depth. Still, there's nothing stopping you from just going around and accepting every single quest you come across, while biding your time before you're of a strong enough level to do said quests.\n\nThe humour in the game is quite nice. Owing to Lea's muteness (except for the word \"Hi\" which was manually programmed in), a good few conversations of the game make some reference or another to this (e.g. \"If there's anything that's troubling you, just say! I feel better talking to you already!\"). Some other conversations make reference to the NPCs not being actual people and hence having limited interactions (combined with Lea's muteness, this results in the NPCs just saying their pre-scripted dialogue). There are puns (the main part of the CrossWorlds world is called The Crossant due to its shape, and one important item you can get is called the \"Hi-Sandwich\").\n\nAs it is now, remember that the game is still in Early Access, so the game is indeed incomplete; at one point, a dialogue box popped up saying that \"This marks the temporary end of the story for this version\" (but it still allowed me to play on); at another point, I collected a key to a building only to find that the interior of said building was inaccessible. However, in this case, I think it's justified; the scope of this game is so large that it's not at all unreasonable to ask for feedback/bugtesting from a community.\n\nIn short, a well-crafted game. It's the only game so far that I've actually had to stop playing because my eyes hurt. I've clocked over 20 hours so far, and I'm still not halfway-through.

Es verbindet den Charm und die Systematik alter Konsolenklassiker mit den M\u00f6glichkeiten moderner Technik und der Erfahrung etlicher Jahre erfolgreicher Spieleentwicklung. \n\nVom Desing orientiert sich Crosscode an den alten Konsolenklassikern, zeichnet sich aber durch eine modernere Aufl\u00f6sung aus die einen unweit gr\u00f6\u00dferen Detailreichtum zul\u00e4sst. Die liebevoll gestaltete Spielwelt kombiniert europ\u00e4ische und asiatische Baustile und eine exotische Fauna, zu einer Umgebung in der man gerne einige Stunden verbringt.\n\n\nDas Spiel nutzt den Umstand, das es sich in einer MMORPG Welt bewegt aus, um allgemeine Klischees dieses Genres auf eine sehr am\u00fcsante selbstironische Art zu bedienen. Auch das Mangadesing der Charaktere f\u00fcgt sich hervorragend in dieses Bild. Fans dieses Stils werden begeistert sein. Skeptiker sollten sich nicht abgeschreckt f\u00fchlen.   \n\nGruppenmitglieder welche die Protagonistin begleiten schalten sich auch auserhalb von K\u00e4mpfen durch Dialoge ein, sorgen somit f\u00fcr eine gewisse Gruppendynamik und erhalten Pers\u00f6nlichkeit.\n\nQuests und K\u00e4mpfe sind hervorragen gebalanced. Viele Quests errinern sehr an die Sammelquests der MMOs (was beabsichtigt ist) erspahren dem Spieler aber das herumgehetze zwischen den Questgebern, da sie sich nebenher von selbst erledigen. Die Hauptquest verspricht interessant zu werden, um eine Aussage \u00fcber ihre G\u00fcte machen zu k\u00f6nnen ist mein Spielvortschritt allerdings nicht gro\u00df genug. Die F\u00e4higkeiten des Avatars auszunutzen ist f\u00fcr einen Sieg in konfrontationen unerl\u00e4sslich und sorgt daf\u00fcr das K\u00e4mpfe jederzeit eine angenehme Herausvorderung darstellen ohne dabei zu frustrieren.\n\n  \nDas Skillsystem ist hochvariabel und komplex l\u00e4sst sich aber unkompliziert an den Pr\u00e4ferenzen des Spielers ausrichten. Auch eine gro\u00dfe Auswahl an Gegenst\u00e4nden steht zur Verf\u00fcgung, die  Vorteile f\u00fcr bestimmte Arten des K\u00e4mpfens mit sich bringen. \n\nIm Moment ist es nicht m\u00f6glich das Spiel, aufgrund seines Early Acsess Stadiums, durchspielen. Die begehbaren Teile der Welt sind jedoch fertig und ansprechend. Die grundlegenden Funktionen des Spiels sind manigfaltig und \u00fcberraschenderweise bereits praktisch vollst\u00e4ndig ausgebaut und anwendbar. Bisher sind mir keine Bugs zugesto\u00dfen. Dieses Spiel ist ein Paradebeispiel daf\u00fcr wie Early Acsess funktionieren sollte.\n\nFazit: F\u00fcr jeden Fan von alten Titeln wie Chrono Trigger ist CrossCode ein muss. Early Acsess: In diesem Fall kein Problem. Alles in allem wei\u00df ich im Moment nur positives zu berichten. Die weitere Entwicklung bleibt spannend. Ich k\u00f6nnte mehr schreiben aber schon jetzt liest sich das warscheinlich keiner mehr durch.^^", "timestamp_created": 1489004266, "timestamp_updated": 1489004266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586007", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30394189": {"recommendationid": "30394189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146459619", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491923128}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing gameplay.\nBeautiful Art.\nCrossCode.\nDeadly Skill trees.\nEverything is just awesome about this game.\nFinishing of this review I'd like to say adding a PVP or Multiplayer Arcade would make this game much more fun to play with friends.\nGreat game. 10/10 \nBig thanks for all the people involved in making this game, would look at more of this kind after this game is finished.", "timestamp_created": 1488992198, "timestamp_updated": 1488992198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30389015": {"recommendationid": "30389015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126363854", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511451297}, "language": "english", "review": "plot is kinda meh.. but other than that, it's a MASTERPIECE.", "timestamp_created": 1488971530, "timestamp_updated": 1488971530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30385157": {"recommendationid": "30385157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066935988", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505006803}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Esse jogo \u00e9 incr\u00edvel, a jogabilidade, a m\u00fasica, as dungeons.

It reminds me a lot about Legend of Zelda game design, and definitely encourages backtracking if you want to complete everything.\n\nFor starters, the open world has a lot of monsters and combat. Some puzzles/jump puzzles scattered around the open world. Followed by dungeons which have minimal combat and lots of puzzles. Then you have a mini-boss which is followed by attaining a new item and then you must use new item to complete the rest of the dungeon and defeat the dungeon boss. \n\nVery much like Zelda in terms of design.\n\nAs for the combat, it's [b]incredibly responsive and fluid[/b]. You don't find many games like this that have as responsive combat as this one. It's also very fast-paced and and encourages you to fight multiple enemies at once rather than a single one.\n\n[b]My only issues are listed below[/b]:\n\n[list]\n[*]FPS is capped at 60, but can be removed if you disable V-Sync for the game using your GPU's software. Also if you have dual monitors, [b]any[/b] dynamic content on either monitor besides CrossCode will drastically drop your FPS. This also applies to any programs using [b]Hardware Acceleration[/b], such as Discord or DeepBot.\n\n[*]Melee and Ranged are bound to the same button. Your character will perform an action based on how far your cursor is distanced from your character. Can cause frustrations when you want to melee but accidentally start range attacking.\n\n[*]There is no exclusive fullscreen mode. This is not to be confused with borderless fullscreen mode. This might be a limitation of the engine they are using for the game though. However this means that users of Win8, Win10, and Win7+Aero Enabled will suffer some input lag and in extreme cases, low frame rate.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1488843554, "timestamp_updated": 1488863323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626079", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30362589": {"recommendationid": "30362589", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992837846", "num_games_owned": 474, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508036046}, "language": "english", "review": "So far I've only played the Tutorial, but I'm really digging the story telling, the art, the design, the .. well a lot of it.

I started out using an XBox controller (first 5 or so hours) but I had ordered a steam controller which, in my opinion, is the absolute best control option due to how customizable it is. Using the tracpad to aim and rebinding the right stick click to shoot while also having attack on right bumper for melee makes it very easy to quickly switch between melee and ranged combat. for those of you who don't know, the combat is a little unorthodox but I think the system works well. If the right stick is in the neutral position, pressing right bumper will do a melee attack. if you move the right stick, an aiming reticle will show up in the direction you point the stick and pressing right bumper will throw projectiles. since both attacks are bound to one button, you may occasionally do a ranged attack instead of a melee attack or vice versa. this isn't really a huge issue since both are very powerful if used effectively. I haven't beaten the game yet as of me writing this review, but the 22 hours I have spent were an absolute blast. The combat is this game's strongest point by far, only matched by the diversity of the countless quests you will come across. Some quests have you helping someone track down a thief, while others have you fight a horde of regular enemies followed by a really strong version of an enemy you've fought before which forces you to apply everything you learned fighting the regular enemies. between dashing, blocking, ranged attacks and melee attacks, and specials for each of the categories, the combat is incredibly fun and deep. This is one of my favorite games on steam right now due to how jam-packed it is with things to do. One of my other favorite games at the moment is Secrets of Grindea.

Every area of the game is chock full of amazing pixelart and so much charm oozing out of it.\n\nThe music in the game is also phenomenal and consists of many styles, from boss tracks that get your fighting spirit pumping, to the calm friendliness of Rookie Harbor's theme.\n\nThe artstyle of the game is sort of a hybrid between Secret of Mana and Phantasy Star Online and creates this vibrant and colourful look to the game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe game looks and sounds good yes, but what about the gameplay?\n\nLuckily the combat is as every bit as fantastic as the Art and Sound design. It's responsive, fast and definitely well balanced with the emphasis based on the players skill. The leveling is luckily very fast with the help of Quests and the game doesn't turn into a grindfest, so you can enjoy the game at your own pace.\n\nTo spice things up the game also features [b]dungeons[/b], which are full of all kinds of challenges for the player to tackle. At the end of a dungeon there is usually a bossfight, which usually put up a good fight.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nSet in a VRMMO called CrossWorlds, the player assumes the role of Lea. An amnesiac, mute, girl who is playing the game in order to get her memories back. During her adventure she meets other players such as Emilie, a competetive young girl, Apollo, the overdramatic wannabe superhero and many others.\n\n[h1]Criticisms[/h1]\n\nI think CrossCode is a phenomenal experience and well worth your money, but the game is in Early Access and as such is not complete, which is a damn shame, because the story is really well done and suffers heavily from the bit-by-bit form of releasing the main story, and even though the dungeons are fun, some of them are a bit bland and the music may get repetitive to some people.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nOverall, the game is bloody fantastic. Well written, great looking, good sounding and greatly playable, This indie ARPG does so many things right it's downright amazing how much Radical Fish Games have put their effort in this.\n\nBut if you are considering buying this, be warned that the story is not complete.\n\n9/10\n[b]Fantastic[/b]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1488409224, "timestamp_updated": 1488409224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30265867": {"recommendationid": "30265867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070510797", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488852887}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game that offers enjoyable puzzles and satisfying skill tree.", "timestamp_created": 1488396901, "timestamp_updated": 1488396901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30261707": {"recommendationid": "30261707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047052766", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492130740}, "language": "english", "review": "Addicting", "timestamp_created": 1488381098, "timestamp_updated": 1488381098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30256386": {"recommendationid": "30256386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192342795", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495119626}, "language": "schinese", "review": "G O O D    G A M E   \uff01", "timestamp_created": 1488357485, "timestamp_updated": 1498665196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497942", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30254222": {"recommendationid": "30254222", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982594046", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506065446}, "language": "english", "review": "God DAMN! \nThis game just hit me in the Face like a Brick thrown by the Hulk!\n\nno srsly, its aweseome, nice story, nice visuals, nice progression, nice skilltree..\nand shieet the combat.. i love the combat! xD\nits very hard, demanding and at the same time rewarding. \ntotaly perfect balance for what i love most in sp-rpgs! \n\ngood job guys!", "timestamp_created": 1488344334, "timestamp_updated": 1488344334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585799", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30243243": {"recommendationid": "30243243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282165503", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510060858}, "language": "english", "review": "The godliest game I have played in a while.

For the time being as of the current version (0.8.5), Steam says I played for 42 hours, in-game time 34. The only things I have yet to do are completing the botanic analysis and finding about 20 chests in the jungle area.\n\nI discovered this game while checking my Steam recommandations and I remember quite well thinking upon seeing the character design \"this one seems nice, might as well checking the store page\". At first, while looking at the screenshots, I wasn't really impressed, since the game seems to have been made using RPG Maker (it's not, it uses HTML 5 and another engine don't remember the name), although I was quite intrigued by the overwhemingly positive reviews. Then, I noticed there was a demo. I tried it the day after...\n\nUpon playing it, I was amazed : \" This game looks like the perfect combination between Zelda, Seiken Densetsu (Mana Series), YS and Alundra gameplay-wise. And the world's background seems like a mix between Phantasy Star and .hack// , That's an awesome idea !\". And you know what ? That was only the prologue (the original indiegogo campain demo was much bigger).\n\nEager for more, I instantly bought the early access, and then, I just could'nt let go of this game (I still can't actually). Let's see why.\n\nThe game takes place on another planet, CrossWorlds, which is actually a MMORPG using augmented reality. You'll be controlling Lea, a female avatar belonging to the spheromancer class (That means throwing BALLS everywhere). However, Lea has two important problems : she's an amnesiac (Yeah, that's clich\u00e9, but I don't mind it) and has a disability with her talking functions. In short, she's almost mute, only able to say basic words such as \"Hi !\". Then, Lea travels trough CrossWorlds, looking for answers, helping and being helped by various characters along the way.\n\nYeah, nothing special about it, still I can't really judge the story in this version : it ends before going in the second temple, and the adventure is still about discovering the world at this point. But I can say for sure the main characters are charming, especially Lea. Do not misunderstand this : Lea is not almost mute to make the player identify to the character, she's really, REALLY expressive. Just by looking at her portraits, you can easily imagine what she's thinking, and you will love her for that. The world's backstory is also pretty interesting, and I want to see more of it, hopefully soon enough ^^\n\nThe game looks better in-game that on the screenshots : Detailled background and sprites, smooth animations and some very nice views. Exploring CrossWorlds is a pleasure to the eyes, if you like 16-Bits artsyle (Although, I think a game like this never could have been released on a 16-bits system at this time, it probably had to wait until Saturn and PSX). I'll nitpick only regarding the basic NPC portraits, which contrast a lot with the others, but Radical Fish members are working on it.\n\nMusic seems like a combination between Phantasy Star Online and Secret of Mana, most of the themes are very peaceful and help you throughout thinking (and you will do that a lot). Battles themes are more aggressive. Overall, a really good soundtrack, maybe it lacks for the time being more battle themes.\n\nAnd the gameplay... where do I begin with ? There are not that much different environments and areas (except the jungle, which is huge), but I can assure you : there's a lot of exploring to do if you're just a bit curious. Most of the chests or plants are in plain sight, reaching them though... that's another story. The game will then takes the form of parkour puzzles, and you will search an answer to it just because this chest is looking down at you, mocking you. Each new zone gains in complexity regarding level-design, and you'll soon discover you'll have to navigate through different screens in order to discover alternate paths.\n\nAs of now, there are 5 dungeons in the game, the sixth one will come on February 28th if it's going well. Those dungeons are massive, the first time you'll visit them, you will easily spend 3 hours. Almost each room is a puzzle, save for a few dedicated to fighting. They are quite balanced, it's difficult enough to force you to think, but not ridiculous to the point you'll say \"Screw this, let's check the answer on Youtube !\". However, I do think timing-based puzzles are sometimes a bit too strict. I have no problem with it whatsoever, but people who are not in the good pace might be discouraged, it could be sad...\n\nCombat in CrossCode are really smooth and nervous. Controls are responsive using a X-Box 360 controller (please note that the game's engine only accepts X-Input controller, you might want to avoid unpleasant surprises), I did not try with keyboard/mouse, but I believe aiming should more precise, the analog stick is sometimes too sensitive for predicting the right angles in order to bounce the balls you shot where you want them to land. You can also dash, guarding and use melee attacks. Each of these abilities have access to a superior level, called combat arts, gained by using CP in a skill Tree granted by leveling-up. The tree will appear small at first, but don't forget : there are four more branches, unlocked by acquiring the elemental powers.\n\nEnnemies are quite a challenge : they're fast and deals a lot of damage . There's quite a lot of strategy involved in order to find their weakspots. Don't worry about dying though : you'll respawn in the same area you died, most of the foes doesn't attack you unless you hit them first and you auto-heal outside battle.\n\nThere are also a bit of crafting and a lot of side-quests. Most of the latter are fetch quests, but you won't feel that doing them is a chore, since you'll do them along exploring the places. Well.. except the botanic analysis which is a bit tedious, because the only plants who count are those who give a drop. Maybe Radical Fish should take into account all plants destroyed or lowering the amount needed.\n\nRadical Fish says the full game will need 30-40 hours to be completed with a 100% rate. Sure... if you know already where everything is hidden. I think a more accurate time should be around 60-70 hours, which would be really impressive for an A-RPG. I think the twenty bucks they're asking for are almost a gift considering the amount of content and the overall fun of the game.\n\nNow then, the question is : should you buy CrossCode ? If you have a soft spot for 2D A-RPG, absolutely, you cannot miss a game which has so much love and care about it. I keep hearing how early access are a bad thing, but this game is a perfect counter-example, this is EA done right : CrossCode is perfectly playable in its current state, the minor glitches you might come across are not game-breaking (and quite funny, watching Emilie jumping to her death repeatedly killed me XD) unless you don't play fair by abusing the game, and the germans from Radical Fish are very attentive to their community. I love those guys so much that I already bought three copies (The other two were for friends who were interested in it), just to support them as much as I can.\n\nStill, since there are only a few development months remaining if everything is going well, maybe it's a wise move to not play the game until the full release or just adding it to your wishlist.\n\nCrossCode has only a last pre-requite to fulfill before falling in my top of best games of all time : the full story. Otherwise, it would only be a really fun game, which doen't take its players for fools and respects them. That's not so common in our time, right ?", "timestamp_created": 1487926424, "timestamp_updated": 1487927419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30134680": {"recommendationid": "30134680", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994936296", "num_games_owned": 721, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485931480}, "language": "english", "review": "Only a little ways into the game (recorded playtime is pretty inaccurate, in reality I've only got maybe 3-5 hours logged), but I'm loving it so far.

The gameplay is a fun action-y real-time battle system that I can't quite describe properly, but it's absolutely fun.\n\nI will say this though: it does frontload a LOT of information early on. You start by getting dropped into a strange world where you (and your character) have basically no idea where, who, or even what you are, and a large amount of my playtime so far was spent reading various in-game infodumps regarding the setting, lore, etc. While I don't know how much of that is made redundant later on, in that maybe it gets explained as the game progresses, I think the developer could stand to do with a healthy dose of \"show, don't tell\".\n\nThat caveat aside though, this is one of the most fun games I've played in a long while, and frankly the only reason I noticed it and harped on about it was because of how well-polished everything else about the game is by comparison.

The skill-tree is incomplete but looks hopeful. The dungeons are really enjoyable, although occasionally segments proved to feel a bit tedious. The bosses are interesting to fight, though not too difficult. As an RPG, the game is NOT a grind. Levelling and acquisition of gear is usually not difficult or tedious, but to make things even better there is a sort of kill-count system that makes the levelling experience involve more player engagement than the basic combat already requires. \n\nThe music is really good, even though some songs may get old after a few minutes.

Cross Code offers the very best one can expect from an ARPG.  The game is Early Access, but the 10+ hours of content currently included are already more than worth the asking price.\n\nCombat is both challenging and stimulating.  Each new foe has an entirely unique attack pattern, and some come with unusual abilities I would not have expected.  For example when you knock most enemies into the water, it counts as out-of-bounds forcing them to respawn nearby and take a hit to their health.  Penguins, however, will leap back up out of the water and perform a special diving attack instead!  Some enemies can only be hit from the rear, others need to be baited into charging a wall, some must first be set on fire to be defeated... it really mixes up the combat and provides some entertaining contests.\n\nPuzzles and Platforming go hand in hand, and are given a lot of focus in Cross Code.  Using your projectile to break objects and throw switches is a basic feature included right from the start.  This is particularly interesting due to the fact that your projectiles can bounce off walls, allowing for intruiging setups.  There are walls that block player movement but not projectiles, and walls that block both.  Movable blocks are included as well as iced floors, moving platforms, timing sensitive puzzles, explosives.  Again a wide variety that will keep you coming back for more.\n\nAdd on to all this, an extremely well written and vibrant world.  The characters are alive and interesting, the setting feels like a living breathing MMO made more convincing by the many \"players\" that populate the cities and pass you by in the open world.  \n\nBeautiful and emmerisive, a true delight to experience.

Overall, 9.5/10. Easily worth the $20 price.\n\nIt's extremely satisfying to go on a rampage to build up your combat rank (a combo counter that spans the entire battle, essentially).

Man hat schon mal ein Klasse ger\u00fcst um das herum die Entwickler immer mehr tolle Sachen bauen und fixen und neuen Content kreiren. Einfach Klasse. Macht weiter so!\nIch habe bisher schonmal etwas Zeit im Spiel verbracht (ca. 12 Stunden) bisher. Hier noch mein kleines Fazit:\n\nDas Kampfsystem finde ich wirklich ziemlich toll. Close Combat mit einer Mischung aus Baseball, nur mit dem Unterschied, dass diese \"B\u00e4lle\" wehtun. Sehr schnell ziemlich fl\u00fcssig und hochspannend. Durch die B\u00e4lle ergeben sich auch au\u00dferhalb der K\u00e4mpfe echt tolle M\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr R\u00e4tsel (Was die Entwickler scheinbar auch gerne zu Nutzen scheinen). Man muss manchmal schon etwas \"um die Ecke denken\" um die R\u00e4tsel, was bei mir etwas Zeit braucht, da ich nicht so gut mit R\u00e4tseln bin. Dann wird einfach probiert bis es klappt. \nDabei ist mir auch aufgefallen was man in diesem Spiel auch viel braucht sind [b]Zeit und Ausdauer[/b], die R\u00e4tsel sind teilweise echt gut und schwer gemacht, jedoch kann es auch koordinativen F\u00e4higkeiten scheitern, ich erinnere mich an ein R\u00e4tsel wo man echt wie der Blitz Schalter dr\u00fccken musste, das hat bei mir gedauert (sogar bsteimmt mehr als 30x ^^\") An sich aber sehr spannend was die Entwickler sich haben einfallen lassen. \n\nDie Endbosse auch Ihre Weise gut gemacht, den alle (die ich bisher gesehen habe) waren auch sehr knackig im Schwierigkeitsgrad, was mir jetzt auch nicht missf\u00e4llt und haben Ihre Eigenarten, die es zu durchschauen gilt. Wann kann ich angreifen?, wann muss ich blocken? Sachen die man nur herausfindet, indem man es immer wieder probiert. Einem Casual Gamer der mal eben so was einfaches f\u00fcr Zwischendurch braucht ist hier wohl eher falsch (Wobei dies vielleicht auch nicht die Absicht der Entwickler ist wer wei\u00df?)\n\nDer Look gef\u00e4llt mir auch sehr gut. Ich spiele es derzeit auf einem kleinen 24\" Monitor auf Full-HD. Hat man erst die richtigen Einstellungen gesetzt sieht das Spiel wunderbar aus trotz (oder gerade wegen) Pixelgrafik. Die Animationen sind fl\u00fcssig und nett anzusehen. Man merkt wirklich dass die Liebe der Entwickler auch in viele kleine Details geflossen ist. Man findet immer wieder kleine Dinge \u00fcber die man schmunzeln kann. (Hmm, wie war das mit dem Avatar und dem Herrn der 4 Elemente ;) ) Auch das immer wieder neuer Content geliefert, zeigt die Liebe und Hingabe zu diesem Spiel. \n\nEin wenig was m\u00f6chte ich noch zur technischen Seite sagen. Mir war gar nicht klar was mit HTML5 und Impact.js(was die Game-Engine f\u00fcr HTML5 stellt) alles m\u00f6glich ist. :o Toll finde ich, dass das Spiel dadurch eigentlich nicht Platfomgebunden ist, ich k\u00f6nnte es sogar noch auf meinem Linux-Rechner spielen, was Linux als Spieleplattform fehlt sind tolle Spiele wie dieses hier. Dank HTML5 k\u00f6nnte man es sogar im Browser spielen, was die Entwickler mit der Demo auf Ihrer Seite bewiesen haben. Was mir auch gut gef\u00e4llt ist die hervorragende Controller-Unterst\u00fctzung, ich spiele mit einem Xbox-360-Controller und es spielt sich klasse. Keine Ahnung wie es sich mit Maus und Tastatur spielt, da kann mich vielleicht mal wer aufkl\u00e4ren. \n\nAlles in Allem ein runder Early Access Titel, der mir bisher sehr gut gef\u00e4llt und mich so ein wenig daran erinnert, wie ich als kleines Kind immer mal wieder Zelda gespielt habe. (was ja auch \u00e4hnlich war mit echt krassen Bossen und klasse R\u00e4tseln) Das Geld war auf jeden gut angelegt, von diesem Spiel k\u00f6nnten sich ein AAA-Titel ne Scheibe abschneiden. \n\nMacht auf jeden Fall weiter so Radical Fish Games.", "timestamp_created": 1486885916, "timestamp_updated": 1486885916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29862156": {"recommendationid": "29862156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057152100", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1514584663}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Excellent RPG[/h1]\n\nThe combat is amazing, puzzles are challenging and engaging.

While I do recommend this game you may also wish to wait for it to be released before playing it. Unless they break the current play style I expect the rest of the game to be very good.\n\nThe game is based off of the idea your playing in an MMO. Other characters and just in general seeing random characters running around has a MMO-ish feel, I would say a world like .HACK.  It would be cool to ocasonally see other random characters fighting mobs but that might require a lot of work.\n\nThe game is also very unforgiving. Unlike other games of \"You died 4 times in a row, we are bumping the dificulty down a bit\", Crosscode keeps a very classic console game dificulty. The few boss fights in the game will kill you, many times. The patterns are simple and easy to pick up. I have been babied by most modern games telling you where to go and providing a compas and pointer. Crosscode does not do this. This means some quests are completly hit or miss as to if you figure them out. I have 1 or 2 I stopped trying on as I could not figure out where to go next.\n\nThe game does have some grind and repetition.  Killing tons of the same creature over an over for a single drop. Finding and breaking plants for the 4% drop rate so you can catalog that plant.  Overall this isn't required to complete the game and if you just destroy every plant you see you will probably only need minimal backtracking to complete the catalogs.\n", "timestamp_created": 1486701546, "timestamp_updated": 1486701546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29808821": {"recommendationid": "29808821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093819274", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496067375}, "language": "english", "review": "Tihs game is absolutely incredible.

I understand that this is a great thing for many players, but if you are a player such as myself, and love combat more than puzzle solving, you might want to at least wait for a bit of a sale for this game. The dungeons are long and a tad tedious; the puzzles (at least in the first dungeon) are reduced to \"push these blocks here,\" \"set up these mirrors to reflect your shots in a certain sequence here,\" wash, rinse, repeat. And this isn't where the atmosphere of the game and the devs' commitment to detail shines; it's the outside world brimming with life and bustling with NPCs. Not to mention the lack of quest marker/helpful HUD map, which makes finding certain events or items a bit of a pain. FOR ME, these deterrents were a deal breaker.

And as i stated again and again on other review's i WANT steam to block any who did not have played at least 10 hours (thus i dont give any review about imperium galactica II atm. or conquest frontier wars).\n\nThere are problems in this game i admit that. Yet those can easily be ignored (one of them being german text pooping up during cutscenes even thou i have it on english (and no i dont talk about schneider. He is obviously German XD) as this game itselfe is one of the most refined ones on steam that still is in Early Access. It has everything a true RPG needs: Story? CHECK! Musick? CHECK(i still say that most of the time when its peacefull i could swear i listen to actual Ragnarok 2 music, a job well done dev's!) Character Development? CHECK DOUBLE TIME!(Especiel when one considers \"learning\" new words as development XD) Epic Boss Battles? CHECK (and i only had fun in the first real Dungeon that is as i am someone who wants to outlevel the enemy at least and grind a shitton of stuff bevorhand(i barely touched the desert).\n\nSO all people who claim this game is either to hard, to much for kids storywise AND to stupid in graphics well lets just say: A: Graphic was deliberatly made as a GBA/NDS title. It fits the Action RPG genre simply the best. B: To hard: well i gotta admit that one not comited to grinding will find it hard at times, yet thats where the evasion/shield skills and timing comes in. I could have layed waste to the first dungouns boss way down on like lvl 12 if i wanted too yet its more fun to run in full 22 on him as i can make mistakes that way that are not my certain dead. and C: Story: Well its one of the best in a game like that i did ever encounter after playing Grandia, Seiken Densetsu (Secret of Mana), Final Fantasy and other great JRPG (I sadly did not touch much of the Tales of games thou i will change this with the releases on Steam, i promise(Especiel to Black Heart/Noire that is! I own EVERY Lastation Console yet no Tales of Games? SACRILEGE!).\n\nThis game is not as childish as most bad review's claim it is. Its actualy more of a Grandia 1 kinda start: You get parts of a large story at the beginning but not much: Then you will be thrown into mindless fun and some grind. After some or much time you finaly begin to get a grasp on the bigger story again and then pursuit it after some time doing RPG stuff. THIS is the way a JRPG should be like, the old way that is! The new one claims to be good yet i lived during a time where Grandia simply surpassed Final Fantasy because of its story so i actualy am able to make that statement that the old JRPG , wich Crosscode is now a part of, are better in most respects save graphic maybe (and thats where Compile Heart/IF international surpass even square enix: they give a shit about CG, they use an modernized old system with cellshading rather than animated 3d).\n\nThats all about this. I said the most important things i wanted to in this review. I will not give Pro's and Con's for eventual buyers out there as i am not finished with the game AND its still Early Accesss. It does not Represent the final game even thou the dev's claim it to be nearly finished.\n\nGood day out there people and have Poi all!(to those who cant understand what Poi means: It has no translation and can be swaped in for ANY word that is easy enogh understand (like for this time its Fun) And no it does not originate from Kancolle, it was used way back in the 1980's of anime and Way back in WW2 historicaly.", "timestamp_created": 1485171581, "timestamp_updated": 1485171581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.353014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29433510": {"recommendationid": "29433510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119686596", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513298169}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is half-finished and blatantly incomplete and it's still better than most RPGs I've played before, the sky's the limit when 1.0 actually comes out", "timestamp_created": 1485129136, "timestamp_updated": 1485129136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29428315": {"recommendationid": "29428315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015125492", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513377681}, "language": "german", "review": "Erster Eindruck: Wow.

A .hackish setting, gameplay that's like a somewhat faster-paced and more in-depth Secret of Mana, and plenty of charm. The worst thing I can say about it is that the perspective kind of screws with the auto-jumping puzzles on occasion - gauging the height of some platforms isn't always easy - but overall this is shaping up to be a great package. With the version number sitting somewhere around the 0.8 mark, I have little reason to think this won't be done.\n\nEDIT: Having put in more time,I'm going to re-word that sole criticism more strongly, and add an additional one: the perspective absolutely skewers the platforming segments by dint of being completely unsuitable for it. Very poor design decision. Destroys any ability to accurately gauge distance/height in a LOT of cases - almost every jump feels like a gamble.\nIn addition, evasion isn't nearly as effective as it should be. While it works fine against projectile attacks, the majority of the enemies have melee attacks that either have turn-on-a-dime tracking, tells that are too quick/subtle to reliably spot in the middle of a busy combat encounter, or some combination of these. By and large, an enemy that goes in for a melee attack isn't going to care how many pirouettes you pull trying to slip away, or in what direction you do them in. They're just going to turn around and kick you in the face anyway.\n\nConsidering these are two significant flaws that affect two of the games most significant facets of gameplay - combat and platforming - I'm tempted to flip that thumb downwards. I'm still charmed enough - and frankly, at this point, invested enough - to give it a pass and keep trying to work with these problems. I would think carefully about these aspects of gameplay before picking it up, though.

I'm a huge fan of the pixel art style, so if you are too, this game is a must. I bought this game knowing it was in early access because I just couldn't pass up on the art style and the slew of positive reviews.\n\n[h1] Overview [/h1]\n\n[b]Gorgeous pixel art[/b] - This was actually the selling point for me. I love the art. I love, love, LOVEEEEE the art. Developers, I believe you made a great decision reworking the portraits of the characters within the game, as they made for an excellent presentation.\n\n[b]Soundtrack[/b] - Really immerses you into the world of CrossCode.\n\n[b]Butter-smooth physics[/b] - And boy is the physics butter-smooth. The physics is great in that when I make a mistake, I know it was of my own accord and not the fault of the game itself.\n\n[b]Fast-paced combat[/b] - The combat in this game is quick. Once you get into the later areas of the game, standing still while you're in combat for even a split second means certain demise, and the game teaches you this right from the get-go.\n\n[b]Great level-design[/b] - The level designs are outstanding and feel like a lot of care was put into them. I enjoyed all of the areas I explored in the game.\n\n[b]Creative puzzles[/b] - The type that makes you go: \"Yeah, I did that! Feels good!\" when you beat it! I really love how some of the puzzles revolve around a certain element and start off easy, then progressively get harder as you progress, which makes it twice as rewarding when you beat them.\n\n[b]Remarkable story & characters[/b] - I literally clapped when I reached the end of the story implemented. I adore the characters in this game oh so much! I need plushies!\n\n[h1]Personal Experience[/h1]\n\nNow that we're past the overview, I'll offer a more personal perspective. The way I'm going to format this is by having two sections; story run, and 100% run. The difference between the two is that a player only doing the story most likely won't encounter the same things a player doing a 100% run will. In doing this, I will be offering two different perspectives on the game.\n\nA 100% run for those of you who don't know, is basically exploring all areas, obtaining every item, and completing every side-quest alongside the story quests and many other things. I kept this explanation brief, but I hope it's clear and get's the point across.\n\n[h1] Story Run [/h1]\n\n[b]Soundtrack[/b] - Soundtrack will be pretty enjoyable since you usually don't stick around some areas for too long.\n\n[b]Level design[/b] - Looks pretty neat, fun to traverse in.\n\n[h1] 100% Run [/h1]\n\n[b]Soundtrack[/b] - It's going to get really repetitive, really fast. You're going to be hearing the same soundtrack for the area you're in over and over and over, and it get's to the point where you just want to get to another area as quickly as possible, just to get a new soundtrack playing.\n\n[b]Level design[/b] - Sometimes I can't tell when a platform is above the character, so a lot of the time you're going to think \"Oh I'm on a high platform, I bet I can reach the one across from me.\" until you try to do so and you smack face first into a stone pillar and drown.\n\nI actually had to devise a strategy in order to tell if I can jump on a platform or not; throw a ball. If it looks like I'm above a platform I try to make sure by throwing a ball at the platform I want to get to.

They made it so you play in a real life mmo, meaning you're in the real world on a secluded island and players control avatars that are basically real people. It's a really cool concept imo.

Damn..\n\nNo matter, no matter.. Surely it'll sound like garbage. No, actually it doesn't. Dammit. The music is decent and the sound effects could use more variety but are workable enough not to detract from the experience.\n\nGameplay, yes.. Surely that's where CrossCode will fall flat on its.. Crap, it's fun.. The controls are tight and responsive and the difficulty is fairly challenging but not overwhelmingly so. I'm also finally beginning to see the enemy types get mixed up a bit as well, requiring different tactics to fight them effectively.\n\nStory!

They don't have steam cloud in this game, but the preset save file function makes this unneccesary. Its a list of save files at certain points of the game, including one immediatly after the long and unskippable (though enjoyable!) tutorial.\n\nCons:\n-Enemies, for the most part, will not engage you unless you engage them. This means you can easily get far into the game without many fights. I've made it to the temple dungeon (level 18) while being only level six. More agressive enemies would fix this.\n\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game and it is well worth the price. 9/10\n(If you didn't read the early access page, it reads that the game is currently much shorter than it will be upon release.)", "timestamp_created": 1483706470, "timestamp_updated": 1483706470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29053736": {"recommendationid": "29053736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041982713", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503656929}, "language": "english", "review": "Is good", "timestamp_created": 1483686977, "timestamp_updated": 1483686977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496942", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29045207": {"recommendationid": "29045207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031794528", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512249115}, "language": "english", "review": "Usually, I have a rule about early acesss; Don't buy into them.

I\u2019ve heard that the lore gets a lot deeper once you get a bit further in the game (I\u2019m still working on the first temple), but as of now, I\u2019d say that\u2019s the game\u2019s biggest short-coming.\n\nAll of the characters so far have been wonderful. The main character is engaging, and all of the side characters have their own interesting traits that make them both entertaining and lovable in their own ways. One of the things that originally hooked me about the game was the fact that half of the NPCs are total a**holes. It\u2019s kinda surreal walking up to an NPC and hearing some condescending side-comment instead of the usual helpful NPC dialogue.\n\nThe art is absolutely stunning, while still remaining simple enough to not drag attention away from the gameplay. I really loved this fact because I\u2019ve played a lot of games where the art was absolutely beautiful, but that\u2019s all the game really was \u2013 pretty \u2013 and it was painfully obvious that the art was being used to make up for the terrible gameplay mechanics. However this game chooses to be beautiful in the background, giving you the choice of being lost in the art or the gameplay. Think Ori and the Blind Forest. \n\nSpeaking of, the gameplay mechanics are fantastic. Most of combat boils down to two attack moves and two defense moves: Melee, Ranged, Dodge, Block. Each move has its own special \u201carts\u201d that can be unlocked in the skill tree. Using these moves, and the massive skill tree, players can easily develop their own specific play style, instead of having one style forced on them. For example, up until now, I\u2019ve yet to use the block move in a fight. Not because it\u2019s bad or anything; I just prefer to dodge, and so far my dodging hasn\u2019t noticeably hindered me. Also, on a more mental level, the combat just feels right. I can\u2019t really put my finger on why, but even when I\u2019m grinding away at enemies to get a specific item for a quest, boredom doesn\u2019t even cross my mind. How they managed to make grinding (which is entirely optional, don\u2019t worry) fun is beyond me, but they did it, so that\u2019s worth noting. \n\nThe enemies are another great thing about the game. New enemies are hard, but not too hard, and have weaknesses that can be exploited if figured out. None of them punish you in bull**** ways that just make you angry; everything is completely balanced. Plus they\u2019re all fun and interesting looking, with unique attacks that keep combat fresh and entertaining. Some even switch move-sets when at low health, which is pretty cool. Bosses in this game feel a lot like old Legend of Zelda bosses, and that\u2019s not a claim I make lightly. I grew up playing Zelda, and for years I\u2019ve watched people try and fail to copy their dungeons, and their bosses. Crosscode succeeds at both.\n\nLike I just said, the level design in this game is flawless. Build around a parkour system that honestly should not be as fun as it is, Crosscode manages to create the perfect mix of combat, puzzles, parkour, and secrets in every area. Most of the parkour starts with you seeing a chest in some strange park of the map and wondering \u201chow the heck am I supposed to get up there?\u201d, and then spending the next five minutes failing over and over again until you eventually figure out what you\u2019re supposed to do. And that feeling is always rewarding. On top of that, the game is full of little hidden riddles and events, some of which remind me of the ones in FEZ. For example (kinda spoiler), somewhere in the first dungeon there\u2019s a specific room where, if you do a specific action, it spawns something. I have no idea which room that is or what I\u2019m supposed to do to figure it out. All I know is that the secret exists, and so does the answer, somewhere. \n\nHonestly, I could go on and on about how great this game is. But the best part is that there\u2019s still more on the way. Unless the developers really mess something up somehow, or start putting out sub-par content to speed up their full release, what we have here is a game that feels more like The Legend of Zelda, than the last three Legend of Zelda games. Every once and a while, a new indie Steam game becomes a classic. As of right now, this game is on track to join the ranks of The Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy, FEZ, Terraria, Undertale, and the many others that have become something like household names in the PC gaming community. I cannot recommend this game enough, even at full price. \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1483559184, "timestamp_updated": 1483559184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29015114": {"recommendationid": "29015114", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971087869", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485623198}, "language": "german", "review": "Beeindruckendes RPG", "timestamp_created": 1483559022, "timestamp_updated": 1483559022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29015065": {"recommendationid": "29015065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067864126", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505334323}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutly fantastic. you could get lost in what little part of the game that has come out. truely excited to see the final realese for an amazing concept", "timestamp_created": 1483558903, "timestamp_updated": 1483558903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29014825": {"recommendationid": "29014825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193474571", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 168, "last_played": 1514453081}, "language": "english", "review": "The game in my opinion is really fun even if its in its early access stage.

The game has quite an interesting story that keeps you going with a satisfactory fast pace combat. Just imagine a Zelda game that is more difficult, faster pace, and a \"Sphere Grid\" System for stats and skills. Throw in some .hack// elements and you have this awesome entity known as Cross Code. There is some \"cons\" but there not really \"cons\" but more of a quality of life fix(s) that the developers can adjust before full game release.\n\nStory - The story as far as early access goes is you take the role of an amnesiac Player name Lea in a fictional game call Cross World. Thinking that Cross World can help her regain her memory, she takes on the Plot of Cross World. However, Lea had her speech \"module\" corrupted so she becomes a silent protagonist. But Wait! unlike most silent protagonist, Lea still \"talks\" in the game. You start out with basic words but its quite comical to see her interact with other characters and see her limited choice of words. Of course she still nods up and down or left and right to let the other characters know her decision.\n\nPros:\nCombat - The combat of this game is, in my opinion a pretty face pace game for a top down Action RPG. You have a basic combo, a dash/dodge button that is shared with guard. The game punishes you pretty heavily with amount of damage you take so dodging or guarding is key to surviving. The idea of \"chaining\" battles by constantly initiating a battle by attacking a monster is pretty cool. The higher you rank up your battle by constantly being in battle, the more EXP you will get and a pretty high item drop boost at the end. The developers were able to incorporate skills in a way where it does not \"interrupt\" combat. For example, you do not have to \"pause\" the game during combat to initiate a skill but rather the player can just hit the dedicated skill button. It is up to the player to charge the skill or not but charging the skill does slow down everything around you. Pretty Nice if you trying to aim a Range skill. The usable item menu though, will be a \"pause\" in combat. There is elemental(s) in this game. The elements provide advantages to monsters that are weak against an element or is key to exposing enemies weakspot/breaking armor. What is nice though is the developers has made it easy to switch elements on the fly with the D-pad. So unlike Zelda, the items or abilities you earn through temples are reusable elsewhere. The amount of fluidity of the combat controls in this game makes the combat system pretty fun and satisfactory.\n\nPuzzles - So far from what I have played, the puzzles are really well designed. Though they are not over the top hard but at the same time, they are not really that simple either and will make you \"step back\" and assess the situation. While some of the puzzles now and days in games requires you to find a button, key, or moving blocks to help you get a cross a platform, most of the puzzles here requires you to set up what you think will work and execute it by using the a bouncing charge shot that Lea can do use. Some puzzle will require you set up and also move fast. For example, You can set up a ball to bounce corner to corner, however one corner is blocked by an ice block, You then have to Shoot a charge bounce ball and run over to melt that ice block with a fire element before the ball is blocked by the said ice block. Yes, the elements you learn from the previous temples will be useful and will reuse for some puzzles which is nice. Some of the mechanics of the puzzles are pretty unique. For example changing the elevation of the charge bounce ball or melting an ice ball with a fire ball to create steam to turn windmills. All these requiring setups, execution, and following up with the execution to ensure the execution goes smoothly.\n\nVisuals and Audio - Not much to be said here but the visuals of this game is that of 16 bit. The game is 16 bit with a top down camera angle. So if you really enjoyed these type of games from the PS1 and NES era, than the visuals here is a plus for you. A lot of my friends said the game looks like the zelda series and Ys series. The Soundtrack so far has been pretty good. Each song seems to fit each setting or background.\n\nNotable Mechanics- There is some sort of jump \"quest\" in each map to get treasure. The player is freely to attack breakable objects to collect or gather items for side quest. On the topic of side quest, there are quite a bit of side quest that has me doing the first set of side quest for 8 hours even though they are technically within the first 1-2 hours of the story. There is fast travel, so backtracking for some side quest won't be an issue. Inviting people to join your party is similar to the .hack// games. You open up a friends list, and call them up to join your party. Though at this time of early access you have only 1 contact in your friends list. Each element has their own \"sphere grid\" and does not share skill points with other \"sphere grids\" which is a blessing. Being a spheremancer you can equip 2 one handed weapons, so maybe we'll get to see a mix and match of weapons in full game release.\n\nCons (not really cons but QoL changes):\n\nDifficulty - Not really a con to me because I like challenging games but to some, it maybe difficult at first. You are heavily punished for not dodging or guarding successfully so it makes it feel like even though you are 10 levels higher than the monster, that monster that is 10 levels lower than you still have a chance to knock out 1/3 - 1/2 of your health if you are not careful. It can give off a feeling that you are not actually getting \"stronger\" per level. The player can also be interrupted while using an item and might not get the healing effect of items. At the same time, this difficulty can be a Pro for some, thus not really a con but a potential QoL change.\n\nDrop rate/gathering rate- Though the idea of using a rank system to determine higher drop rate is a good idea in my opinion, the rate(s) can get some players frustrated. For example, if players need to find \"Raw Meat\" from a cow, players may need to preemptively initiate other battles before engaging the cow to boost the drop rate for the said quest item. Some of the drop rates from breakable gathering objects are pretty low. I took about 2 hours to find 4 Bear Cicada from breakable gathering objects for a \"beginners\" quest. \n\nDetermining Height - Since this game is a top down view, determining if a platform is in the same elevation as the player can be quite confusing, especially with the amount of plants and other objects that are displayed in each map.\n\nSummary:\nOverall This game is an amazing game that can be come a masterpiece here on steam. With a very satisfactory combat system and have puzzles that will give players a sense of a achievement, this game is in good hands. The Developers have done so far a very fine job. Just maybe adjust some rates here and there. I will probably add more to this post as I delve deeper in to the Early Access Version.  \n\n8.7/10 Will and already has Recommend.

Where do I even begin? Well, for starters this game has a really great sense of humor that more than a couple times made me burst into laughter with it's witty puns and sarcastic jokes. I don't know how but this game has intense levels of irony that can only be rivaled by it's character development. It also tends to be faintly self aware at times and has you going into some comical situations that you would not even expect in a game like this.\n\nFor the record: I did try out the demo around a year back and I saw mega potential in this game to grow into what it has become today, and with that I am happy to say I was not dissapointed.\n\nThere are a lot of things remeniscent of early 2000's classics like Zelda: A Link To The Past and Metal Slug; more specifically the art style, of course, which is one of my all time favorites. All of the sprites look wonderful. When I play Cross Code [b]it feels[/b] like I'm reliving my childhood through a spiritual successor to all those games I once loved to play.\n\n[u]MUSIC[/u]\nHad I never seen, nor experienced anything about this game besides the music and I didn't know any better I'd have thought this game was made by nintendo. Every track in this game is simply brilliant, and  they make every area feel as diverse as ever. The instruments used in each track match up very well with scenery and give you a peculiar sense of wonder every time you discover a new town or come across an ancient monument. Whenever I hear a new song it leaves me with a strong urge to start exploring the new places I've found.\n\n[u]STORY[/u]\nAs stated in the game description, this story is gripping and very sci-fi. I was drawn to the characters in multiple ways. Partially because of their bubbly over-the-top personalities and partly because of how well I can imagine their voice/accent. That's also part of the reason why I love games with silent protagonists because it's part of the fun to assert your perceptions onto them. The story telling is divided meticulously through certain interactions Lea (Main character) has with others, through dream-like flash back sequences, and through catagories upon categories of plot scattered about the Encyclopedia (which won't help you all that much if you aren't willing to take the time to read the entries)\n\n[u]LEVEL DESIGN[/u]\nAll of the sprites and environments look so nice with the various animations. The enemies, although they aren't perfect, are unique and stylish aswell. All of the areas are nice and detailed although there can be a few minor inconveniences that, otherwise could be tweaked with small fixes. What I'm talking about in particular are the ledges. Alot of times it's hard for me to distinguish the verticality on some ledges I want to hop to so I end up jumping towards a platform that was one level above me. Or, when enemies fly just above you when you try to shoot them but you can't tell because the only thing indicating their altitude is a tiny shadow underneath them. It would be better if it were more clear whether or not something was below or above you. Some subtle details could be added to make it a little easier on the eyes.\n\n[u]GAMEPLAY[/u]\nOverall, the gameplay is truly engaging with some captivating challenges and puzzles that will test your reaction time and accuracy. Playing with some type of gamepad is recommended for an optimal experience, but I recall the game playing rather well with a mouse and keyboard too if that is all you can use.\n\n[i]Conclusion[/i]\nHonestly, this game is a dream come true for me because you can tell that some proper time was taken to polish and optimize it. The sheer quality of all of the content is something that is worth cherishing given that this is an indie game that's currently in beta. Kudos to the developers since I can tell that they had a blast creating and designing this awesome game.

From the very beginning, it is easy to see that the devlopers poured their hearts into the game. \n\nHere is a short list of things that I like about the game:\n\n-The developers have done an exellent job of easing the player into the games various mechanics. There is some hand holding in the beginning, but it isn't overbearing. \n-The combat is very engaging. This is due in no small part to the obvious amount of thought that went into the different combat mechanics.\n-The controls are very fluid and responsive. \n-The art is beutifully drawn, and does an incredibly job of conveying the characters emotions. \n-The level design is thoughtful and engaging. \n-There is just the right amount of dialogue. Enough that you can understand what is happening and appreciate the story, but you don't have to spend an eternity reading it. \n\nSo far, CrossCode appears to be far more than the sum of its parts. I am incredibly excited to see how the game continues to evolve and change as it is being developed.

CrossCode is a Retro 2D RPG 16-bit game with SNES-style graphics as said in the summary. CrossCode comes with a leveling up system with skills, items, equipment, and quests so you can waste your valuable time on them. CrossCode also has many fun puzzles to enjoy while fighting in dungeons with cool bosses to defeat as you play through the story. CrossCode is the best videogame I have ever played.

Once it was done, I proceeded to stay up until 2:00 AM to finish the entire 60-70 minute demo. I have never finished a game demo in my life, mind you.\n\nThat right there should tell you plenty about the game's awesomeness.\nThe following Tuesday, I talked my dad into buying the game for me (as I had no other way of purchasing the product). I've already invested at least 3 hours into the game, and have loved every second of it.\n\nThe game's storyline and premise are very interesting, and I wouldn't mind seeing them expanded upon in a sequel, if the devs get there.\nThe graphics and audio just scream Gameboy Advance era, only they're much better quality than such a console could have produced.\nThe characters, even though we don't know a ton about them, seem very developed and realistic for the setting. You'll see what I mean when you play it.\nI think my favorite part of the entire game is the combat, though. The game has crossed all of the best RPGs into one game, in a sense, with its own spin.\n\nThis is the game I have, almost literally, dreamed of playing all my life. The only real issue now is going to be getting myself to finish Final Fantasy VII before this, as I don't want to run into issues with the game being incomplete.\nObviously, I'll be playing it again, but you know what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaking of, I'd even go so far as to say that this game gives even FF7 a run for its money, in a sense. FF7 is known as one of the best RPGs of all time, but somehow I feel that it just doesn't quite have the charm that CrossCode does.\n\nAnyway, what the heck are you waiting for?! Screw food and other necessities...use that $20 on this instead!\n\n[b]UPDATE Wednesday, December 28, 2016:[/b] I made it to the first \"real\" dungeon in the game, and boy oh boy, is it impressive. I've seriously been in the dungeon for 3 hours and now I'm going to bed because I don't want to stay up any later (it's almost 12:30 AM). \nThe dungeons appear to be like Zelda dungeons, with some almost Metroid-vania-like elements in them.

An encyclopedia in game that fills out as you kill monsters/destroy nodes, and will give you drop rates after you loot X amount from each specific monster/node. AN INDEX OF SHOPS SO YOU CAN LOOK AT WHERE YOU SAW A SHOP SELLING A SPECIFIC ITEM.\n\n     Trading system in game, where you don't just straight up buy a new set of armor/weapons every time you reach a new town, but you actually collect materials and trade them in for pieces. Equipment also makes you think about what you want. Increased Focus (crits) in exchange for less HP and defence? More HP and HP regen in exchange for damage and Balance (lets you use elemental attacks more, which is required against some enemies)? To go with that are huge talent trees, think Final Fantasy X, where you have Neutral and the four Elements (Fire, Cold, Shock, and Wave), which each get their own talent trees and points every time you level up, each offering different Melee, Ranged, Guard and Dash Arts, plus all the passives you'd expect like Max HP, elemental resists, Attack Power, etc.\n\n     Variation in characters is really nice, too. Your best friend is French, and her friend [spoiler] who becomes your guildmate [/spoiler] is German. Your own character is a mute so-to-speak, but the different facial expressions she makes are very well done, so you're able to communicate through that. You also have the aforementioned Saitama dressed as Santa, there's a dandy on a hunt for a stylish tophat, a character who somehow is using armor from every class, the nerdy guy that needs your help with research, etc. No two characters are alike.\n\n     The Dungeons are just amazing. After having completed the four Dungeons for all of the Elements, every single one of them posed a challenge to me, and I would have to stop, take my hands off my keyboard, and think about how to solve the puzzles. They really make you think outside the box. In Fajro, there's even a puzzle that you start it by shooting a ball, then as the ball travels around the \"track\" of the puzzle, you have to interact with the course, moving blocks, freezing/melting water pillars, lowering barriers, to change it's path, and the puzzle is roughly the size of two screens. Absolutely loved it. Each of the four Dungeons has a specific theme to it, to match the element it is for. As an example, in the Shock dungeon, you create big balls of energy and shoot them off, maneuvering them around to get them to power up circuits. The late Dungeons also utilize the previous Dungeons elements, so it's not like you go get the Fire element first, and then never use those mechanics/methods again.\n\n     The only things that were sort of downers for me, was that equipment doesnt change the look of your sprite at all (save the santa hat, which I think looks really nice). You always look the same. Even recolors and a slight amount of detail would be kinda nice. Maybe add on some cool effects to attacks for some higher level weaponry, or effects based on what Modifiers are on your weapon/armor. Also some of the areas got very confusing because from my experience, the map does not accurately portray your position in the current map, and there are A LOT of treasures that I can't seem to get to. A lot of them require you to enter an area from the previous/next map from a vantage point. But maybe that's just because I'm stupid. I dunno. Also, some of the puzzles annoyed me, because there are pillars you have to move around, but you can only push them forward/backward, not side-to-side. Not a big deal, but just annoying. There are also some spots that are like landform bridges, but I can't tell, and I just think it's a wall, so I don't even go in that direction.\n\n(Edit in after more gameplay; After actually going through and finding the treasures, it is definitely possible, but they can be very challenging! And in regards to the landform bridges making me think they are walls, the developers DEFINITELY did that on purpose, which I understand a lot more now. They make you consider all possibilities when trying to solve puzzles, maybe try going from this way, well how do I get there, maybe enter in through the previous area, well maybe that \"wall\" there isn't a wall, etc. I quite like it.)\n\n     Small sidenote; even has the cocky rival that you just love to hate, and you get to duel him. But he's kind of cheap, basically if he hits you with a melee attack, he's gonna take like 2/3 of your HP bar. Despite that, it is very possible to beat him as long as you utilize your guard and dodge mechanics, and if/when you do, it really feels good to beat him.\n\n     Basically, amazing game. One of the best that I have played in recent years.

While Early Access is definitely a giant red flag to most steam users (and for honestly good reason), I believe that this game is fairly trustworthy. The devs are quite transparent, with each of their updates noting issues yet to be fixed, delays in release dates, and what's going on in general. There is also livestreams which I have yet to check out, which likely go into much more detail of upcomng content.\n\nPros\n-Fluid gameplay and combat\nWhile it definitely takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning, within a few hours I was dashing all over the place firing shots and using specials with ease. On keyboard the game is quite easy to use, haven't used any other medians as of the moment though. The management of special attacks and dodging and using weak spots creates a very hectic and high pressure atmosphere, while still being very fun.\n\n-Story and Dialogue\nThe story is, as of now, unfinished. However, what is here is still a fairly hefty amount and has been good so far. The main character, Lea, is unable to speak except for certain phrases (largely consisting of \"Hi!\" \"Bye!\" and \"Lea!\" for a good bit early on). Upon hearing finding this, I assumed dialogues would mainly be between other characters with her sitting on the side listening, but she does seem to input quit often through the use of \"...\" \"...!\" or \"...?\" and a facial expression. The facial expressions are quite good, often relaying her inputs quite well alone. You do gain a few more words as time goes on, and I assume the story will continue adding more as it progresses.\nThe dialogue itself between characters or NPCs often poke fun at other MMOs or make somewhat referential humor. I wouldn't necessarily call it subtle, but it definitely isn't blatant enough to seem like it was fishing for laughs. The dialogue seems rather real between the team characters you get and also between the players NPCs.* I often pause to read the dialogue because it is entertaining, although because it is chat bubbles above their head you can continue running by while reading. As a quick example, the boss of the demo can be found in the bestiary under \"Behemoth Hostile Crab\" I believe. \n*To help clarify things a bit, there are sort of multiple levels of NPCs to explain. As you run around, there are NPCs that are NPCs. These are people running shops and giving quests like those in an MMO. Next, there are player NPCs. They are NPCs running around in game as if they were players playing the MMO. They often use more aware terms (patches, updates, raids, etc.) when chilling at 'player' hubs, and can be seen running around in the fields as you are fighting monsters. On a side note, when lost it can be beneficial to follow the player NPCs because they run between areas and can lead you to exits if you get lost. Lastly, there are party member or story character NPCs. These NPCs are much more present and converse much more with you, the rest you can find out. As strange as it is, being aware that certain characters are NPCs along with the other characters actually helps build immersion, since they think a person welcoming you to town with the same line 800 times is as stupid as you do.\n\n-Tutorializing\nI think this game does tutorials fairly well. It is somewhat hands on in the beginning when it initially teaches you all your moves, but it gives you a lot more freedom as you enter the full game. Even early on it is more of telling you and letting you experiment compared to making you watch it over and over. After leaving the initial zone, about when the demo ends,s all questions and tutorializing is basically optional from then on.\n\n-Difficulty (Bosses)\nI personally think it does a very good job of creating a rewarding difficulty. When I fight the bosses of the game, it is often very hectic and challanging, and contains a few deaths while doing so. However, when I do die, I generally retry with more knowledge of the bosses patterns and what to avoid or take advantage of. Instead of feeling like I'm playing a very biased game of russian roulette, I actually do see myself progressing each time I fight a boss, and not because of stats. Also death puts you directly at the beginning of the room when you die, so failure doesn't stop you from diving right back into the action.\n\n-Difficulty (General Battles)\nThe game seems to prefer actual fights compared to grinding, so any enemies you fight in the field that are worth their time in EXP will put up a fight. I find this enjoyable, as new areas aren't bogged down with annoyances but instead full of actual danger even without a boss. Plus, when high enough level and traveling through fields they often don't bother you if they wouldn't be worth your time.\n\n-Difficulty (Dungeons)\nI'm just going to say I love the dungeons. They are often large maps with multiple rooms filled with puzzles, enemies, or both at once. However, the pacing is often done quite well on them. Instead of telling you what everything in a room does, it will often give it to you in a puzzle room first. You get to spend time playing around, finding out what your abilities do to whatever object is given to you. Next, it often gives you some enemies that are affected by whatever you just learned, so you can try it out on them. Later, it mixes the two by including one of the puzzle objects that can be used to inflict bonus damage on the enemy or open up breaks for massive damage. Later, the boss combos this by making you use the mechanics you learned by using the puzzle objects on the enemies to open up the weak spots on the boss and attack it. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the dungeons I've played.\n\n\n-Cons\nYes, even though I love this game a lot, it still has some issues.\n-Lack of Story (Likely to be fixed)\nAt the current moment, the story is rather unfinished and cliffhangery, and leaves a good bit to be desired. This is definitely on the list to be added obviously, but this is just a warning as of now. I personally think this is a solid dev team that will add more, but you never know.\n\n-Lack of PvP (Likely to be fixed)\nThere is one point in the game where you have a battle against another 'Player' in game, and it is 5 out of 9 battle of hectic, chaotic fun. When I played through it I was basically sweating by the end of it through the careful spacing, dodging, and use of specials. But there is the issue. As of my knowledge, this only appears one time early game and it doesn't happen again for the rest of it. Again, I believe this will likely be added in the future, but just in case this game doesn't get updated anymore (which, again, I highly doubt) I'll leave it here for now.\n\n-Bugs/Glitches (Might be fixed?)\nThis is almost a pro based on how few I ran into, but I did have one issue that recurred a few times. At random points (I run the game full screen) it would basically freeze the frame onto the screen and reformat it to roughly windowed size, and only update that corner, which left about 40% of my screen a frozen frame. Even after it resized it, the mouse acted like it was still in full screen so the center of what I saw wasn't what the center was to me. I posted this issue to the forums and got a response within a day or two (yay) that said it was fairly hard to replicate so may be difficult to patch (boo). This wasn't common, but it didn't recur enough to make the game unplayable. So while it may be a bit to get this issue fixed, possibly even never, it was nice to get a dev response quickly and it isn't enough to deter me from the game. \n\nTL:DR Good combat, good story (albeit unfinished), good dialogue, good controls, good devs, good fun. Try the demo if you are unsure, but it should be noted that while the core gameplay remains the same, you get some additional abilities and the difficulty ramps up over time.

Though it is in early access, the game is incredibly polished in virtually all aspects.  The controls are fluid and the combat and plaforming elements are very satisfying to say the least.  On top of the core gameplay, the world is vibrant and the characters are memorable.  \n\nSo far I've played around six hours or so without moving very far beyond the first major area, mostly doing the various sidequests and exploring, so I already feel that I'm getting a good value even if the game were to remain in its current state.\n\nThat said, the developers are some of the most transparent I've seen, and they do a great job of communicating their progress to the community.  They even hold livestreams on a semi-regular basis during which you're free to ask questions and sometimes get to watch them implement different features/ideas as well.\n\nOverall this game encapsulates everything I love about the genre while still feeling fresh and refined.  I wish the best of luck to the developers as they continue to work on this wonderful project.\n\nIf you still have reservations, you can do what I did and try out the free demo.

For unknown reasons, Lea lost her memory and logs into CrossWorlds as an attempt to recover it, but due to a problem her speech module isn't working properly, resulting in her ingame avatar being mute. Only with the help of a programmer called Sergey, she is able to express simple words like \"Hi\", \"Bye\" or \"Lea\".\n \nTo find the answers to her questions and to her memories, she keeps playing the game in order to not make the system identify her as an intruder or bot and kick her out. With the help of various other players from other classes and the crew of the MS Solar, she dives into the world of CrossWorlds.\n \n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nCross Code is visually resembling the 16-bit titles from the SNES and Playstation 1 era using a flat top-down-perspective to make the riocheting and ball throwing natural. It mixes classic medieval RPG environments with futuristic elements like laser bridges, energy walls and teleport devices. Every area or city has its own look which is defined by the area it is built in:\nRookie Harbor, with its western medieval style, Bergen Village, where snow-covered houses are built around cliffs, Ba'kii Kum, resembling a desert town that was built around a large oasis, Basin Keep, a rainy, modern skyscraper city in the midst of a fairytail-like jungle. The world is full of little details and filled with NPCs talking or running around the areas and towns making the game appear lively and populated at all times.\n \n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe game features a rich playlist for all kinds of situations and environments and never seems to be out of place. On top of that, has a very enganging battle and boss theme. Style reminds of early PSX-themes. Especially atmospheric in puzzle rooms where concentration is required, rhythmic beats keep your mind focused.\n \nThe sound effects are natural and a mixture of sounds that fit the medieval setting as well as the MMO type futuristic sounds. Explosions are loud, wind is soft. When you use skills, they will impact with force and sound and landing every hit feels great.\n \n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nControllable with both mouse and keyboard and gamepad, the gameplay is responsive and easy to pick up. However, you will learn early that precision and skill are still required to be effective in this game; [i]you can not simply run up to opponents and start beating them up[/i]: they have more than one way to deal with you.\n\nThat brings me to the three main gameplay elements of Cross Code. But first,\n[b]Mechanics[/b].\n[i]Because[/i] of the puzzles, it is [i]impossible[/i] to miss a mechanic as you have to understand and use it to proceed. Every puzzle is a tutorial so to speak.\nThe formula is mostly like this:\n- Introduction of new element/mechanic tied to it\n- Very simple introduction puzzle/battle for comprehension\n- Several puzzles and battles with advanced usage\n- Boss battle that requires advanced usage and timing\n\n[b]Puzzles[/b]\nPuzzles make use of all logic you pick up in the game. If a new element or mechanic is introduced, [i]the following puzzles will evolve around that[/i]. For example, the [i]Faj'ro temple[/i] makes use of both your [b]ice[/b] and [b]fire[/b] element by introducing walls that are made of [b]water[/b]. Based on the element you use on them, they become ice blocks or vaporate for a limited time.\n[b]The puzzles themselves are never hard:[/b] They are easy to comprehend and you always know what you have to do to solve it. The only factor that makes you fail the puzzle is [b]yourself[/b]. Either you are not used to mechanics yet, or you missed the timing.\n\n[b]Parkour[/b]\n[i]This game does not have a jump button by design[/i]. Lea will automatically jump once you run off a ledge or gap. Using that, every single area has parkour and free running elements. They either lead to hidden chests, secrets or new areas. You will spend a majority of the time wondering [b]\"How the [i]fuck[/i] do I get up there?\"[/b]\nMost parkours span [i]through the entire area[/i], some even [i]across multiple areas[/i].\nAs you can imagine, puzzles and battles will also make use of platforming which adds a third dimension into the game.\n\n[b]Battle[/b]\nLea will be fighting a lot. Using her balls for ranged attack, melee attacks and defensive options like blocking and dodging, she is quick on the battlefield and you always have control over her. Every action type (Range, Melee, Defend, Dodge) comes with their own set of special skills which you can unlock in massive skill trees.\nAs the game features 4 prominent elements (Fire, Ice, Wave, Shock), on-the-fly switch between elements is possible and necessary in the later midgame. For that, every element has its own key assigned which lets you switch to it instantly. Hitting the same key again will return you to your normal state.\nBased on the element you currently have equipped/selected, they have impact on Lea's statistics. Fire increases offense, ice defense etc.\nEnemies have strengths and weaknesses. Obviously, using fire against a fire golem won't do much. The solution is to use ice. But [i]in what way[/i]? Finding out weaknesses, breaking enemy defense and hail attacks on them while they are broken/stunned is the key to success in battle.\n\nBut Lea cannot only attack, but defend. Lea can dodge 3 times in a row, then needs a brief moment until she can dodge again.\nThis makes you aware of positioning, as especially in groups, enemy attack patterns can get relatively lethal.\n\nCross Code provides Lea with non-playable party members. As of version 0.8.5, only Emilie, your french Pentafist sidekick, will accompany you. Emilie will support you in close-combat.\n\n[h1]RPG[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of statistics that synergy with skills, elements and equipment. There are a lot of ways to minmax and to create new builds, which increases the replayability a lot. A whole botanics and glossary system provides you with info you need. A lot of detail has been put into the background story and lore around the MMO CrossWorlds. It is quite worth the read.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nAs of 0.8.5, the story is currently in development. It promises to have depth as the ingame lore is already massive.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nCross Code is the potential next big hit on Steam. It has very few flaws that are easily overshadowed by its strengths.

I have played 18 hours. I am also in the middle of finals. In conclusion: I am not a smart man.\n\nCrossCode is an amazing game made by an awesome team of developers, I honestly wish I knew about this game before so I could have backed the crowdfunding. The combat is smooth and the amazing control scheme on the mouse and keyboard makes for an \"easy to learn, hard to master\" style of gameplay. When combat gets boring, interesting puzzles consistently push the boundaries of the game's mechanics.\n\nThe art and animations are beautiful. Motion looks fluid and detailed, making combat look stellar once you master the basic concepts. One criticism I will give, however, is the forgettable soundtrack. Nothing particularly stands out as awful to listen to, though Bergen Village is slightly annoying, but nothing really stands out at all. On the same note, during lengthy battles you will sometimes notice a lack of sound effects with some enemies' attacks and this can be a bit odd.\n\nThat aside, I absolutely adore CrossCode and can not wait for the final release with the entire story. There is so much potential with the already loveable Lea and extremely interesting world that has been set up.

The art style is marvelous, the characters are likable and the gameplay by far is STUPENDOUS! As you progress through the game, you get rewarded with even MORE gameplay. I would recommend this game to anyone, new or old.\n\nGraphics [NOTE! This game is 2D, but I don't think it detracts from it's score] 10/10: The details in the sprites and just the overlay in general is enough to leave your jaw dropping. Some of the best art work I've seen in a video game. Considering these were hand draw, they came out FABULOUS and you can just tell that whomever drew the cutscenes did so with much love and care. The world it's self is drawn in a detailed manner it's self and the sprites are very appealing to the eyes. I can say nothing less about the art in this game.\n\nGameplay 10/10 - As you progress through the game, it gets only better and better. Elements are a big component in this game. Not only that, the punishment for using them is not that severe and they look SPECTACTULAR! You feel as if you're powerful, without a detraction from the difficulty level. The game proceeds to be difficult and though weapons and armor can make a difference, the game still remains difficult. The puzzles are immersive and very well thought out as well. Well place and well done. Though, it may be a detriment to those who don't enjoy that style, I feel it brings moments where you're challenged to know how the game works to progress forward and getting better at doing so. New trees open up to you as you obtain new elements and the game doesn't punish you completely for building in certain ways. You can even switch what you want if it's important enough. And of course, the enemy designs are guaranteed to challenge you too. Knowing which element to use at the right time can make all the difference in this game.\n\nStory 7/? - To be honest, I don't know what the complete story is so far, but so far it's been pretty great. The characters have been likable and though it starts off a little \"cliche\", it's fitting of what's happening. They kind of start you off with the whole your character has amensia thing, but there are other elements to redeem it so far. I leave the question mark as a symbol of whether or not it should get a better score or not because there have been certain things to hint for a better story and again, the characters are very likable.\n\nMusic 8/10 - The music's pretty good. I can see inspiration from other games and can tell the musician put a lot of work and time into the music to match it's environment. The \"Zoom\" reminded me of a part from Chrono Cross for example in one part of the game. (You'll see if you get past the first city) I felt there could have been more power behind the instruments but they still met their purpose.\n\nOverall 10/10\n\nThis game has overall been amazing.

It is one of the rare games I actually continue thinking about after a session, wishing I had even more time to sink into it.\n\nUPDATE for clarity: CrossCode is an Action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dodging and positioning, which can be done quickly and the controls feel tight (using an Xbox One gamepad). There is a skill progression system; they are mostly passives, with a few exceptions of the Active skills, which can be switched on the fly to a different branch.

It is by no means a bad game; it just falls short of the potential I saw in the original demo and has some caveats that make the game unenjoyable at times, which I currently don't see reflected in the reviews.\n\nThere are a lot of good ideas behind this game. However, due to the nature of the many features (like leveling, an expansive skill tree, equipment, and consumables) that they tried to shove into the game in combination with the existing combat, the balance has suffered and your character is incredibly overpowered. To compensate, they just made many of the generic enemies harder to hit, which just makes the game more frustrating. You spend a lot of time running around not only to avoid getting hit, but just to get the right timing and aim necessary for a few hits on your evasive enemies.\nThe player's strengths and weaknesses are not as reflected in these enemies strengths and weaknesses as they should be. The experience gains are also ridiculous. Just the quests alone will overlevel you, not even taking into account grinding with the exp and item drop boosts of the rank system, or the puzzle dungeons.\n\n[b]Pros: [/b][list]\n[*]Great exploration\n[*]Decent puzzles\n[*]Well structured boss fights\n[*]Transparent dev team (if you're into that)\n[*]Beautiful assets\n[*]Resettable keyboard and mouse controls.

The rpg style progression is well done (lots of skill tree choices, the ability to swap branches). The loot system is the best I've seen, it actually makes sense what creatures drop, and that you trade those drops in to traders for goods and equipment. The story shines, and although it obviously has influences from popular shows and games, it still keeps itself unique. The characters have great personalities; Emilie is a fun and relatable companion; and Sergey, while mysterious also is likeable. I've not seen enough of the other characters to form an opinion on them. The artwork of the game is a prime example of pixel art done right, it truly is beautiful. Between the gameplay, story, and beatuiful artwork, it is hard to find a flaw in CrossCode, but if I had to find one, it would be that, between quests and traders, the drop rate on some loot items isn't enough to obtain them in a reasonable amount of time.

It took me some time to adjust playing with a keyboard and mouse. If you have a gamepad controller, you might want to do some research and find out of your controller is compatible. Sadly, mine was not. The keyboard controls are not too complicated but there is a slight learning curve until you get the swing of things. Once you get the keyboard and mouse adjusted to your preference, the rest is actually easy and enjoyable.\n\t\n\u2022 So far, the storyline is interesting and keeps you hooked. I'm interested to see what will happen next. I'm really digging the sci-fi futuristic feel of this game. For some reason I feel a bit of \"sword art online/portal\" vibe going on. Not only is the storyline great, but the fast paced gameplay and puzzles tie together make this a pretty solid game. In simple terms, I'm not bored and believe me, I do get bored easily. This game will make you think and use that thing upstairs we call a brain. Time to get the hamster wheel spinning. \n\t\n\u2022 If you're looking for high resolution graphics and mainstream 3D technology, you won't find that here, instead you'll find old school graphics that might bring back some memories of the great RPG era of the 90's. Remember Chrono Trigger, Thousand arms and Lunar? It will be a nice dosage of nostaglia. Just let soak in\u2026  :)\n\t\n\u2022 I will be updating this review when I have completed the game in full. As I've mentioned, this game is interesting, fun, challenging, fast paced and includes a great storyline to keep players coming back. I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of RPG, puzzle solving, Sci-Fi, fast paced, action games.   5/5  \n\t\n\tTo be continued\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1480152035, "timestamp_updated": 1480152694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27621494": {"recommendationid": "27621494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266512425", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496839926}, "language": "english", "review": "Its good", "timestamp_created": 1480150835, "timestamp_updated": 1480150835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27541054": {"recommendationid": "27541054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022794988", "num_games_owned": 726, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480108702}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty good check it out", "timestamp_created": 1480106025, "timestamp_updated": 1480106025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519313", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27518873": {"recommendationid": "27518873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075873592", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513278912}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "uns dos melhores jogos indies que eu j\u00e1 joguei.", "timestamp_created": 1480099009, "timestamp_updated": 1511885317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27515904": {"recommendationid": "27515904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158970905", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482002113}, "language": "english", "review": "Although I haven't played much of this game, I can tell CrossCode is something special.

Tem uma demo dispon\u00edvel, ent\u00e3o caso n\u00e3o queira gastar dinheiro sem pensar, voc\u00ea pode testar o produto.\n\nO design da principal e o mundo me lembram Xenosaga, de alguma forma. Se voc\u00ea gosta dessa tem\u00e1tica e da est\u00e9tica pixel art, ent\u00e3o \u00e9 mais um motivo pra adquirir o jogo.\n\nUm dos pontos que os desenvolvedores sempre refor\u00e7am \u00e9 um que est\u00e1 na descri\u00e7\u00e3o do produto: \"butter-smooth physics\"... E \u00e9 100% verdade. O movimento nesse jogo \u00e9 ESPETACULAR. Sabe quando voc\u00ea tem coisa pra fazer, mas fica procrastinando, zanzando por a\u00ed? Aqueles jogos que voc\u00ea s\u00f3 quer andar pra apreciar a paisagem, o movimento, a velocidade? Esse \u00e9 um deles, e no build atual, est\u00e1 tudo maravilhoso. Ouvi falar que em builds mais antigos haviam problemas de plataforma GRAVES onde voc\u00ea escorregava quando ficava muito na borda de uma plataforma, mas arrumaram isso e a mudan\u00e7a foi drasticamente positiva.\n\nOs personagens s\u00e3o bons, e a hist\u00f3ria, de in\u00edcio, est\u00e1 \u00f3tima. Tenho um pouco de receio de ficar gen\u00e9rica ao decorrer do jogo, visto que eles est\u00e3o dentro de um MMORPG e tem toda aquela ladainha de quest principal para descobrir blablabla, mas esperemos que acabe bem. As circunst\u00e2ncias da personagem Lea d\u00e3o margem pra MUITA backstory bacana e eu tenho muita f\u00e9 que os criadores v\u00e3o bolar algo bem bacana. A hist\u00f3ria n\u00e3o est\u00e1 completa no momento dessa review, pois o jogo est\u00e1 em Early Access, mas mesmo assim voc\u00ea pode acessar \u00e1reas al\u00e9m do momento em que a hist\u00f3ria est\u00e1 feita. Logo logo v\u00e3o colocar quests e encontros especiais pra cobrir os espa\u00e7os.\n\nDevo avisar que este jogo \u00e9 EXTREMAMENTE r\u00e1pido e fren\u00e9tico, e n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada f\u00e1cil. N\u00e3o existe sistema de dificuldade selecion\u00e1vel, o que pra mim \u00e9 um ponto positivo pois a progress\u00e3o \u00e9 decente e voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisa de muito grinding quando voc\u00ea aprende as mec\u00e2nicas e acessa novas habilidades, exceto quando voc\u00ea realmente quer liberar algo na Skill Tree. Prepare-se para morrer BASTANTE.\n\nPr\u00f3s:\n+Extremamente promissor para um Early Access\n+Combate r\u00e1pido e fren\u00e9tico com \u00f3timos controles (Pelo menos no Gamepad, n\u00e3o sei como \u00e9 Mouse+KB)\n+Trilha sonora agrad\u00e1vel\n+Bom sound design\n+Skill Trees variadas com caminhos divergentes, onde alguns podem ser trocados sem nenhum custo de ponto\n+Personagens legais com designs \u00fanicos\n+Puzzles muito bem articulados\n+Pixel art linda e que passa por grandes reformas (Procure \"Crosscode Lea\" no Google e v\u00e3o aparecer muitas imagens de Antes/Depois dos Portraits)\n+Equipe muito prestativa de desenvolvimento que escuta seus f\u00e3s\n\nContras:\n-Early Access, logo, incompleto at\u00e9 a presente data\n-Alguns puzzles podem te deixar preso por muito tempo\n-Voc\u00ea pode se perder MUITO f\u00e1cil se n\u00e3o seguir o mapa e olhar cada peda\u00e7o aberto que se parece uma porta\n-Consequ\u00eancia do Early Access: Muitos peda\u00e7os da Skill Tree ainda est\u00e3o faltando\n-As chances de voc\u00ea achar um item que voc\u00ea realmente precisa s\u00e3o baixas, tornando o sistema de trocas bem trabalhoso\n\n\u00c9 isso!

The levels can be replayed at any time and you are free to explore the open world. \n\nIn fact, teleporting back to the start of the level and chaining together all of the enemies will boost your combat rating from D,C,B,A, all the way to S which means better item drops. As soon as you leave combat you get a short timer to start the next combat or you lose your rating. The rating pushes you to attack the next mobs even if they are harder and even if you're nearly dead and it can get really intense (as a death would put you back to the beginning).\n\nThere are even some elite mobs that will kill you in 2-3 hits that take a few mins to kill and are very reminiscent of Dark Souls bosses. The first one I found was a large dark blue hedgehog that spins to attack you (though he didn't have red shoes or white gloves).\n\nThe pixel art is really charming and the lighthearted music is amazing and varied. It definitely reminded me of classics such as Zelda and Alundra.\n\nBefore purchasing I thought the price was steep for an indie game but since playing I've discovered that it is more than fair as there is a lot of quality content here.\n\nI also voted it for the Game Within a Game award and can't help but laugh at the ingame 'players' anticipating the closed off areas \"coming out in the next patch\" :D", "timestamp_created": 1479977597, "timestamp_updated": 1479977778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504796", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27074593": {"recommendationid": "27074593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004745463", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478621865}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of the best early access game I've ever played.\n\nPros:\n- High speed and complex combat, but also accessible and fun\n- Even just running & jumping around is super smooth and entertaining\n- Perhaps the only top-down 2D action game that succeeds at platforming, and really good at it too\n- Tons of hidden items on every map with tricky paths\n- Fun characters\n\nCons:\n- At times it's hard to remember the specific location of a quest's client and the game only indicates which map they're located", "timestamp_created": 1479976147, "timestamp_updated": 1479976147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27047104": {"recommendationid": "27047104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017398842", "num_games_owned": 555, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510148003}, "language": "english", "review": "First time I heard about this game was somewhere in 2015. I played the demo and simply with that, I wanted to buy the game. But considering that the game is single player, is in early access AND it costs 20\u20ac, I was pretty sceptical about buying it. I mean, I had played the demo and I was confident that the quality of the game is amazing. It's just that I was afraid I'd be paying for a single player experience that'll get finished sometime in 2 or 3 years, at which time I'd already be bored with the game and not even bother playing the full version. So I decided to wait until it was out of early access... And considering that I already own the game and have played a few hours of it, you can probably tell that my impatience got the  better of me.\n\nAnd what was the experience like? Well, it's as I assumed: a very fun action RPG with a colorful world and a cast of characters that you'd swear you've met and loved in any other MMORPG you've ever played... But as the game is in early access, the story leaves something to be desired. They ARE working on it, but know that the story is only added in little by little with some updates. It's not a bad thing, I mean you ARE getting the story and all. It's just that if you're planning on getting the game, know that you might have to wait a month or two or three just to get another piece of the story. It would be the only reason I wouldn't recommend the game yet, but the game itself is so much fun that I can't just not recommend it.\n\nBut that's not to say the story is bad. Absolutely not. It's just not finished, and seeing that this is a game in early access, that's to be expected. So if you want the full experience of CrossCode, my recommendation is that you play it when it comes out of early access for the full experience all at once. The problem with that is that if you don't have the patience to do that and you want to get this game, you'll probably go crazy because of the wait like I did.\n\nOn the other hand, you could jump on the development train and become involved! Buy and play the game, then report any bugs or typos or whatever to the devs and help them make CrossCode the masterpiece it deserves to be. Devstreams happen almost every week, so you can head over to Radical Fish Games Twitch channel on Sunday at 11am (PST) / 20:00 (CET) if you're interested in how the game is coming together.\n\nAll in all, CrossCode is a gem that, in my opinion, is on it's way to becoming a masterpiece. I know I haven't talked about the gameplay itself, but trust me when I say that it's fast, intense and extremely fun. The only thing I regret about buying CrossCode is that I bought it in a bundle for merely a fraction of CrossCode's original price. Gonna have to change that soonish: Going to wait until the sale on the game ends and buy it full price to support the devs.\n\nIt may still be in early access, but it's worth every penny of it's base asking price.

Quirks like Lea's (The Main Character) inability to speak coherently and can only blurt out words or phrases at certain points along with her multitude of interesting faces that she makes, brings extra life to the characters.\n\nThe areas are also really beautifully represented but there are still some undeveloped areas due to being an Early-Access title. However, I don't regret buying this game as I feel that it was worth my money helping this developer.\n\nWhat I did not really like was that it was rather confusing to find where the NPC where specifically. The game would tell you the general area but not the exact coordinates, this meant that you would spend time rather uneconomically by just running around trying to find this NPC.\n\nAnyway, if you liked Secret of Mana and the rest of the Seiken Densetsu games or Illusion of Gaia, you would most certainly would want this in your library as it shares its gameplay but with a much more modern and faster feel.", "timestamp_created": 1479950691, "timestamp_updated": 1479956539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518868", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26969965": {"recommendationid": "26969965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080188697", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479949275}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc644\uc131\uc774 \uae30\ub300\ub418\ub294 \ub3c4\ud2b8\uac8c\uc784.", "timestamp_created": 1479949324, "timestamp_updated": 1480438763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26964364": {"recommendationid": "26964364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067872098", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478139422}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a blast.\n\nThe story is amazing.\nThe characters are great.\nThe art is pretty.\nThe controls are intuitive.\n\nI love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1479948072, "timestamp_updated": 1479948072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26948276": {"recommendationid": "26948276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137114606", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508539566}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 would play forever", "timestamp_created": 1479944609, "timestamp_updated": 1479944609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26943446": {"recommendationid": "26943446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076458835", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511759972}, "language": "english", "review": "As of this time, it's still in development.

The characters are pretty good, the plot and landscapes are AMAZING, and the combat is nostalgic. My current rating would be a  8.9/10.

I'd personally recommend playing this with a controller as the controls feel perfect with that layout as you never have to rely on face buttons during combat, it just feels so tight and responsive. K/M feels pretty good as well, but I'd recommend the controller for this.

Now the game is very intersting and the combat is also really good, however it could use some improvement. This is by far one of my favorite games despite it only being in early access. I would without a doubt recommended it to everyone who likes RPG's and don't mind the art.\n\nThat said I think I can get to the second part of the review.\n\nOk, so CrossCode is a 2D action RPG, unlike most RPGs it's a cyber RPG and not a fantasy one.\n\n\n-It features a Tree system for the skills called \"Circuits\"\n\nI really like the ability to choose your own path, your style. However the circuits dont let you do that.The circuit system is still incomplete and I hope it will let you pick a \"style\" once it's complete. Being a melee spheromancer is near impossible and being a tank is useless. This system has a lot of potential but is not fully exploited.\n\n\n-Challenging bosses and puzzles\n\nI personally really, really enjoyed this. For some people, the puzzles and the bosse fights can be extremly frustrating due to their punishing behavior. \n\nWhen you die in a boss fight you have to redo the entire fight and figure out what did you do wrong and what can you do to not make the same mistake. However for some people dying over and over is not an option and they tend to give up. I see it as a way to evolve. \n\nThe puzzles can almost all be solved using reverse engineering however to solve some puzzles you will need to have great timing and understanding. I remember at the level 18 dungeon I was trying to get one of the last mine keys. I knew the key was in the room I was in, because it was the only one left, however I didn't have enough vision to see where I should throw my fire charged ball to prock the bomb and destroy the rocks. So I started throwing charged balls in all directions until I got it right after one minute. I still don't know if there was another way to solve that puzzle, but I rejoice in the method I used to solve it; this game lets you be creative (sometimes).\n\nMonaster puzzle (ascension quest): At the last level I was really confused and spent thirty minutes trying to figure out what was going on because I completly forgot that you could use a shield in this game... You were put on a steady plate and you had to block the cannon's shots. However nobody uses the stupid fucking shield in this game so we forgot that it existed!!! Can you make it so we use the shield more??? So that it's mandatory sometimes.\n\n-Map and Quests\n\nThe map (not the regions and everything, when I say map I mean the thing you see when you press TAB and click on map) is horrible and the quests are often unclear. The map shows you very little information and could use a massive rework (I know it's still early access) and the quest tab under synopsis should show you the location of the quest giver using a map. I take on alot of quests and when I complete one I have to start looking around for 10 minutes to hopefully find the quest giver... not fun. Also for gathering quests tell us what plants or whatever we have to destroy to get the material using an image or something similar.\n\n-Combat\n\nI feel like it relies too much on range combat. The use of the shield is almost always unecessary. However it is fun and enjoyable.\n\n-Controls\nI tried to play this with my logitech F310 controller and all I could say was : holy shit. You attack with fucking [RB] ? do you know how tiring that is??? It hurts after 2 minutess... You need to redo the controls for controllers. However the mouse and keyboard controls are fine as they are. Can you also introduce an option to jump? The automatic jump is thrash. \n\n-Graphics\nThis is the last point because it didn't bother me a lot. I play on a 27 inch 1440p monitor. Once the game has been upscaled 10000x times it looks like a blurry mess.\n\n\nConclusion --> This is constructive critiscism. I want you to understand that I loved this (early access) game and that's why I bothered writing a review, if you are undecided as to wether you should pick up this game or no, I would recommend you pick it up!

The battle system is awesome.  It's fast paced with an intricate system of breaking defenses to actually be able to do good damage to enemies.  I find often that it really is the only way to kill off enemies.  The combination of using range, melee, and dashing is well balanced and fun.  I am also impressed with the skill tree system, and how each element has its own separate tree.  It really allows for some specialization of the character.  You can basically build a character with different ways of fighting for each element.  The only bad part of the skill tree is that all the skills have not been implemented yet.  I find myself at a  stand still with my character building because I don't know what the next skills will actually be.  \nThe platforming and puzzles range from super easy to difficult.  The rewards of each puzzle match to the difficulty of each puzzle.  So if you are not really a puzzle person you can rely on the gathering and crafting system to get new armor and weapons.  I do find that there is some minor grinding that needs to happen to craft new equipment which can be a turn off for some people, not me though.  If you play MMO's you'll be fine.  \nThe difficulty of the game overall is moderate.  It's easy to die from regular mobs if you are not paying attention, and the bosses are challenging.

I don't think I'll be able to go back to a standard RPG with where you have to stand still and let the dice choose everything. The movement and skills are addictive. \n- Ambience and atmosphere. Landscapes to explore. A perfect combination of cyber feel and traditional creatures + magic. Good story so far.\n- Skill trees are flexible and forgiving. Unlike things like Diablo II, you can always change around your points, and each element uses a separate skill point bank. Part of the game is using all of your elements and neutral powers, as you get them one by one. \n\nMIXED: \n- A bit puzzle heavy for my taste so far. I have seen some similar complaints from other players. 75% of the game is traditional quests, killing, and small puzzles, but 25% are these long dungeons with chains of puzzle after puzzle. These can be fun in some moderation, but they may be a little much for traditional RPG players. Some of the puzzles are more tedious than others also (fail to jump or time something correctly, and you have to go back to the beginning, etc.). \n\nEven with the mixed, I still definitely recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1479104540, "timestamp_updated": 1479104540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26593895": {"recommendationid": "26593895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162531301", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 39396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489945441}, "language": "english", "review": "First review Ive written.

Das sieht man heutzutage echt nicht mehr oft. Ne Menge Teams k\u00f6nnen sich da mal ne Scheibe von abschneiden!\n\nCrossCode ist ein 2D Action-RPG welches an alte Zeiten erinnert. Es spielt in einer fiktiven zukunftsartigen Welt in dem du ein Spiel in einem Spiel spielst, vergleichbar mit dem Anime Sword Art Online. Zudem ist die Welt vollgepackt mit einer Unzahl an kniffligen R\u00e4tseln im Zelda-Style.\nDas Spiel beginnt mit einem d\u00fcster gestalteten spielbaren Prolog, in dem du ein junges M\u00e4dchen spielst welches versucht seinen scheinbar gefangenen Bruder zu retten. Der Prolog dient gleichzeitig auch als Minitutorial und endet mit vielen offenen Fragen. Nach einer Sequenz wird deine Protagonistin Lea ins Spiel wortw\u00f6rtlich gespawnt und die Geschichte nimmt seinen Lauf.\n\nPro's:\n+ unglaublich sch\u00f6n gestaltete Welt\n+ toller und stets passender Soundtrack\n+ riesengro\u00dfer F\u00e4higkeitsbaum mit ner Menge Spezialangriffe (WIP!)\n+ unz\u00e4hlige R\u00e4tsel von leicht bis schwer \n+ forderndes Kampfsystem mit intensiven K\u00e4mpfen\n+ sehr gelungenes Storywriting\n+ DEMO!\n\nCon's:\n- manchmal sehr schwammige Jumpphysics (wird sicher im Laufe der Zeit gefixt)\n- Dungeonbossk\u00e4mpfe neigen zu schnellem Ende wenn erstmal der Schwachpunkt gebrochen wurde (es besteht bei allen Bossen   OneShot Potenzial -> vlt die Zeitfenster verringern)\n- die Ebenen Unterschiede sind Zeitweise extrem schwer zu erkennen (dadurch werden Jumppuzzles manchmal ein Disaster)\n- keine Questmarker (l\u00e4sst den Spieler des \u00f6fteren hilflos zur\u00fcck)\n- ung\u00fcnstige, gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftige Schnellmen\u00fcf\u00fchrung (im Kampf manchmal wirklich ung\u00fcnstig-> Slots oder Hotkeys w\u00e4ren da besser)\n\nAbschlie\u00dfend m\u00f6chte ich mich noch einmal bei den Entwicklern bedanken, daf\u00fcr das sie einfach ein Paradebeispiel f\u00fcr Early-Access bieten! CrossCode ist ein wunderbares Spiel mit unglaublich gro\u00dfem Potenzial und ich hoffe Radical Fish Games nutzt es aus und gibt dem Spiel den Platz den es verdient. Ich kann dieses Spiel wirklich jedem Spieler ans Herz legen und damit meine ich wirklich jedem! Ich hab das Spiel jetzt schon bis zum aktuellsten Stand durchgespielt und trotzdem will ich es immer weiter spielen obwohl es nix mehr zu tun gibt.

After having played it a bit, I have to say I absolutely love this game- it's one of the best games I've played in a long time. The core gameplay elements of this game are fun and just feel great- I would say they set a high bar in terms of quality and, as a game developer myself, they are inspirational in how a great game should feel and play.\n\nThere are a couple things that really stand out about the game:\n- The controls are on point. Running and jumping around the world feels superb, I would be willing to put the controls for this game on the same level as Super Meat Boy's controls.\n- The combat is good (and fun!), the combat systems are easy to learn (maybe feeling a little akward at first because of the mix of range and melee) but require enough finess that you can get noticeably better at combat.\n- I like the art, some people don't like \"retro\"/pixel art but I think CrossCode doesn't just go for \"retro\" style art. The world is more detailed than what you would find in an actual SNES-Era game, but is still in the same style. I would call this art high quality pixel art, I especially love the antimation on the title screen.\n- The world/lore is interesting (so far) and the game being a [spoiler]'parody' of an MMO[/spoiler] is well executed and entertaining. I love how the world is used to explain and build gameplay mechanics, such as having allies, communicating with people, and more. I look foward to seeing the story continue and eventually be completed in future updates.\n\nBeyond those specific points, I still enjoy pretty much everything else about this game (they just don't nessecarily jump out as specifically being awesome to me). The music is good, the controller support is good, leveling and equipment (allowing for a bit of flexability in how you build your character) are also good. I struggle to find anything negative about the game.\n\nThat said, there are really only two negatives I can find about the game (which honestly don't bother me at all).\n- Sometimes it can be difficult to tell how high up you are in relation to other terrain/platforms (which is important for moving around). The world you are moving around in gives you 3 dimensions of freedom, however it's only represented in 2 dimensions.  I've only had this be a problem once or twice, but it's maybe worth mentioning. It really is only a minor problem, it's not nearly as bad as what you have problem encountered in other 2D/3D plaformers where it can be difficult to gauge gaps and your placement in the world.\n- It's not finished :( I was really sad to see I had hit the end of the existing story content and can't wait to see the game finished (at which point I will probably replay it from scratch).\n\nEverything said and done I would absolutely recommend this game. This is, personally, one of the best games I have played in a long time and I can't wait to see where the world and story go as the game continues to develop.", "timestamp_created": 1478548433, "timestamp_updated": 1478548444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26475231": {"recommendationid": "26475231", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970837233", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488864938}, "language": "english", "review": "This game reminds me of how you dont need the latest graphics to have a game be fun.\nI love the 16bit feel of this game.

These shall be ignored for now, as they will be fixed in the final version.\n\nPros:\n + Pretty fun gameplay\n + Charming art\n + Interesting enemies\n + Good mix of real time action and RPG\n + Good puzzles\n + Lots of side quests\n\nNeutral:\n - Consuming heal items takes time and leaves you vulnerable\n\nCons:\n - Locations to finish quests often unclear\n - Puzzles and bosses can get quite challenging and there's no option to choose difficulty\n - Questmenu kinda hidden\n - Quick access menu not very comfortable\n - Low item drop rates\n\nI think the good parts of the game are quite obvious: Apart from the nice pixel art, the gameplay is really good. Despite the pixel art, the movement is free and not tile-based and the game plays similar to titles like diablo or bastion. Apart from the Action, there's a skill tree and options for equipping the character, so it also got the fun of a RPG.\n\nAbout the bad parts: I think the only real criticism would be that the game can sometimes get rather difficult. For this, I'd suggest adding an option to choose difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard) or have a option to give hints to the player (maybe in form of a shop item?). The other points are mostly nit-picking which hopefully get fixed in the final version: It sucks that the quest menu requires couple of clicks (with the gamepad) to reach. Assigning it directly to a button or the quick access menu is neccessary. Also, the quick access menu is kinda uncomfortable: Holding down a button, moving the analog stick and then also pressing another button is annoying. One of the two last steps can and should be removed for an easier access. Another thing is about the quests: Often, it is very unclear where you initially got the quest. Every place in the game is rather big and full of hidden paths, so searching around for one person is annoying. A better description (\"This person is in the north-west of place XY\") would be nice. What also annoyed me were really low drop rates for certain items, be it from monsters or from plants. Especially when a certain amount of items is needed for a quest and the specific item drops at 1% chance (bear tail or smth, for example), then that's rather annoying and really just grinding, which isn't very nice. Also, starting the game does take a while (20 seconds, I guess?), which feels rather long for a 2D pixel art game like this, but well, since the game runs fast after that without longer loading times, that's ok.\n\nWell, this was mostly just me nitpicking. Overall, the game looks very promising and is pretty fun and addictive to play!\nI'll edit this review with time as I and the game's development progress.", "timestamp_created": 1478048094, "timestamp_updated": 1478058782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501117", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26353624": {"recommendationid": "26353624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103323832", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 70, "last_played": 1513876754}, "language": "english", "review": "Now this is my first review so bare with me.\n\nI have been following this game for some time and recently I finally bought it. The game is obvioulsy inspired by some old classics but it also tries to inovate a lot and brings tons of great features that help the pacing of the game, and the overall enjoyement.\n\nYou play as an avatar called Lea. She is mute, but slowly starts to get more words put into her vocabulary as the story progresses. This sparks a lot of interesting and comedical conversations  which brings me to the first great point of this game. The writing, and some of my favourite things are :\nInspect the hilarious usernames of the npc's\nAbility to listen to conversations and then interrupt if there is something interesting in it, which usually results in a quest\nAlthough the main character is mute, the amount of different expressions the character has + the supporting characters really spice up a lot of conversations.\nDon't want to watch/read a cutscene ? The game has got you covered with the skip cutscene feature which can skip almost any dialogue in the game, even the important story parts, which is great for both speedrunning and people who are replaying certain areas.\nCombining all of this the story is really enjoyable the whole way through.\n\nNow, for the great mechanics.\nLooking for a rare item for a quest ? Just keep killing enemies without stopping for a short time and your \"rank\" will increase ! The higher the rank the better the loot ! This helps a ton and can also keep areas where you are overleveled (revisiting old areas ) fairly dynamic to go through anyway, as you can try to chain as many monsters as you can.\nYou have the normal quests that give you a bit of exp, but the majority of the quests are really interesting and make you do things such as :\nFight sonic the hedgehog\nGo into a mole hideout\nCatch a smuggler\nDiscover landmarks etc.\nSpeaking of landmarks, teleporting ! Cause backtracking has never been easier !\n\nLets move on to the art and music.\nNow I am not the best with musical terms, but this game does a really good job with the soundtrack. It is not too diverse, as you will usually be going through a whole area with just 1 song playing + the battle song, but the songs are not annoying at all even after listening to them for some time.\nThe pixel art in this game is gorgeous , some of the best I have seen. This is aspecially impressive seeing that its made by a small team. At certain points you are really high up from the ground and the view to down below  is great, or in the early areas of the game , the view to the first city from far away is breathtaking because it gives a sense of scale of the world.\nAll the animations feel extremely well, and the game should run on 60 fps on most computers, and if it doesn't , I suggest going to windowed mode and lowering the window size. The smaller the faster !\n\nNow for the most important and best part of this game \nGameplay\nNow I am gonna divide gameplay into 3 categories :\n1. Platforming\n- Really basic jumping platforming, but there are a lot of areas where you are just going to say : \" Hmm, how do I get over there \" , which usually I would say is a bad thing, but in this case it feels like a puzzle of its own.\n- Party members follow you really nicely around the map. There is only a few instances where I have seen the AI fail a jump.\n- Theres a quest where you jump on top of a roof to chase a goat. WHAT MORE YOU NEED ?\n2. Puzzles\n- As I said, platforming can sometimes be a puzzle of its own, but besides that this game features a lot of other good and interseting mechanics.\n-Platforms that only move/extended when you hit a switch. At first this seems really basic and unoriginal , but you would be suprised how interesting it gets later on.\n-Your balls ( weapon, not the nut part ) bounce off of terrain , which in combination with the extending/moving platforms gives some really fun puzzles, which are exteremely fun to watch when speedrunned.\n3. Combat\n- Skill tree with 4 elements.\n- Every elements is a different part of your character Fire = demage , Cold = Defense , Electricity = Ball demage  and Wind = Health/Dodge\n-You can switch between using different elements, which comes with its own costs and advantages.\n-Dodge, Melee, ranged and block feature.\n- Block feature features ( say that 10 times fast )  perfect blocking, aka timing your block last second to negate demage/counter enemy attacks, leaving them vulnerable.\n- Dodging can not be spammed which, in my opinion ,is a good thing.\n-Tough but extermely fun bosses \n-Enemies tend to have a lot of recolours which is probbably the biggest negative point of the game I have found so far ( This does not mean the game is perfect ) Although, recolours tend to have different means of attacking then their previous itterations. ( For example , normal hedgehags can \"spin dash\" at you , while red ones can dash and jump on top of you, where you need to block one and dodge the other )\n- And of course simple to learn but hard to master controls.\n\nI give this game a 9.5/10 as it currently stands, and this is honestly my opinion and its subject to change and it does not have to affect your opinion at all.\nThe game is addictive and fun, if I truly talked about everything in this review, it would have taken me double the time to write this.\n\nThank you for  your patience, and I hope we can direct link our opinions

Ok i'll stop spoiling now.) with different strategies that reward the player for using his brain a little, but not so much that it interrupts the pacing? Check.\nPlatforming puzzles with switches and pushing boxes and moving platforms and things that shoot at you and bombs and... check.\nSidequests that are not just plopped on, but actually feel like you have a small impact on the world, hidden chests with loot inside, backtracking, making encyclopedias of monsters and plants? Check.\nBalance between combat platforming and puzzle? Check.\nEpic boss battles with patterns to learn? Check. \nSentient cyborgoats?

The sprite-style of this game doesn't only look beautiful, it also runs as smooth as a good Shooter with high FPs and  low Ping.\n\nCharacter:\n\n- What I really like about this game is the Main Character. This is one of the very rare games in which the Main Character is something special, she is funny, badass and many more without even the need for long speeches. The same can be said to the other important characters. Each one of them is unique in his/her/its own aspect and the dialog's between them is often quite funny.\n\nFights:\n\n- The fast-pace fights in this game are quite difficult but they make fun, which is something really rare today in this combination.\n\nMusic:\n\n- The music is something which can only be praised in any aspect. It isn't too good that you would get distracted but it's not too plain that you don't even notice it.\n\nStory:\n\n- I can't say much about the overall story at the moment but the things I know at the moment are quite interesting which too, is something rather rare these days. The combination of VR-MMORG in the story is quite unique and the other aspects, which I won't spoil, are really good.\n\nOverall:\n\n- Overall is this game not only one of my favorites but also one of the best I have played, in any aspect. It has style, good characters, nice background music, nice story and a really good concept.

Combat is tight and challenging without being frustrating, rewarding quick reflexes and concentration, and the movement/parkour system is very satisfying despite its simplicity.\n\nMy main (and to be honest only) gripe is that this game is inundated with fetch quests. I was able to overlook how menial the quests were because of how fun the core gameplay loop is.\n\nThe characters are very likeable and charming, which I found to be a huge relief since a lot of JRPG inspired games tend to be swimming in unbelievably twee characters. Not the case here, and on more than one occasion I've found myself grinning and laughing along with the characters. Nothing too heavy going on, no black fringed edgelords stinking up the mood.\n\nPicked it up for \u20ac15 and so far it's looking like being worth easily twice that.", "timestamp_created": 1477792871, "timestamp_updated": 1477793029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26302440": {"recommendationid": "26302440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079506572", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513311043}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has something going for it but I'm not sure what,\n\nCrossCode is a sort-of 'Hack n' Slash, Bullet Hell RPG' which coincidentally (story-wise) takes places inside a game of the same genre. However, fun gameplay aside it's story is questionable but enjoyable.\n\nYou play 'Lea', a blue-haired 'avatar' which is basically infiltrating an online videogame as a fake player. You're basically a sentient AI who's motive is unclear for the entire game. I wasn't sure what the whole point of the main character being in the game was and I was never told why. The game pulls the amnesia-card straight out of the hat with this story so your main character knows just as much as you do. However, the few people that do know your backstory don't speak up at all and rather take a backseat while occasionally talking. Immersion breaks after that unfortunately once you dive into an endless paradox of self-purpose but let's not get ahead of ourselves. \n\nCharacters are a mix of fantastic but also quite mundane. Most of the time you're accompanied by a French Redheaded girl named Emilie who for the most part won't shutup and her only real use is 'To stop you from being a solo-player in a RPG'. There's also some green dude that I forgot the name of because he makes an appearance like twice and then you never see him again who has so much potential to be part of the plotline but it doesn't seem like it. He acts more like a rival from Pokemon than anything else.  There isn't much relation to the main-story and the ingame characters in that regard, the only 'real' character you keep in touch with that knows about your backstory doesn't say much aside from obvious advice such as 'Log off now you imbecile, you can't play for 24 hours, that's not human'. This entire scenario to put lightly comes to a screeching halt when we nearly get proper character development and then the game slaps you in the face and says \"Hi, we haven't made this part yet! But you can still grind and do stuff to set you way over the level-cap for the next dungeon so that the game loses its challenge.' \n\nHow am I still giving this game a positive review?\nBecause for the most part, it's fun. It's challenging and enjoyable to enough of an extend where I can recommend this game to people who like fast-paced gameplay. The gameplay/gunplay/whateverplay is amazing, borrowing a lot from 'Furi', dashing around, avoiding attacks and when getting into close-quarters it can seem chaotic. The puzzles are a mixture of difficult and relatively easy, a bunch of the Ice Temple's puzzles had me stumped up until the last one which was probably the easiest in the entire dungeon. But that's what got me hooked, the gameplay. Which is a damn shame because the story accompanying it has so many flaws but so many upsides it's hard to say whether it will live up to the gameplay and blossom into a great game or just trip and fall into the pit of forgotten games. \nFor what it's worth, play it as it is right now.

No enemy feels like its a trash mob, unless youre 5 levels above that poor little creature, because then you're likely oneshotting it anyway. There's a relatively well structured vendor system aswell, that rewards you with items that don't just boost your basic stats, but enable you to customize Lea (that's the protagonist's name, duh) to your playsytle. Want hardhitting crit balls? There you have them. Want to take like 0 damage when blocking and reflect damage to enemies? You can do just that! \n(Disclaimer: said strategies are not guaranteed to work throughout the progress of the Game) The Riddles and Puzzles are great and are a lot of fun, and if you're not a fan of those, too bad, you're missing out on some good Leveldesign there.\n\n[b]Moving on to the Characters and Music.[/b]\n\nTwo words, Eargasm and Eyegasm.\nThe soundtracks are awesome, fitting and don't get too repetitive or boring while you're playing,\nCharacters have really unique characteristics to them, which makes them very enjoyable. (I'm not looking at Apollo or anything.) Also, I think it's mentionable that every single Pixel the devs put onto your screen is blessed, because everything just looks so good, even with those little colored squares being visible. Animations are smooth and very enjoyable (also oddly satisfying sometimes.) And don't get me started with the title screen, that smooth animation had me hooked for a good 2 minutes of appreciation.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nIs this game worth 20 bucks? For you? Probably. For me? Oh hell yes.\nDoes the game offer you quality gameplay? Hells yeah.\nDo the devs deserve your money?

Es kombiniert ein Echtzeit-Kampfsystem mit knackigen (Zelda-artigen) R\u00e4tseln und einer packenden Geschichte.\n\nEntwickler: Radical Fish Games \u2014 [url]www.radicalfishgames.com[/url] (Englisch)\nHerausgeber: Deck13 \u2014 [url]www.deck13.com[/url] (Englisch)\n\nCrossCode - Netzauftritt (Englisch): [url]cross-code.com[/url]\nCrossCode - Enzyklop\u00e4die (Englisch): [url]crosscode.gamepedia.com[/url]\nNetz-Demo (Englisch und Deutsch): [url]cross-code.com/en/start[/url] (ben\u00f6tigt einen HTML5-Kompatiblen Internetbetrachter)\n\nSchwierigkeitsgrad: Moderat\n\n[h1]Grafik[/h1]\nAngelehnt an alte SNES-Klassiker, unvergleichlich detailverliebt mit Parallaxe und Zwischensequenzen\n\n[b]Teilwertung: 10 von 10[/b]\n\n[h1]Steuerung[/h1]\nDas Spiel erlaubt es frei zwischen Nah- und Fernkampf, ausweichen, Spezialangriffen, Schild und Elementarangriffen zu wechseln, um die unterschiedlichen Gegner mit passender Taktik zu besiegen. Die Steuerung ist dabei so gew\u00e4hlt, das ein komfortabeles und schnelles wechseln der Angriffe m\u00f6glich ist. Die Steuerung ist perfekt auf das Spiel abgestimmt und einzigartig. Probiere die [url=cross-code.com/en/start]Netz-Demo[/url] (Unterst\u00fctzt controller mit X-Eingaben oder mit Maus und Tastatur spielbar; ben\u00f6tigt einen HTML5-Kompatiblen Internetbetrachter)\n\n[b]Teilwertung: 10 von 10[/b]\n\n[h1]Musik[/h1]\nDie Musik, wurde von [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Intero]Intero[/url] komponiert und ist perfekt auf das Spiel und die Umgebung abgestimmt. Meiner meinung nach beinhaltet CrossCode einige der wohl besten Musikst\u00fccke die man im Videospielebereich findet.

Zudem ist ihr [spoiler]k\u00fcnstlicher K\u00f6rper[/spoiler] aufgrund eines [spoiler]Technischen Problems (ein bisschen) stumm.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Teilwertung: ---------[/b]\n\n[h1]Umfang[/h1]\n\nDas Spiel ist in Entwicklung und hat damit nicht den Umfang des vollen Spiels. Trotzdem kann man viele Stunden spa\u00df haben\n\nGesamtspielzeit - Geschichte: ~8h\nGesamtspielzeit - Missionen und Details: +45h\n\n[b]Teilwertung: ---------[/b]\n\n[h1]Gesamtwertung[/h1]\nDas Spiel ist f\u00fcr mich Perfekt\n\nGrafik: 10 von 10 \u201ePerfekt\u201c\nSteuerung: 10 von 10 \u201ePerfekt\u201c\nMusik: 10 von 10 \u201ePerfekt\u201c\nGeschichte: ---------\nUmfang: ---------\n\n[b]Gesamtwertung: 30 von 30 - \u201ePerfekt\u201c[/b]\n\n[h1]\u00dcber die Rezension und den Autor[/h1]\nAuflage: c4\n\nDiese Rezension spiegelt meine subjektive Meinung wieder.

Highly recommended.\n\nCrosscode is one of those special games you come across only once in a while. A small, obscure indie game that hides in the nooks and crannies of the internet, hoping to be discovered.\n\nIf I were to describe this game with a sentence: Imagine a game that combines classic 2D Legend of Zelda puzzle and exploration mechanics with top-down shooter combat, and MMORPG leveling and skill tree systems.\n\nThe game world takes place in an MMORPG called \"Crosscode\" but is in fact a single player game. The exact place you have in this world as the protagonist (Lea) is a mystery, and an intriguing intro sequence reveals that you may have quite the past to uncover. Suffering from amnesia, the only way to recover your memories is to play and advance through the world of Crosscode, fulfilling two purposes: Completing the game, and discovering the truth about yourself.\n\nThis game exploits the best elements of an MMORPG, and eliminates the boring parts they contain. Leveling up, finding hidden items, getting loot, destroying large amounts of enemies in a short amount of time, skill-based combat that requires finesse and precision, these are all fantastic elements in Crosscode. If you master the combat system, you can wipe out enemies vastly superior to you in level, and by investing in a variety of skills, unlocked through a skilltree, you can express yourself with battle instead of words, which you'll come to find quite valuable. *wink wink* \n\nPuzzle mechanics are not only smart and satisfying, making you feel like a smug little Sherlock, but they are just as fast paced as the combat, meaning that you'll never sit still and be bored out of your mind, or spend too much time walking around wondering what the hell is going on.\n\nSo please, buy this game. The developers deserve so much more than what they're getting. There's *passion* in this game. Just go. Buy it. Do it, do it now.

In fact, when you buy this game, the package you download is basically a browser baked to run this game. No plugins like Flash or anything like that - but written in HTML5 and JavaScript instead of something more standard like C++ or Unity.\n\nBut this review don't need no qualifier. Because this game is amazing.\n\nFirst of all, it has an absolutely beautiful aesthetic. The 16-bit pixel graphics look stunning, and easily create a piece of a beautiful whole. Each and every animation looks fluid and natural - playing as Lea and exploring her different moves felt like experimenting with Mario's acrobatics in SM64 all over again. And just as amazing are the sound effects - things tap, ping, scratch, and pop in a way that just adds so much. My personal favorite audiovisual moment in the game is seeing and hearing avatars materialize - hearing that soft, otherworldly fizzle and seeing the blue, slightly teal patterns come together was love at first sight for me.\n\nThe gameplay is also pretty awesome. Your dual wielding of both a strong melee weapon as well as a slightly weaker ranged weapon (which itself can either be thrown slowly and accurately or quickly and haphazardly) makes for plenty of exciting combat experiences that always keep you on your toes, anticipating the enemy's patterns and watching for weaknesses. And the same tools also apply themselves very well to the far less combative puzzles, which feel like they take things common to games like Zelda and one-up them all over the place. I found switching between the two weapons difficult on keyboard and mouse (the system they use, in which you click close to Lea to swing your melee weapon and click far away to aim and fire your balls, can be finnicky to get right), but it became quite easy with an Xbox controller (which simply melees when you press RS unless you are also aiming with the right stick) and even easier with a Steam Controller.\n\nThe story of the inner MMORPG (CrossWorlds) that the characters are in is cheesy as heck, but the surrounding story of CrossCode itself, the single-player RPG you're playing, is very good. I can sense a bit of satire towards the MMO genre as the characters make various comments about CrossWorlds, such as Emilie's comment about how the players (who are essentially jacked into fully immersive rigs connected to their avatars) can adjust their sensors to decide whether or not they want to feel the cold of Bergen Trail. And beyond that, all of the characters are well written and have interesting stories to tell. I can't wait to see what else the game has in store for this aspect.\n\nAnd again, as I mentioned before, it's designed to play in a freakin' [I]browser[/I]! The platform that has traditionally been the platform of serious business applications and .io games and banner ads is also completely and totally home to THIS thing! If you're feeling down about the state of the Internet and Internet programming, download and play this game. You'll feel much better.\n\nHeck, even if you aren't, download and play this game.

It's truly challenging, and it's like a single player MMORPG as insane as that sounds. Unbelieveable writing. No soilers - at one point your regular (admittedly gimped) companion has to \"log off\" because it's too late and the last dungeon took too long. Literally this person is an NPC but it's undeniably meta since this NPC is your friend, party companion, fellow guild member, yet despite the fact she's an NPC she has to go \"AFK\" and log because it's too late and she literally \"logs off\" and is inaccessible in the game universe for an unspecified amount of time.\n\nThe combat mechanics are like Witcher 3 level skills.\n\nI just can't praise this game enough. Devs, PLEASE give us an option for additional financial contributions to allow for more frequent content updates.

This is my first review on steam, and this is the kind of game I've been waiting for, for a long time.\n\nWhen I discovered Secret of Mana as a kid, I was hooked from start to finish. When I tried Seiken Densetsu III after it, same thing. I'm not sure how to explain what made these games so special to me, but never a game felt like these ones since. That is, you guessed it, until I tried CrossCode.\n\nYet, while capturing this nostalgia, CrossCode managed to shine in ways I never expected.\n\nThe combat. \nThis isn't really a surprise, but the controls are tight and fighting in CrossCode is a real blast. Enemies can and will overwhelm you if you aren't careful. The skill tree isn't complete yet, but I can only see more awesomeness ahead.\n\nThe level design. \nNow I'm no expert, but it's always a pleasure to study the layout of each room to reach heights and find chests. The puzzles are - already in 0.8.1 - some of the best I've ever seen in this kind of game, and the platforming is top notch. \nI strongly advise to do all the quests in each areas as the later ones give access to interesting trials in previously unreachable rooms - I'm looking at you generator repair quest!\n\nThe setting and art. \nThe Phantasy Star series instantly came to mind when I first saw CrossCode's trailer. I love the setting and music of these games, and the influence became even more apparent while playing. The story takes place in a MMOG, so you can often see busy other players running about, or having conversations with friends about some aspects of the game. This made the world that much more believable.\n\nThe story. \nOnly part of it is available, but I'm really intrigued and can't wait to find out more. The feeling of leveling with a good buddy is the last thing I expected from this game, and it nailed it. Bravo.\n\nOverall, considering early access, I am very optimistic.

I think I'll easily get 50 extremely enjoyable hours out of this, so that's my \u00a315 well spent.\n\nThe combat is perfect: really fun, very immersive and super smooth. The enemies are extremely diverse and always create new challenges in each section of the game. The boss fights are epic and look absolutely beautiful for a pixel-style game like this one. The story is adorable and highly addictive (at least from where I've reached) and the characters are equally as interesting and diverse. The plot and setting is fantastic.\n\nWelcome to Dark Souls meets Fable meets Helen's Mysterious Castle, in the future!\nVery possibly the best game I've played this decade.\n\n\n[u]PS.[/u] If you're not convinced by the 99% overwhelming positivity, [b]PLAY THE DEMO[/b].

The story is neat if you're into .hack/sign-esque story with the whole trapped in a virutal world sort of thing. But it doesn't really show all of its cards until you reach the first dungeon of the game. There it will toss so many puzzles and neat mechanics it's like they were placing bread crumbs and then threw the entire loaf at you.\n\nA game like this is good because of it's puzzles. I like the puzzles. They make you think. I like thinking. Once you get to the first dungeon, you begin to appreciate the time and effort these fellows put into designing this game. All of the puzzles are well designed, save a few which you can cheese  a bit.\n\nThe characters are endearing. I like Lea in particular. Though she lacks dialogue more or less, she makes up for it in her animations during dialogue sequences. The art team put a lot of work into conveying how Lea feels with only using one word. Since her vocabulary is so limited, it makes for some truly hilarious moments.\n\nAside from that, Emile is a neat contrast to Lea. I like to think of her as the driving force for the story. Without her, it feels like Lea would just not do things. She also has an animation that makes me think of that Futurama meme with Fry.\n\nNow for gameplay. It's pretty slick. You can go from melee to ranged quite easily. I prefer mouse and keyboard since it makes aiming your projectiles a lot easier. You get a lot of customization for how you want to play. Eventually the skill tree expands and once you get elements the combat really opens up because you get something like an empowered mode when you pick an element. Picking a specific element boosts a lot of your stats during combat, but you can't keep it up all the time so there's a sort of balance there. Eventually, though skill unlocks, you can prolong the element a lot longer.\n\nNow to the story. It is interesting since I like virtual reality games a la .hack/sign, but I'm not fond of the story structure. It's fine for some people for sure, but it's one of those stories where they don't tell you anything until the end. Everything leading up to that point is mostly fragmented memories. They even use the dreaded amensia thing, so yeah, not that great. Nevertheless, the pacing is good enough and they play a bit with exposition. It's not flung in your face. Everything can be found in the encyclopedia.\n\nSo I would recommend this game if you're interested in a pixel art action type of thing. Though the game has a demo, the game doesn't get interesting until the first dungeon where you have to think about manipulating your projectiles to solve puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1475991377, "timestamp_updated": 1476139232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25937419": {"recommendationid": "25937419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063983352", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489538908}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game.

I really really love this game for a long time now and I feel it can use the support and deserves it.\n\nFirst the game slipped past my radar, and I love action RPG's a lot. And this game? It really gave me that excited kid out of me again when I first played the on-website-demo. Right away the controls felt super smooth and super accurate. The story didn't have much back then and the game was split in half with a tiny but of story (tutorial) content and an exploration mode. Which was kind of an open world idea at the time I guess? Later on after I purchased the Steam version which had a few more updates they were tying those together nicely. It wasn't as open world as I expected but it's still very nice.\n\nThe game kind of let's you focus on 2 classes or playstyles. Maybe 3 if you chose for a hybrid such as myself. You can either chose to go all melee based or if you try to play it safe you can play range based. This through your equips which stats mostly either go towards a melee build or a ranged build. Besides that you get point to spend on a Final Fantasy X sphere grid like skill and stat boost system.\n\nNow let me add something on the developers. In one word they're awesome. Let me explain what I mean... As most people following the Indie market know we've had a few terrible examples recent year. One of them that stood out for me was Mighty No.9 and their completely lack of transparency and contact with their backers. RadicalFishGames is like the total opposite. They are active about anywhere. Twitter, Reddit, as well they have their own forum. And on all of them they are very active and very friendly/open towards their backers. Bug reports, while sometimes made fun of, are taken seriously and fixed in the next update. Besides that I think every 1 or 2 weeks they also have a dev stream on Twitch. During those streams you can actually see them work on developping the game while they can answer questions directly to people asking in the chat.\n\nSpeaking of updates the game kind of has a linear development. Each several months there's a new early access update all backers get. Mostly there's a littlebit more story progression, and play/world wise you can progress a bit further. Among the lines of the story goes up to a dungeon/city/specific location but you can still play further. It just won't have any story etc. yet. Also each update you mostly get a few new skills and gears to play around with.\n\nFor now I think my rewiew is long enough and I really hope it will draw some people over the edge on trying this game. If anything try the demo at first! You won't regret it if you like these kind of games!\n\n(P.S. I may edit the review here and there later in case things change in future updates.

I CANNOT wait until the full release. It basically takes an MMORPG and takes out all the bits I don't like (how it's basically aimless apart from leveling up). If you take up all the quests there is minimal grinding and once you upgrade your items in the next town and do some side quests (some of them which have a story while some are basically just collect x amount of y), you won't believe how easy you beat the enemies you were dying over and over to just a few levels ago, making it much easier to progress or collect items you will need for trading, quests and selling. The controls are incredibly tight and satisfying, the zelda-like jump is flawless and if you fall it's basically your fault. \n\nThe only thing frustrating about the game is that in one part of the game the platforms are sometimes too small and they are also \"icy\" (so slippery but sometimes also with ice growing out of them that you need to destroy...but it regrows very fast) so you basically jump onto them and slip right down into the abyss very easily, but I guess that's just platforming! The point is sometimes it's hard to get to where you want to go because of this, you need to be incredibly precise and quick. These places are also randomly placed, like basically you want to go through a door but in order to be able to do that you need to get on three little slidy platforms with ice growing out of them, you need to destroy each piece of ice after you jump on the prior platform and then destory the next, do a perfect jump and not slide off, and repeat this a few times and it's not even part of a puzzle. \n\nOh and there's a lot of puzzles....a lot of classic ice sliding puzzles too...which sort of got boring after the 3rd one even though they do mix it up with additional features.\n\nPros: \n-Amazing soundtrack\n-Quest system\n-Feels like a real MMORPG\n-Guilds! (I'm not sure if you will be able to select one other than the one selected for you)\n-Trading\n-Items give different stats, and sometimes may decrease one thing while increasing another compared to your equipped item, so choices to be had \n-Skill tree!\n-Real time combat with special moves!\n-Precise dodging/blocking (which is a lot of fun)\n-So far great and interesting story (it's not done yet, I've read about 30-40 percent of the story is finished by now)\n-Tight controls\n-Minimal backtracking (mostly for quests, not frustrating as there is a teleport system)\n-Very nice pixel art \n-And seemingly hours and hours of fantastic gameplay! \n\nCons:\n-Too many slidy puzzles\n-Random annoyingly hard platforming which doesn't add anything to the game but frustration\n-No multiplayer planned (which isn't a big con for me but might be for some)\n-Game pauses when you open the menu to select an item but not while you consume the item to heal etc., you most likely end up taking more damage than you healed if enemy isn't focusing other party member as you are stationary while you use the item (for about a second or two), or if you didn't manage to go very far away from the enemy (most of them have a way of quickly getting back to you even if you run across the screen from them)\n\nFor the rest, play the game and see how you feel\n\nI'm very picky when it comes to games and I have to say, I sit down and find myself being 7 hours into Cross Code without knowing where the time has gone, just like Emilie. \n\nFor an early access, I'm incredibly hyped, 10/10, will check every day to see if new update was released.", "timestamp_created": 1474060604, "timestamp_updated": 1474107783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582439", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25511858": {"recommendationid": "25511858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153366921", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501278303}, "language": "french", "review": "le gameplay est excellent, les musiques sont superbes, les donjons sont funs, l'histoire est originale et les personnages sont plutot marrant.\n\nen bref, toutes les heures que j'ai pass\u00e9 dessus n'\u00e9tait que pur plaisir et j'attends impatiamment la prochaine mise \u00e0 jour", "timestamp_created": 1473949286, "timestamp_updated": 1473949286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25507545": {"recommendationid": "25507545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063080179", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496822275}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great, it feels good, has some tigh yet loose controls per situation and can be very complex.

time to master using both analog sticks to move, aim, attack and dodge. they also have 4 basic classes which can be built to your likeing or just make a balanced character utilizing all 4 areas. aside from the battle areas there is also the puzzel aspect to the game which definately makes you think. totally looking forward to seeing more as well as watching the game grow.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOk so several days into cross code and still loving it. finding out the devs have a good sense of humor found in names of npc and enemies. as well as jokes from several console games ive found so far. this part is for the devs---two things 1) not sure if i missed it someplace or not but i do not seem to see a compass anywhere. i do beleive that would greatly help. either in map or HUD or both. 2) the questing system is great. not sure if its level based or area based but either way its great. would be a great help if maby on the quests where you know where to find the npc you need to speak to, you can have a marker on the map. or instead of a marker put maby an arrow by the marked quest in the HUD. i have gotten lost several times looking for some npc. sometimes it would take 30 min untill i got used to the layout of the city. last thing. as far as area map goes, like the setup, but maby have the player marker (the little blue haired head) be more assocciated with where your player actually is in the area instead of staying in the center. once again i got lost a couple times but ive just learned to leave the area and check the map after returning to get on the right path. i know its alot to read but every little bit helps. so far no bugs that ive found. i will let you guys know if i do find any though because no gamer likes bugs. keep it up guys your makin a great game here.", "timestamp_created": 1473550834,

I first saw the game demo on newgrounds and after the first update to make the demo different from the early acces I bought the game because I was impressed by the smooth combat, great enemy disign and a VERY high potential. I have never regretted buying this. The combat is still fluid and the new enemys that were added need a different aproach to effectively defeat and the inclusion of elements and party members add a bit more depth to combat.The game also looks gorgeous, the soundtrack is beautiful, dungeons and areas are disigned almost perfectly with dungeons being tricky and challenging and the outside areas are open and have enough to explore and discover. However, I feel like farjo desert is way to restricted unless you first find another rout to open another rout with many being the same rout with you just making shortcuts to get back on that rout even though I like what you have to do it still feels linear at first and the way routs are baricaded is wih just a blue wall wich feels realy uninspired in a desert were it's used a lot. I also feel like some dungeon rooms spawn way to many enemys at the same time like the room with a lot of times or the room with way to much crabs. besides those points I love everything else, the devs keep us inforemed and are showing that they are consstantly working on the game  and the are showing a lot of promising content.", "timestamp_created": 1472037782, "timestamp_updated": 1472038190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25097829": {"recommendationid": "25097829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188322847", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498940727}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de los mejores juegos que he comprado, la verdad es que la est\u00e9tica retro/arcade que ofrece y el beat'em up y los elementos rpg hacen que me guste mas incluso.

In jeder Hinsicht macht das Spiel unheimlich viel Spa\u00df. Es hat einen sehr angenehmen \"Flow\". Man wird von Anfang an sehr gut mit der Spielmechanik vertraut gemacht. Das gelingt in Kombination mit der anf\u00e4nglichen Geschichte hervorragend. Ich m\u00f6chte an dieser Stelle nat\u00fcrlich nicht spoilern, aber eins vorab: das K\u00f6nnen, die F\u00e4higkeiten, die \"Spielregeln\" werden eng mit der Story verbunden erkl\u00e4rt. Selten hatte ich so einen willkommen, wohlf\u00fchlenden und interessanten Einstieg erlebt.\nDie Dialoge sind klasse. Ohne Sprachausgabe, aber angesichts der vielen Dialoge ist das meiner Meinung nach besser als mit Sprachausgabe. Leider sind die Texte ab ca. einer Stunde Spielzeit nach und nach nur noch in Englisch (aber das ist ja auch die Early-Access-Version) - in der finalen Fassung nat\u00fcrlich nicht mehr.. Es wird viiieeel geredet (aber keinen langeweiligen Kram). Fans von Zelda und/oder Final Fantasy werden sich erfreuen. Sehr vieles wirkt vertraut von \u00e4lteren Retro-Spielen, was aber nicht hei\u00dfen soll, dass das schlecht ist. Das Spiel ist auf seine Weise trotzdem sehr eigen - und das ist auch gut so!\nDer Wechsel von Action zu Erkundung l\u00e4uft flie\u00dfend. Die K\u00e4mpfe sind teilweise sehr herrausfordern und es wird in dem Spiel stellen geben die f\u00fcr absolute Freaks geschaffen sind. Es ist sch\u00f6n wenn man eine Quest schafft und hinterher noch einen drauf gesetzt bekommt die gleiche Quest ohne Schild und mit einem Zeitlimit zu absolvieren - mir fiel die Kinnlade runter, da ich die Quest an sich schon sehr happig fand -> Klasse, solche Momente! Davon gibt es sicherlich noch reichlich.\nWas die K\u00e4mfpe angeht: sie machen uuuunheimlich viel Spa\u00df! Da kommt wieder dieser \"Flow\" ins Spiel, den ich erw\u00e4hnt hatte. Die Steuerung ist derart simpel, dass damit wirklich niemand irgendwelche Probleme haben sollte. Ich habe noch nie oder nur sehr selten so eine gute, einfache (aber dennoch komplexe) und fl\u00fcssige Steuerung in einem Spiel gesehen bzw. erlebt. Super!\nDie Grafik ist ebenfalls ein Augenschmaus - ja, ich meine das ernst! Wir reden hier schlie\u00dflich von einem 2D-Action-RPG... Die Farben sind super, die vielen Details sind klasse, die Charaktere und \u00fcberhaupt das Art-Design ist ein gelungener Mix aus Fantasy und Science Fiction. Toll!\nUnd zu all dem dann noch richtig coole Retro-Mukke im Hintergrund.

Doesn't matter, CrossCode got you covered~ Or you like challenging puzzle-(plattformer-)games, but are seeking a new perspective on things? This might be the game you're looking for! (...Get it? Because it has a tricky top-down camera~) If you need a story-driven game, love sci-fi themes or just like or even hate anime tropes: CrossCodes world and characters keep you involved, or you can choose to just ignore them and let the gameplay do all the talking!\n\nIt's actually hard to think of a reason why you wouldn't give CrossCode a try and you definitely should, since there's even a free demo right under your nose! The only negative point that comes to mind is that you will have to go through a pretty linear, lengthy and text-heavy introduction/tutorial area of the game (which is unfortunately also the entire content of the demo afaik) until the world finally starts to open up for you and lets the player roam more freely if that is what you mostly care about. Other than that it comes down to what kind of player you are, since there's a chance you will either find the puzzles or fights a tad too demanding, but in that case you shouldn't feel bad about making use of internet resources to find some solutions or enemy weak points to get to the next chunk of your preferred content more quickly and less frustrated (you know, kinda like Dark Souls :^)) \u2026at least until the devs decide to implement an ingame hint-system and adjustable difficulty settings~ (For now just be ensured that all fights are winnable even far below the recommended level and make sure to take all the sidequests to fasten up the leveling process in the background, before you complain about \"The Grind\")\n\nOnly thing left to say is that there are probably many people like myself, who have similar games from their childhood that they hold above all other (be it Secret of Mana, Terranigma or A Link to the Past, which are all without a doubt great timeless classics), but for me that nostalgic spot in my heart now belongs to CrossCode, even while it's still in early access~", "timestamp_created": 1471205525, "timestamp_updated": 1471205870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24912275": {"recommendationid": "24912275", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970632983", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509726181}, "language": "german", "review": "Geiles Spiel! 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1471184513, "timestamp_updated": 1471184513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24895246": {"recommendationid": "24895246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089932778", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 77, "last_played": 1514048942}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1] CrossCode [/h1] - \u0448\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u043f\u0433-\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0430, \u0441 16-\u0431\u0438\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0439.\n \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0432 early access, \u043d\u043e \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c, \u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e! \u0416\u0434\u0443 \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0433\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430!\n\u0416\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 (\u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430), \u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0451-\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e.\n\u0417\u0430\u0442\u044f\u043d\u0443\u043b\u043e.\n\u0420\u0415\u041a\u041e\u041c\u0415\u041d\u0414\u0423\u042e\n10 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1471121461, "timestamp_updated": 1471121461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24881060": {"recommendationid": "24881060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040436485", "num_games_owned": 742, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471288336}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game!

The fighting is comprable to Ys: Origins in style and speed, though I would say CrossCode is a little faster and defniitely more in depth and challenging.  I suck with controller but I really like how they set up the mouse and keyboard (cursor close to sprite= melee, cursor far from sprite= ranged in that direction).  The extensiveness of the skill tree is impressive as well and I really like the concept of being able to \"switch\" your skill branches on the fly. \n\nAnother really positive thing is the trading system.  You have to grind a bit to get trade items to trade in for higher weapons and armor, as opposed to just buying things.  I thought this was a great system and gets the player more involved in hunting for specific loot.\n\nThe storyline itself is phenomenal.  I hate spoilers so I will just say that it has almost a Sword Art Online feel to the story and the way they incorporate little references is a lot of fun.  \n\nSometimes in really intense battles you can get a little laggy (I have 16GB RAM, AMD Phenom II 3.2ghz X6 processor, and GTX 970 with 4GB VRAM with the game installed on a Solid State Drive so I don't think it is my build).  I haven't tried playing in any mode other than fullscreen at 1080p resolution though on a 56\" Flat panel TV, so it may just be other variables.  \n\nSpeaking of, the artwork in this game is AMAZING!  The pixel art never looks choppy or lazy and the way they did the terrain makes it easy to tell where you are jumping to and from height-wise and directionally.  \n\nThe puzzles in the game are challenging but not overwhelming.  I would say they are similar to the puzzles you would find in Lufia II.  \n\nDefinitely check it out though, the game is on my top favorites list.

Auf jeden fall Daumen hoch f\u00fcr das Game und hoffe das es zu einer Finalen Version kommt!!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqQk_9LvcPU&index=1&list=PLo8PpX3KCscXbkIdZAmvho_naT78LTEwE", "timestamp_created": 1470603583, "timestamp_updated": 1471464075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24760260": {"recommendationid": "24760260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103987279", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 110, "last_played": 1514406012}, "language": "koreana", "review": "[nods]", "timestamp_created": 1470578712, "timestamp_updated": 1470578712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24755384": {"recommendationid": "24755384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203353442", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500960995}, "language": "english", "review": "Cross Code is the simulation of a MMORPG which gives that funny vibe of playing an online game actually offline.\n\nCombat is a fun mix of evasion, melee and ranged tactics, Learning skills to suit your play stile anyway you wish.\n\n90% of the early access titles I see leave me always very skeptical as to whether to buy or not buy them, I'm happy that Cross Code is on the super tiny 10% that actually delivers content and more than satisfactory experience for an early access game.\n\nYou have tons of quests to go through, funny dialog, puzzles, parkour, plenty of areas that actually make you to explore the world and much more!\n\nPeriodically gets updated and bugs get fixed as soon as possible, unlike most early access games I see which is already a positive sign in my book.\n\nThere is plenty of content in the game in it's current state so I can totally recommend buying it when you are able to.", "timestamp_created": 1470555676, "timestamp_updated": 1470555676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24753205": {"recommendationid": "24753205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024663424", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495850838}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing!

The dungeons are filled with both challenging monsters and puzzles and progress smoothly, gradually teaching new mechanics without babying you the whole way through. But puzzles are not limited to just the dungeons; the fields are also filled with platforming puzzles that reward the player with loot bearing crates and new areas to explore. The battles are dynamic and somewhat faster paced, but not too fast as to make them overly difficult. And as you explore the skill tree, options for combat are diverse, but not overly complex.\n\nThere's also a load of wonderful humor and charm throughout the game, from dialogues and character backstories to hidden references to other games and media.\n\nHowever, don't just take my word for it\u2026 Try out the demo for yourself!", "timestamp_created": 1470365327, "timestamp_updated": 1480046262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24717239": {"recommendationid": "24717239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075019260", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494382786}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing piece of video game art. \n\nThe tutorials are a little long at first but it ends up fun as hell to play.

Even though this title is still in early access it's got a lot to offer already. It has that nice retro feel that offers the right amount of nostalgia without over doing it. The story/idea of the game so far is pretty interesting. Haven't played a lot of it yet but once you play it you get addicted to it. You just want more and more from Cross Code. I've had my eye on this game for a while now and decided to purchase it. Best decision ever if you ask me. If you're into science fiction, and virtual realities with a nice classic jrpg feel to it (gameplay kind of reminds me of chrono trigger a little bit? not sure why) where you control an avatar completing quest after quest all then I highly recommend you pick \nthis title up!

The story in this game is very interesting so far. It is in early access so while not finished, what story is there really drew me into the game.\n\n2. It has very tight controls. I played with mouse and keyboard so I can't give a review to how it plays with a gamepad. Any time I missed a jump or stepped off a ledge it was always because I messed something up not because of the controls.\n\n3. Very good graphics for this type of game. The graphics remind me of old school SNES games which is one of my favorite times in gaming history. \n\nAll in all, this game is a must for me, even unfinished.

It has made some amazing and vast improvements to the game which include from creating an adventure mode which brings the whole game aside from the previously linear storyline which also hold many sidequests for you to spend hours of your time having fun with, new and awesomely animated abilities that bring exitement to the allready engaging combat system, and more additions to the world map in adventure mode which get updated (I would say every 3 - 4 months maybe) that bring a singleplayer game (so far..) into a simulated npc multiplayer world that acts like they are part of the game from thier own view.\n\nYou can still play the web demo of crosscode (which also will not be blocked in most schools) on crosscode's website if you for some reason, prefer to save download space. \n\nI would pay \u00a320 for this game for what it is worth. It truly is an amazing rpg (which in game calls itself an mmorpg but it isn't, yet...) You won't regret your purchase if you like the look of the game, there is so much more of this game than what first meets the eye. \n\nHowever, the story is not yet complete. This is not the game developers' fault because the game is getting updated as frequently as possible. Whenever I see an update is released for this game, I hop on to this game and play through the story to see what they have added, because they don't dissapoint.\n\nIf only I could play the previous versions of the game however, because I got to level 25 in patch 1.1 and because in that patch you were able to access fire and ice powers, it made the character seem unbeatable. However you can now get those same powers in an actual story mode so you can't recieve those same powers straight away. \n\nI kept on postponing the writing of this review because I had so much to say about it, you believe me when I say this is worth a buy from almost anyone who likes this genre.", "timestamp_created": 1469481695, "timestamp_updated": 1480087385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24520031": {"recommendationid": "24520031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171724306", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505055533}, "language": "english", "review": "Not likely to change anyone's decision, but I'll mention this is my first review. I did not expect what I found at all. This game is too well done to let it fail; so I will do what I can to promote it.\n\nThis review was written as of  build 0.7.1. Game/story only goes up to, not including, the second dungeon.\n\nTL:DR\n\nPros:\n- Well drawn/animated\n- Challenging combat and puzzle sections.\n- Relatable realistic character interation.\n\nCons:\n- At build 0.7.1, there isn't a whole lot of story yet. It took up 12 hours at this point with minimal side-questing, so I won't say it's short, just incomplete.\n- A bit grind heavy when getting items to trade with. There are some traders that trade for the basics, but it still requires some other items to get them. More common items, but still. Keep in mind you don't have to trade. You can find equipment in the wild if you search the areas at more than a simple glance.\n\nFull Opinion:\n\nDownloaded the demo first to have a look. It seemed like a decent retro-style action/adventure that might be fun for a few hours. I was utterly blown away by what I found. The tutorial is a short 10 minutes or so explanation to just give the most basic parts. The combat is fairly simple, but the abilities you learn are well done and fun to use. The enemies are implemented in a way that you will have a hard time if you just run around hitting the attack button. Personally I always feel most games are a little too easy these days, so that's a plus to me. The puzzles are varied, sufficiently chanllenging, and introduce new ideas without burying you in tutorial. The new ideas are added without warning or explanation. You'll just walk into a room, see a switch or button you need, and ask yourself \"How do I get that? Maybe I should try this new object over here? But how does it work? Hit it? Shoot it? Fire? Slide on the ice?\" As for the story, there hasn't been much developement at this point. There are two main plots. The plot for the MMO is a generic \"gather the elements\" type of quest, but they have handled it well so far (more or less paying homage to how MMO's often are and how players would act toward them) and have spoken of a far deeper narrative beneath it. The plot outside of the MMO (How the herione got there and why) hasn't moved much just yet. Personally, I find the character interaction to be a shining example of how to flesh out character traits without over-playing it. You don't need slapstick gags or some running joke to make them memorable. Between that and the well drawn character portraits for these sections, the story segments are honestly a joy.", "timestamp_created": 1469460370, "timestamp_updated": 1469460370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24507980": {"recommendationid": "24507980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020283185", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469398043}, "language": "english", "review": "Great graphics, but the controls leave something to be desired and the amount of grinding required takes any of the fun away.", "timestamp_created": 1469398149, "timestamp_updated": 1469398149, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.256261", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24480580": {"recommendationid": "24480580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049156087", "num_games_owned": 1223, "num_reviews": 168, "playtime_forever": 1275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475400573}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u65e9\u671f\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9Ver0.71(2016/07/23)\u6642\u70b9\nSFC\u98a8\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3RPG\n\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u306e\u5929\u5730\u5275\u9020\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u64cd\u4f5c\u611f\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\n\u3069\u3046\u3084\u3089\u8a18\u61b6\u55aa\u5931\u306e\u6cbb\u7642\u3067\u4f53\u611f\u578b\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3089\u3057\u3044\n\u30aa\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u304a\u99b4\u67d3\u307f\u306e\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u53d7\u6ce8\u5236\u3067\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc\u3084\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u3082\u3042\u308b\n\u305d\u3053\u3089\u8fba\u3092\u8d70\u308a\u56de\u308b\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u3082\u3044\u3066MMORPG\u7279\u6709\u306e\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17\u304c\u826f\u304f\u51fa\u6765\u3066\u3044\u308b\n\u5e8f\u76e4\u306e\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u7684\u306a\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u5c11\u3057\u9577\u3044\u304c\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u306b\u51fa\u308b\u3068\u9014\u7aef\u306b\u9762\u767d\u304f\u306a\u308b\n\u4eca\u306e\u3068\u3053\u308d3\u3064\u76ee\u306e\u8857\u307e\u3067\u3057\u304b\u7121\u3044\u304c\u300120\u6642\u9593\u8fd1\u304f\u697d\u3057\u3081\u305f\u3002\n\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u91cf\u3082\u591a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u82f1\u8a9e\u304c\u8aad\u3081\u308b\u4eba\u306f\u76f8\u5f53\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3046\n\u8aad\u3081\u3093\u304b\u3089\u5168\u7136\u308f\u304b\u3089\u3093\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3051\u3069\n\u5b8c\u6210\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u307b\u3057\u3044\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d1\u30c3\u30c9\u5bfe\u5fdc", "timestamp_created": 1469284899, "timestamp_updated": 1469284899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24469944": {"recommendationid": "24469944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061651120", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470173009}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like JRPGs, you should give it a try.\nif you like MMORPGs, you should give it a try.\nif you like Sword Art Online, you should give it a try.\nif you do NOT like Sword Art Online, give it a try anyway.\n\nBest Retro-SNES-styled-game i've ever player since Chrono Trigger.\n15/10 <3\n\nPositives: Amazing OST.

Even it's in incomplete state, it's a masterpiece.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nGraphics 10/10 - CrossCode has a beautiful 16-bit art style. This really comes to shine in the gorgeous close-up portraits of the characters seen during dialogues. Not only that, the world is also amazingly beautiful with small details everywhere that really make you think the devs care deeply about the looks of their game. If I only cared about the visuals, then those alone would've made me buy the game.\n\nMusic 9/10 - Not a lot to say here, the music is just all around nice. And there's a lot of unique pieces heard in different areas of the game.\n\nCombat 10/10 - Combat in this game feels really fluid and every hit feels impactful. There are many ways to utilize your base kit - throwing balls, fighting melee, guarding, and dashing - and your talent trees and equipment offer a lot of customization. On top of that, there are 4 elemental attack modes.\n\nPuzzles 10/10 - Probably my favourite part of this game. The puzzle design in CrossCode is just genius. Never did the puzzles feel unfairly hard or frustrating, but they always offered a fair bit of challenge. Currently, there are 4 proper dungeons that combine puzzles and combat together. Some enemies are puzzles themselves - you need to figure out a way to beat them, just going in and fisting everybody is not the solution. Key parts of the puzzles are the ball throwing mechanic and different elemental interactions.\n\nStory 10/10 - The story is probably my second-favourite thing about CrossCode, although it's nowhere near complete and all the big twists are yet to happen. There's just something about it that makes me want more every time the new story segment ends. The colourful characters, the humorous dialogue; it's just all around very light-hearted and not too serious.\n\nAmount of content currently: I got about 14 hours playing the story from start to finish, completing most of the side quests and doing all 4 dungeons. I had, however, already played through the dungeons so I knew exactly how to do the puzzles, and didn't spend as much time as a first-time-player would've spent doing them. Currently, if you do all the content in the game, collecting the hidden treasures and completing all the side quests, I think you could get around 25 hours. This number is obviously going to change when more content gets added (the game is around 2/3 done I think) but already, it is easily worth 20 bucks. \n\nAlso: as you can see I have over 80 hours of playtime on CrossCode which just goes to show that the game is so good I'm willing to play it multiple times from the beginning even though it has pretty much no replayability value as of yet (that will change when they add the NG+ mode).", "timestamp_created": 1468944568, "timestamp_updated": 1486299867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617312", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24409266": {"recommendationid": "24409266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062888745", "num_games_owned": 1219, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509820889}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu est vraiment tres bon", "timestamp_created": 1468940347, "timestamp_updated": 1468940347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24408301": {"recommendationid": "24408301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139445766", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 282, "last_played": 1514732681}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]I Fall in Love on the First Sight[/h1] Since i play the first demo i can't stop playing this game for a day , love the stories and the setting , control is a bit hard , but when you master it no one can't stop you , Love the graphic too this is so beautiful, really Love all the background sound mostly on title screen , i beg a lot from you Radical fish .. i Rate this 9/10 since this hasn't been full released haha ..\nReally fun i recommend this for you who love pixel graphic with action rpg gameplay !!!\nI hpe there is multiplayer mode or maybe a new game where we made our avatar with any jobs ? it'd be wonderful\n\n*sorry for my bad grammar", "timestamp_created": 1468936431, "timestamp_updated": 1468936496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24402485": {"recommendationid": "24402485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033505525", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496932069}, "language": "english", "review": "So quite some time ago I made a review on this game, I did give it a good recommendation, but I'd like to revise my review of it now compared to before, seeing the updates to the game.

Note that this is still in EA, so it is NOT complete! If you want to play a demo, there is one available on the official website. \n\nI backed this game on Kickstarter with 60 Euros based entirely on the demo - it was THAT good. Now that an EA build has released, I'm quite happy to say that I'm enjoying where the game is headed. The systems in place are looking really polished for what is essentially a pre-alpha build, with less than a quarter of the intended content available (based on the fact that you unlock only one of the four elements available in the game in the current build, 0.7.1), and the gameplay is really smooth. Reminds me of Ys, though more exploration/RPG focused and less so pure-action as Ys games are, so maybe more LoZ. LoZ style game with Ys style combat might be a good way of describing it.\n\nPros:\n- Aesthetically pleasing. Usually I don't like the 8-bit or whatever style, but the pixel art in this game is gorgeous.\n- Great gameplay; actions feel responsive and tactile, rather than sluggish or delayed. \n- The story is intriguing so far.\n- Characters are great, smug faces are 11/10.\n- Puzzles are suitably difficult without mind-bendingly obscure, though some of the more precise puzzles can be a bit frustrating at times.\n- Exploration is rewarding.\n- Characters actually run around instead of walking, thank GOD. Speed feels fast enough to be fast, but slow enough to be precise.\n- I really enjoyed the universe of the game (\"MMORPG\" set on a real planet), though it might not sit with everyone. The 4th wall breaks aren't obnoxious and are well paced, IMO.\n- I also like the character level progression system in the game, though some people might find it restricting for a SP game. \n\nCons:\n- You may not like the number of (very precise) jumping puzzles there are in the game. There are a LOT. \n- The art style sometimes makes it hard to judge elevation between platforms, which is mildly annoying but not painfully so.\n- The rare-drop system feels mildly forced. I would rather 'rare' drops intead drop every X number of monsters, which allows the player to farm for guaranteed drops rather than needing to charge up the battle meter etc etc. I think currently the drop rate isn't bad, but finding that one rare drop for a quest is always a pain in the bum.\n- Quest system is MMO-like, which may turn you off. Talk to X, get me Y amount of Z, etc. I personally don't mind it as long as it's not annoying (get me FIVE HUNDRED RABBIT TAILS!). The quests encourage exploration, so for me this is a plus, but for a lot of other people they might find the sub-questing tiresome or annoying, considering the game is a SP game!\n\nIf a dev reads this, I also think they should implement a hotkey system where you can bind certain menus to other hotkeys on your keyboard. It's annoying to have to go through multiple menus to access details on side quests, rather than having a separate button for it to flip in and out to read quickly. \n\nOverall, I definitely recommend you at least check out the demo, and if you don't subscribe to EA, at least give CrossCode a follow. I'm looking forward to the completed project, and until the full game releases I'll probably try to stop thinking about it so I don't ruin it.", "timestamp_created": 1468161091, "timestamp_updated": 1468161091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24216580": {"recommendationid": "24216580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105241026", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "last_played": 1513650198}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fast paced, vibrant game that has piqued my interest.\nI know it's not finished but for what it is, there's just a lot to enjoy about it.\nThe story as of now, is enjoyable with a startling amount of character development from Lea who's basically mute.\nThe puzzles have you think, but are not the type of head-scratchers that would make you look up a walkthrough.\nThe controls are responsive and every mini-boss and boss is a joy to fight.\nThe side quests are a tad annoying if you have multiple quests in progress, but it's manageable.\n\nI am glad I bought this and hope to see the full product soon.", "timestamp_created": 1468098198, "timestamp_updated": 1468098198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24197306": {"recommendationid": "24197306", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994164775", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467996848}, "language": "english", "review": "Good plot with likable characters, the game takes place in a guturistic MMO and the plot, dialog, world design and gameplay really makes it feel like you are actualy playing a MMO.

recipes and ingredients)\nbut you'll eventually understand everything and can keep track of every trader in the trader book\nI hate rabbits now\n\nDo you kwnow that feeling when you acquire some games in a bundle and you treat them as \"collaterals\" because you just want one or two specific games? I'm very glad that CrossCode came to me this way\nAt start I thought it was the usual rpgmaker 2k jrpg on steam (2 the moon, I'm not talking about you, stop fussing), but that's not the case... the game engine is developed in html5, there are no turn based fights, but evrything is done real time, it's a really fast paced action rpg, but if you're looking for the usual button masher, this is not the right stuff for you: every fight, even against the most harmless looking one, will have to be planned beforehand.\n\nBut let's start talking about the plot: I have yet to reach a far point, but the story gets me in a good way; you impersonate a game avatar, Lea, who has lost her memory and she's searcing for it a game universe set on an island in the real world.\nThe only thing that so far I didn't like is the class of your character, which is bound by the plot for some reason (I have yet to discover it). Lea is a spheromancer, who is able to rapidly cast projectiles while rolling away to safety, or comboing with a quite strong melee attack, a shield and a large number of skills that you acquire by spending cp in your skill tree.\nThe skill tree is not that difficult you have to choose between some basic passive feats (increased damage, defense, elemental resistance...) and active skill, like a stong projectile that can hit multiple enemies, some dagame reduction buffs, melee attacks... you can quite personalize your fighting style.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the only way of personalization that I found in the game, you can't choose your class, you can form a party choosing between some online friends, but I still only have one, but you can't modify their skill tree or equipment, which is ok, because who can actually look into a friend skill tree or inventory in a MMORPG?\n\nAnd that's what I thing is one of the major point of CrossCode: the setting.\nIt really feels like I just start playing a MMORPG again... the game world has everything, it's really well done: the Hub, hunting grounds for beginners, mob respawn, people running around doing things (it's a very populated world) that behave like real players, you can guess which NPC is acting like a real NPC or as a \"real player\", some players setting shops in the wild and stuff, even the dialogs between other people. I really liked the MMO atmosphere.\n\nI still have to talk about the fitghint system: as said, CrossCode is a fast paced action RPG, you can basically play with a controller or with the mouse+keboard combo. I uses the second one, and I must say that it's really well done, the programming is awersome, I can say that because myself is in a love-hate relationship with html5...\nBasically you can do 2 types of attack: a ranged one and a melee combo of 5 hits. As ranged, you can spam an unlimited number of projectiles in a spread that reduces over aiming, or charge a shot that will bounce against walls 3 times and that will set your spread to minimum, while you can hit everything in front you in a not so small radius with the melee attack, stopping your enemies blocking them from attacking you. Everything is done with the left click (click far and you'll cast energy balls, click near your character and you'll perform a melee attack)\nWith the right click you'll perform dodges while moving and use your shield while standing still. The game is really focused on dodging , because your character is quite frail, but incredibly fast, but you still have to guess the timing correctly, or you can see a large fraction of your hp bar flying away with a single hit.\nwhile performing each of these action and pressing space, you'll perform a special attack (you have to buy and select them in the skill tree) Each skill consumes a sp point, which charges over time (you have a max of 4 sp points: 2 that are charged everythime, while 2 start to charge only in combat and will deplete over time after you finish), so no mp potions for you this time. \nThe combat system is really fun, enemies AI is really well done, there's a large number of enemies in different groups, and you'll have to think a different strategy to approach each different mob party, because they are very strong, hit very hard and will try to dodge and pursue you, some of them have shields on their body that will reduce the damage from the front. This makes grinding not so annoying, also because you'll get a \"drop rank\" that will deplete over time, which is important because it will increase the drop rate (which is very low, 12%-20% at D drop rank) and increase the rarity of drops. Everytime you stop fighting, you drop rank goes back to the lowest level, but this will permit you to regenerate your hp bar. Acquiring an A rank can be quite difficoult, but some drops are only acquired at that level.\n\nWhich reminds me of the shop system. You don't actually buy from shops, you instead craft your items by spending drops and money. This makes farming and drop rank essential in your explorations (you won't go past the noob area with the starting equipment). There's a lot of merchants around the map, each one will sell you a few number of items (which can be weapons, consumables or higher tier ingredients), a lot of items have a different recipe for each trader, but you can find everything in the trader book in the menu. So you can have fun going window shopping looking for the cheapest recipe for the same item.\n\nWhat to say anymore about CrossCode... It's a really fun, rewarding game, quite different from your usual 2D RPG, a really good experience, It says early access, but it doesn't feel that way (I discovered that was early access 5 hours after playing the game, and I was still in the noob area) \n\nIf you don't wanna spend the full price, wait for the sales, I personally found this game in a bundle, and I'm glad I did c:", "timestamp_created": 1467722474, "timestamp_updated": 1467747983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596278", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24072399": {"recommendationid": "24072399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023082088", "num_games_owned": 2068, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474084484}, "language": "english", "review": "TL:DR -> best game for the genre\n\nlonger:\nIve been mashing buttons on joysticks, keyboards, mice and gaming wheels for 30+ years.

This game knows its flaws and runs with them wildly into something that becomes charming and \"fantasique\".\n\nThe actual dialogue to this game for the most part is pretty stereotypical in that of RPG to the point that it feels as if it's all set to be a satire of the subject(s) being observed and I for one am enjoying that.\n\nRegardless of these matters, this world respects me and I respect it as I wander through this large world to explore and be mesmerized by it's visual bounty. Huge mountain tops and sky islands a plenty and the very NPC characters are as lost and befuddled as you are as you try to comprehend and understand what exactly you've delved into.\n\nI don't wish to spoil anything major, so I'll give you what at least the demo will tell you if you choose to download it.\n\nThe summarization of the plot as far as I know goes along the lines of this: You are a special character in this world, but your memories have become lost with an unexplained reasoning and those memories may hold the very answers to why a particular \"blue individual\" has appeared and you're left asking the questions: \"Who am I? Who was I just before this all started? Finally, just how much of an adventure am I in for?\".\n\nThe story aside, the next best thing has to be controls and combat.\nYou can play this game with Controller or Keyboard with absolute ease; you use both ranged and melee combat to carve your path in this world. This game also features a level tree system similar to that of Path of Exile where everything branches out in segments and sections- but this game takes it a step further with a feature not yet included in the game, which you learn about just a step after the demo, thus I will not spoil it for you. It also a fantastic fusion of barter and traditional economic systems in order to gear yourself out- Oh, I forgot to mention that you do get to equip your character out in a lot of different kinds of equipment to properly suit your style of play for your character. The trading system works super well in both complimenting its eastern inspired grind fest as it usually requires items from creatures or environmental drops in order to properly progress your character by your own accord and you'll definitely need to do so based on your own skill level with this game's enemies; which in my opinion have a really strong difficulty curve that you can ease into, but definitely will take a proper length amount of time to master.\n\nYou really get that feeling that you're playing a form of RPG as the game incorporates a lot of staple pseudo RPG systems that you find across anything that melds the two worlds into one, such as dot hack did with examples including the \"Direct Link system\" (aka the Member Address system in dot hack) for getting in contact with friends in certain times of the game (which at least implies there may be times where characters you meet up into with can be unavailable for helping you throughout the game's main story plot.) as well as being able to message them.\n\nOf course there's also with this patch that I'm writing this review on that they added what's called the \"Trader Book\", which allows you to keep track of any trader you've met in the game in a listed catalogue, then it even tells you about what items they trade you for AND what materials it takes to trade for their items respectively, very progressive of a system as well as a progression oriented design- Kudos to the developers on simple things like this.\n\nSo with the combat, story and controls explained; I guess I should delve into the graphical aesthetics opinion portion of this lengthy review.\n\nI truly think the graphics of the game look really nice, they're a great homage to a time of games that took finesse and diligence to craft properly and this team has it down to the a T. They understand in order to appreciate this art form that you need to make the entire view and scope of it all to be as filling and substantial as possible, but without it trying to make everything look TOO busy. The color palettes they use are nicely contrasting and bright to convey the form of world that they've created and their aesthetic is just appealing enough to where anyone can enjoy it- as if of that to watching cartoon characters on TV, considering how expressive they are.\n\nThe bosses and character animations are easily a technical design delight as they're very fluent and easy on the eyes.\nThe sprites are simple, yet elegant to behold for the first time every time as you don't quite know what you'll encounter as you progress onward. The few bosses I've encountered thus far as been pretty nice to look at- first example being the crab boss encounter on the cargo ship in the earliest part of the game. That crab boss set a really decent bar of what to expect in the graphics department as well as the animation as they deployed a lot of well practiced techniques in their contrasts, dithering and light source ability in unison with decently fluid animation to give it a proper sense of Life to what they constructed.\n\nTo keep things flowing and going, I do want to say one thing about level designs.\nThey do a pretty good job so far in puzzle work and level layouts- though I haven't explored enough of the game to realistically comment on how well they actually HAVE done since I've barely gone past Bergen (Post Demo Area).\n\n*EDIT*: After playing through to the posted end of the current content in 0.7.1, I will gladly say that the dungeon designs are rather decent thus far. The first dungeon experience I was given to quest through was a very satisfying and interesting bar to set for the difficulty of future dungeons. I found myself trying my best to find creative solutions throughout the layouts and puzzles given, meanwhile I was at least interested to look for all the treasure- yet It did not make me feel compelled to find ALL of it immediately, so I would be able to come back at a later time to search and scavenge. One thing that needs to be said is that the boss fights scale up in difficulty pretty well and feel rewarding for getting through the puzzles and then finally defeating the boss of the realm before you. They are definitely doing everything right with this so far and hopefully get to see how bright the future will be in this regard as patches and content installments continue to come.\n\nEasily so far- this game has a SOLID 9 to 9.5 out of 10 due to the game being incomplete, but what they've shown so far is easily worth commending admiration and attention to a great cause. This game is a near immaculate example of what an Early Access game should be and to strive for being.

You can aim and ricochet shots to hit attack openings. This feature also is used a lot in the game's puzzles.\n\nThe story kind of has a metagame within a game vibe going for it. Basically, you play a character that is playing a simulated MMO. But of course their very special within the game world their playing. The game even has simulated teams mates that banter, etc. Similar to the .Dot Hack and/or loosely Sword Art Online series of games.\n\nOverall the game has phenomenal 2D physics, inventive fast based melee combo combat with range puzzle elements. It also runs very smoothly on about any remotely current PC or laptop. It is really worth a try for anyone who likes the top down 2D RPG hack and slashes of the 90s.

It reminds me of Golden Sun, one of my favorite games of all time. The graphics are simple but smooth. The story is engaging, and I enjoy a lot of the humour in the game. The soundtrack is very good, although like many RPGs, entire areas have one soundtrack that just loops, and some are better than others for listening to for a couple hours on end, but it can't really be helped.\n\nThe combat is good- and a big part of that is how you get punished for dying. You effectively don't- you get reloaded to your last save, which is the autosave that happened when you walked into that room. I think that's important, because the game is very skill based when it comes to more difficult fights. If you don't know the mechanics of a boss or a new room/enemy, you can get punished hard and quickly. And that's good that the game can challenge you like this and be fast paced in its combat, because it fits the style of it.\n\nWhile it's difficult to judge, I think the puzzles overall are good. There are a lot of puzzles in the game- even just small ones like \"How do I get a floor higher in this area so I can get the chest?\", not just dungeon puzzles that encompass a whole room. It's difficult to judge because there were puzzles that I got stuck on when the solution, obviously, was right there on the screen. So I want to say the game has bad or frustrating or difficult to figure out puzzles, but at the same time, I have to weigh the fact that I'm an imperfect human. Of course there would be puzzles I would get stuck on! Some people found those puzzles easy, and other puzzles I figured out my first time stumped others. So I think overall it was mostly me not applying good problem solving techniques. The majority were enjoyable, or just challenging enough to where even if it took 5 minutes instead of 30 seconds like I might expect, it felt good to beat it, not frustrating to spend so much time on it.\n\nPro tip- always work backwards for puzzles.\nAlways.\n\nThe game is unique in a couple of ways. As of the most recent version, a lot of enemies in the game (I think all but two) are non-aggressive. So when you walk into an area with enemies, the health bars will be blue, and you can run right past them, or into them, and it doesn't matter. If you attack an enemy, you get it's \"group\" to attack you. In other words, an area's enemies are not all going to attack you if you attack one enemy. Enemies do respawn, but not instantly, and not when you leave and enter a new area. I believe it's time based. This is important for another way the game is unique- it's not just a combat driven or story driven RPG. Like mentioned when I wrote about the puzzles, the game has many, and many small ones outside of dungeons, for example. Not constantly getting attacked when switching between two areas trying to figure out a solution, or just having the enemies in the one area the puzzle is in respawn quickly and attack you is important to the game, because almost all areas in the game of some form of puzzle/parkour element to it. Again, it reminds me of Golden Sun.\n\nThe characters have a lot of character. They'll speak when they don't need to or it's not pertinent to the story, because in in the game world, they're regular human beings of course, not just cogs in the machine that is the protagonist's storyline. That's really cool. I feel like the writing is very good overall and mimics what a person might actually say relatively often. The story so far is good because of the characters. The story is interesting because of the characters. When you've watched hundreds of movies, play hundreds of games, or what have you, you realize that pretty much everything has been done when you generalize plots. What are most RPGs? Go find something that's long lost, go save a person you care about or a country or town or whatever, go stop the bad guy trying to awaken an evil power, etc. CrossCode is unique in that in CrossCode, you play a character who is playing a game called CrossWorlds, along with everyone else you meet, is in the CrossWorlds universe. That's new to me. What saves the parts of the story that is pretty generic- go grab the ancient thing no one has been able to before, is that the writing is good, the characters and expressions are good, the names for things and puzzles and actual gameplay is good. It makes the plot an acutal thing to enjoy and get invested in, instead of having it be this out of context, \"Oh, it's another game where you go grab the ancient power. That's new...\" story.\n\nWhile currently short in story, (2-3 hours for me on my first playthrough to get through it), it did take me a healthy 17ish hours to get through the gameplay that there is so far. And for that matter, that's without story adding time to it. I've played games for less than 17 hours and thought they were good, so even though it's not finished, I'd still recommend it, it's still a great game, and the Developers are pretty interactive with the community and update about every 2-3 months- but the updates are big, for example, the last update brought about 6-8 hours of gameplay into the game, because it was the entire second dungeon and the surrounding area. One last note- there are two dungeons currently in the game, and there will probably only be 4-5. There are 4 elements you need to obtain in the game, and right now both dungeons contained one, so the game might be about halfway over gameplay wise. Although I wouldn't imagine you would just get the 4th element in the 4th dungeon and have the game end very quickly after that (which is why I said 4-5 dungeons), the game would still be about 35 hours with only 2-3 hours of story and the gameplay finished if it DOES end pretty much right after the 4th dungeon. And for that matter, if the 3rd and 4th dungeons and areas of the are about as long as the first two. Given the story will be carried throughout the whole game, I expect the game to be about 50 hours, but that's a total guess. Either way, 35 hours is pretty much the minimum, which is definitely worth the $15.99 I paid for it, and would have gladly paid $20.00 for it too. Also, keep in mind that that would be if you played through it once. I've played through it twice for a different build as it is an RPG with a skill/talent tree!\n\nOkay, imagine the following scenario. A man you don't know at all (me) is sitting at his computer, playing CrossCode. Because it's $20.00 (though I got it for $15.99), and I've played it for 30 hours, that's about 66 cents an hour. When I played this game, I played it for about 5 hours straight through dinner and didn't even realize- that's how engulfed I was in the game. If I never played this game again, then I would have paid that 66 cents/hour for the game relative to how much entertainment time I got out of it. So imagine now that a man who isn't even aware he's played CrossCode for an hour is approached by another person. This person comes to the man at his computer and says, \"You owe me 66 cents for the last hour you played.\"\n\nWhile I would have been surprised a random person in my house was asking for 66 cents for the game I just played...\n\nI would have undoubtedly payed it. I would have absolutely payed it to keep playing CrossCode.\n\nThis game is amazing and you should get it.", "timestamp_created": 1465405164, "timestamp_updated": 1465405213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23446912": {"recommendationid": "23446912", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984327304", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482595078}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game because it seemed to have a vaguely \"PSO\" feel despite being a top down action RPG.\n\nThe most important detail of this game is that no matter what you are doing in it, you don't feel bored and even legwork doesn't feel like \"a chore\".

The developers have truly created something that is a great addition to the RPG genre, it is incredibly unique and refreshing.

I am so very excited to see what direction they take from here, and look forward to any future titles done by Radical Fish.\n\nGrade:\n\nAudio           -            9.5/10\nGraphics      -             10/10\nGameplay/Physics -  10/10 (indeed\" buttery smooth\" as described!)\nMechanics/RPG     -  9.5/10\nControls         -          10/10\nCompletion  -            10/10  (one of the most complete early access titles ever, aside from the storyline)\n", "timestamp_created": 1464197820, "timestamp_updated": 1464197820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23181468": {"recommendationid": "23181468", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973800101", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462881802}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer Snes Spiele geno\u00dfen hat wie Zelda, Secret of Mana wird hier bestimmt nicht entt\u00e4uscht.\n\nTeste es seit der ersten Demo und ich kann sagen da sitzen Leute dran die auf jedes Detail achten und\nsehr viel Liebe drin steckt.\nDas Spiel ist herausfordernd aber auch nicht zu schwer.\n\nGrafisch Top (Snes 16bit Stil)\nSound Top\nGameplay Top\n", "timestamp_created": 1464093785, "timestamp_updated": 1464093785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23175071": {"recommendationid": "23175071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162201110", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 188, "playtime_forever": 1280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463030724}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc18c\ub4dc\uc544\ud2b8\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub3c4\ud2b8\ubc84\uc804.\n\n\ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc560\ub9e4\ud558\ub2e4...\uc601\uc5b4\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0.\n\n\uc7a5\uc810 : \ud6cc\ub96d\ud55c \uc870\uc791\uac10, \ub808\ubca8\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud2b9\uc131 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\n          \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\uac00 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud574\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc74c.\n\n\ub2e8\uc810 : \ud37c\uc990\uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uae4c\ub2e4\ub86d\uace0 \uae38\ucc3e\uae30\uac00 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0.", "timestamp_created": 1464056334, "timestamp_updated": 1464056334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491972", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23103182": {"recommendationid": "23103182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175086365", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "last_played": 1514477156}, "language": "german", "review": "Also:\n\nDas Spiel ist [i]gro\u00dfartig[/i] und [i]nur zu empfehlen[/i].\n\n[b]Was ist denn so toll daran?[/b]\nSch\u00f6n, dass du fragst!

Stand true to the demo and kept its own promises and features. It's somewhat sad that the story arc is still somewhat short, but as the game is now, which I presume is still not that far completed, It already rack at least some 10+hours of gameplay doing the various quests and solving puzzles. The most different feature about this game is the fluid combat. Which remember the portable versions of The Legend Of Zelda, such as Minish Cap, but overall way better and with more skill-oriented combat features. Sure, level and equipments make a lot of difference, so it's not \"pure strategy and skill\" but still, timing and precision play a major role in being sucessfull or not. Grinding the mobs is also quite fun with the rank system. \n\nI'm eagerly awaiting for the full release!", "timestamp_created": 1463533867, "timestamp_updated": 1463533867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23045696": {"recommendationid": "23045696", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972351208", "num_games_owned": 618, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 3827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513290540}, "language": "english", "review": "Crosscode is a game that I decided not to back initially, because I thought the project had unrealistic goals.  Upon revisiting it in the demo and pre-purchasing, I think I can safely say that I was not only wrong, but that is the only project I even remotely regret not backing.  This is what I think an indie game should aspire to be: a passion project that has standout and unexpected production quality.\n\nDescribing Cross Code is difficult, because almost no one has played any of the games it most resembles.  Alundra, Terranigma, Secret of Mana, Shining Soul, Robotron, Gunman Clive... probably the closest well-known parallel is Zelda, and this ain't no Zelda.  In short, it's a top-down fast-paced action game with SNES era style graphics, \"phantasy star\" sort of character design, large puzzle sections and some quality of life improvements from modern games.  I'd say the closest new game in function is Hyper Light Drifter (which is quite similar), although the two games greatly differ in tone with Crosscode being much much lighter and transparent about its premise, but much less stylish and ambitious in that regard.\n\nI don't want to just gush about this, so here's what's bad:  Flavor-wise the story and setting are busy and inane: People are playing an MMO as hard-light beings on a real-life alien planet, and you're injected into things as an outsider with likely special capabilities as well as amnesia and limited speech capabilities.  Some people are obstensibly people in the cities, so it's impossible to figure out what are questgiving ai characters and inhabitants of the cities which is fairly irresponsible given the MMO players are basically operating killing machines.  It's dumb, but it lets the game be a game and do whatever it really wants to.  In line with this, some of the characters are kind of annoying as well, in particular anyone who can't help but mix in words from other languages in nearly every single line of dialogue.\n\nIn addition, puzzle-and-action hybrids often have a lot of issues regarding their audience.  Although I for one love the mix, you force action lovers to do puzzles in order to play more of what they like and vice versa, and the game is linear.  In particular, the dungeons are very very puzzle heavy almost to the point of exhaustion, and the rest of the game is somewhat light on them (although the mix is worked in much better as of the latest overworld area).\n\nSomewhere between bad and good is the music.  Most of the tracks are forgettable and a few are very unappealing short-loop midi-quality stuff.  On the other hand, the newest town theme and especially the boss theme are fantastic.  When you fight a tough opponent you will find no fault in the music for getting you psyched, and that's really what I'm looking for in this type of game.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, let's get into the good stuff.  The bosses themselves are pure pixel porn and must have been ages to animate given their size, and they are a joy to fight with their gimmicks and weaknesses- and ability to sometimes cover up their weakness or turn your exploitation of it back at you.  In particular, the duel against a foe of similar abilities is a blast because his AI is shockingly adept for this kind of game.  In addition, certain special encounters against regular enemies are made much more interesting with strange arenas or mixes of opponents.  Healing is tricky due to a delay but very helpful in some particularly deadly fights.  It's obvious that in most cases, these guys know encounter design inside and out.\n\nPart of what makes bosses so fun to fight are the controls.  I cringed when I saw that the bumpers were going to be the main attack and dodge buttons, and that the right stick was used to aim shots, but actually it works very well on a 360 controller.  The bumpers depress pretty quick, allowing you to really tear into stuff- but it is tiring over a long play session.  Everything is fluid, from dodging to attacks to blocking to using special moves.  I didn't suffer any slowdown at all compared to Hyper Light Drifter, not that my computer is top of the line.  Pretty exceptional, really.\n\nOn the subject of slowdown, in the overworld areas it's pretty amazing just how much stuff is going on.  Despite the goofy setting, the illusions they use to convey a living world (mainly resting avatars and huge number of \"travelling\" players) are really good without interfering at all.  The towns feel populated, which is rare, and the trading mechanic supplements the cash shops really nicely in my opinion.  You can also jump all over the place, even if it's always going to be tricky figuring out elevation in a 2D game.  Still, you can jump on just about everything in a very golden-sun style of conspicuous parkour in order to find out-of-reach treasures, and for me that was just a joy.\n\nAlmost exclusively the puzzles are excellent.  They are unfortunately linear, but make up for it by teaching you constantly.  Each dungeon so far has two gimmicks that each engage differently with most or all of your abilities you'll have up to that point, and serve a purpose in fights.   Many puzzle rooms also contain additional goodies for going the extra mile as well.  A few of them, however, require fairly precise timing or aim (or both) and I can see some players getting stuck.\n\nIn short, I think this is a standout title and am greatly looking forward to its release- and would encourage anyone not disinterested due to the style or other negatives to do the same.", "timestamp_created": 1463524721, "timestamp_updated": 1463524721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23045653": {"recommendationid": "23045653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101034541", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506563465}, "language": "english", "review": "a promising game !", "timestamp_created": 1463524537, "timestamp_updated": 1463524537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23034414": {"recommendationid": "23034414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044626754", "num_games_owned": 410, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467383356}, "language": "english", "review": "Recently got a game controller and Crosscode is a really great game to play using it.

What at first glance may look like standard RPG Maker fare is actually something quite different, and very refreshing.

The look and feel is quite authentically that of an early 32-bit era game, still resorting to tile-based 2D graphics, but taking advantage of the \"new hardware\" for large sprites, zoom and lighting effects, and other shenanigans. All of that, combined with a so far very solid narrative and set of characters, makes for a game that is most definitely worth keeping an eye on.

Well, to be honest, I don't find any problem during gameplay and I actually enjoy it despite being early access but there are very few that I want to point out.\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n-Some battles can be frustrating at first and the first challenge starts very early\n-You need a lot of info on the environment around you and it takes time in order to get from one point to a desired point\n-Might experience lag in some points\n-Game contents are still small right now\n\nThe game is written in HTML 5 instead of C++ or Python but it runs as .exe so I can't tell whether the game runs natively or still relies a lot on a default web browser.\n\nSo, is the game finally worth it to buy and play at this point?

Ahh. Nice. The music is Beautiful, and reminds me of Snes classics like Chrono Trigger,\nSecret of Mana, Secret of Evermore and Illusion of Gaia, and just a bit of Megaman and Xenogears as well :)\nAs far as gameplay goes, I got used to the controls in almost no time. The controls were smooth and fluid, which is something I like in games like this.\nAs a side note: I use the keyboard and mouse, but aside from any technical issue, I think you would find it easy to use a controller. Also, an FYI, to use Melee attacks, keep the target cursor near Lea when attacking\n(This is for the keyboard and mouse)\nNow, The Story. So far, There isn't much yet, as you might notice from other reviews, but, what there is of the story\nis really interesting so far. At the moment, the story goes as far as the beginning of bergen trail, and a fight with \nanother character. after the fight, it wraps up, and you can either do quests or explore all the areas available right now.\nThe graphics are as advertised, and again, remind me of the snes era games. Nice.\nFinally, the Big Question. Is it worth the price? Short anwser is: Maybe. As i mentioned before, i Don't regret buying this game one bit. i'm glad I decided to buy it. but some things work in my favor. \n1- I got it on sale, that's always nice(15 bucks instead of 20)\n2- I grew up playing these kinds of games. This might seem strange to put in, but there is something to be said for nostalgia when it comes to games. on the other hand, if you never played a snes before, this might your future nostalgia ;)\n3- I love the music. No Really. I Love it. When it comes out as a soundtrack, or perhaps on bandcamp(you can check it out on soundcloud right now) i will definitely be buying it.\n4- That story. Grahh. Want Moar!\nAnyway, the long and short of it is, If Crosscode were complete right now, it would be more then worth that 20$ price\nRight now, it might be a little hard to say(since i'm stingy) but honesty, I don't think you'll regret it. \nAt least until you need an update for the story.

I'm amazed that I didn't find out about this game last year, I absolutely love it! If you are interested in this game, I highly recommend playing the demo first. I thought of buying it based solely on the reviews. trailers and screenshots, but experiencing the demo is what sold it for me.\n\n   The graphics are in a wonderfully done 16-bit style that reminds me a lot of SNES RPGs like Breath of FIre II and Final Fantasy III/VI, and it honestly feels like true pixel art. Nothing ever moved or rotated such that the pixels rotated as well, which is what can hurt games in this style, in my opinion. \n\n   The sound design is really good, and everything feels like it has impact and right for the situation. The music is also very Kingdom Hearts-esque, which fits this game very well. \n\n   The gameplay is a very interesting mix of a twin-stick shooting, RPG elements, platforming and puzzles, but the game doesn't feel like a perverbial Frankenstein's monster. Everything is designed around the movement and the combat mechanics, and it introduces a lot of different puzzle mechanics around them, and it all works really well! \n\n   Even though it is only in early access, the RPG mechanics that are there are very easy to understand and use, and I'm very excited to see what new things are added in the future. As of version 0.5, the party system also has a lot of potential. The AI needs a little bit of fine tuning, in regards to the various command settings, but overall it works pretty well. \n\n   I also really enjoy the story and setting of this game. As I progressed, I became more interested in finding out about the world and the many different characters. All of the main characters so far have very unique and memorable personalities, and the conversations between these characters made me more interested in them. One of my favorite mechanics in regard to this was how the dialogue you can hear just passing by various people can sometimes hint at important information. During the window where these hints are up, you can begin a conversation with them and gain some new information which can either help you on a quest or find out more about the world. I am definitely excited to see how this plays into the rest of the game. \n\n   So, if you're looking for something new and unique, I highly recommend checking out this game.

Initially when crosscode came out it kinda seemed like it was going to be a cyberpunkesc gamem, but now i'm not so sure... the beta/alpha has next to no story exposition after the intro/first 3 hours, so honestly i can't tell if they just intend to leave it completely sparse or if they are going to fill it in.. I really hope they consider hiring a writer or actually putting a story in, because as is the \"hehe we're an mmo aren't we so witty?\" exposition is going to be unpalatable if there isn't a REALLY dark cyberpunk undertone to it with actual death and despair.. I understand that the dev team aren't writers by profession, but this game would be such a waste if they ruined it with a shitty story. also, we need cooler characters. stop with the cheese. cheese is only good when there are actual characters there to respond to it.. Like, the first mission of the game is in a traditional japanese style fortress, and it's AWESOME. Then it hits a really high note, aaaaaaaaand then exposition falls off the face of the (cross)world.\n-the trading system is also kinda dumb.. it's kinda based on a component system (with a gold system on the side), so you can go out into the world and get components from the enviornment and mobs ala a real rpg, and then you can trade those up for better components at specific vendors to trade to OTHER vendors to get equipment. Functionally, what happens is you have to 1. find an item that you want to make, 2. memorize the components required, 3. find the vendor that will synthesize the higher componenets required, 4. memorize those requirements, 5. go out into the world and find all of the components.. it just takes a while and it's a huge pain in the ass, but i can see the potential for some hidden vendors/equipment creators that could potentially make it cool. Honestly, i wish they would add stuff to the map showing where vendors are and what they sell after you discover them. Then have a little intro to the system at the start of the game where you have to go through all the steps.\n-some gear effects need to be explained in the synopsis section of the game\n\n~~~\nSo in closing, it may sound like i have issues with this game, but honestly it's just because I love it. It has such potential, and I really do have a lot of faith in the developers because they seem like genuinely passionate people. The game itself is easily worth 20 dollars, so please give it a shot! i hope they fix the stuff that i brought up, because if they do crosscode could probably be up there with some of my favorite games! also, devs, please release an ost when the game \"comes out!\" please an thanks!", "timestamp_created": 1454758488, "timestamp_updated": 1463247425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474987", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20883572": {"recommendationid": "20883572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066979039", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470043328}, "language": "english", "review": "First things first play the demo.

It also makes me unreasonably happy that the devs follow the \"show, don't tell\" way of introducing new mechanics. For example, in the newest dungeon, the Bergen Temple Mines, the entire area revolves around ice physics. In one room, you can't go anywhere because a pillar blocking one way, and there's a force field blocking the other. If you try shooting the pillar, you learn it can move around on the ice, until it hits a wall. Later, you find another room sealed off with a bomb near a rock with a pillar behind it. Here, you learn bombs can move pillars, and is key in progressing in the room. The only time the game outright tells you how to progress is at the very beginning when the girl giving the tutorial straight up says something like, \"Okay, you can charge your shot, and when charged it ricochets.\" Beyond that, it feels like the devs put a lot of heart in to the game, the puzzles are interesting, the towns are fairly large and feel busy, and they put in a couple of fun references to other things, like the Giga Spiral Drill (said to be able to pierce through the heaven itself) and some other references I'm sure went over my head.\n\nIt's very nice visually, screenshots do it no justice, you really have to see the game in motion to have an appreciation for it. The music is very Kingdom Hearts-like, which is a plus in my book, and your shots make a very satisfying \"thwack\" when it hits something.\n\nOne thing I DON'T like about the game is some of the platforming. On one hand, it's nice that you don't have to keep mashing the jump button to get up on ledges, but on the other hand, one example I can think of is in the Bergen Temple MInes, where I fell off quite a number of times trying to do a simple jump because I couldn't control when I jumped, and jumping at angles generally feels weird to me. And even then, it was only the one time that really stuck out to me, and by and large it works fine, it's just a personal gripe.\n\nAnother thing I don't like is that the game is incomplete. Which is why I bought another copy to give to a friend who I showed it to, so he could also get hyped for future updates and so I could throw more money at Radical Fish Games.\n\nFinal verdict: \"I'm throwing my money at the screen and nothing is happening!\"/10 I highly recommend it, even in it's incomplete state, if only to support Radical Fish and get the word out of what I hope will be the next big name in Indie gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1451714699, "timestamp_updated": 1451714699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20190921": {"recommendationid": "20190921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053045873", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456099957}, "language": "english", "review": "Fast paced combat.

heading. It feels like it's combining the spirit of both Ghost in the Shell and the .hack// series.\n\nThe pixel art is simply gorgeous, and the in-game physics are surprisingly advanced and well established for a game like this. Seems like it could just as well be made into an actual MMO.\n\nThe gameplay is somewhat like a hack'n slash RPG with ranged combat and puzzle solving. You laso collect lots of loot as quest rewards, killing monsters and trashing plants. Much of this loot can be used to craft items at vendors.\n\nMy only gripe is that there does not seem to be much of a penalty for falling down pits or into water (You can't swim, but there's a reason for it which you will find out while playing) only loses you a few health points and instantly respawns you right where you fell in.\nI think it should be a bit more punishing. Perhaps losing a third of your HP when falling in water would be sufficient (it regenerates fairly quickly out of combat) It wouldn't be insta-kill, but you wouldn't be able to hold the move button and fall in a hundred times before dying like it is now. Make it seem like a risk instead of a nearly non-existant inconvenience.\n\nWhile I'm disappointed at the lack of story content in the game right now, I realize this is an early access game, and I will be waiting eagerly for future updates.\nFor now I will advice everyone to buy this while it's still in a special promotion offer. Or, you know, wait till it's over and buy it then to give the devs more money to finish it faster.\n\nPS: While the story is short for now, you can still explore the world and do side quests and upgrade your character.

Overall great fun, especially for a demo (usually, hopefully, a dev's \"best foot forward\").\n\nPros: \n\n- Clearly a lot of thought was put into designing the main cast; not just in looks but in characterization as well.  Each one's clearly unique and has his or her own attitude and way of speaking (or not ;).  The nameless masses are less visually impressive, but still usually have interesting things to say.  \n- Likewise, the backstory is detailed and pretty well thought-out, and the dialog is pretty consistent so far, not to mention incredibly witty.\n- Awesome awesome awesome \"16-bit\" graphics.  There's a lot more sophisticated effects than Mode 7 at work here, but it still has the look:  an elegant style from a more civilized age.\n- Gameplay is very fluid, especially important when combat is king and timing is everything.  \n- Challenging puzzles that make good use of the abilities you're given.\n\nCons:\n\n- K&M controls were a little awkward, mostly trying to track a target with the mouse while also dodging enemy attacks.    (Hope it's better with a gamepad, because this would make an awesome handheld game (e.g. on the Shield or even PSVita).\n- Three different types of in-game dialog.  I understand they're for different purposes (cutscenes, in-game conversation, and \"overheard\" conversations) and so basically necessary, but could they at least use the same key(s) to continue?  In particular, G is used to continue in the latter two, and MouseLeft is (of course) your attack button; but for cutscenes G is the Skip button, while MouseLeft continues the conversation.\n- It's SHORT!  I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the rest.  Now, I bought it in a bundle, so I've probably already got my money's worth, but I'd probably drop $20 on a copy to give away once I've got an idea of what's in store.\n- Tutorial did not run with the obvious joke about \"a girl who can handle balls\". ;D\n\nWishlist:\n\n- Multiplayer.  I mean, it IS an MMOG... simulator.  But it would be nifty at least to be able to \"join\" other players' games in progress, \u00e0 la Borderlands.\n- Voice acting.

medicore indie game that I got for $5 with 4 other games, but to my pleasent suprise it turned out to be not only one of the best if not the best indie game i've ever played.\n\nEverything about this game is filled with love and care, the dialogue, the art, the animation, the characters, the world, it's all so fluid to the point where  I haven't put the game down in the 2 hours i've been playing, I legitimately am shocked at how interesting it all is and how well it is keeping my attention.\n\nFrom the fact that hedgehog enemies actually spin like in Sonic, to the funny dialogue that goes on between the main protagonist and everyone else due to her limited speaking abilities. \n\nI can't really go into detail enough simply because I want to get back into exploring the world so here's a list of things i love about the game.\n\nThe Art\n\nThe characters\n\nThe skill trees \n\nThe RPG elements (side quest, equipment, levels, skill trees, etc.)\n\nThe side quest\n\nThe well written dialgue \n\nThe fluid animations and combat systems\n\nThe huge world map\n\nThe music \n\nThe little details (Hedgehog enemies spinning like sonic, leaves flying in a autumn like area, etc)\n\nI can

highlight the best things about this game that I've seen so far.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay is challenging, action oriented, and has a good deal of depth, with close combat and ranged attacks joined by powerful abilities, fluid and fun movement, dodging, and blocking to provide a robust game experience. A+\n\nArt: Charming retro art that doesn't have the \"Love me because of nostalgia\" vibe. The developers are amazing at this kind of art, and the love and detail put into this game is clear. A\n\nSound: The music does get a bit repetitive at times, but is cheerful enough and in keeping with the graphics. The sound effects could use a bit of variety, but they serve well enough and are quite functional. While you'll be listening to a ton of the same stuff, it's solid, and my only complaint is the scarcity because I would love more (and I'd buy the soundtrack).  B\n\nStory: Still in progress. The developers are putting content ahead of story in their priorities, so there's still quite a bit to play even though the story (more of a prologue at this point) only runs about an hour. The dialogue is tounge-in-cheek and often parodies videogame cliches, but does so without being too heavyhanded and I find it quite amusing. If the story is writen as well as the dialogue is, I forsee the outcome being quite good. ?????\n\nSystems: I normally don't take note of a game's systems like UI because normally I just suffer through mediocre menus, only noticing when something is so painfully tedious that it requires extra effort. However, the UI of Crosscode is exquisite, with clear markers of what's happening when, items sorted neatly, and quick, easy to navigate menus. If every RPG had this menu system, I would not complain. It is wonderful. A++++\n\nI have no complaints with this game in its current state. It is in early access (0.4 at the moment) and I expect there to be plenty of room to grow- and that's apparent. This will be one of those games that I check out every time a major update gets pushed out. I have no concerns for the future of the game because a wonderful foundation is in place, and as long as the developers manage to keep improving (the last time I played before Early Access was an early beta demo that only had the first few stages in, and I was hooked then) it will be great! The only danger I see is the chance of grind in the future; it's already a little bit grindy (since it's styled like an MMO, with MMO style quests and drop rates and leveling and all that entails) but if the gameplay is as solid as it is I will at least enjoy it.\n\nOverall: Undecided. I am very optimistic, and would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who enjoys action combat, RPGs, and puzzle platforming. There is a lot of potential here, and as long as it doesn't get botched I see it being a wonderful game. Likewise, my few complaints may be addressed in the future, so I don't want to leave any negative feedback that doesn't accurately reflect a later state of the game (since I'll probably forget to update this).

Back then, it wasn't even an RPG; it was basically a simulation of the aiming engine, a clone of the early tutorial now present in the current version of the game. As little of a resemblance that web-version has with the current state of the game, it did show the talent and ambition of the developers, and what has been added since is astonishing.\n\nAstonishingly good. Although there are some loose ends in the story still, this is due to the fact the game is actually in Early Access as of writing this review. And already now, it's worth the $20.\n\nWhy? Well, first of all, the game looks extremely polished already. The pixelated sprites 'fit' each other, controls have been neatly arranged and the game mechanics up until now have been executed to near perfection.\n\nThese mechanics are quite plentifully present, actually. Every enemy has specific attacks and weaknesses, and even different 'evolutions' of itself. The attacking system is as elegant as it is challenging; WASD to move, left-click to hit, right-click to dodge/block. That's it. The maps have been built in such a way it is relatively easy to traverse through for a quick sweepthrough, but provides quite the challenge when going for the semi-hidden presents scattered all over the maps.\n\nNow, of course, as it is still in development, the main plot of the story is finished in roughly half an hour. After that, you're kind of being released into the world, in order for you to explore on your own. Quests can be completed, ranging from collecting items to beating enemies. Because of the layout of the maps, some of those can take some time; not in an annoying way though, as you're mostly being busy trying to work out how to get to a certain ledge.\n\nThe only negative in this version is that the 'open-world' feeling of the game is somewhat limited. This is caused by the facts that certain buildings aren't visitable, some paths are blocked, and the world is consisting of only 5 maps (a city, 2 trails, the tutorial map and the main hub - these are rather extensive, though!). I'm not only expecting, but quite frankly plain confident the devs will be able to make that point go away.\n\nThe game is already a blast to play through, and with the constant stream of content updates, it'll only get better.\n\nIn short: Buy it now.

It has smooth controls, an easily intuitive UI, and doesn't burden you with massive complexity in terms of gameplay itself. While the current story is limited to the opening bits and one dungeon, it still gives you a great deal of room to explore and play with the game's mechanics.\n\nIn terms of the game environment and the bits of story seen, it takes influences from throughout the era, with a few from other eras to better flesh out the story. The world's details are reminiscient of the later 16-bit era games, with great attention to detail, colorful environments, and excellent pallete layering to give a perception of depth. This gives the game's aesthetics a very nostalgic feel without bringing up the era's limitations.\n\nThe music, of course, is and is not 16-bit. It is 16-bit as it uses the synthesized sound we remember, but isn't in the fact that it uses modern sound drivers which perfected the digital music compression started in the era.

Oooooh, this game. Even in it's uncompleted state is near a masterpiece.  I'll try not to fanboy about how \"Unrivaled in awesomeness, DUUUUUUDE\" it is. So, beginning the review, as well as spoilers. Crosscode is an amalgam of Kingdom Hearts style gameplay and atmosphere, an MMORPG, Zelda style puzzles, and a Megaman Battle Network (Which is a massively under-appreciated series.) aesthetic. As gameplay starts, it introduces you to a vague character in a vague setting on a vague quest. The first part ends with a death-scene of a character you don't know at all, and switches scenes to a fututristic setting with a girl floating in stasis , whom you can only assume is yourself. And if you had any doubts about this game (Which I'm sure you would, considering the very vague beginning), they're near immediately flushed away by a short but effective tutorial leading to your first boss fight. You're then told about the setting of the game, being a futuristic MMO that directly plugs your five senses into the game, and that you're a player who logged in, and for a yet unexplained reason, forgot everything. Picture the Matrix, but optional, and with less brain jacks. The game also very cleverly integrates the silent hero trope, with the fact that your voice synthesis is malfunctioning. A common problem, it seems.After dramatically escaping the cargo ship that nobody knows why you were on, (and a Naruto poser) you arrive at the entrance to the first dungeon, Rhombus Dungeon(Or whatever it's called). Going through the dungeon there are several puzzles for you to solve with your throwing-balls. You then shortly arrive at a beautiful town, all yours to explore! This is where the story stops. As you may have noticed, this is early access, and is in beta. The next part of the story is almost here, but for now, we can grind levels, do quests, and listen to the guy telling us to \"become water\" by jumping into the fountain.

Since you'd obviously want your memories back, you'll have to play the actual game, too. And thus, Lea is thrown into CrossWorlds, with no memories, and no language to use to speak, since her speech module is broken. Well, at least at first.\n\nOver the course of the, relatively simple, but engaging, story, you'll meet plenty of memorable characters - from edgelords, to tanks, from glass cannons, to helpful other players -, some of which may even join your party to help you during battle - even though in the current version, this feature is only available with one other player.\n\nIn order to regain your memories, you have to play CrossWorlds, and for that, you have to travel across the lands and gather all the elements and become the Avatar- scratch that, and figure out the mistery behind the ancients, an ancient (Duh.) civilization that lived on this planet long ago. The world of CrossWorlds is beauti- and colorful. You will see frozen mountains, deep jungles or ancient ruins. The variety of locations and enemies is certainly there.\n\nSpeaking of enemies - let's get to the gameplay. The gameplay is actually rather simple. Click close to Lea for a melee attack and far away from Lea for a ranged attack. Right-click let's you evade or guard, depending on the input. And holding the spacebar will unleash one of your powerful special attacks. The combat is fast, precise and fun, but also rather challenging, especially when it comes to the huge bosses inside the dungeons. \n\nBesides the typical combat, you can also solve different puzzles. These range from simple button-pressing to block-moving or arranging a certain path so your projectile can hit the switch. The easy controls make these puzzles quite entertaining.\n\nThe soundtrack of CrossCode is simply beautiful. I don't think I have to say any more than that. It's just wonderful.\n\nOverall, CrossCode is a small, simple, but very fun game. You can have fun for many hours with the current version. However, be aware that this is not the finished product - the story doesn't even go to the second dungeon, and many locations are still not done yet.

It's destined to become a cult phenomenon, reverently mentioned in the same company as Cave Story, Braid, or Fez. I'm highly looking forward to it and you should be too.\"\n\nSo I summarized the first (and currently only) review I ever thought worth writing over a year ago. 15 months on, it's truer than ever. In the intervening time, among plenty of other great independent games, we saw the absolute juggernaut that was Undertale blow up the internet. And at the risk of drawing parallels between two VERY different games (\"indie\" isn't a genre after all), CrossCode deserves that kind of recognition.\n\nCrossCode is not the best game you'll ever play. Its story and characters are fun and infectiously endearing, but they won't redefine the way you think about narrative in games. Its art and music are lovingly crafted, but so are a dozen other great (and not-so-great) pixel-art games. The puzzles are smart and the fast-paced combat is insanely fun and suitably challenging, but it probably won't supplant your favorite ARPG. CrossCode is reminiscent of a lot of things, a synthesis of elements both nostalgic and modern that you've likely seen many times before.\n\nWhat CrossCode likely IS though, is the best game you've never played. Because it's been fairly sparsely covered during its early access period, it's flown under the radar for a lot of people. And because that synthesis of elements is so well tuned, you'll wonder how you missed hearing about such a well-made game for so long. Almost every aspect of CrossCode feels really, really good to play, not just in an acceptably non-distracting sort of way, but dripping with love and care and attention to detail.

Now has come for a review update: Version 8.3:\n\nNothing can describe the length of detail, and scale of what this game was to what it will become.

So they rely on us to offer feedback, ideas, and other inquires we as players would like to experience in a game.\n\nAlthough the story hasn't quite gotten developed yet since the story (as of Ver. 8.3) is about half way there, and the characters are developing slowly (at least for me it is). I have always believed in this game since I discovered this priceless diamond in the rough. So I beg you, please try the Demo out at least, because you won't know unless you do it.\nCheers!\n\nWhy?

They all release in some kind of beta sandbox state, with the dev house behind it promising the moon and the sun to the community within a year or so. Often enough these products stagnate and never realize any \"potential\" the hype train saw in the game. CrossCode is not another one of these games.\n\nCrossCode is a wonderful action RPG that takes place in an alien world where gamers far away connect to avatar bodies and occassionally throw balls at hedgehogs, cows and similar kinds of dogs. Lea, the protagonist (so we're led to believe so far) is suffering a mad bout of amnesia. A floaty head guy tells Lea to play the game to kickstart her memory and following drama involving a giant enemy crab you begin your quest among the peasants to hopefully remember something about your past.\n\nThe developers have done a wonderful job pacing the release of the story along side the development of important gameplay features which has made every new release feel well rounded out and avoids spoiling the end before the game itself is complete. At the same time, they have been very responsive to input from the community which has thwarted any notions of stagnation (*cough* Starbound *cough*). The story is not yet complete so it would be ill-advised to buy the game expecting a full story right now.\n\nIntertwined with the story are many side quests. Many of these are not required, but they help cement the impression of being in a living MMOG world and are justly incentivized to help you cut down the amount of grind time you have to spend to advance the actual plot. The standard quests are typically matters of item collection or monster slaying, and other kinds of quests are available if you seek them out. Those so far seem to entail more challenging monster battles or terrain puzzles.\n\nThe physics engine underneath everything is so smooth that you'll never feel like you're fighting your character or the environment. This lends itself well to the gratuitous ball throwing and parkour fun throughout the game and largely due to this you'll spend less time being frustrated by clunky gameplay and more time getting swole to beat a certain spikey haired rival into the ground.\n\nCharacters in this game have so far been very likeable with colorful (not in the derogatory sense) dialogue and unique personality. Additionally the game has an MMOG-like character party system which works and feels similar to any other MMOG analogue. This might seem minor, but considering the world of CrossCode is actually a pseudo-MMOG it adds realism to the experience and being able to bring other players into your party really makes any grinding stints much more fun.\n\nMap design has so far been stellar. One thing that has been nice about the travel areas is they fairly open and built into the terrain are often parkour puzzles that hide not only collectables but also now players with quests to give you as well. There are still several that aren't done, but I expect it will be about the same level of quality.\n\nThere are only a few things I'd like to see improve, but does not deter my recommendation:\n\n- It would be really nice to see gamepad controls improve. With a keyboard and mouse, if you need to aim for throwing a projectile you move the mouse cursor outwards in the direction of the target which allows smooth correction as you move or the target moves. With a gamepad (specifically, the Xbox One controller) you must use the right control stick to specify the direction of aim. This effectively moves your point of reference to over your characters head which makes it very difficult to aim with any precision. I feel like it would be reasonable if they added an aim assist for gamepad play to even out the gameplay experience between gamepad and keyboard control schemes.\n\n- I still feel like the skill tree could use some expansion. But it is a minor point and the system as is works well enough given the amount of available play time available from the game.\n\nOverall this game is a worthy purchase for early access. If you're looking to support development or just really like throwing balls its worth a buy. If you want a full story to play through right at this moment, however, I'd advise waiting to play the game until it is completed.", "timestamp_created": 1437785100, "timestamp_updated": 1460341930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17189823": {"recommendationid": "17189823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072279507", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485635339}, "language": "english", "review": "New game love it, fast pace combat that can be long and painful or short and relieving.

Despite that it is in early release, it is really well polished.\n\nThe short part of the story story included is good, graphics and animations are 16-bit eye-candy, and the music fits well.\n\nThe best part in my opinion is the combat system.  It is very intuitive, fluid, and simple to learn, but it is hard to master.  The basics are moving, dashing, cutting, throwing energy balls/spheres, and blocking.  There are other aspects like attack elements you can easily switch between while attacking, and other special abilities and upgrades you can unlock.  There is also a simple,efficient, \"no-nonsense\" equipment system, which isn't tedious or time consuming like in many games.\n\nThe game is polished well enough to be a final product (minus content wise, being still in early release), and that nothing feels tedious; I've played hours and haven't gotten tired of combat (which is saying a lot for me, I end up avoiding combat half the time in many games because it can get annoying/tedious).

This isn't exactly a review, but it's basically a \"should I be tempted to buy this or not\" kind of review, with a few heads up\n\nThe thing I really like about this early access, they nail graphics and gameplay before actually adding content, this is early access done RIGHT, rather than those where their games actually feel incomplete and you proceed to say how the gameplay/animations are clunky or weird, but this game is none of that! It provides a perfect gameplay with beautiful pixel art to go with it, and very smooth pixel animations to go with it!\nThe game's gameplay is beautiful. The trailer wasn't enough to show how smooth it was? Don't worry, I got you covered. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjGYfBYALO4\nJust LOOK at the smoothness, imagine this gameplay in perfect 60fps, it's seemless!\nThe only reason that you wouldn't buy this masterpiece... is the current amount of content (around 3 hours worth of content), which, is pretty low for a 20$ game. However, the developers announced that v0.2 is just around the corner, it's release date is early july, and is said to show 2 new areas and more features! The exploration mode, which is roughly 2/3 of the entire game so far, is only one area. I can only imagine how much longer the game would be with two more areas!\nYou can watch my video, and basically graph your own expectations of the game.\nSo far, the game features a very small portion of the story mode (since exploration mode is basically a portion of story mode cut out since it still barely has anything to do with the story), exploration mode is basically the REAL part of the game, which features equipments, levelling up, skill tree, elements (there are 4 planned, but only ice and fire working for now!), trading, and so on! It's basically the real game, since story mode is but an introduction to the game, and serves as a tutorial for exploration mode.\nThere's also puzzle mode, which is the shortest mode, it features very easy puzzles for now, but the combat every few buttons and switches keeps it fresh. It also includes a nice boss at the end.\n\nSo, all in all, buy or nah?\nmy recommendation: Buy it after v0.2 is out, since it will actually provide a good splash of content for you to enjoy, but for now, the game isn't worth $20. The only reason I bought it was to support the devs, since it was disappointing to see their kickstarter campaign mostly ignored (even if barely reached the goal, it felt like this masterpiece deserved so much more...)\nThanx for readin.", "timestamp_created": 1435532736, "timestamp_updated": 1435532736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538849", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16766887": {"recommendationid": "16766887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012024082", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435413876}, "language": "english", "review": "CrossCode -  a retro action-RPG, promising exciting fast-paced combat, serious puzzle-solving and on top of that a meaty story. So far so good!\n\nMaking these kinds of promises as a new development team certainly takes a lot of... courage, but how does CrossCode hold up so far? Thankfully, the current Early Access version is split into three parts, each of which is focused on one of these things:\n\n- Exploration Mode puts you into a large open area populated by monsters. It allows you to get a feel for the game's controls as well as the extensive systems for skills (think FFX's sphere grid, but designed by a sober person) and equipment. Trying to find a large number of hidden chests you get the chance to freely jump and battle your way through the area, all the while learning new techniques and improving the stats of your character. This mode makes up the bulk of the game's current playing time and is I have had a blast playing it. Running and jumping around is just a ton of fun! While it took me a while to get comfortable with the controls during fighting, the feeling you have when you start improve and manage to defeat large mobs of enemies (that just minutes earlier were vanquishing you mercilessly) is incredibly rewarding. The game it reminded me most of is Bastion, which was one of my favorite Indie action games of the last few years, but with the beautifully animated SNES-era graphics it of course also recalls classics such as Terranigma.\n\n- Puzzle Mode shows you an example of what the dungeons of the finished game might look like. It is only a short part of the current version, but it complements the action-y parts very well and gazing into my crystal.. eh... sphere I foresee a lot of fun once these puzzles get properly integrated into the main narrative. Think Alundra, but with a feeling that you have actually solved the puzzle instead of exploiting the game's jump physics (nah, I'm just breaking your.. stones here, Alundra, you're a great game)\n\n- Story mode mostly works as a tutorial for the controls and an introduction to some of the game's main characters as well as a teaser as the game's larger world and plot. So if you're hoping to get deep into the world of CrossCode already, this might leave you with a severe case of blue testes, but that's not a bad thing in my book. Well I guess it is... should have rephrased that. Anyway, I'd rather have the chance to enjoy the game's style and mechanics now instead of delving into the plot too deeply - that's best left for when the game is actually finished.\n\nSO GET TO THE POINT, SHOULD I BUY CROSSCODE NOW?\nWell, maybe! (\"Ooh, such decisiveness,\" the crowd murmured approvingly.)\nSee, part of me wants to go and make everybody buy this now, but I think that would do the game a disservice. CrossCode is certainly not a finished game at this point, even if the controls, animation and soundtrack already have a very high level of polish. And the current price is certainly at the level (or likely even above) where the finished product will be sold next year. So I would suggest this: if this sounds like your kind of game and you're curious to experience a game as it goes from its early stages to a fully fleshed out product - get it now! If you're interested but already don't have the time to play half the fully-finished games in your backlog? Then put it on your wishlist, follow their regularly updated and very detailed development blog and come back in a year or so. This is not a game that will always be expanded or be significantly cheaper during Early Access. \n\nIn short, CrossCode is already a ton of fun, and if the devs keep their eyes on the .. prize then this should turn out to be a great game once it's done.\n\n\nFull disclosure: I backed this game during the Indiegogo campaign and I'm friends with some of the devs, so I might not be entirely trustworthy. But for what it's worth, I promise you that I wouldn't have written any of this if I didn't enjoy the game and thought it deserved a wider exposure. AND I DIDN'T EVEN SAY BALLS ONCE. EXCEPT FOR NOW.

No other compensation was given.\n\n[b]Introduction[/b]\n==========\nCrossCode is the perfect example of why Early Access exists. It gives us an idea of the game the developers have in mind, while allowing us to support them and help them to finish their game. CrossCode is an action RPG, and a shiny pearl in the sea of  trash that's currently swimming in Early Access. There are a lot of systems and features in place and ready to go, such as melee/ranged attacks, dodging, guarding, skill trees, elemental attacks, interacting with the terrain, trading, puzzle-filled dungeons, story scripting, enemy AI and attack patterns, bosses, and more! CrossCode draws heavily from the 16-bit era, and if you've played Secret of Mana or Zelda: A Link to the Past for the SNES, then you'll see the influence easily. The gameplay is very similar to those two games, and it's simply amazing. The current version of CrossCode is a set of demos, one for each mode: Story, Puzzle, and Exploration. I'll go over each one in turn.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n==========\nFirst, let's go over Story Mode. In Story Mode, you are introduced to a cast of characters and the game world. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but let's just say it's a premise that's been done before but with a few twists. You begin in a sort of tutorial area, which has you running a character through a small forested area towards a building. Along the way, you are taught the basic controls and basic combat abilities.  Once you reach the building a short dialogue occurs, then the game transitions to a cargo ship where we meet the main player character and the supporting cast. More tutorials occur, such as ranged and melee combat, switches, dodging, and later guarding. You have a melee slashing attack, and a ranged attack that has you shooting spheres. The spheres are able to bounce off walls when charged. The Story Mode demo wraps up after a boss battle that introduces an antagonist who tries to abduct the main character. She is saved by the supporting cast and makes an escape.\n\nNext, we have Puzzle Mode. Puzzle Mode takes you through a typical dungeon that will be implemented into the finished game. This has you hitting switches to open doors, moving boxes to press switches, navigating large rooms to solve puzzles scattered throughout, and ultimately ending up at a boss battle that introduces you to Boss AI scripting. It has 3 phases, the first being the melee phase. It'll be within your melee range, so just attack it normally. Next with Phase 2 it'll move away out of your melee range, so start using your ranged attacks. In the combat area are 2 switches which raise 2 pillars. When the boss starts charging up it super attack, hit one of the switches and hide behind a pillar that pops up. The boss will finish his attack, then hit the switch itself and lower the pillar and resume it's attacks. In phase 3 it gains a shield, which you need to solve a small puzzle to figure out how to bring it down. It involves bouncing your ranged attacks off of bumpers to hit it from behind, shorting out it's shield. Defeating it gives you the option to take on the \"Final Challenge\", which is a short Survival Mode, that has you fighting waves of enemies. The Puzzle Mode Demo wraps up afterwards.\n\nLast, we have Exploration Mode. This starts you in an area called Autumn's Rise, where you are introduced to even more features, like Elemental Attacks, Skills, Items, Equipment, and Combat Arts. In this mode you are free to explore the map, defeat enemies, and buy equipment and items from the few shops that are present. There are even a few trading booths where you can trade items you find for other items.  Exploration Mode ends when you find all of the hidden treasure chests in the area and open up the last challenge. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n==========\nCrossCode is a very colorful, vivid game, with detailed character sprites. Remember how the SNES did sprites? Take those, and make them 100 times better. CrossCode uses very crisp sprites with fluid animations for all aspects of gameplay. Attacks, movement, dodging, etc...all look extremely detailed and very well done. No complaints from me in the graphcis department. I grew up with classics like Super Mario World, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy III (VI), Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, and Lufia, so I'm no stranger to sprite-based games. CrossCode features some of the best sprites I've ever seen in a video game. Even the character portraits are sprites!\n\n[b]Sound and Music[/b]\n==========\nGreat sound effects and cacthy tunes that fit any given situation. The music sounds like it would have been right at home on the SNES, and sounds very Secret of Mana or Star Ocean-esque; this fits the theme of the game extremely well. When combat starts the music changes to a more fitting tone, and transistions back to normal when combat is concluded. Being a big fan of video game music, I can't go on enough about how much I like the music in this game.\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\n==========\nI ran into absolutely no issues while playing CrossCode. Everything was crisp and smooth, no framerate issues or crashing. The game seems very well optimized for a game in what looks liek an alpha stage. This makes it very easy to recommend this game to all players who are fans of this genre, as they will have very little issues getting the game to run so they can enjoy it!\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\n==========\nThis game has everything you could possibly want from an action RPG. Combat, exploration, puzzles, dungeons...the concept is here and it's amazing. Please buy this to support the developers and help them get this gem finished! I'd hate to see such potential shut down, and this game has a ton of potential. It could be the next big indie title. It just needs a helping hand. And with Steam's Early Access program, that could very well happen. Even with it's early alpha/demo state, it still offers several hours of fun gameplay.\n\n[b]Gameplay Demo[/b]\n==========\nThis demo covers all of Puzzle Mode and a nice portion of Exploration Mode.\nhttps://youtu.be/6hQX5DcAvt8\n\n[b]Nerd House Verdict[/b]:\n==========\n[h1][b]Highly Recommended[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1435350734, "timestamp_updated": 1485058965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707419", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16668482": {"recommendationid": "16668482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050621840", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "last_played": 1514761077}, "language": "english", "review": "Review (Jun 24, 2015)\n\nSo the first game I actually spend my money on on steam is an early access...\nI played the original demo when it came out, and holy shit I was sold. Imagine a Danmaku inside a LoZ game inside a skill-tree RPG. That is what this game is, and holy crap it is amazing. I bought it early access because of that demo (and also the fact that I prolly won't have funds when this actually comes out).\n\nThe early access currently features a bit more than the original demo (not the newer, more restricted one). The world exploration is phenominal. My only qualm at this point is that judging height when platforming is a bit tricky, but that can be fixed with some depth cues based on lighting.\n\nThe art is amazing. The music is amazing. The polish is amazing, but the real point where this stands out is its gameplay. As I said, it feels like an LoZ game with danmaku elements. The skills are pretty cool too.\n(btw this is what I got from the original demo. I have yet to get as far in the early access as I have in the original demo).", "timestamp_created": 1435125891, "timestamp_updated": 1481387777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16631319": {"recommendationid": "16631319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107803309", "num_games_owned": 486, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455612421}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Key supplied by developer for review.[/i]\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n[h1][b]CrossCode[/b][/h1] Read on for the full review!\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n\nWhile this game is still in development, and I can't say much, I can say that the demo has me sold, and if you're looking for the next big thing, this just might be it. Give it a purchase if you're okay with waiting for the finished product.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[h1][b]Pros[/b][/h1]\n+ Graphics: Oh my god yes. They're gorgeous!\n+ Animation: In a category all of it's own, literally.\n+ Music: As good as the graphics!\n+ UI: Stylish AND extremely functional.\n+ Story: Well written.\n+ Levels: Excellently designed with flawless puzzle integration.\n+ Combat: Fast paced, varied, excellent.\n\n[h1][b]Cons[/b][/h1]\n- So much polish you MIGHT go blind.\n- It isn't finished yet! D:\n\n[h1][b]Neutral[/b][/h1]\n+/- The combat sequences may tend to drag on. Remains to be seen.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\nThis one impressed me from the very start. The music, colors, and animation I was greeted with on the title screen alone were all of fantastic quality. Upon entering the game, Crosscode treats you to a wonderful color palette, and a basic mysterious introductory story scene, that gives you a brief briefing of the combat system you'll be working with.\n\nCrosscode, from what I can tell, is a game about an AR MMO where the players are hooked into avatars made from instant matter. There is a physical location in the world starting with Rhombus Square where they can play the game. Their attacks, it seems, effect the physical world, although they can only be seen with AR glasses. It also seems that they are not necessarily prohibited from leaving their designated game zone.\n\nThe tutoral will cover all of this and a bit more, as you take on the role of the protagonist Lea, who has amnesia and is going to be playing the game to attempt to recover her memories. The story may be starting to become familiar territory, but aside from a few grammatical mistakes, is excellently written. Likewise, the gameplay is as smooth as can be, with many options for you.\n\nIn combat, you can fight with ranged or melee, even to some extent simaltaneously, and both will be needed, but often times you are allowed to use either as you see fit. There will be many RPG features like equipment, a sprawling skill tree reminiscent of Path of Exile, inventory management, levels and experience, etc. The gameplay I've experienced so far reminds me a lot of Golden Sun, in that it's an action-puzzler RPG with excellent graphics, world design, and puzzle elements flawlessly integrated into said world design.\n\nThe UI is also flawless, and the developers have made it very easy to navigate. It's stylish but also very functional. The game has full keyboard/mouse and controller support, but goes the extra mile to make keyboard navigation easy. The camera transitions, dialogue, and everything else are smooth and refreshingly simple.\n\nAfter playing this demo I could not be more excited about the final product-which I will now commence eagerly awaiting. Even more importantly, this demo has made me feel like I have a high degree of assurance this will be a game of the utmost quality.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1435007665, "timestamp_updated": 1435778223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.678444", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16611219": {"recommendationid": "16611219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162914184", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472533087}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego que te atrapara para seguir esperando el fin de este asombroso proyecto.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1434945079, "timestamp_updated": 1434945079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16568243": {"recommendationid": "16568243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174738623", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472413083}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all it's amazing gameplay, also nice art/graphics and scarce content yet(it's in the early access as of the time of writing).

The blend of ranged and close-fighting may need some balancing because as fun as pelting everything with balls is I find myself obliterating stuff with melee much quicker.

If however all you want is a full game then\n[b][u]put this game into your WISHLIST RIGHT NOW.[/u][/b] Right before release (Q3 2016) the game will be around 10% off again and you will be getting a mail, so you can have another look at it before it releases.\nUntil then you can [url=http://cross-code.com/en/start]play the introductionary Demo on the game's website[/url].\n\nWhat we have at hand already and the way the devs communicate their thoughts and development process in their blog and in live streams makes me very positive, that the end product will be of highest quality and lots and lots of fun.\n\n\n[h1]About Early Access[/h1]\nAs I'm writing this review, the game has just been crowdfunded and full time development has started just now, so atm there's not really enough content to justify the 20\u20ac (or 20 whatevers) price tag.\nThat said, the devs have always been very open about their progress on the game (as you can see here on [url=http://www.radicalfishgames.com/]the devs' blog[/url]), so it is only natural for them to let everyone have Alpha and Beta access if they choose so. Steam is also the easiest way to provide early access to those, who have paid considerable amounts in the crowdfunding campaign.\n[b]We can expect a lot of progress in the next few months[/b] as most of the custom engine is already done and it's all about content creation from now on, save for some balancing, bugfixing and general tweaking at the end, I suppose.\n\nIf you want to see this game go from 10% done to 100% done in the next year and a bit, then I can recommend buying it right now. In any case though, I beg you to put it in your wishlist and have a look at it next year again.\n\n\n[h1]Visuals and Sound[/h1]\nOh god... [b]the sprite art is simply amazing[/b]. The animations are really, really good, the maps are very colourful, detailed and lively. The combination of pre-industrial aesthetics and a lot of nature with sci-fi themes is intriguing and seeing their latest screenshots, I'd say it's going to be a treat.\n[b]The soundtrack so far is just as strong[/b]. [url=https://soundcloud.com/interovgm/sets/crosscode-original-soundtrack]Here's the soundcloud playlist[/url]. Go and dig it. My favourite title isn't even in the playlist. It's no chiptune, but it definitely takes inspiration from some SNES titles.\n[b]The sound effects do a great job of supporting the gameplay[/b]. You get actual audio feedback from your actions, making each attack and each jump feel so much more enjoyable and satisfying.\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay and Controls[/h1]\nFinally, the actual reason why I love this game already. [b]You know that the gameplay is good when even the most basic actions feel awesome and are fun[/b]. In this case that includes running, gunning and fighting.\n\nThe character moves at a proper pace and the auto-jump mechanic is weirdly fun. You would think auto-jumping would be \"meh\", but jumping around feels pretty good actually and as a plus: not only are the controls streamlined, you also always jump off as close to the edge as possible. One has to experience it to believe it i think (go play the demo). All in all I have a lot of fun with platforming here.\n\nYour fighting options include melee and shooting/throwing projectiles as offensive actions as well as blocking and dashing. On top of that you will be getting some special abilities while leveling up. All of these are sensible actions, opening the game to different play styles. Generally the fighting is fast paced and action oriented and while atm the most effective way to deal with most mobs is melee, I'm fairly positive that in the future we will see more opponents that require the use several skills in order to take them down (like the meerkats that are already there).\n\nOther than places to run and fight there will also be dungeons filled with puzzles, which is where the projectiles come in handy. But yeah, not much to say about that, yet.\n\nThe controls are more on the side of streamlined yet powerful giving you the option of using \"WASD+Space+Mouse\" or \"Dual-Stick+A+B\" (that doesn't include extra buttons for menuing only). Personally I play with mouse and keyboard and I find the controls very elegant seeing no reason to remap them. They remind me a lot of Hotline Miami's controls.", "timestamp_created": 1432827656, "timestamp_updated": 1432982893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16039588": {"recommendationid": "16039588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166354217", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473459013}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich hoffe die story wird noch weiter gehen tolles spiel", "timestamp_created": 1432824181, "timestamp_updated": 1432824181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16002719": {"recommendationid": "16002719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067658588", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512658553}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer in der alten Zeit aufgewachsen ist und den SNES kennt, unter anderen das Spiel Terranigma das auch ein Action-Kampfsystem besessen hat.

The graphics and gameplay take me back to the glory days of SNES action RPGs like The Secret of Mana. I get a Squaresoft like vibe from the game and that's a good thing.

I've been following this game since it was very early in development.  I took an extended break from playing to allow the game to grow some more and now that the game is more complete (in fact it's nearly finished at the time of this writing) I feel I can talk more about the gameplay.\n\nCrosscode is an action RPG with a strong retro flair, recalling classic 16-bit-era games like Zelda: Link to the Past, Phantasy Star IV and others.  You play as a girl named Lea. Lea has unfortunately lost her memories, and it's been decided playing the futuristic MMO \"Crossworlds\" is the best way for her to get her memory back. Players control hard-light constructs in a real physical world via some kind of remote interface. Lea is somewhat of a silent protagonist (something went wrong with her speech controller, so she can only say a few words at first).  Along your path you'll meet party members, explore huge dungeons filled with complex puzzles, and kill lots and lots of critters (including some very impressive bosses) The death penalty is fairly minimal in this game (you lose whatever you gained in that room) so there's no harm in trying and trying again until you get past whatever obstacle you're working on.\n\nCombat is fluid and slick.  You have a close-range melee strike that deals heavy damage, and a long-range projectile weapon. Both of these can be upgraded over time, and you'll quickly unlock special attacks to make you even more powerful. Later on in the game you'll get elemental powers that will not only amplify your ability, but allow you to take advantage of certain enemy's weaknesses. And it's in your benefit to dispatch enemies quickly. The faster you move, the higher your combat rank goes, which allows you to collect better loot from the enemies you slay.\n\nYou won't lack for stuff to do either. NPCs all over the map have various sidequests for you to take on, that give XP and loot of all kinds. There's also tons of merchants and traders for you to swap all the useless junk you find scattered around for new and better gear.\n\nThe game's audio is somewhat simple, but the tunes are catchy and even after multiple repeats they don't seem to get annoying.\n\nOverall I still really like this game. It's a wonderful throwback to the old 16 bit RPGs I used to love, but it's new enough to be a standout in its own right.", "timestamp_created": 1432049307, "timestamp_updated": 1491322028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15899123": {"recommendationid": "15899123", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997241229", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467304078}, "language": "english", "review": "I  played the demo before the Indiegogo campagne and I have to say never have I ever been hooked on a game this fast. \n\nThe first levels I thought ok, this could be funny, but isn't very unique. \n\nBut then the fresh ideas, the nice soundtrack and of course everything in a browser with HTML 5 just blew me away.\n\nPlay the demo and judge fpr yourself!", "timestamp_created": 1432037921, "timestamp_updated": 1432037921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15897813": {"recommendationid": "15897813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065482733", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508965887}, "language": "english", "review": "It may only be early access, but it's still amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1432030028, "timestamp_updated": 1432030028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15891050": {"recommendationid": "15891050", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998590277", "num_games_owned": 473, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452809843}, "language": "english", "review": "I've already played and loved the demo, so I just had to back this.\nFor now, the Early Access pretty much resembles the demo, but I am definitely looking forward to the updates.\nAll I can say is, that you can play this on pretty much everything (maybe even Potato-GlaDOS).\nI tried it on my Acer Switch 11 and the game itself runs amazingly fluid.\nThere's little lag in the cutscenes and rather long loadingtimes, but I noticed no influence on the actual gameplay.\nSpecs of my Acer:\nIntel Atom Z3745 with 1,3GHz, 2GB RAM,  Intel HD Graphics.\n\nAbout the gameplay:\nI haven't tried it with a gamepad yet, but playing with mouse and keyboard works absolutely great.\nFor some it might be a bit unusual to play a retro oriented game which reminds of the SNES era with mouse and keyboard, but it definitely pays off. The aiming works well plus it doesn't have any influence on the melee attacks like pointing in the wrong direction. The combination of shield and dashing as defensive moves also gives the game more variety since you have to decide on how to defend yourself against the enemy in front of you.\nThis next to typical elements of RPGs like stats, resistances etc. offers a lot of possibilities for enemies and obstacles which the player has to understand to be able to beat them and therefor is a great opportunity for challenge.\nAlso it seems some accuracy improvements were made in comparison to when I last played the demo.\nThe jumps and platforms feel easier to to access and I generally think that it's responding more playerfriendly.\nObstacles and riddles with the ballshooting mechanism are fun and I hope they find plenty of use further in the game.\nAlso I like how the game switches between melee and range attacks. It's a lot more fluid than manually changing the attack type and helps keeping the fights focused on the actual battle.\n\nGenerally I'm having a lot of fun with the other two game modes, which are pretty promising and give a good hint at what might be added to the game in the future. In my opinion it was a really good idea to show different aspects of a game by presenting short bits of each of them instead of just delivering a fraction of the actual gameplay and doing the rest by teasers and promises of how awesome it will be.\n\nCrossCode definitely gets my recommendation and if you're not sure whether the game suits you: Play the demo, it's free on the games website.", "timestamp_created": 1431983883, "timestamp_updated": 1431983883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15891039": {"recommendationid": "15891039", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971469492", "num_games_owned": 803, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506367921}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.

I know it's going to be one of those that I finish and wish I hadn't because I didn't want it to end.\n\nThe combat is razor sharp, and there are plenty of interesting ways to approach it.  The puzzles are stellar.  The story is interesting and the characters are entertaining and full of flavor.  ESPECIALLY the companion NPCs.  The game world is fascinating and it really feels like an adventure as you go through it. I found myself excited every time I discovered a new area.\n\nIt's like some kind of blend of a Zelda game and Maplestory with actually good combat and a Path of Exile-esque skill tree.

I purchased this game when it was on sale, so I got a good deal; Crosscode is a multi-genre Rpg - which is to my knowledge, still in early access. \n(This means when the final update comes to steam, it will actually be a complete game, with from the authors, the actual entirety of the story and content.)\nOnly a couple hours so far in the story and the game feels surprisingly refined and inspired with the various combatants, music, artstyle, and game design.\nThe music especially caught my attention, which had a great tribute to other classic adventure rpgs from older games. Which was welcoming and almost iconic to a extent.\nThe characters were also varied, and had certain quirks that made the player want to learn more about the backstorys and general motives. There was also a sense of foreshadowing and plot to be developed as the player progresses. (most notably the tutorial section)\nThe difficulty is unforgiving which to me seems where many would be turned off by, as you can actually expect to be thrashed by many of the bosses and armored opponents. Although harsh, it gives a the player a sense of progress when optmizing gear and learning attack patterns of mobs to beat them and seap rewards from winning.\nLayouts of the overworld for the most part are beautiful and lively that it doesn't feel like a dead server or like a generic biome of sorts. Although the colors can be irritating if played for long periods, a method useable for players is to just lower the brightness..seriously helped.\n-The Story-\n(no spoilers)\nYou play as the main protaganist Lea, a amneisac stuck in what seems to be a mmorpg, where you have to blend in with other players. In a endevor to recover your memories and to find why you are in the game, with the threat of many foes.\n(Seems lackluster but its a well explored senario, kinda like SAO but not bad, or botched in a way where its overthetop.) \nOne thing that annoyed me, was that there is no tracking quests, in this game, Lea the main character, would be filled with a quest log full of quests to engage in. Although my gripe with this although for the most part good is locating where to go next, as its hard to find specific sequeces. I might be bad but I still can't find the damn bandit/thief, anywhere at the autumn road area. \nBut with these minor problems with navigation and quests it served as a beacon for me to actually seek depth in the world, it helped me appriciate the surrounding areas and mobs. It was a kind of padding for me that was annoying in a way but still welcome.\nWhat sold me right away and got me hooked was the fluid gameplay and combat, I played too much in a setting that my index hurt from clicking.  Seeing the game smoothly without many hiccups was welcome, as there were many particles present and mobs being attacked..\nEverything about this game was top-notch compared to many games on the market and I hope to play the full game when the devs finish production.\nDon't worry (if you are thinking to wait) its actually worth buying it now, (whenever there's a sale) as most of the content is there and you would be criminal to leave it untouched or to experience this game. I would recommend this game to my friends if I had any... jk but you don't want to miss out on this gem.\n\nIf you don't want to read through this: \nPros:\n+Engaging Story (surprisingly depth)\n+Excellent Combat\n+Variety of Monsters and Bosses\n+Good Platforming, and Puzzles that actually require thought.\n+The ArtStyle and Soundtrack\n+Provides a challenge that'll have u grinding wishing you invested in defence...\n\nCons\n-The Saturation (hurts to look at for a while in some areas) very mild con\n-Quests not able to be tracked or finished consistantly \n-Not for the casual (many difficulty spikes)\n\nAll of the Cons are oveshadowed by the overall thickness in the effort of producing this game, and its contents.\nGreat Stuff\n9/10\n9.4/10 if the game gets out of E.

Overall I would rate this game somewhere in my top 5 of all time, maybe even #1, it's an amazing game developed by a team that really cares about details. If you were looking for a game to satisfy your 2D Action RPG game needs, look no further, just buy it.\n\nPROS: \n\n- Super immersive world, great setting.\n- You pretty much never get bored, even by sidequests.\n- Well-written characters.\n- Tight action oriented gameplay with great controls.\n- Funny, and doesn't overdo it.\n- Great skill tree.\n- Great puzzles.\n- The story is great, pulls you straight into the world.\n- The graphics are amazing.\n- Alot of content available even in early access.\n- Since this game takes place in an fictional MMO there are always other \"players\" running around, and it truly makes the \n  world feel much more alive than any other games similar to this.\n- It's the small things that matter, little details put in everywhere.\n- The level design is truly something to behold.\n\nTo reiterate, the level design in this game is on another level in it's genre. Can't jump up on that mountain? There is probably another path. Looks off-limits? There is probably another path. Is that a wall put there to limit your play area? There is probably another path to get on top of it. Some secret paths spans between multiple rooms. You truly never grow tired of exploring, checking if you found every path in the game. \n\nCONS:\nThe only thing I can think of is that puzzles can be abit unintuitive at times, and hard to solve / unclear.

If you've yearned for some of the old 16-bit action from the SNES in a much smoother and more modern feel then look no further.  In my opinion the game uses many elements from some of my favorite SNES RPG's such as Lufia 2, Secret of Mana, Zelda, and many others.  \n\nIt's executed beautifully and will keep you entertained for hours on end.  The puzzles are extremely challenging and at times you will want to nerd rage and give up.  The combat is flawless with a high-paced mixture of melee and ranged attacks with special abilities, skill trees and equipment upgrades.  It's high paced nature will keep you begging for more.  An if you have a completionist personality -- then plan on staying inside for a solid week.  \n\nI can't fully review the game at this time as it's not released yet, however; it's WELL worth the money to go ahead and jump in to early access (something I NEVER do).  \n\nMy only real complaint for the time being is the sound tracks get a bit monotonous after awhile.  The music is very good, however it's replayability isn't there for me.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1516259905, "timestamp_updated": 1516259905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39523042": {"recommendationid": "39523042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198403917300", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1354, "last_played": 1516573506}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u3068\u3066\u3082\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\n\u7d76\u5bfe\u306b\u307f\u3093\u306a\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308c\u3088\u306a\u3002\n\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u304c\u7570\u5e38\u306b\u3088\u304f\u7df4\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u3066\u3001\u4f5c\u696d\u7684\u306a\u30ec\u30d9\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u305b\u305a\u3001\u3057\u304b\u3057\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u3067\u6e29\u304f\u3082\u306a\u3089\u305a\u3001\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u3084\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u3053\u306a\u3057\u3066\u3044\u3051\u308b\u3002\n\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u3082\u8c4a\u5bcc\u306b\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u8981\u7d20\u3068\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u8981\u7d20\u306e\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u306b\u3088\u308a\u3088\u304f\u5de5\u592b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001\u540c\u3058\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u304c\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u5b58\u5728\u3057\u306a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u3001\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u306a\u6c17\u5206\u3067\u5e38\u306b\u904a\u3079\u305f\u3002\n\u6226\u95d8\u306f\u9ad8\u901f\u3067\u3001\u6163\u308c\u308b\u3068\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u826f\u3044\u3002\u9ad8\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u306e\u5fc5\u6bba\u6280\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u3068\u30c9\u6d3e\u624b\u3067\u3082\u3063\u3068\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3044\u3044\u3002\u4f4e\u30b9\u30da\u3059\u304e\u308b\u3068\u6575\u304c\u591a\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067\u5fc5\u6bba\u6280\u4f7f\u3046\u3068\u51e6\u7406\u843d\u3061\u3059\u308b\u3002\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3002\n\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u3082\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3001\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3001\u6226\u95d8\u3001\u3069\u308c\u3082\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3002\n\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u3082\u4e2d\u3005\u98a8\u5442\u6577\u304c\u5e83\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3001\u4eca\u5f8c\u306e\u5c55\u958b\u304c\u697d\u3057\u307f\u3002\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u5143\u3005\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u3068\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3082\u9055\u548c\u611f\u304c\u306a\u3044\u307b\u3069\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3002\n\u5143\u6c17\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u5a18\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3001\u840c\u3048\u301c\u301c\u301c\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1516575363, "timestamp_updated": 1516575756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39500193": {"recommendationid": "39500193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011468399", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2367, "last_played": 1516595449}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u5f88\u597d\u73a9  \u53ef\u662f\u89e3\u8b0e\u8981\u7d20\u5be6\u5728\u592a\u591a  \u6709\u6642\u5019\u6703\u89ba\u5f97\u5f88\u7169", "timestamp_created": 1516505963, "timestamp_updated": 1516505963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39498429": {"recommendationid": "39498429", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967052056", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2106, "last_played": 1516574545}, "language": "english", "review": "For starters, [b][u][i]this game is fucking amazing![/i][/u][/b]\n\nIn my opinion, combat is the weakest part of the game, but not because it's in any way bad.

It's really enjoyable and it's so much fun to figure out how to get everywhere on each map. Even more so when it's a map-wide jaunt, but especially the couple of times when the path goes across multiple maps.

It is extremly close to being a negative. If it was out of 5 starts it would be 2.5 (2.4 being negative). For the most part I enjoy this game quite a bit.\n\nI found the music a bit repetitive because some chests can be a pain to get to. Meaning by the time you get most or all of them in the area you want to beat your face into the desk to make it stop playing in your head. \n\nSound effects are pretty good. No complaints. \n\nThe dungeons are a bit lack luster. They are mostly puzzles with the occasional fights. This game has a combat grade system. Meaning the more/better you fight, the higher your grade, the better items that can drop. Because dungeons are mostly puzzle oriented. It makes the grading system just about worthless overall. The rooms you do fight in either are really far apart, don't respawn or just a couple respawn. More fights in dungeons are needed (allowing the grade to move room to room) or remove the grading system entirely and make drops a flat rate. Possibly having the drop rates higher for some of the rarer items that are in the areas just before the dungeon would be good too.\n\nThe temple mine was a little close to what it should be as I would like to see above. But Faj'ro temple went waaaay too far with the puzzles. I would be OK with having to defeat a few enemies in each room and they respawn after visiting so many other rooms or on a timer while not in that room. With the grading system being usable of course.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is although I don't mind puzzles (some of them made me REALLY think). The fact there is some really cool combat and combat mechanics. They don't get really used in dungeons where they could shine is what really bothers me.", "timestamp_created": 1516848148, "timestamp_updated": 1516848283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39582703": {"recommendationid": "39582703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255656481", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2155, "last_played": 1516901777}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u6700\u8fd1\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u7dba\u9e97\u3067\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3067\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1516805699, "timestamp_updated": 1516805699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39581817": {"recommendationid": "39581817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053666093", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 200, "last_played": 1515738546}, "language": "koreana", "review": "[h1]\ub808\uc544 \ubaa9\uc18c\ub9ac \uc9c1\uc811 \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\ub529\ud574\uc11c \ub123\uc5b4\uc8fc\uace0 \uc2f6\ub2e4...

However, every time I had money to get a new game my friends wanted me to dive into something cooperative. Now that I finally hit a lull and could get this game, I regret waiting so long.\n\nI'm at around Lv 17 at the moment and needless to say this game is beautifully done. While I hope that these \"not implemented\" tags here and there get to go away, the game has an amazing polish to it as-is. Playing with a controller is just as smooth and precise the videos made me think it was. While early on it made me feel like I'd be picking between melee and ranged to focus on, using both on the fly is a blast and heavily encouraged.\n\nThe only qualities that bothered me are things that can be adapted to (the intro city is a maze, ranged aiming can be quirky at first). The menu interfaces are a series of tubes to an extent, but the way information is displayed is very nice and intuitive. The game runs on my laptop beautifully and only dropped in frames when someone unplugged me by accident.\n\nTL;DR:\n+ Hella smooth gameplay, focused on timing and situational awareness\n+ Protag is too pure for this world\n+ Well-made mechanically, with a clean menu system\n+ Snazzy elemental system that incentivizes rationing hits to avoid overload\n+ Chaining encounters can improve item drop rates, rampaging across an area makes gather quests easy\n\n- Maze-like city at the start, but it can be overcome\n- Some quests devolve into wandering around, thankfully you can spam dodges to equate sprinting\n\n? It's ya boi, BULLET HELL\n? Silent but not silent protag\n? Still in development. Whether this is neutral or outright bad is up to the individual.\n\nOverall: Hi/10", "timestamp_created": 1516597890, "timestamp_updated": 1516597890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40965874": {"recommendationid": "40965874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047295469", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1086, "last_played": 1521768330}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is not finished, nor am I finished with what it currently has to offer, but in my opinion this would fall somewhere in the top 100 games of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1521678385, "timestamp_updated": 1521678385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40965864": {"recommendationid": "40965864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052962547", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 291, "last_played": 1521677355}, "language": "english", "review": "I have enjoyed this game so far!

This game is extraordinary within all fields that it represents. An awesome example of early access, indie gaming, and every facet of its hybrid gameplay.\n\nAs of making this review I've finished the story part of the current release, which is supposed to be roughly halfway through the game. Because of this the story is the one thing I can't comment fully on as I haven't seen any of the conclusion. However, it's been an excellent first half. The setting, characters, and overall plot is all quite unique. The mystery set up so far is interesting. The characters are definitely the strongest point though as they all feel natural but distinct. There's a lot of excellent comedy through the game.\n\nAnother thing that I consider a very strong point is the use of their setting. There are in game reasons for other characters going through the same challenges and bosses as you, and seeing them discuss the game you're playing within the story is rather unusual but interesting. My only nitpick with this is honestly that there isn't more of it. I feel compelled to seek out all the dialogue trees I can and still want more.\n\nThe visuals are consistently impressive. The game may have an old school pixellated look but it does everything it can with it. The aesthetics are strong through almost every zone so far. The only thing that looks a bit off to me is some of the character portraits, but even that is a small issue that might just be my taste.\n\nWhat truly sets this game apart though is gameplay. Both combat and puzzles are some of the most mechanically intriguing I've seen. Your entire moveset is impressively used for both puzzles and combat, sometimes both at the same time. In fact, many of the encounters feels more like dynamic puzzles than anything. It'll test your reflexes and with in a consistently challenging but fair series of trials.\n\nThe puzzles naturally introduce new concepts and then progressively increase their complexity. This is quite standard in puzzle games, but Crosscode simply keeps going and does a lot more than you'd think possible with the mechanics given. You'll be mixing all your abilities and elements in huge puzzles near the end of the dungeons, and you'll feel awesome for completing them.\n\nCombat is even stronger as it'll often use tools from the puzzles in a more active conflict. That coupled with a lot of quick decisions to make during every encounter. The stagger mechanic especially is intriguing. Staggering enemies isn't just a crowd control effect, it's like changing them to a different state. Sometimes enemies will become more dangerous when staggered, sometimes they'll get different resistances. The ways they stagger vary a lot as well, some from specific damage types and others from more puzzle-like elements. There's simply a lot to consider when fighting just one enemy, and it only increases as they come in packs.\n\nThe bosses are the best examples of this. All bosses I've fought so far have been excellent tests of what you've learned through the dungeon coupled with reflexes and learning their movesets.\n\nOverall it's a consistently impressive experience. I already got more than my moneys worth at the halfway point. I'm eagerly awaiting the full release where I suspect it'll keep getting even better as the developers seem to know what to do, so I'm excited to see what a bigger moveset will allow them to do.", "timestamp_created": 1520689667, "timestamp_updated": 1520689667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40707074": {"recommendationid": "40707074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255124819", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513202895}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430", "timestamp_created": 1520677471, "timestamp_updated": 1520677471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40681984": {"recommendationid": "40681984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162932367", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515976870}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game waaaaaay back in mid-2015 and enjoyed it then.

video games? The answer is probably to have a good time. For those of you whom enjoy suffering, might I recommend something like a generic third teir MMORPG? Their godawful, soul sucking grind machines, that in the end, added no real value to your actually human exsistance.\n\nFor the rest of us, this is a wonderful experiment in narrtive subversion with a high focus on unquie gameplay design choices. For a 2D title, this game has a lot of open movement range. Quirky diolouge with an emphsis in deepening the story with gentle but not over barring mentions of the over all story line as we play. \n\nThe result? A game that plays enough like what you've played before to never feel lost, but is different and takes risks in rewarding ways. I play Crosscode, seeing the influences as I pass them, not as mile high markers in the distance. For a 20 dollar investement, you get the game thus far, but also the game that will very soon be. So this isn't so much a review as it is a vote of confience based on what I've played so far. \n\nAs with all early access games, do your homework first, but let me just say, rarely do you meet a dev team this connected to it's fan base. They really want you to know what their doing and seem to respond well to feedback. All in all. Glad to have contriubted.

There's plenty of puzzle-y dungeon goodness and awesome boss fights too. I can't speak for the story yet (still WIP), but the characters thus far are pretty charming, and the world is vibrant and wonderfully animated.\n\nThere's a demo if you wanna get a feel, and it's

This game is packed to the brim with content, great storytelling and writing, really tight controls, and the game just runs very smoothly overall.\n\nThe combat is fantastic.  Action packed and very reactive to your button imputs.  The monsters are simple enough to where it can be pretty easy to learn their \"tells\" to see what attack they're going to do, giving you a chance to react.  But at the same time, they can still be difficult, and even much more so when you have large groups of enemies coming after you at once, it's intense trying to keep up with everything going on and trying to dodge multiple attacks coming from all directions!\n\nThe art's really good, the sounds and music are great.  The game just feels so lively, they really did a good job of putting all these characters who don't do anything but run across the screen, but they feel like actual players in this world.  It's a 2D pixel game that has so much life.\n\nAlso;  optional, boss-version of monsters you can kill for loot.

I joined it at V0.98 and was really annoyed (not in a hateful way, but sort of disappointed / curious) for how the story turns out in V1.0. I don't really play a lot of singleplayer games, but this one totally caught me.\n\nAs many other reviewers said, this really reminds me of the good old days with Secret of Evermore, just a lot more extensive, and the focus seems to be a bit different. I also forced myself not to look anything up on the internet for this game, which drastically enhanced my game experience.\n\nWhat I sort of find hard is the trading system. There are marketplaces everywhere where you can trade items, but I rarely ever find myself knowing what I have to do to get these trading items. I know there's a built in \"encyclopedia\" and stuff, but that's only filled out as you progress. Maybe at some point in the game there could be a library or something like that, something that you don't have on yourself permanently that contains more information. Or NPCs giving you hints when you talk to them where to find certain stuff or where it's rumored to be found, maybe even a rough description, that would be a lot more subtle.\n\nAnyway, I'd give this

There's a lot of them.\n\n\nAlright... time to be verbose.\n\nVersion 0.9.2 ratings in order from a 10-1 scale, 1 being disgusted disappointment and 10 being top-notch approval:\n\u00b7 Gameplay/Combat: 10\n\u00b7 Character Progression: 10*\n\u00b7 Enemies: 9.5* \n\u00b7 Graphics/Effects: 9* (although it would be nice to have the option to use a powerful and possibly blasphemous non-pixelated smooth version)\n\u00b7 Strategy/Skill Level: 8.5*\n\u00b7 Ambience: 8\n\u00b7 Puzzles: 8\n\u00b7 Game Pace: 7**\n\u00b7 Soundtrack: 6*\n\u00b7 Story: 5.5**\n\u00b7 Replayability: 5**\n\u00b7 Ally AI: 5**\n\u00b7 Length: 3**\n\nAt this rate, once version 1.0 comes out, it will have little/no bugs and be truly streamlined and I believe, no doubt, that the game will be at least a 9.8/10. Because of this, I'm waiting to replay until it after v1.0 has been released (Seriously though, I keep having to stop myself from playing it again so I can enjoy the full experience).\n\nEven back at 9.2 (impossible to complete the game at that time hence the poor pace, story, replayability, and length figures) it was still worth buying. I happened to stumble upon this game and it was one of the best buying choices I ever impulsively made. I can't stress enough how much this game is loyal to its classic roots while maintaining a higher modern quality the populous has grown to expect. It is a true tribute to classic SNES ARPGs (The era when RPGs started getting really good) like Secret of Mana, Illusion of Gaia, Secret of Evermore, etc. while being massively better in every way, most notably in equipment, abilities, and combat. The combat and gameplay is addicting, making you really want to kill as many as possible, as quickly as possible, and in the coolest ways possible to achieve the best rewards and that next level so you can do it all oh-so much more effectively. This game inspires you to want to be better and do better, which is not often seen in games. Your level of success depends on your level of effort, just as a true game should be. As you play, it is evident the developers poured so much in this game to strive so hard to make it a fulfilling experience, and they did not disappoint. Having an uncontrollable ally isn't as bad as it seems (especially since the AI improvements), and it makes sense; Everyone but the main character is supposed to be a real person playing this game- outside of the game... you'll understand that more when you play. [b]Personally, I enjoy single-player games and can really appreciate someone making one to simulate (more like parodying) an MMORPG without any of the truly frustrating and tedious aspects an MMORPG has.[/b]\nCrossCode is on my Favorites list, and one I plan on playing multiple times. Just get the game and play it.

Es gibt viele Taktische Elemente wie Blocken und Fernangriffe mit einem Ball der unter anderem auch f\u00fcr viele R\u00e4tsel zu gebrauchen sind. Es gibt sehr viele Schiebe R\u00e4tsel von leicht bis schwer und viele Secrets zu entdecken. \n\n[h1] Einzelspieler: [/h1]\n\nMan Spielt ein M\u00e4dchen Namens Lea was ihren Bruder helfen will, doch pl\u00f6tzlich findet man sich aus irgendeinem bestimmten Grund in einer Art MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) wieder und ist darin gefangen. (Mehr will ich jetzt nicht Spoilern)\n\nMan wird von einem Moderator kurz aufgekl\u00e4rt was man zu tun hat und muss erst einmal die Grundlegenden Sachen erlernen wie man in dieser Welt nun zurechtkommt. Man findet nach kurzer Zeit auch eine Freundin, die auch dieses Game spielt und die sich einem anschlie\u00dft um weiter zu Leveln. Im sp\u00e4teren Spielverlauf kommt noch ein dritter Mitspieler hinzu um euch beizustehen, alle Mitspieler k\u00f6nnen sind Optional und k\u00f6nnen jederzeit ausgeschaltet werden wenn sie einen st\u00f6ren sollten.\n\nMan spielt in Typischer Manier Quests, abholen, abarbeiten und abgeben. Daf\u00fcr bekommt man Geld, Erfahrungspunkte und manchmal n\u00fctzliche Items. In der Umgebung k\u00f6nnen Pflanzen zerst\u00f6rt werden um Rohstoffe zu Farmen und die dann auf verschiedenen M\u00e4rkten gegen N\u00fctzliche Items wie Tr\u00e4nke usw. eingetauscht werden k\u00f6nnen. Durch verdientes Geld k\u00f6nnen Ausr\u00fcstungen gekauft werden oder man tauscht Items die man gesammelt hat auf dem Markt gegen noch besserer R\u00fcstungsteile ein.\n\nDas besiegen von Gegnern bringt einem alle 1000 Erfahrungspunkte eine Level Up ein, was einen st\u00e4rker macht und einem eine Gr\u00f6\u00dfere Spezialleiste verschafft die man im Kampf einsetzten kann.\nDie Spezial angriffe (Melee) werden im Erfahrungsbaum (Skill Tree) freigeschaltet den man selbst beliebig ver\u00e4ndern kann. \n\nEs gibt im Skill Tree 5 verschiedene Elemente die nach und nach freigeschaltet werden, wenn man die Dungeons und ihre End Bosse besiegt hat. Jedes Element hat verschiede F\u00e4higkeiten die wichtig sind um R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen und um Gegner besser oder schlechter zu besiegen.\n\nDie Welt hat sehr verschiedene Areale die alle unterschiedlich aussehen und viele R\u00e4tsel und Secrets versteckt halten. Was die erkundig der Spielwelt wirklich interessant macht.\n\n\n[h1] Mehrspieler [/h1]\n\nEs soll in sp\u00e4teren Versionen noch einen Lokalen Koop Modus dazu kommen, der aber bis jetzt noch nicht vorhanden ist.\n\n\n[h1] Grafik: [/h1]\n\nDie Grafik ist wirklich sehr sch\u00f6n gemacht und erinnert an alte SNES Games wie Terranigma, Illusion of Time und Co..\n\n\n[h1] Musik: [/h1]\n\nDie Musik ist wirklich Super immer sehr passend zum jeweiligen Gebiet oder Dungeon, hier gibt es kein 08/15 Gedudel.\n\n\n[h1] Steuerung: [/h1]\n\nDie Steuerung kann mit einem Gamepad (ich benutzt XBOX360 Gamepad) oder mit Maus und Tastatur gespielt werden. \n\nMit einem Gamepad ist das Spiel viel schwerer, da das zielen sehr oft vorkommt und mit dem Stick \u00f6fter recht ungenau ist bei schnellen Aktionen. Das Wechseln zwischen den verschiedenen Elementen liegt auf dem Digipad was auch nicht so gut auf dem XBOX360 Gamepad funktioniert (was aber die Schuld von Microsoft ist, da das Digipad ja nicht gerade das Beste ist und was ja nicht die Schuld vom Entwickler ist)\n\nWer es schnell und genau haben will sollte zur Maus und Tastatur greifen um gut voran zu kommen.\n(Ich habe zu 98% alles mit Gamepad gespielt und den Rest mit Maus und Tastatur)\n\n[h1] Pro/Contra: [/h1]\n\n+ bis jetzt sch\u00f6ne Geschichte\n+ gute Grafik\n+ sehr guter Soundtrack\n+ sehr gute R\u00e4tsel\n+ gute Steuerung\n+ Super Level design\n+ viele Secrets\n+ anspruchsvolle Quest und Gegner\n+ super Skill Tree\n+ deutsche \u00dcbersetzung (fast komplett)\n\n- etwas lange Einf\u00fchrungsphase circa 1-2 Stunden\n- Quest Level \u00f6fter zu niedrig angesetzt\n- ruckelt bei zu vielen Gegnern\n-  \u00f6ftere Performance Probleme mit Ruckeln\n- zielen mit Gamepad zu ungenau f\u00fcr manche Aktionen\n- kein Cursor Lock (was wirklich sehr schlimm ist, NO GO)\n\n\n[h1] Fazit: [/h1]\n\nBis jetzt ist das Game wirklich gut, und hat sehr viel Spa\u00df gemacht aber auch durch harte Gegner sehr viel Frust bereitet^^. Es spielt sich wie eine Art MMO mit Illusion auf Time vermischt, wo sicherlich noch mehr kommt. Das einzige was am meisten fehlt ist zurzeit Story die aber 2018 noch nachgereicht werden soll. \n\nDie Entwickler sind hier mit der Community auf Du und Du, und arbeiten tatkr\u00e4ftig mit der Community zusammen, man kann \u00dcbersetzungsfehler einschicken und Fehler melden die auch beantwortet werden. Die meisten Fehler halten sich in Grenzen und sind nur Kleinigkeiten die bei der Vollversion sicherlich fast alle weg sein d\u00fcrften.\nMan erlebt selten das Entwickler so nah am Geschehen mit dran sind wie hier. Da es sich um ein kleines Studio handelt die schon ein paar Jahre an diesem Spiel arbeiten l\u00e4uft man hier auch nicht Gefahr das, dass spiel morgen nicht mehr weiter gepatcht wird wie bei so vielen anderen Early Access Games.\n\nIch bin jedenfalls begeistert bis jetzt und habe 58 Spielstunden in alle Hauptquest, Dungeon und fast alle Secrets gesteckt. Ich denke wenn das Spiel fertig wird kann man circa mit doppelt bis sogar der dreifachen Zeit rechnen. Ich denke f\u00fcr ein kleines Studio und der hohen Spielzeit und eine Entwicklungszeit von mehr als 2 Jahren sind 19,99\u20ac noch relativ g\u00fcnstig. (Es gab es auch schon im Angebot auf GOG f\u00fcr circa 12,09\u20ac oder in einem Bundle)\n\n[h1] Zusammengefasst: [/h1]\n\nEinzelspieler: 9/10\nGrafik: 10/10\nMusik: 10/10\nSteuerung: 8/10\n----------------------------\nEarly Access Wertung: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1516956036, "timestamp_updated": 1516956036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634196", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39623562": {"recommendationid": "39623562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048490209", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518216916}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac13\uac13\uac13\uac13\uac13", "timestamp_created": 1516953660, "timestamp_updated": 1516953660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39621208": {"recommendationid": "39621208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115856377", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516080544}, "language": "english", "review": "If I could recommend a game multiple times, it would be this one. I love the artstyle, the music is jamming, and the gameplay itself is a treat! The two temples available in pre-release are really good Zelda-Type ordeals, but with, get this, actually challenging puzzles! But to be fair, one or two dungeon puzzles in the second temple ran a bit sour, but I'd say my point still stands. The characters are also great to be around, and it almost gives off this saturday morning cartoon vibe with the constant bits of witty humor. I also find the combat to be rather fun, involving mixing up ranged and melee attacks constantly, to effectively dispatch enemies. And those enemies aren't slouches either. They're very well capable of taking you out easily, granted, if you're around their level. Same thing goes for the bosses. They're pretty tough as well, with you switching priorities between dodging and hitting their weakspots, as well as making sure your elemental charge doesn't overheat. My personal pick for the best boss thus far, by the way, would be the encounters with apollo, your spheromancer rival. They get seriously tense as his strategies and manuevers get more and more ludicrous as the match goes on. They're a blast.\nSo enough gushing, what do I think of it? It's awesome. That's all I can describe it by, and it's still in early access at the time of writing this, meaning that it's story hasn't been fully implemented yet. I'd say that this game is seriously worth the 20 or so bucks you sink in, even in early access. As for me, I'll just sit here, waiting for the full release.

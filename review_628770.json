It references classics like Secret of Mana heavily, but manages to maintain its own character in spite of that.\n\nMechanically, it's generally very straightforward - you choose a starting Job, which gives you a skillset you can upgrade as you complete milestones and defeat monsters. If you want (and you'll definitely want to) you can even switch Jobs, keeping all the abilities you've unlocked for use with the new Job. A combo I've really enjoyed is matching Bandit with Budoka to build a tricksy, lightning-fast character who can deal bone-crushing sneak attacks. \n\nThe monster design in Tangledeep makes every enemy unique and interesting - most monsters can always pose some kind of threat, whether it's poison, paralysation, or just being absurdly dangerous at one distance or another, and since your resources are extremely limited, you have to think carefully about how you approach each threat.\n\nPossibly the most controversial design choice is non-recovering resources - most roguelikes let you regain HP, Stamina etc. over time, but in Tangledeep, the only way you get those resources back is by killing monsters or using items. Some players may find this stressful, but it forms an incentive to keep pushing forward, be smart with your skills and make good use of the cooking system, which is robust and forms a keystone of survival in Tangledeep.\n\nThere are some meta-progression elements in the game, as is common for many roguelikes these days, but nothing that I would say would ever make a win guaranteed in the end - there's persistent item / gold storage, pet rearing and an orchard for growing food and cash, but none of this can be a substitute for good play.\n\nI'm excited to see this project continue to develop, and with any luck it'll eventually enter the roguelike cannon as one of the great examples of the genre!", "timestamp_created": 1518956122, "timestamp_updated": 1518956122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40180193": {"recommendationid": "40180193", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989591657", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 50, "last_played": 1520823715}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has been really great.

Zosta\u0142a wydana jako gra Early Access a swoje pocz\u0105tki mia\u0142a na Kickstarterze gdzie prowadzona kampania pozwoli\u0142a uzyska\u0107 niemal dwukrotno\u015b\u0107 zak\u0142adanego pierwotnie bud\u017cetu. W grze za zadanie mamy wydosta\u0107 si\u0119 z podziemnej wioski i sprawdzi\u0107 co kryje si\u0119 ponad nami, kieruj\u0105c si\u0119 stale ku powierzchni. W tym celu musimy nauczy\u0107 si\u0119 efektywnie walczy\u0107, pozna\u0107 s\u0142abe strony przeciwnik\u00f3w a tak\u017ce wyuczy\u0107 r\u00f3\u017cnych umiej\u0119tno\u015bci, kt\u00f3re odpowiednio u\u017cyte zwi\u0119ksz\u0105 nasz\u0105 przewag\u0119 w trakcie star\u0107.\n\n\n=== GRAFIKA I MUZYKA ===\nGrafika jest wzorowana w stylu retro 16-bit i pr\u00f3cz rozpikselowanej mapy wygl\u0105da ca\u0142kiem przyzwoicie. Widok planszy oraz przeciwnik\u00f3w jest przedstawiony w lekkim rzucie izometrycznym. W razie konieczno\u015bci mo\u017cemy w menu w\u0142\u0105czy\u0107 tak\u017ce stylowe skanowanie rastrowe (scanline) dzi\u0119ki czemu wy\u015bwietlany obraz upodobni si\u0119 do starych wy\u015bwietlaczy.

Teren oraz przeciwnicy wygl\u0105da j\u0105 schludnie i nie ma problem\u00f3w z interpretacj\u0105 na czym stoimy czy te\u017c z czym walczymy. Posta\u0107 jak i wrogowie s\u0105 z lekka animowane (kilka klatek), podobnie jak i wykonywane akcje.\nOprawa d\u017awi\u0119kowa stoi na przyzwoitym poziomie \u2013 dodatkowo w grze przygrywa nienu\u017c\u0105ca muzyka (kt\u00f3r\u0105 oczywi\u015bcie mo\u017cna w razie konieczno\u015bci wyciszy\u0107).\n\n\n=== ROZGRYWKA ===\n=== Cel gry ===\nRozpoczynamy w podziemnej wiosce a naszym zadaniem jest sprawdzi\u0107 co znajduje si\u0119 ponad nami, kieruj\u0105c si\u0119 ku powierzchni. W tym celu gra powoli zapoznaje nas z dost\u0119pnym asortymentem oraz uczy nas radzenia sobie z ekwipunkiem. Stopniowo, poziom po poziomie b\u0119dziemy pi\u0105\u0107 si\u0119 coraz wy\u017cej.\n \n\n=== Trudno\u015b\u0107 rozgrywki ===\nGra ma trzy poziomy trudno\u015bci, wybierane na starcie przy tworzeniu postaci:\n- naj\u0142atwiejszy (Adventure Mode) \u2013 gdzie gin\u0105c odrodzimy si\u0119 w wiosce trac\u0105c nieco przenoszonego z\u0142ota, do\u015bwiadczenia oraz JP (job points). Przedmiot\u00f3w nie tracimy\n- normalny (Heroic Mode) \u2013 gin\u0105c tracimy ca\u0142y ekwipunek\n- permadeath (Hardcore Mode) \u2013 \u015bmier\u0107 oznacza koniec rozgrywki. Przegrana usuwa tak\u017ce save.\n \n\n=== Tutorial (samouczek) ===\nSam w sobie nie istnieje jako odr\u0119bne wprowadzenie. Z zasadami rozgrywki oraz nowymi rzeczami jeste\u015bmy zaznajamiani w trakcie naszej podr\u00f3\u017cy. Dlatego te\u017c pocz\u0105tek zajmie ci nieco wi\u0119cej czasu poniewa\u017c trzeba nieco poczyta\u0107 i zapozna\u0107 si\u0119 z opisami dost\u0119pnych mo\u017cliwo\u015bci.\n\n\n=== Sterowanie ===\nNasz\u0105 posta\u0107 mo\u017cemy sterowa\u0107 u\u017cywaj\u0105c jedynie myszki ale wygodniejszym rozwi\u0105zaniem jest drugi z system\u00f3w sterowania gdzie mo\u017cemy u\u017cywa\u0107 zar\u00f3wno myszy jak i klawiatury. W tym wypadku klawiatura numeryczna s\u0142u\u017cy nam za wskazywanie postaci w kt\u00f3rym kierunku mo\u017ce si\u0119 przemie\u015bci\u0107. Ja w trakcie rozgrywki prawie nie u\u017cywa\u0142em myszki, znacznie wygodniej u\u017cywa\u0142o mi si\u0119 klawiatury. I kilka zasad:\nUk\u0142ad klawiszy mo\u017cesz przypisa\u0107 w menu samodzielnie\nSpacja powoduje pomini\u0119cie tury ruchu. Przydatne by poczeka\u0107 a\u017c przeciwnik wejdzie w nasze pole ra\u017cenia.\n \n\n=== Pocz\u0105tki gry ===\nNa pocz\u0105tku rozgrywki nie jest a\u017c tak trudno poniewa\u017c przeciwnicy nie s\u0105 a\u017c tak wymagaj\u0105cy. Poziom trudno\u015bci nieco wzrasta gdy zaczniemy si\u0119 zag\u0142\u0119bia\u0107 pod\u0105\u017caj\u0105c ku dalszym poziomom. Warto si\u0119 przygotowa\u0107 i mie\u0107 zawsze w zapasie nieco po\u017cywienia by m\u00f3c w razie potrzeby odzyska\u0107 nieco zdrowia. Dlatego te\u017c nie warto sprzedawa\u0107 specyfik\u00f3w odzyskuj\u0105cych \u017cycie poniewa\u017c przydadz\u0105 ci si\u0119 w dalszej podr\u00f3\u017cy.\n\nWraz z kolejnymi stoczonymi walkami pozyskasz nieco drop\u00f3w tak wi\u0119c b\u0119dziesz m\u00f3g\u0142 je spieni\u0119\u017cy\u0107 i tym samym zarobi\u0107 troch\u0119 grosza, Polecam zakup dobrego \u0142uku (zasi\u0119g 4 p\u00f3l) co pozwoli atakowa\u0107 przeciwnik\u00f3w z oddali. Nim ci zbli\u017c\u0105 si\u0119 do nas strac\u0105 ju\u017c nieco zdrowia.\n\nNieco denerwuj\u0105ce jest rozwi\u0105zanie tycz\u0105ce si\u0119 dodatkowego ekwipunku \u2013 dla przyk\u0142adu mamy cztery sloty na bro\u0144 za\u015b je\u015bli posiadamy w nich miecz oraz \u0142uk to w ekwipunku mo\u017cemy mie\u0107 tarcz\u0119 (u\u017cywana gdy dzier\u017cymy miecz) lub ko\u0142czan ze strza\u0142ami (je\u015bli trzymamy \u0142uk). Tym samym trzeba uwa\u017ca\u0107 by\u015bmy nie sprzedali jednego z nich w sklepie poniewa\u017c je\u015bli nie jest u\u017cywany, przechowywany jest w plecaku i trzeba na to uwa\u017ca\u0107 by przypadkiem tego nie opchn\u0105\u0107 handlarzowi przy pozbywaniu si\u0119 zdobytych grat\u00f3w (co mi si\u0119 ju\u017c zdarzy\u0142o). Odkupienie naszego przedmiotu rzecz jasna jest nieco dro\u017csze ni\u017c jego sprzeda\u017c.\n\nJe\u015bli mowa o samym wprowadzeniu gracza w arkana rozgrywki to zosta\u0142o to rozwi\u0105zane dosy\u0107 dobrze. Co prawda to jak dzia\u0142a cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 rzeczy oraz w jaki spos\u00f3b w\u0142a\u015bciwie z nich korzysta\u0107 zrozumia\u0142em nieco p\u00f3\u017aniej. Trzeba uwa\u017cnie czyta\u0107 kolejne przedstawiane porady \u2013 lub zapozna\u0107 si\u0119 z poradnikiem, kt\u00f3ry zapewne stworz\u0119 po przej\u015bciu gry.\n\n\n=== Rozw\u00f3j postaci ===\nJak ka\u017cda gra RPG tak i tutaj wraz z pozyskiwaniem punkt\u00f3w do\u015bwiadczenia otrzymamy do dyspozycji mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 wyboru pewnych umiej\u0119tno\u015bci i ukszta\u0142towania swojego dalszego rozwoju. Przede wszystkim wszystko kszta\u0142tuje wyb\u00f3r bohatera na starcie gry \u2013 ka\u017cdym gra si\u0119 nieco inaczej, ka\u017cdy z nich posiada nieco inne drzewko umiej\u0119tno\u015bci  i to wg tych wybor\u00f3w b\u0119dziemy j\u0105 prowadzi\u0107.\nWraz z pokonywaniem kolejnym wrog\u00f3w b\u0119dziemy pozyskiwa\u0107 pieni\u0105dze, do\u015bwiadczenie (XP) oraz \u201ejednostki pracy\u201d (Job Points).\nDo\u015bwiadczenie podbija nasz poziom. Skok o poziom to podbicie bazowych parametr\u00f3w postaci (\u017cycie, stamina itp.) Nie mamy wp\u0142ywu na rozdzia\u0142 tych punkt\u00f3w.\nJob Points pozwalaj\u0105 na zakup (nauk\u0119) umiej\u0119tno\u015bci specjalnych \u2013 wybieramy jedn\u0105 z dost\u0119pnych. Wy\u017cszy poziom zaawansowania to niestety konieczno\u015b\u0107 zapewnienia wi\u0119kszej ich ilo\u015bci. Dziel\u0105 si\u0119 one na pasywne (dzia\u0142aj\u0105ce stale / samodzielnie) b\u0105d\u017a aktywne \u2013 gdzie musimy p\u0142aci\u0107 energi\u0105 czy te\u017c wytrzyma\u0142o\u015bci\u0105 (stamina) za ich u\u017cycie.\n\nWi\u0119cej (+nieco porad) w moim opisie:\nhttp://hakimodo.pl/2018/02/14/tangledeep-rpg-w-starym-stylu-lecz-w-nowym-wydaniu/", "timestamp_created": 1518605373, "timestamp_updated": 1518605373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40059543": {"recommendationid": "40059543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083465111", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1521072358}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful visuals and sound for this fun roguelike.

I must admit is kind of generic when compared to classic & standard rogue-likes, but what misses in depth it earns in presentation and addictive gameplay. The game is rich in modes so it can be both hardcore and kind-of-casual friendly. I was following this game since the early stages of development and only bought it when it reached state 1.0 just to make sure I wasnt missing any parts of it. I believe I was correct. The game as of now is a coherent and engaging experience. Bit hard for the newcomers in terms of difficulty but at the same time very beginner friendly in terms of game mechanics. It allows you a free form of advancement, by using storage for gold and items for your upcoming runs. Mind that it is not forgiving even if the map tells you its an easy or even a mediocre challenge. Dont get fooled! Its a setup! All classic hardcore difficulty lies underneath a well organised and presented \"easy\" approach. Also consider a great depth of replaybility since it offers smart ways of extending gameplay rules and conditions by adding random elements (quests, secrets, multiple roots to continue exploring etc). Invest safely here. The game deserves all the love it gets. With an obvious classic personality but at the same time a modern and free-form approach this little gem has it all.

Set in a verdant and magical underground world full of weird creatures and talking animals, you must roam through Tangledeep: a route to the surface through procedural maze levels.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon crawler it is quite challenging, especially on heroic and hardcore modes, where permadeath resets the character, or all progress (hardcore). There is also the adventure mode for more roguelite casual play, though some roguelike enthusiasts might say the inclusion of this mode makes the game more of a roguelite.\n\nInfluenced by roguelikes such as Tales of Maj\u2019Eyal and Dungeonmans, Tangledeep may not be as full-on hardcore as those games, but then it doesn\u2019t have to be, aimed as it is at a broader audience with the nostalgic SNES aesthetic. It\u2019s an accessible roguelike rather than a roguelite, delivering a full experience beyond the challenge for challenge\u2019s sake.\n\n[url=http://backlogcritic.com/all-review-list/tangledeep-review/]Keep reading...[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1518320280, "timestamp_updated": 1518324579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615046", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39991354": {"recommendationid": "39991354", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996799584", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518670201}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun roguelike with RPG elements and a visual and audio style that is very reminiscent to old SNES RPG games.\n\nSpecially when learning the game runs tend to be quick (at least playing in 'normal' difficulty) which give the game the typical 'one-more-run' character.", "timestamp_created": 1518314837, "timestamp_updated": 1518314837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39979113": {"recommendationid": "39979113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190332871", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 248, "last_played": 1520720479}, "language": "english", "review": "alright this is actually a veryyyy good game and stuff. im pretty sure theres a few bugs here and ther but lik otherwise vewy good\n\n\nedit: ok now after this new patch most of the bugs are gone so thats pretty nice. also fuck bandits.", "timestamp_created": 1518275614, "timestamp_updated": 1518394180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39970712": {"recommendationid": "39970712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004130416", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1521434934}, "language": "english", "review": "A very nice little roguelike game with some compelling cross-genre features.

r\u00e9ussissent: au niveau de la rejouabilit\u00e9. Tout l'int\u00e9r\u00eat d'une \"run\" de Binding of Isaac ou de FTL par exemple, c'est de r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 s'adapter aux outils que le jeu nous donne. L'approche de Tangledeep est compl\u00e8tement invers\u00e9e et c'est le d\u00e9faut majeur du jeu: le joueur choisit un \"build\" au d\u00e9but du jeu, doit s'y tenir, et il n'a plus qu'\u00e0 prier/grind pour avoir les bons objets qui vont avec. Deux runs sur Tangledeep avec le m\u00eame personnage seront quasiment similaires, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 10 runs avec le m\u00eame vaisseau sur FTL seront toutes compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rentes par exemple.\n\nTangledeep \u00e9choue aussi au niveau de l'aspect strat\u00e9gique: on fait attention \u00e0 son placement pendant les premiers niveaux, mais les monstres gagnent tr\u00e8s vite des capacit\u00e9s de d\u00e9placement qui rendent caduque tout travail de positionnement. Certains monstres invoquent m\u00eame des tornades qui se d\u00e9placent de mani\u00e8re compl\u00e8tement al\u00e9atoire et attirent p\u00e9riodiquement le joueur au centre, sans aucun contre possible. Les combats deviennent rapidement des stats-check o\u00f9 on spam les sorts et les consommables en esp\u00e9rant survivre.\n\nEt justement, si le jeu se veut difficile, c'est avant tout parce qu'il est extr\u00eamement mal \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 avec des pics de difficult\u00e9 ridicules. Le jeu limite fortement la r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de sant\u00e9, et comme les classes corps-\u00e0-corps disposent de peu de moyens de gagner en r\u00e9sistance, elles sont compl\u00e8tement inutiles par rapport aux classes \u00e0 distance qui peuvent hit & run. Les monstres \u00e9lites commencent rapidement \u00e0 taper dans les 20-25% de vie max par tour, et la plupart de leurs bonus se limitent \u00e0 \"fait tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s mal\" de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res, sans moyen de jouer autour.\n\nLe jeu se vante aussi de disposer de beaucoup de m\u00e9canismes de progression, mais la plupart sont compl\u00e8tement inutiles. Il est par exemple possible de capturer et d'\u00e9lever des monstres pour aider au combat, mais ils ne peuvent pas gagner de niveaux et demandent beaucoup trop de temps et de ressource \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00eat au combat. Il y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de nourritures diff\u00e9rentes, mais comme on ne peut en prendre que tout les X tours, tout celles qui ne rendent pas de vie deviennent inutiles.

Reminiscent of [i]Rogue[/i], [i]Nethack[/i], and other early turn-based, dungeon-crawling RPGs, the game leavens the infamous difficulty of the genre by doing away with most of the complexities and vagaries of its predecessors, as well as by adopting the common \u201crogue-lite\u201d element of persistent progress.\n \nOn the default difficulty of the game, you can pass on items and gold, among other things, to future characters after your current character meets her grisly fate at the claws of the strange creatures of Tangledeep.  There is an easier mode that allows you to continue playing the same character after you die, and a hardcore mode that deletes your progress entirely.  One of the highlights of the game is its dynamic job system, which allows you to switch between classes on a single character in order to mix and match acquired skills and abilities to create a customizable fighter.  I was reminded of [i]Final Fantasy V[/i], which for me was a good thing.  Unfortunately, that was probably the high point of my experience. \n\nThe main problem with [i]Tangledeep[/i] is that there\u2019s just not very much here. As is my policy, I selected the hardest difficulty upon starting the game\u2014hardcore mode. I expected to die a few times, but I was well aware of the inherent danger of roguelikes (especially roguelite variants).  They tend to be content light, depending on the player to die repeatedly in order to artificially extend the game\u2019s experience.  I didn\u2019t want to trivialize the game too quickly.  Unfortunately, I just ended up beating the game on my first try. Sick brags; the end. \n\n. . . In all seriousness, though, [i]Tangledeep[/i] somehow fails to justify the existence of its own mechanics.  For example, there is a Monster Pen where you are able to keep captive monsters and breed them in order to make monster companions to accompany you on your adventures (something like [i]Dragon Quest Monsters[/i]).  After a few feeble attempts at feeding the two pathetic monsters I captured, I just gave up on it.  I had no real need for a monster companion, and the entire system was just anemic and . . . well, not fun.  I haven\u2019t tried New Game + (and don\u2019t intend to), but I don\u2019t see things suddenly improving the second time around.\n\nBy the way, you may have noticed I keep referring to older games in this review.  That\u2019s not a coincidence\u2014there\u2019s really not a single original idea in this entire game.  It just takes a bunch of things that have been done before and mashes them together.  Sometimes, that can be novel in and of itself, but in this case it\u2019s just a hot mess. Nothing really works together and I\u2019m not sure what the vision was. \n\nMuch of the excitement of customizing your character is ruined when things don\u2019t work due to hidden information or bugs.  At one point, I picked up a passive skill from the Claw mastery category for my fist-fighting character.  The skill purported to make me immune to paralysis and attack down effects, something I was sorely missing.  Within two minutes, I got paralyzed by the first monster I encountered.  Nowhere in the skill description did it tell me that this passive only worked with claws (which is what I assume to be the case; I didn\u2019t test it), but similar passives are very specific in telling you that they only work with a certain weapon type.  It\u2019s just inconsistent, as if no one really bothered to test anything about the game. \n\nThe interface is a bit wonky\u2014nothing terrible, but not as polished as it should be.  Perhaps the worst part is that you only get two hotbars to switch between for your skills, despite the fact that you could easily acquire tons of skills.  If you want to use anything more than what you have available on your hotbar, you have to stop the action to choose your skills manually from a menu.  Why?\n\nThe items are 99 percent worthless, and yet they keep dropping without end, just cluttering up your screen.  The absolute worst is the food\u2014if you are taking the game at all seriously and playing safely, you will quickly realize that you can very rarely use any kind of food that doesn\u2019t heal you, because there is a shared cooldown.  You simply can\u2019t afford the risk of getting caught out without being able to use food to heal yourself. \n\nPerhaps among the worst disappointments of the game are the bosses.  Roguelike bosses always tend to be a bit generic, as designers shy away from ending the player\u2019s run due to an unexpected quirk, but these are as vanilla as they come.  I literally walked up to the final boss and punched it until it died.  Probably the easiest part of the game.\n\nThanks for sticking with me through this rambling tale.  Ultimately, there is no real depth or difficulty to [i]Tangledeep[/i].  If you play patiently and can endure the tedium, you will eventually win the game.  Unfortunately, you\u2019ll feel like you lost\u2014your investment of time, money, and tolerance washed down the drain.", "timestamp_created": 1518171937, "timestamp_updated": 1518293430, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641465", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39948043": {"recommendationid": "39948043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070644099", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519914822}, "language": "english", "review": "Tangledeep is a great game.

It looked like a pretty typical, dime-a-dozen roguelike at first glance, but after playing it for an hour or two, I was overwhelmed by the sheer joy the game has to offer. \n\nTangledeep has a wonderfully nostalgic feel about it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its own personality. The music and art style will immediately throw you back into the classic SNES era, with character art reminiscent of Secret of Mana and music with that same familiarity, though like I said before, it also manages to maintain its own identity and create a nice, fairly relaxing (apart from the, y'know, you die, you're dead) atmosphere.\n\nThe gameplay is straight forward and I don't think I need explain much about it. It's a tile based system with actual animations so everything feels a bit more alive. You can use a controller or mouse and keyboard, though I haven't played it with a controller. Mouse and keyboard controls perfectly. \n\nThe game has a total of twelve jobs (or classes) with the ability to switch jobs on the fly via consumable or by talking to an NPC at the Riverstone Camp, which serves as the world's hub. Each job offers unique skills and passive abilities you can equip at any time as long as you've unlocked them by spending JP (Job points). You'll have to actually play each job to unlock those skills though, as JP is unique to each. You'll get access to four passive slots and sixteen skill slots through two hotbars you can switch to at any time so there's plenty of character customization. Oh, and each weapon type also has skills that you can unlock for another layer of character building fun!\n\nTangledeep offers three difficulty settings, the easiest letting you just teleport back to camp when you die, the medium difficulty letting you keep any items you stored in camp and pets you've raised (I haven't explored the feature much, but it's there), and the hardest being TRU RAGU LYK.\n\nIt does have some flaws, however. At times, I found myself having to grind up a bit using the Dreamcaster, which creates a randomized dungeon from a piece of equipment. This allows you to upgrade your gear (but you won't be able to use this gear while in the item's \"dream\"). Unfortunately, if you find yourself overwhelmed in the dream and you manage to make it out, there's no way of ending that dream prematurely (except for an item you find IN the dream, which you'll lose if you teleport out). If you are having troubles in the main dungeon AND the dream dungeon, this could lead to some frustration. As I said before though, sometimes floors jump in difficulty, usually after a boss fight where you are generally starting to feel pretty confident. It's not a huge deal, and it's just a part of the game, but it is pretty unexpected to \ngo from facetanking a boss and killing it in three or four turns to not being unable to move because Venosaur and his fifteen babies, his best friend Charizard the flamethrowing champion lizard, and a floating jewelery box all decided that it was just your time to go. But that might have just been bad luck.\n\nThere's also little things that could be improved upon, like when selling multiple items to a merchant, the sell window will close and you'll have to select the quantity that you want to sell. This is annoying if you have a lot of items. \n\nUnfortunately, Tangledeep also suffers from a few balance issues with ranged characters being arguably stronger than melee characters, but as far as I know, the developers are already working on those. \n\nOverall, I have really enjoyed my time with Tangledeep. It has a lot of content to enjoy for $14.99 and I would most certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys roguelikes or roguelites, or even anyone who just likes RPGs in general.

A unique set of classes combine to make this a must have game for dungeon crawler enthusiasts.\n\n[h1]Game Breakdown[/h1]\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\nTangledeep shares many of its gameplay systems with other roguelikes. The player picks up new equipment in a dungeon, one\u2019s character becomes more powerful with a level up system, and the player\u2019s goal is to reach the end of some great dungeon system. Tangledeep changes how many of these core systems work. \nThe equipment system has been reworked so that your character has a main hand weapon, an offhand weapon, an armor slot, and two accessories. What makes this system interesting is that the armor and accessories are often found with a passive ability. These abilities feel powerful and I had difficulty deciding which one to choose. Tangledeep wants the player to adapt to the situation and change equipment as much as necessary. For this reason the player character is given a limitless inventory and four weapon slots which gives the player the chance to change weapons without requiring a turn. This creates a strategic layer to equipment that I have never seen before and is a great addition to the genre; no more set and forget equipment here!\n\nAs for the classes, they are enjoyable and unique. You choose one of nine initially unlocked classes with three yet to be unlocked. Every class feels unique and the level up system has a surprising twist. When you level up you only gain extra points in the five main stats. To gain skills you must first kill monsters to gain job points. Job points can then be used as a currency to buy your classes abilities from the \u201cLearn Abilities\u201d menu. The unique aspect of this system is that bought skills can be used if when you change classes. Changing classes is in fact encouraged as changing classes is incredibly cheap and the job change scroll is decently easy to find.\n\nFinally, moving between floors is changed too. Other than moving upwards instead of downwards, players are given the chance to go up a second flight of stairs which can contain anything from a difficult maze with tons of loot, to an apple orchard with bunches of bananas strewn about. These are completely optional but end up being rewarding to complete.\nOverall, Tangledeep on the surface uses every system from its predecessors and twists them all around to create something incredibly fun that we haven\u2019t seen before.\n\n[u]Story:[/u]\nTangledeep has a decent story that most importantly doesn\u2019t get in the way of dungeon diving. The player is introduced to the world in a short cutscene after you start the game. You are then able to freely explore the starting area where you will meet the many characters who will work as quest givers and shop keepers. You get new bits of lore as you meet and defeat bosses, but otherwise you are left to defeat every monster you come across.\n\n[u]Sound:[/u]\nThe sound design in this game is as good as other roguelikes but it doesn\u2019t excel in this area. Impacts of weapon hits are decent and spells have good audio but nothing that ever wowed me. \n\n [u]Music:[/u]\nThe music is exceptional in this title. It perfectly matches the mysterious forest feel that the game\u2019s great graphics help to create. The sounds used to create the music are also of the SNES era, which is the era the developer attempted to capture in this game. I would say they had a great success. The music is on par with the classics of the genre such as Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana. It adds so much ambience and energy to your adventure that it felt like a great piece of a great game instead of a burden. \n\n [u]Graphics:[/u]\nThe SNES era pixel art graphics are amazing. The breathtaking forest and waterfalls, the well animated characters with fluid cape movement, and lively monsters all make Tangledeep\u2019s world feel full of life and vitality. This can be hard to create in the pixel art, but the developer pulled it off spectacularly. \t\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[u]Pros:[/u]\nAmazing Pixel Art\nGreat Twist on the roguelike genre\nEvery turn feels like it matters\nCooking is pretty fun\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\nInventory management can be a pain\nHuge difficulty spikes\n\n[u]Rating[/u]\n[b]8/10[/b].\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1518060557, "timestamp_updated": 1518060557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654654", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39918980": {"recommendationid": "39918980", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970683872", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518029615}, "language": "english", "review": "Although its easy to see the care put in there is something missing for me.

feel it was worth the price point it was sold at.\n\nIn future updates I will reconsider changing this when it meets certain criteria.\n\nHopefully the developers will go the way Tales of Maj'eyal did and NOT the way magicite & roguelands did which were one time releases and no longer updated.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Difficulty scaling\n\nThis is really good for a game released in recent times devs are making games way too easy to accodamate casual player instead of having multiple difficulties.\n\n+ Gear-Progression\nI won't spoil too much but this gear has decent gear-progression you'll need it for the post-game stuff (I got 1-shotted in it damage taken: 2,702)\n\n+ Job System & Weapon System\nUnique way of having classes thouroghly enjoyed being able to swap after I maxed a class truly a godsend to min-maxers. \n\nNot limiting weapons to certain classes is A+ I hate not being able to equip certain things due to class/race restrictions.\n\n+ No crashes or Bugs Experienced in my playthrough\nExtremely rare for indie games as they tend to cut corners.\n\n+ Graphics & Animation wise looks good for what type of game it is.\nIf you compare this game to Tales of Maj'eyal you can see it looks far better and plays smoother.\n\nCons:\n\n- Achievements are lacking (Suggested names in parentheses)\nOnly 12 achivements in 6 hours of play I was able to 50% of the achivements of this game [I beat heroic difficulty]\n\nNo acievement on reaching Max Level (Capped!), Taking Damage that exceeds your max HP (1-shotted), Achieved + (Upgrade a gear!), Achieved +++ (Over Geared) on every equipped item, Killed a Nightmare Prince (Risk vs Reward)\n\n- Lacks community engagement \nTales of Mej'eyal allows you to chat with other players, link your items, view other players characters this would be a great addition to this game.\n\nExample found here:\nhttps://te4.org/characters/196851/tome/0effa33d-ef28-4be3-bf68-916d8e961062\n\n- Frustrating spawning mechanic the monsters respawn until you reach the final areas of the game or enter a side-zone\n\nIt doesn't make much sense why mobs would respawn full clearing feels satifying taking this away is strange. If you want infinite grinding in this game have it in dream zone to upgrade gear.\n\n- Infinite Inventory\nHow does one girl carry so much stuff in her backpack?\n\nI know it's a fantasy game but some sort of limiter is needed for balance issues.\n\n- Clunky Scrolling (unsure if it was only me or if everyone is affected)\nYou have to manually click and drag the scroll bar\n\n- Not enough gear slots\nCurrently only 1 Weapon Slot, 1 Off-Hand Slot, 1 Amor slot, 2x Accesory slots exist.\n\nI'd like to see a gloves, boots, helmet, ring, ring, necklace slots to be added\n\nFeels strange having 2 helmets equipped how is this possible?\n\n- Swapping Weapon slots doesn't consume a turn but equipped an item does?\nDo weapons magically appear from her backpack into her hand and vice versa.\n\n- If you die in New Game+ you are given the option to remake the same characters in New Game+\nYou will not be able to get past the first monster they deal 210 damage your base HP pool is 100-200 dependiing on what job you chose.", "timestamp_created": 1518017057, "timestamp_updated": 1518017057, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463150", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39904791": {"recommendationid": "39904791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163394457", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518574364}, "language": "english", "review": "A good roguelike that imitates the features of many of the rpg classics.

A death in heroic mode is expensive, but allows you to keep anything you didn't take into the dungeon.\n\nHardcore mode is only for those willing to plan every step in advance and who won't cry at losing hours of progress.

The game will be easy to get you comfortable, but the game will challenge you greatly and you will feel fufilled after completing the challenges (after a few deaths).\n[*] This game employs the Keep-It-Simple-Stupid system very well. The game mechanics and ability descriptions are easy to understand, letting the player play the game with full confidence in what they are doing.\n[*] The graphics and music are pleasing upon first exposure, and a work of art upon further inspection.\n[*] Fun, cute, and lighthearted sense of humor that plays off of other roguelikes and \"geek references\" (I'm sorry for making you cringe). This game will make you smile when you least expect it.\n[/list]\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n[list]\n[*] The game seems a bit short, the pricetag may be too steep for some buyers. If that is the case, wait for a steam sale, because this game is worth it.\n[*] The game has some minor UI polishing to do that makes the game sometimes feel slightly awkward.\n[*] The story for the game is minimal to moderate, the game is more focused on the roguelike experience than story.

Graphics - To get this out of the way, I personally like the art style to this so theres not much else to say \n\n2. Bestiary - I love it when a game comes with a bestiary, expecially ones that add more in depth descriptions as you kill the enemy more, expecially useful when your asked to kill an enemy and cant remember what that enemy was\n\n3. Item deams - This is an expecially nice part of the game, the basics are you get sent into a level and you climb a few floors eventually beating the boss, then you get an upgraded item with potantially new stats / abilities, as well as being stronger.\n\n4. Gameplay - This one is a pro and con situation, the combat and general style of gameplay I personally like but as explained in the con section there are some parts of it which are a pain in the rear, the gameplay is grid based, you move then the enemy moves, some skills bypassing the turns so if your not into turn based games then might want to step aside\n\n5. Class Variety - There's a total of 12 classes in game, 3 being unlockable throughout the game, as well as skills gained for each weapon in the game each having their own ultimate each class has its own abilities but there's not that much in terms of animation for these which is a shame\n\n\nCons - \n\n1. Pet System - The pet system in the game is a pain in the rear, your pets dont lvl with you so thats a big nono you also cant use a pet you caught until you get them to a certain likeness such as level 6 likeness, also it costs quite allot of food to raise this which is already scarce, in all this is a pretty useless system as by the time you can use your pet its already underleveled for the part your in luckily theres an insurance system which gives your pet an extra life essentially.\n\n2. All female characters - not a con for me but every character is gender locked and only female which might be a problem for some people\n\n3. Sprites - The ingame sprites have very few animation changes, and sprites are reused fairly often the character sprites are the same, ranged attacks and melee attacks are no different, if you equip a melee weapon and no ranged weapon lets say the archer, there's no sprite change which is a small nitpick I know but its still something you notice\n\n4. Dream difficulty - So you can upgrade items by entering dreams, well dont take the difficulty rating seriously sometimes it'll say very easy and yet at the end your put up against 2 *Very hard* ranked champion enemies\n\n5. Healing - There's no healing spells in game and you can only heal via food or a potion that you find refills for in the dungeon, however as a melee user you'll burn through these very fast, so currently playing as a melee is to say in the least, not as easy as all the other classes you can also heal at town by paying a healer but you need to wait a while, as for a long time after, the price skyrockets making it not very useful, expecially when your trying to keep some money for food which is bought from a merchant that once again takes quite a while to restock and not much at that\n\n\n\nOverall the game can get frustrating, most of it was likely due to me playing as permadeath so it made the negatives stand out more, though it does say permadeath is as the game intended so I based the judgement on this yet all in all it is a good game that is fairly difficult if you prepare well enough most situations aren't that hard", "timestamp_created": 1517860376, "timestamp_updated": 1517938850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39872234": {"recommendationid": "39872234", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998919486", "num_games_owned": 681, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517854104}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun, interesting classes/jobs, can mix them up with the job change function.

Tangledeep's control flow and move rotation isn't trivial once you start getting stronger, but it's approachable enough that you can play it on a regular controller and still feel like you're a pro.\n\nAdditionally, Adventure mode lets you have a very difficult game without the insane punishment of having to start over and weigh insane risk in every encounter. You can get your teeth kicked in by a procedural death trap you just needed 2 extra turns to outsmart, take a deep breath, and head back in to try again. It's great!\n\nThe art is so insanely well done, and the OST is probably one of if not the best game OST of this genre.\n\nThat gets into what bothers me, typically, about retro games. Usually, indie game developers make retro games with the purpose in mind to capture a nostalgic feeling from an older time. They'll study the art, the music, the game design philosophies, and they'll replicate. That's kind of why I hate them; they definitionally add nothing new, and without the original expression of art those old games were trying to convey, the experience ends up this sort of empty shell.\n\nTo me, Tangledeep ranks right up with games like Shovel Knight for \"games that do retro correctly\". The idea is to use the magical feeling of an older aesthetic as a baseline to build new ideas on top of, not just to take a piece of history and copy it. And Tangledeep does that really well, for a few different reasons:\n\n-Art. Tangledeep has beautiful 16-bit style pixel art. And yet, there's an element of modern touch to it, an extreme refinement that comes from people who are improving on the past, not mirroring it. The sprite sheets are thorough, the animations are crisp, clear, and elaborate. The environments are incredibly detailed. Seriously, stop and look at the waterfall in Riverstone Camp some time, and think about the last time you saw something like that in a retro game.\n\n-Music. Tangledeep's soundtrack is an amalgamation of influences from Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana, and all kinds of other stuff. But the music is as much written by Zircon (Andrew Aversa) as it is written by those influences. His own melodic and harmonic voice that you hear in his EDM discography comes through the Tangledeep soundtrack. The music is comprised of very interesting and memorable compositions written by someone who grew up on amazing video game soundtracks, and does not at all sound like some chump in Fruity Loops trying to copy Nobuo or Kikuta (and no reason to, since Kikuta himself did a track here!). It really is amazing, and as deep as the game feels, the soundtrack quality is right there with it.\n\n-Dialog. The dialog is bonkers. It's so witty and funny, and every NPC has some charming personality to them. Once the story kicks in later in the game, those personalities are really fleshed out every step of the way. It's not self indulgently high fantasy at all, and I really appreciate that. Nothing is worse than dry lore.\n\n-Game mechanics. As I mentioned earlier, Tangledeep's control flow is great. So great, that even as a Roguelike, you can play it smooth as butter on a regular controller. Once you get the button shortcuts to access your skills into your fingers (which for me, happened by the end of the first level), you can really get into a rhythm fighting your way through the dungeons without fumbling around. It's very difficult, but so far I've been able to use my head to get out of most situations. The game is surprisingly balanced and well thought out in its skill trees and enemy stat scaling. The change jobs thing is freaking amazing, and mixing different class playstyles together really goes beyond what old SNES RPG's ever accomplished (even beyond what modern MMO's are trying to do successfully).\n\nThis game has some bugs, and it's Zircon's first video game, so that's sort of expected. I'm not gonna say it's perfect; there's been some unfair situations here and there, especially coming from bugs, but I promise that if you look past them (and they're patching them out diligently), this game is definitely a show stopper.", "timestamp_created": 1517807090, "timestamp_updated": 1517807121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607850", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39858570": {"recommendationid": "39858570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070983033", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518221058}, "language": "english", "review": "Comfy game that has a nice art style and good gameplay.

I'll leave the negative review for now but I am approaching it with more of an open mind.\n\nI guess I'm always chasing the feeling I had while playing Castle Of the Winds. I was hoping that this game would be just htat but I was dissapointed. That may not be the games fault so I'll go ahead and list the good, what I hoped for but didn't see yet, and the bad that I experienced while playing. \n\nGood:\n-Turnbased. \n-Procedurally generated \"dungeons.\" \n-Music was good and relaxing.\n\nWhat I hoped for but didn't get:\n-In depth NPCs. \n-A underlining story arc.\n-In Castle of the Winds you would sometimes open a room and all would be revealed in that room at once: glorious treasure with several hard enemies. You never knew what might be behind a door in COTW but you hoped it revealed something like that. This version of \"Dungeons\" was way to open and you would pedictably reveal an exact amount every step you took nothing look so planned out as those rooms in COTW.\n-In COTW you started out by just punching things and you slowly built up your weapons and armor. However, in Tangledeep just one dungeon floor in I had already obtained 3 more weapons, 2 leather armors, and 2 sheilds.\n-In COTW you had to indentify treasure or you could just risk it and put it on. It could be cursed or enchanted. Finding out the level of armor was so satisfying. As far as I can tell in tangledeep it's just simple stats on Armor. If there was more to it then it wasn't immedietly apparent.\n\nThe Bad:\n-I would pick up an amulet while walking around but for the life of me I could not find it in my \"inventory.\" Then I might randomely find it later in a section that was empty that first time I looked. There needs to be much clearer labeling of what you are looking at in the \"inventory.\"\n-The Shop Inventory was not intuitive either.\n-The mini map is way too big. And it was annoying that I had to go click on an Icon to open it and close it. Maybe I could have bound a hotkey to it but why wasn't \"m\" the default hotkey? Nothing was bound to \"m\" so I see no reason why it wasn't default.\n-It already felt boring after the first level. I'm not sure why. Maybe it was because I already had so much armor and weapons without even trying. Maybe it's because I felt like I already knew everything about my little campfire town. \n\nOh well.", "timestamp_created": 1517773782, "timestamp_updated": 1518056834, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.303435", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1517782328, "developer_response": "When you redeem a key for a game on Steam, Steam marks it as \"received for free\" even if you got that game as part of a Kickstarter backer package or some other third party service.\n\nSo I'm not the primary developer on the team, that's Zircon. But I read all of your review and it actually made me smile. Tell you the truth? I loooove CoTW. I really do. It was one of the big inspirations behind another game I worked on called Dungeonmans. TD and CoTW are certainly different games. CoTW is a little more gritty and hard-scrapple, TD is brighter and a little more forgiving -- in the beginning at least.\n\nIn Castle of the Winds, you limp out of the first dungeon with a rusty sword, a hat that's probably cursed, and then you find someone burned your farm down.\n\nIn Tangledeep, you port back to town and a cheerful cat lady sings you a rhyme while buying your goods at a fair market price.\n\nThey're two different games. It makes me sad that you didn't enjoy TD but I can understand if your itch for CoTW wasn't scratched here. It *does* certainly tick up in difficulty after you pass the first story boss, but it never has that kick-down-the-door-and-yell-at-the-orcs feeling of CoTW. If anything, I feel like it works almost in reverse of that. The monsters roll up, you size up their powers and relative danger level, and you work to take care of them before more show up, or while moving to your next destination and trying to keep things under control. I have a good time with it, and the open spaces make all the mobility and AOE powers more useful.\n\nIt's also too bad that Tangledeep hurt you to the point where you wanted to warn other players away from it. That's unfortunate. But your feedback is still valuable and I appreciate it. Well and some of it made me chuckle -- for months the minimap had been too small and too hard to read. We updated it right before launch and so many players applauded, and now here's a negative review saying it's too big :D can't please 'em all.\n\nThanks for giving us a shot!"}, "39850775": {"recommendationid": "39850775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025610900", "num_games_owned": 415, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518085534}, "language": "english", "review": "An EXCELLENT  game.

While not as deep as some roguelikes (nethack for instance) the system is still satisfying to play and with many tactical options that will require juggling placement, skills and consumables. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1517606534, "timestamp_updated": 1517606534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503099", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39795898": {"recommendationid": "39795898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119805318", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518419288}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3068\u308a\u3042\u3048\u305a\u6700\u521d\u306e\u30dc\u30b9\u307e\u3067\u3084\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u81ea\u5206\u306f\u6b7b\u3093\u3060\u3089\u9280\u884c\u306b\u4fdd\u7ba1\u3057\u305f\u7269\u3068\u304a\u91d1\u3001\u753a\u4ee5\u5916\u306f\u30ea\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u308b heroic mode\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\n\u81ea\u5206\u306f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u4e0a\u624b\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u65b9\u306a\u306e\u3067\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u6b69\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3067\u3082\u3089\u3048\u308b\u56de\u5fa9\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u3067\u306f\u8db3\u308a\u305a\u3068\u3066\u3082\u8f9b\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u98a8\u6765\u306e\u30b7\u30ec\u30f3\u7684\u306a\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3067\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u6bb4\u308a\u3067\u653b\u6483\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u3001\u6700\u521d10\u7a2e\u985e\u304b\u3089\u9078\u3079\u308b\u30b8\u30e7\u30d6\u306e\u4e2d\u306e\u56fa\u6709\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3092\u30d0\u30f3\u30d0\u30f3\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u884c\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3060\u3081\u307f\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b\u30a8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8mob\u7684\u306a\u3084\u3064\u3082\u3081\u3061\u3083\u3081\u3061\u3083\u5f37\u304f\u3066\u6700\u521d\u306a\u306e\u306b\u4f55\u5ea6\u3082\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3057\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u304b\u306a\u308a\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u4eca\u5f8cswitch\u7248\u3067\u3082\u51fa\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3067\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5316&update\u306b\u3082\u671f\u5f85\u5927\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u5b89\u3044\u4eca\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u3084\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u3057\u307e\u3059\n\n\u8ffd\u8a18\u3000\n\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3092\u4e0a\u3052\u3066\u7269\u7406\u3067\u6bb4\u308d\u3046\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3051\u3069\u6575\u304c\u5f37\u3059\u304e\u308b\u56de\u5fa9\u624b\u6bb5\u304c\u5c11\u306a\u3044\u3067\u8f9b\u3059\u304e\u308b\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1517593859, "timestamp_updated": 1517717760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39795069": {"recommendationid": "39795069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039956251", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517656370}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ubc18\ub144 \uac00\ub7c9\uc758 \uc5bc\ub9ac \uc561\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ub9c8\uce58\uace0 \uc815\uc2dd \ucd9c\uc2dc\ud55c \ub85c\uadf8\ub77c\uc774\ud06c \uac8c\uc784\uc778 \ud0f1\uae00\ub525.\n\n\uadf8 \ub204\uad6c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2ec\ud50c\ud558\uac8c \uc7a5 / \ub2e8\uc810\ub9cc \ub530\uc838\ubcf4\uc790\uba74.\n\n\n- \uc7a5\uc810\n\n1. \uc774\uc05c \uc5ec\uc8fc (\uc194\uc9c1\ud788 \uc774\uac8c \uad6c\ub9e4 \uc774\uc720\uc758 7\ud560\uc744 \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\ub9ac\ub77c \uc0dd\uac01\ud568)\n2. \uad1c\ucc2e\uc740 \uc774\ud399\ud2b8, \uc88b\uc740 \uc74c\uc545, \uc2a4\ubb34\uc2a4\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud53d. \uac1c\uc131\ub118\uce58\ub294 \uc9c1\uc5c5\ub4e4.\n3. \uc88b\uac8c \ub9d0\ud574\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucee8\ud150\uce20. \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ub9d0\ud558\uba74 \uc774\uac74 \uc720\uc800\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ud070 \ub2e8\uc810\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c.\n - \ub2f9\uc2e0\ub9cc\uc758 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc744 \ucee4\uc2a4\ud140 / \uc9c4\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubcf4\uc138\uc694!

This one does.\n\nNow with those graphics, you might suspect that there must be a shortage of complexity, variance, replayability, difficulty.\nI sure did. And was surprised.\nTangledeep is a surprisingly difficult roguelike with loads of stuff to do and enough reasons to replay it. If you ever make it to the end, that is. I didn't. Yet.\n\nOnce you beat the first boss, the difficulty ramps up significantly* and you are required to think about your every step as soon as you see an enemy. Use the right items, eat the right food, summon a creature, use your abilities... or run away. Everything is valid and you'll need to do all of it from time to time.\n\nReplayability-wise, there are many classes (called jobs) to choose from, all of them different in abilities. And some clearly more challenging than others (in general, ranged classes are considered easier and I can agree).\n\nBut the game doesn't end there.\nYou also have the ability to catch pets, plant trees (it is more useful than it sounds), do quests, find secrets, enter the dreams of your items (not kidding)...\nI will not say it is the most complex roguelike out there. It is not. But it is complex enough to keep you entertained for a long while.\n\n[b]There are a few downsides, though:[/b]\n\n* The difficulty spike after the first boss is just too much. Before you learn how everything works and just how careful you have to be, you will lose a number of characters right after the first boss. This is just weird and needlessly frustrating and should be changed to follow a more natural feeling difficulty curve.\n\nMelee characters are much harder to play than ranged ones. It is just much easier to get surrounded and keeping your distance just isn't an option before later on when you can learn some techniques for ranged weapons, too.\nThe devs have already acknowledged that and it should be improved on release. But I have a feeling even then, ranged will be easier.\n\nThe UI can be clunky at times. For example, when you sell a single item in the shop, all is well. But when you click on a stack of items, the shop UI closes and a popup opens asking you how many of the stack you want to sell and after that the shop UI opens back up. This is awkward as hell and could be made much, much simpler.\nAnother example: You cannot access your recipes from within the cooking window. Why? Would seem natural to have a button for it there.\nOr: You can only move around entries in your hotbar in the inventory, not during the main game. Seems unnecessarily clunky, too.\n\nAnother downside is that you can only equip 5 items at the same time. A weapon, an offhand item, an armor and two \"misc\" things (which is everything else, including helmets). And when you play a Budoka, you will only have three items...\nThat just isn't very much and the game should have taken hints from other RPGs that allow you a lot more. The biggest problem is that it just doesn't make sense that I cannot equip another ring if I already wear shoes and a helmet. It also limits the customization, which is a huge part in RPGs. One or two item slots more wouldn't have made a character overpowered.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n\nIn the end, you get a very fun and challenging roguelike  with a couple of downsides that I hope the developers will eventually improve for a thoroughly enjoyable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1517315231, "timestamp_updated": 1517315759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.877676", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39669952": {"recommendationid": "39669952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201946520", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517467579}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game :D\nI prefer it to Disgaea ^^", "timestamp_created": 1517102837, "timestamp_updated": 1517102837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.382989", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39668888": {"recommendationid": "39668888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309563506", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519525958}, "language": "english", "review": "The art, the music, the gameplay, this game is beautiful in every aspect", "timestamp_created": 1517098635, "timestamp_updated": 1517098635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482878", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39606808": {"recommendationid": "39606808", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983332054", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517813107}, "language": "english", "review": "The game always has replay value, progression in character to variety of classes, fun diverse item world similar to that of disgaea to enhance gear, developer is always involved almost all the time and fixing bugs to help players, very active community, great soundtrack, small mechanics such as cooking, pets, and many more!

It has truly captured the best of both worlds.\n\nAccessible as the game is, that doesn't mean it's easy. The floors of Tangledeep are crawling with endless powerful enemies, healing abilities are limited and you will constantly have to exhaust your resources just to scrape by. Fortunately, the game offers a variety of tools to help you even the odds; the most obvious one being the highly flexible job system that allows you to switch jobs whenever you want and mix and match their skills to your heart's content. There's also weapon mastery skills you can learn to help tailor your playstyle around your favorite weapon types, ingredients and recipes you find to cook food for invaluable extra healing and buffs, item dream dungeons you can clear to upgrade your equipment, randomized \"rumor\" sidequests that reward you for completing optional objectives, planting seeds that grow over time into trees that you can harvest ingredients from, and even capturing monsters and raising them to fight alongside you! \n\nAll of these add up to an experience that feels highly rewarding to players who take the time to explore their options and prepare for the dangers ahead, and it manages to make every death feel like a result of your own carelessness and not just another sacrifice to the Random Number God. And even though death is permanent, future characters can make use of any money or items you've stashed in the bank, trees you've grown and the monsters you've captured. This system of \"investing\" some of your stuff in future playthroughs is something I've really come to enjoy, because it allows you to make some permanent progress and make future runs go smoother without making it feel like your new characters are just downright better than the old ones. Very refreshing if you play a lot of \"roguelites\".\n\nTangledeep is also a beautifully presented game. The sprites, animation, sound effects and music channel the SNES era prefectly and are great in their own right, enemy and area designs are distinctive and easy to learn, the dialogue and flavor text is lighthearted and charming, and overall you can see the love that went into it. There are still some bugged visual effects and flaws in the UI to work out, but nothing has seriously hampered my experience so far. The developers work hard and are constantly releasing new builds and communicating with players. I'm happy to support them and I look forward to watching this great game get even better.", "timestamp_created": 1514149679, "timestamp_updated": 1515008525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38544805": {"recommendationid": "38544805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041595853", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519188220}, "language": "english", "review": "Doesn't manage to be fun.

You\u2019d be best off seeing it for yourself, either with the originals or faithful imitators like Super House of Dead Ninjas or TowerClimb. Now you can add Tangledeep to that list, not because it\u2019s faithful to the look but because it captures so much of that classic 16-bit mystique. Few games are as lush and charming as this, even as it gleefully kills the fuck out of you.\n\nYou and your bestial kin live deep underground in an idyllic bastion of nature, but the allure of the mysterious surface proves too much for you to ignore. Between home and your goal lies the Tangledeep, a labyrinthine mess of fields, tunnels, thickets, forts, and other locales teeming with danger. You\u2019re only going to survive the trip if you scavenge up some gear, make the most of your many skills, grow some plants, enter some item dreams, and cook a lot of meatwiches. There\u2019s weirdness afoot in the subterranean wilds, and your journey is going to take you straight into the heart of it, should you survive.\n\nTangledeep shares a lot of DNA with kooky roguelikes like Dungeonmans and Dungeons of Dredmor, but with much of the silliness swapped out for additional polish and depth. At its heart is a turn-based dungeon crawl, with health and magic and stamina to manage as you cast skills and bump-murder enemies for loot. It\u2019s worth mentioning that it plays better than a lot of its contemporaries, especially with a controller, thanks to some clean and intelligent UI design and silky-smooth game flow. Essential information like enemy health and area effects is always visible, and your own items and abilities are extremely clear in their functions.\n\nThat\u2019s enough for a baseline roguelike, but Tangledeep makes good on its name with a dizzying knot of interconnected systems you can explore to find success. The ancient job system of Final Fantasy V and Tactics is resurrected here for the 12 playable classes, allowing you to earn and spend points for the skills you want before swapping to an entirely new class built atop those same skills. There\u2019s also a weapon mastery system to spend those points on if you favor more direct combat. My floramancer was able to compliment her vine summoning and staff magic with area-of-effect elemental spells, making her a match for even large groups of monsters.\n\nBeyond the vast potential of the job system, you\u2019ll find a familiar RPG leveling scheme, randomized gear for five different equipment slots, a cooking system, a pet capture and care system, a simple farming system, and even the item dungeons from Disgaea if you want to fight the dreams of your hat to make it a better hat. And these are just what you can find in the base town, ignoring the side areas with casinos, pet shops, and even more off-beat options for building your legend. There\u2019s so much you can do with your character that it\u2019s easy to lose track of everything at your disposal, yet it\u2019s never so pressing or overbearing that it detracts from the excellent, methodical combat.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to focus heavily on that combat too, because like most quality roguelikes Tangledeep pulls no punches. You won\u2019t often find yourself out of your depth thanks to clear difficulty indicators on the maps and enemies themselves, but you might be surprised at first how dangerous a Tricky or even Average threat can be. Certain design choices like no regenerating health or magic can make combat dicey until you learn to work around this particular style of challenge. It didn\u2019t take me long to adjust but because it\u2019s such a deep and involved game, losing a character stings more than it does in bite-sized romps like Isaac or Gungeon. Patience definitely helps keep you focused on your distant goal, and fortunately the look and feel are the right kind of soothing to keep you in that space.\n\nI really can\u2019t say enough good things about the aesthetic here. It\u2019s not a perfect recreation of SNES graphics but it doesn\u2019t need to be, and it hits all the right notes in all the right places to evoke that sense of wonder and comfort. The sound design is easily its equal too, with bright effects and tracks that hearken back to Secret of Mana and other giants of the genre. Few games are as vibrant as this one, and that joy it exudes makes the deep combat and vast progression systems so much more fun to explore and master. It\u2019s right at the end of its Early Access cycle too, and feels far more complete than some full releases do. Tangledeep is a powerful addition to the roguelike genre, taking the best parts of nostalgia and fundamentals to produce something as enthralling as it is challenging.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

It's presented in a 2.5D overhead style, in a fantasy setting. Pick from three difficulty settings : in Adventure Mode, the default setting, the game just shunts you back to town if you die, albeit with a noticeable EXP penalty and the loss of all of your gold and Job Points. In Heroic Mode, the intended setting, uses permadeath, but your town progress and banked items remain intact. In Hardcore Mode, you get the classic Rogue-type treatment: Everything goes away, including the town, your bank, and the save file itself, if you die.\n\nTHE FLOW AND THE STORY:\nAn idyllic little forest town is being threatened by all sorts of monsters \u2013 sentient and otherwise, all just as brutal \u2013 and guess whose job it is to deal with their abuse? That's right! Thus, it's time to make a character, decide their starting class and passive buffs, then go and gear up, grab some food and healing potions, and wade into the dungeon as its floors just keep going up and up and up...Higher floors mean tougher monsters, as well as better loot! How high can you climb and still stay alive? Just how far will you push your luck, and will it run out before you can make it back home with your little town portal or not? If you're feeling lucky, many floors will contain a \u201cPandora's Box\u201d that, once activated, increases the local monsters' levels and gives them a buff, allowing you to find more of a challenge.\n\nEach time you get to a new \u201cfloor,\u201d one day will pass back in town. Your tree garden (if you've planted any seeds) will be harvested for its fruit, gems/shards, and/or spices; the critters you've captured and placed into your monster farm will have a chance to reproduce with one another (making better ones) and grow stronger; new quests and items will also become available at the vendors in town.\n\nCONTROLS:\nKeyboard (WASD or numpad) w/mouse, controllers, or mouse-only mode are supported. 8-way move in turn-based style, \u201cmove\u201d towards an enemy for a basic attack, numbers from the top strip for shortcuts to special powers and attacks.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nGood-looking, highly detailed sprite-based everything. A bit cutesy at times, but in a way that suits the game and the environment. If anything, this may lead one to suspect that the game goes easy on you...It does not, and that's a good thing. Just when you're expecting to clear out an area and move on to some new little bonus region to explore, a pack of ninjas and lightning-throwing slimes all show up at once and proceed to teach you some humility. Or, you move onto a new floor, only to find the entrance to a bandit hideout, with signs warning you to stay away and let them conquer your little world in peace. Naturally, your first instinct is to ignore that warning and go kick their asses...doing so unprepared, however, will yield a swift GAME OVER. Gear up, load up on buffs, and come back, and maybe...just maybe...\n\nSOUND:\nAmazing music all around \u2013 from something gentle at the title screen to something a bit more tense when it's all about to hit the fan.

The game places a massive emphasis on 'health management', because none of the classes/characters have any reliable healing abilities, so your health declines after every battle and eventually will run out, and the only want to heal yourself in the game is from food (which is pretty rare), flasks (which are pretty rare also) and the healer in the town (which costs gold). So if you run out of gold and can't kill anymore mobs because your hp is too low, then you're dead. So the game is pretty punishing if you can't minimize the damage you take with every encounter. Another thing that I really like about the game is the small amount of armor/gear that you can equip (only 4 at once), which means you have to be very selective with what your characters wears. Overall even in early-access, you can get hundreds of hours of fun gameplay out of it and there's still so many good things that can be added to the game, but the base game is already good and enjoyable.\n\nVideo review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ88A4TXtU8 (in-depth, 60minutes review)", "timestamp_created": 1503888809, "timestamp_updated": 1503888809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455099", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34539215": {"recommendationid": "34539215", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985889900", "num_games_owned": 775, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517468162}, "language": "english", "review": "i thought i was in for another by-the-numbers steam EA roguelike but this game is full of content and creativity and charm and just brilliant design! the classes are all unique and the job system is a ton of fun to play with. every mechanic is thoughtfully and refreshingly rethought from genre convention. easy 10/10, buy this game if you like roguelikes at all.", "timestamp_created": 1503868407, "timestamp_updated": 1503868407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575401", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34479855": {"recommendationid": "34479855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003946375", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506118570}, "language": "english", "review": "No way around it, this game is fun even in it's somewhat unfinished state.\nArtwork is pleasing to the eye and the sound track is extremely well done.

Aside from the obvious (gorgeous old school pixel art and music that sounds direclty out of any given 90's JRPG,) Tangledeep feels like a long lost game from my childhood.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is very much a real roguelike - but only if you want it to be. You can play it as a regular RPG if you desire, but it's clearly meant to appeal to roguelike fans. If you want meta-progression, it's there, but it's in no way necessary. If you don't want permadeath, you can play without it.\n\nThe crux of the game is a standard tower ascension dungeon crawl. You pick a starting job (class), and you're on your merry way. There are quests to help you progress, and the flexible job system lets you design any kind of character you can think of within the span of skills available to you. You may switch jobs at any given point, provided you have the necessary gold (or a special item.) All the skills you spent JP (the resource you use to buy skills) on will be kept when you switch jobs. You could, if you really wanted, learn one skill per job and just keep switching. Highly inefficient, but still possible.\n\nThe weapons classes in the game (i.e. sword, axe, bow, staff, etc...) all have a unique feature to them. For example, swords have an increased parry chance, and the ability to riposte upon parry, while axes hit all adjacent enemies. You can have four weapons equipped at once, which lends flexibility to each job. Some jobs clearly prefer certain weapon classes, of course; the Hunter works best with bows, while the Brigand works best with daggers, but these aren't hard rules (though some skills do require specific weapon types.)\n\nThere is no hunger clock. You *can* grind - though the usefulness of grinding diminishes heavily very quickly. Of note, your ability to heal is finite. You carry a flask which heals based on a percentage of your max health, and has a limited number of charges. You can refill these at fountains scattered throughout the dungeon, but these fountains are also finite. You can also heal through food and an NPC in town, but you will eventually run short on food if you mess around too much, and the NPC in town charges higher and higher prices to heal with each subsequent heal. So if you grind too long, you will probably lose the war of attrition.\n\nThe dev is amazing. This game is updated very frequently, each update bringing quality of life changes and bug fixes, and often times some content. I'm serious when I say it's updated *VERY* frequently. Like 4-5 times a week. The dev is friendly and communicative and fixes bugs pretty much right after they're caught. He is open to suggestions and seems to enjoy communicating with the players.\n\nI keep forgetting this game is Early Access. It has a TON of content already, and quite a bit more on the way. There are currently 9 jobs, but 3 more are slated to be released before 1.0. There are so many ways to approach a win here, and that number will only increase. This is well worth the $15.\n\nTrue modern roguelikes are uncommon, but this game fits the bill. Perhaps the most extreme purists won't see this as a true roguelike, but if you are playing on hardcore, I fail to see how it is anything but.

However, you do have the option to play without perma-death.\n- Some skills can be a bit buggy - I'm speaking mostly of the Floramancer's vine-splosion skill. I've had multiple instances where it refused to work on her summoned vines. This should not be an indicator of the game's quality now or in the future though - it IS an early access and there will be bugs.\n\nThat's pretty much it.

It's not for me but I can see it's good for other people.\n\nThe decision that has been made with graphics is a bit weird. There are nice, pixelart graphics with animation but all the player sprites are female with no plans to change that and changes in your weapon, armor etc. don't show on the character. Plans for more graphics include adding graphics and animations for facing up and down. This might look good on a trailer but I think effort would be better spent elsewhere. As for the gender of sprites, since there are 9 classes I would have made some of them male by default and others female by default if you don't have the time to make male and female for each class.\n\nBasically with the graphics I think they went too specific and removed connection with the player/immersion. Instead of being your character, male or female, a certain class, using certain armour and a certain weapon you are THE SWORDDANCER, a female sword dancer with a set outfit and weapon (which is a sword even if you're using a club).\n\nHow would I solve this? I would axe specific sprites for classes and make all classes look the same but I would add in a modular system with the sprites so that armor and weapon can show on your character. If this means that there's no time to animation as it's done here then fine, I would do all animations for moving and attacking by rotating, scaling or transforming the sprite.\n\nAs a roguelike the game has too much roguelitey persistance for me.

The score has drilled its way deep into my brain, and I'm pretty sure it's rewriting some neural pathways, because I'm tempted to scour everything else Zircon has composed to find some more gold nuggets.\n\nSo, the review. To set up: I'm an avid player of ARPG and have been since the SoM days. D2 through to D3 and Path of Exile hold most of my hours, while sampling various MMORPGs along the way. But in the last 5-6 years, I've been getting more into rogue-like games. I'm not ashamed to say I've sunk 173 hours into FTL. Lastly, to disclose: I'm backer of Tangledeep.\n\nTangledeep definitely scratches that FTL itch, and carries an equally strong soundtrack. The game mechanics are unique in its turn-based move/action style. This aspect, combined with NECESSARY resource management (flasks/food), make for gameplay that is challenging, yet brisk.\n\nAs far as an Alpha goes, it's much more polished than expected, and is HIGHLY playable at this stage. I blew through 6 characters before I got the hang of how you need to balance and manage healing, and mitigate or minimize damage. Health/HP is a commodity, and does not automatically replenish.\n\nWhile the game art feels dated, even in a simulated-retro-8bit sort of way, it still carries 100% of the charm that the author was no doubt shooting for - and is a remarkable achievement considering the size of the team.  Replayability is extremely high; if this was a goal of the developer, it really shows.\n\nLastly, I can't emphasize enough how promising the soundtrack is at this stage. There are several excellent songs that will really grow on you if you're a fan of VGM.  If I read correctly, I think the developer is going to release two versions of each song - the in-game one that simulates more of the midi feel, and another more polished, hi-fidelity version. If this is the case, it might be worth checking out the Kickstarter, or scooping up the deluxe version if they offer it in Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1501442359, "timestamp_updated": 1501442359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526535", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33849853": {"recommendationid": "33849853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037780770", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503010202}, "language": "english", "review": "I like ADOM. ADOM is a fun romp through a large world with dozens of classes, hundreds of items, and all sorts of other cool things.\n\nTangledeep, however, is not ADOM. Obviously it's in Early Access, and I've only put an hour into it so far, so I can say that as of now it's a little less complex than ADOM... but it is also a MASSIVE step-up in UI and interface quality over all the other roguelike games I've played.\n\nThere are 9 jobs you can pick at the start of the game. Each job has a whole bunch of abilities you can purchase permanently as you play through, and you will keep these abilities if you switch to another class. However, the classes also have passive abilities that are locked to only that class, and if you switch you lose them. This means you can play through and learn every active ability in the game, but you also have to make choices about how to build your character since you can't have everything all at once.\n\nItem variety is pretty good, but I imagine this will be expanded to the level of ADOM in the future.\n\nThe art in this game is very nice, the colors pop, the catgirls look nice, etc. I think the only characters in this game are female, I didn't see a single male (Or I wasn't looking hard enough) so that means lots of spriting eye-candy.\n\nThe UI is really phenomenal though, seriously. I've been bashing my head against rocks every time I play a roguelike and they put zero or minimal effort into user accessibility. Even in ADOM, just comparing two pieces of equipment to each other is a chore. Here, it's a cinch.\n\nLots of game altering options to choose from too, etc.\n\nAs of right now, it's a good 6/10 overall, and a 9/10 for presentation. You might think 6/10 is bad, but this is an above average Early Access game, since I'm using the Moist Meter system of rating, and not the IGN numerical system where anything below a 7 is terrible.\n\nThis game is missing many things, due to being in Early Access, like 'advanced jobs' and other things that simply don't work and haven't been added yet, but the amount of polish already present in the game tells me the developer is taking the product seriously.\n\nI would say that buying it at full price is fine, and any form of a sale is definitely worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1501225409, "timestamp_updated": 1501360046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552081", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33846363": {"recommendationid": "33846363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005669153", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507780633}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun with more potential!

Designed, coded, and even scored by one man (which brings to mind the likes of Pixel and his work on Cave Story), Tangledeep feels like the kind of rougelike we might have gotten on an enhanced SNES, if one were ever made for today's audiences.\n\nThe soundtrack is literally what sold me on this game; I didn't even have a computer ready to play the alpha builds (since there was no Linux support yet), so I backed the Kickstarter based *solely* on screenshots and the existing soundtrack, which is still available to listen to on zircon's SoundCloud and is probably now all over YouTube. Only the chiptune versions are in the game last I checked, but MAN are they good. It really is a mixture of some of the best parts of SNES soundtracks' glory days, injected with its own soul; it may *sound* familiar, but it *feels* like a truly new soundtrack.\n\nLinux support was added well before early access, and I at last played the game the week prior. Controller support is already pretty good, at least with a wired Xbox 360 pad (keyboard plus mouse and just mouse or just keyboard are also perfectly doable; I just really like using gamepads), and the game is not a performance hog at all, so I imagine that any laptop will be able to run this with ease as long as it meets the OpenGL requirement in hardware (version 4.1, I think). Mine doesn't, though, so I played on my desktop.\n\nThe gameplay itself lends itself well to exploration of both the dungeons and the mechanics! I've only tried out two jobs and have yet to make it past 11F; but there's plenty of loot to enhance yourself with; loads of enemies that will keep you on your toes, including minibosses; and combat options galore to help you get out of that sticky situation *if* you plan things out well. I can get impatient at times so I'll just hack-hack-hack at most enemies, but the tricky situations that demanded me to make the most of my items and spells in order to get out alive are satisfying to take a moment and ponder over; and when I die, it's usually my fault, even if I don't always realize this until it's too late.\n\nI suppose I never was great at roguelikes.\n\nAnyway, I suppose I'm rambling at this point.

On a basic level we've seen it before - get a character, wander through randomized dungeons, find stuff, gain skills, kill things.  You can die, but you can bank items, corral monsters, and plant trees to assist your replacement.  So you can be a wizard or warrior, but also a farmer and a practitioner of animal husbandry.  Oh, but there's more\n\nSee, as you go on more and more potential comes out.\n* Each character is very distinct, and their skills invite differnt strategies.  However you can . . .\n* Swap classes as you have the resources and carry over the same skills (but not unique class bonuses).  Ever want to be a giant armored tank that shoots magic?  Tangledeep has you covered.\n* Learn other skills in town to further specialize your character.\n* Random quests are assigned in town to give you a chance to advance.  How many do you want to queue up?\n* Corral monsters for all sorts of benefits.  Groom them.  Feed them.  Get gifts.  Take them on adventures with you!  Breed them to make stronger companions!  Monsters stay around even when your adventurer dies - a good monster buddy can make re-exploring much faster.\n* Plant trees to get food and other benefits - or chop them down for experience.  Trees will be around even when your adventurer dies.\n* Learn to cook various dishes with bonuses and healing.\n* Bank items and gold for future adventurers.  Speaking of items . . .\n* Items bring various bonuses.  Ever want to have armor that summons attack crabs?  Magical books that create shields in front of you?  You'll have to choose your loadout carefully (fortunately the game allows you to configure four weapon slots).\n* Unlock the ability to enter the Dreams of items, unlocking randomized or specific powers.  Or maybe you want to take a power away - you can do that to.  Explore imaginary dungeons with real danger - and real rewards, including leveling up items.\n\nOn top of all of this there's a plot and backstory.  Tangledeep has it all.\n\nTangledeep is a game with a lot of depth, a lot of heart, and a lot going for it.  It's clear the team enjoy games and asked \"what would be fun?\"  Then they keep shoveling fun out.\n\nWho's it for?\n* If you love \"continuing Roguelikes\" like Dungeonmans or Shiren, go for it.  End of story.  You should have this.\n* If you like a good challenging RPG.  This has it all.\n* If you want a bit of retro with modern polish.\n* If you want to climb deep into an RPG's character and item crafting.\n* If ANYONE you know fits the above, you just found a great fit.", "timestamp_created": 1500617494, "timestamp_updated": 1518230169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727097", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33687098": {"recommendationid": "33687098", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963280337", "num_games_owned": 859, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501174148}, "language": "english", "review": "yep.", "timestamp_created": 1500606138, "timestamp_updated": 1500606138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.388264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33686610": {"recommendationid": "33686610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045086283", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517693789}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun roguelike, more in the light than Tales of Maj'eyal, less cryptic than Dungeon of Dredmor if you've played those.\nUnlike most game of this genre, this one look gorgeous.", "timestamp_created": 1500604187, "timestamp_updated": 1500604187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33686451": {"recommendationid": "33686451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039993465", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517580133}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm big on Traditional Roguelikes and after playing for some time I highly recommend this.

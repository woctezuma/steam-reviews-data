It's compatible with the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and even the Windows headsets. \n\nIn this game you will explore the area, manage your resources, solve puzzles and try to survive until you reach the end of this horror adventure. There are two difficulty options. Survival horror which I played and casual which is said to be more forgiving.\n\n\nYou start in your apartment room, only armed with a torch and a map of the building. You look through the rooms for resources, bullets, weapons and medical equipment. The items can be hidden quite well. Under beds, down the side of a bookshelf and so on. \n\nAt first you'll need to avoid enemies, but throughout the game you can find various weapons. \nWhether you'll be careful enough with your bullets to keep using them is another question.\nYou do have to manage your resources quite well, so avoiding enemies can still be the better option.\n\nThere are a variety of puzzles in the game. Some quite obvious such as placing a found item into a similar shaped slot, where some require more thought such as placing certain items in an order based on a clue in the same room.\n\n\nOrgan Quarter's graphics are nothing amazing. You can tell it's definitely an indie game, but while it's not very graphically impressive, the aesthetic is done very well. This combined with the audio, both the sounds, background music and voices which are brilliant to really give you that oppressive horror atmosphere, keeping you on edge.\n\nOf the horror games I've played so far, this one has done the best at creating the correct atmosphere and it doesn't rely on jump-scares to do it, unlike some others. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513250222, "timestamp_updated": 1513250222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38087980": {"recommendationid": "38087980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030788633", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510871105}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game so far!

Props to whoever did the music for this, it really nails it. There's also something weirdly satisfying about having to mark off your own map.\nIt's a little raw in places- definitely feels like a game that came from a smaller studio- but by the end I sort of fell in love with that charm.\nI was legit upset when I finished this because I could wander around this world forever.", "timestamp_created": 1510513853, "timestamp_updated": 1510513853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36437393": {"recommendationid": "36437393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053210555", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510387452}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the better VR games available as of this writing. If you're a fan of classic survival horror, especially Silent Hill, this is your game. \n\nLike the older Silent Hill games, this doesn't try to be an in-your-face scary game. It's more about the oppressive atmosphere and the looming presence. Most of your time is going to be spent wandering around decrepit buildings and streets, checking doors, solving puzzles and dodging monsters. One feature is that it has a map system much like the old Silent Hill games except you have to manually mark your map as you find doors locked or passages blocked off. Maybe that sounds tedious but it's actually pretty neat.\n\nAs for graphics, the aesthetic is great even though it's a relatively low fidelity game. It actually feels like you're in Silent Hill 1. There's a mix of fleshy, gross, organic architecture and rusty, bloody, crumbling architecture. It's perfect and it's a whole new experience when you have to traverse these kinds of locations in a first person VR game rather than a disconnected third person flat game. \n\nThe one major weakness is that the combat is rather poor. It gets the job done, though. There's nothing really mechanically wrong with it but it's just not all that satisfying. \n\nOverall, if you're at all interested in playing a survival horror game for VR, this is a great one.

Namely, this game is completely unashamed of its likeness to Silent Hills 2 and 3. I can't speak for Silent Hill 1 as I've never completed it myself but considering Silent Hill 3 is one of my favorite games, I can see the comparisons here in full. People are weird and awkward, constantly seeming detached from reality. The Environments are nightmarish and impossible. While Silent Hill tries to trick you into thinking you're in the real world and everything is safe, this game doesn't even try. You are in it from beginning to end. It's obvious that there is a layer of unreal to this game and I feel like it wears that like a badge of honor. \n\nThe visuals are amazing, but the graphics are not. This is kind of a hard one because I personally like this graphical fidelity. This is going to age just fine because it looks a lot like the environmental design of Silent Hill 3. It looks old and that's okay. Plus, this means the game runs very, very well on most systems, as far as I can tell. But obviously, better graphical fidelity is always welcome. I just don't see a problem with this. The enemy designs are fine, certainly frightening if you are at all affected by body horror. The gunplay is fine but the focus on this game is the looming sense of doom and environmental unease. It's this games corner stone and god, if it isn't a strong one. \n\nThe music is great. It's static ridden and tense when it needs to be but then it settles down when you reach a save point, giving you a good little resting point that feels good to be in. The composer for this game is, again, keeping pretty true to the Silent Hill formula, even if no one can top a music composition for this type of game like Akira Yamaoka.\n\nI can't give a final opinion as I'm super early but this game is certainly worth looking at. If you have even the slightest inkling of interest in it, I think it's worth it. I'd been watching the game for a while. I played the demo a long time ago and it was okay but the finished product so far is a good bit more cohesive and feels less meh. I love it. Love it to death.\n\nContinued: Without spoiling anything, this game stays consistently great. There's a point at about the 1 hour mark where things ramp up a little and it's not needed but it is welcome. This game just feels like an homage in a really wonderful way. It's a beautiful melding of classic survival horror and modern virtual reality interaction.\n\nComplaint: At long last, I finally have something to complain about. And it's tiny. There comes a section in the game that has to do with doors. As silly as that sounds, I'm keeping it to avoid spoilers. But these doors don't have any sound effects. The don't have iron slide noises or creaking or anything and for just a second, it pulled me out of the moment. I got over it as I continued attempting to get the puzzle but even still. There are a few parts that are like this where the lack of sound to a particular action or object just made it feel less genuine but I can still accept it. Complaining finished, however, because I'm still enjoying this game more than I expected to.

Environment graphics are a bit rough, but the monster and meat generally looks good. Sound is great, monsters make creepy noises, and the soundtrack is, well, like a silent hill game. Story is kind of vague for an hour or so, then it seems to start picking up more after you get out of the apartment building.\n\nNot heavy on real jump scares, but is tense and I jumped a few times just from looking around a corner and spying a creature. Inventory and item managment important and adds to the tension. It's fun scavenging for items in the environment and trying to weave between monsters to conserve ammo. I also like how it makes you get down on the floor/crawl under stuff at times. Can be kind of intense when your sprinting for an item under a table or something with 4 monsters bearing down on you and you gotta get down on all fours to get the item.\n\nPlayed on an occulus with touch, didn't encounter any issues other than when I went through a door it seemed to take a few seconds for my left stick to start working for movement. \n\nI imagine I'm Harry Mason when I'm playing it, I just write the stilted dialogue for myself.", "timestamp_created": 1508622569, "timestamp_updated": 1508622569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35901601": {"recommendationid": "35901601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381853704", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511914403}, "language": "english", "review": "https://youtu.be/SBYiIuIksR4\n\nOK wow!  I remember the first time I popped Resident Evil in my Playstation back when it first came out.  That first hallway where the zombie dog burst through the window and proceeded to rip my throat out.  As my charcter laid there in a pool of blood with YOU DIED on the screen all I could think was,.. This ,,, is,,, TERRIFYING!  I had never had that kind of experience before where a video game scared me.  Not at that viceral fight or flight instinctual level.  Organ  Quarter does this all over again.  The terrifying blacking out momentarily of the screen as you move through the door, the sounds all around you coming from ducts over head and distant rooms, behind doorways or around the corner, up ahead, un-seen.   It's exactly what this Dr. ordered! \n\nGraphically this game is not going to blow anyone away.  That being said what this team has done with their graphics just works.  The spaces feel great, claustrophobic and foreboding.   They are crisp and clear,. no need for super sampling and no frame drops.  The Character models are just great!  Creepy AF with a definite Silent Hill feel to them.  Nice enemy variety from the little close to 2 hours I've played as well.  I have never really been afraid of a spider in a game save the giant one in Resident Evil,. but the little spider dudes in this game are creepy AF and even killed me once!  There is another thing,. with the play style and feel of Resident Evil, I would compare it visually more toward Silent Hill.   Both Games that we have been wanting if you are a Survival Horror fan.   Yes I know there is RE7 but I don't have a PSVR.  \n\nThe Sound is excellent.  It has that late 80's/90's vibe to it with over bearing creepy ambient music, sounds that come from all directions and really help pull you into this terrible world and give you that sense of dread, even when it is mostly quiet with hardly any sound.  The devs did a great job of sound use not over doing it and using the silence just as effectivly.   I had to nope out of one room early on just because I walked in and it was dark, I had no weapon and all I could hear was this terrible crunching coming around the corner up ahead of me .  nope nope nope.  \n\nYou can choose teleport or analoge locomotion.  I chose the later.   It works great, moving where you are pointing your controller, slowing down when you pull back and speeding up with thumpad depression.  I didn't try the teleport so I can't comment on that one.   Anyway I noticed no simulation sickness at all and it felt really good moving through tight spaces in those rooms aiming around corners and avoiding bad guys to conserve ammo which brings me to my next point.\n\nGameplay.  This is really the shining gem of excellence in Organ Quarter!   I love the limited Inventory system, limited ammo,  save system,. all of it really is the old 90s survival horror we all love!  I really love horror in VR (as well as hate it because I'm a big chicken} but have yet to really see one capture that survival horror feel.  In Paranormal Activity, for example, you had \"limited\" batteries for your flashlight,. but did anyone actually run out of batteries?  I know I had a ton of them at the end of the game.  As polished as that game was graphically it cannot hold a candle to the game play and feel of Organ Quarter!  Go Outer Brain!! I also love the map!  great system of being able to mark the rooms you have visited with different stamps.  I use it a LOT!  The use of motion controllers is another thing that just makes these horror VR games so much better!  I think that is one thing I worry about if RE7 ever comes to the VIVE,. I'm going to be really dissapointed if I have to play with a game pad.  holding your gun up, whipping it around when your eyes open in the dark hallway you just entered,  reaching out and grabbing your stuff like ammo and other items,.. that is where things just need to be in VR.  none of this game pad nonsense! \n\nSo YES YES YES I highly recommend Organ Quarter!  If you are a Survival Horror fan this game is an absolute MUST have in your VR library!  It is now my favorite VR horror game and I can't wait to get in and play more!  Once I can get up the courage!

No jumpscares here- just good old fashioned \"Oh geez, that's unsettling...\" enviornments and enemies. For me so far, it's hit every note it's aimed at.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Some of the best I've seen in VR yet- and by that, I don't mean like \"the gun has the highest res textures money can buy!' sort of graphics- I mean in how the whole game looks period. The graphics feel tailor made for VR. \n\nEnemies are intimidating alive, and creepy to look at dead. Letters with small text are readable (this is maybe the first VR game where that was possible for me). Things in the game look 'clear,' not blurry like in most early VR games. The flashlight casts moody shadows beautifully. If there are any anti-aliasing issues (that shimmer effect on the edges of objects like 90% of VR games have), I haven't noticed them. \n\nI'm honestly impressed at how nice everyting looks like game, and this *might* be up there close to Valve's The Lab in how 'made-for-VR' the visuals look in the headset. (Note:  do have SuperSampling enabled on my headset, but most of my games don't look *this* smooth, even with SS enabled.)\n\nThe audio deserves a special mention in this game for sure. The music is excellent - it sets the mood,  it doesn't get in the way, and it sounds great (it very much reminds me of the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack). Aside from the music, the other sounds in this game are *fantastic* and do an amazing job of adding to the dread you feel as you turn each corner, and open each door.\n\nIf you have even a passsing interest in errie games (no jumpscares here, remember!)

It does not rely on jump-scares although the monsters will certainly make you jump out of your skin at least once or twice with it's brilliant placement. The enemy variation is just right and their often sporatic movements can make for tense moments if you miss a shot and need to reload. This game has boss battles. This might be considered a spoiler to some (I do not consider it such as I am not detailing how many or what they are) but if you've played any survival horror games, you will pick it up before it happens and know when to expect them.\n\n[i]BOSS FIGHTS AND GAME LENGTH[/i]\n\nI bring up boss battles for the sake of critique. Most are done well but the final boss does feel like it could have been executed better. Following that thought, Organ Quarter feels like it slips in and out of a \"padding trope\" for the second half of the game. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the full experience a lot but at some point I feel like I would have traded the last 3 hours for another 1.5 hour of the first half. It took me 6 hours to complete Organ Quarter on the \"Survival Horror\" difficulty and (whichever way you look at it and as long as it doesn't completely suck) that is a great amount of play time versus dollar spent (especially since VR game lengths are often much lower than 6 hours).\n\n[i]WORLD DESIGN[/i]\n\nI can hear the critics now. \"GRAPH1CZ MAK3 DAH GAM3!\" And by this they mean \"good graphics\" or some standard that means all else is bust if visuals doesn't bleed realism. Organ Quarter does not have realistic graphics in the sense we see today... but you know, that is okay. I'd even say that is a bigger plus for Organ Quarter because it gives a better \"nightmare\" or \"retro\" feel... however you want to look at it. One of my favorite horror games is Cry of Fear and if you know what that is, you will know why \"X engine\" and \"gud graffics\" don't make the horror game.\n\n[i]AUDIO[/i]\n\nTo a large part, the soundtrack makes the game. I don't think I will remember everything about this game years from now, but I can tell you that if I ever heard the soundtrack being blasted by someone driving down the road... it would be unmistakable. The dark, industrial , and electronic mixes really set the mood (or even parts where there is not music and dead silence). It's brilliant in the music department and without those rich tones... it wouldn't be the same. So what about the voice actor cast?\n\nDr. Alset and his voice actor is definitely the star of the show. Without the voice actors talent and emphasis, it might have been a car wreck in this department. You have a few other voice actors but (no offense actors) it feels a little \"phoned in\". The animations for the characters don't always feel like it matches how the in-game character is coming across but that is no fault of the v/o actor. You might have mixed feelings too but its nothing to avoid this game over.\n\n[i]CONTROLS[/i]\n\nVR is still an experimental field so there is no real \"right way\" to do VR. This game is made to work with both the Rift and Vive with angular snapping of the camera for those who do not have a 360 degree setup. You can choose to play with traditional movement of character or you can teleport. Teleportation is not recommended for the best experience but it is there in case you get sick by thumb-stick locomotion. Organ Quarter\u00a0does survival horror right and gives you an inventory in-game that you need to manage which for the most part, translates well in interaction.\n\nThat is not to say that inventory interaction is without it's faults. Some puzzle items will be very annoying later when you need to set them outside of your inventory and use (only to pick up and go immediately in your inventory and not for use in your hand). It could use some tweaking but for the most part, this one puzzle in particular was the only main headache. Organ Quarter also implements save rooms very nicely (where you can only save the game and nowhere else, duh) which includes a proper box to store additional items when your on-person inventory is full. You will need to manage both inventories fairly frequent! Survival horror and inventory management... imagine that!\n\n[i]FINAL THOUGHTS[/i]\n\nOrgan Quarter is definitely a good game if not in some parts \"great\" for how well it handles survival horror and effectively re-introduces it to us in VR. You can feel the strong Silent Hill vibes and whether you feel that is a cop-out for style and plot device... that is up to you. There are plenty of puzzles to figure out and some even make you feel smart. The added ability to get a map of your current level and place stamps on it to guide you... is genius as well. For an indie title and the work of a small studio, it is certainly the VR horror entry that Silent Hill and horror game fans will definately overall enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1508545148, "timestamp_updated": 1508694968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676701", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35866512": {"recommendationid": "35866512", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998881945", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512496272}, "language": "english", "review": "Survival Horror in VR, spooky.\n\nThe atmosphere in the game is fantastic, with the player having to concentrate on resource management like in the old Silent Hill games, you feel dread coming over you as soon as you have something coming towards you, miss a couple of headshots and hear a click, frantically moving backwards as you wait for the reload to finish.\n\nThere's no jump scares I've ran into so far, everything is purely built through suspense, player error and disgusting visuals, awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1508513886, "timestamp_updated": 1508513886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35857797": {"recommendationid": "35857797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024800960", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508478263}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been waiting for this game since the day I got my Vive, and I am not disappointed. This is the first VR game I've played that has felt like a true videogame. It captures the essence of a PS2 survival horror in an amazing way. While some of the graphics aren't technically stunning, they do an amazing job of setting the vibe. There's something about the stark contrast between the bleak walls and the visceral, sore-ridden enemies that makes me feel like what I'm experiencing is real, and a real threat to me. I don't really know how to explain it. Beyond that, the game's soundtrack is atmospheric and oppressive. I really admire it and I feel it adds so much to the game. Resource management is stressful in a good way that adds extreme tension to every shot you have to take. Despite most enemies being slow, lumbering monstrosities, they twitch and gyrate in ways that make their weak points move just so slightly out of your sweetspot, making them hard to hit in a way that is both fair and creepy, and in an overwhelming situation, each missed shot feels like one strike closer to your death. Some of the early enemies don't feel super threatening, but man, the third enemy type you can encounter nearly made me shit my pants. I just beat the first boss being only a little over an hour into the game, and if the devs are not over-exaggerating with their 5-8 hour estimate. I am SO excited to see what else this game has in store for me. Honestly, even with the little I've played, I could go on and on about how much I love this game.\n\nOne specific thing this game does visually is its use of complete darkness. One of the vive's main graphical limitations is the limited FOV, the black borders around my vision always remind me of the fact that I'm in a game (one day, PiMax, one day) but in a pitch black room illuminated only by a weak but sufficient flashlight, the darkness outside of your light is identical to the black borders. It feels so damn real. The first boss makes AMAZING use of darkness (I won't spoil anything :) ).\n\nThe only thing I dislike about this game are the stairs. I'm pretty much immune to VR sickness, so I have comfort settings at the minimum, but you cannot analog walk up stairs. You click on the railings and it warps you to the top. Not only does this take me out of the game immensely, it also makes me a tad nauseous as everytime you warp up the stairs you have to get a completely new bearing of your surroundings and find the next railing. And a lot of these damn staircases are multi-story. Would love if this could get changed.\n\nIf you can stomach a VR horror game, you owe it to yourself to play this.

It feels like a first person Silent Hill game (I've only played SH3, but it did feel a good bit like that, just in atmosphere, less in symbolic influences). \n\nThe controls are okay, it would be cooler to be able to configure them a bit more, but there's more options to do so than in other games that I've played and the warnings are apt, 'smooth motion' is defineitly an option to avoid x3. You get 2 different types of movement available, Teleport and Locomotion (using the thumbstick to move). I used the locomotion controls and they were pretty good. There are several different camera options as well, for turning and such, Like smooth moving (which you can use the thumbstick to turn your character, which can end up nauseating), or an angle based camera option that when you flick the thumbstick, it'll move your camera like 30 degrees or something to whichever direction you has moved it to (it can be a little finicky. There can be some issues with picking up objects on the ground or in other hiding places as your control of the interaction hand can get 'stuck' in places and not end up highlighting what you need to pick up (or it does, and still doesn't pick it up).\n\nThe gunplay is okay, it's just basic hitscan tech, meaning that you can have trouble telling where your shots are firing at since there's no tracers or anything, but the guns have good ironsights for the most part which will allow you to aim pretty well. There's 3 different weapons that you'll be able to choose from, all still using the same hitscan tech, but each unique enough to be able to be useful in their own right. You can hold up to 2 guns at a time and there are no melee mechanics. \n\nThe inventory management is alight, just standard survival horror stuff, sans inventory tetris. You get 8 inventory slots + 2 for the guns. Using health kits is interesting as you have to use it 'on you' which is neat as it's like sticking needles into your chest and stuff. Items are persistent across levels, which means that if you leave items somewhere, it'll be there when you get back. You get a stash that is available in some areas (mostly next to save points) where you can store items and retreive them from other stashes. On the 'easy difficulty' (there's only 2 difficulty options) you may end up with too many items to fit in your stash and somewhat makes the stash less useful since you're not actually using the items that you're being given. Key items take up inventory room and can also be stored in the stash, the stash is usually found in areas near where you need to use the key items, sans the final area.\n\nEnemy variety is pretty interesting, I counted about 8 or 9, though you'll encounter all but two of them in the first 'area'. Each enemy has different mechanics, such as movement speed, attacks, health, etc. There are 3 bosses, each with different mechanics as well, but in general they are somewhat similar in tactics, with just their arena being significantly different between them. \n\nThe length of the game, while only about 4 hours in play time is a bit of a stretch. The enemy variety, being capped at near the half-way point leaves a bit to be desired near the ending stretch. Introduction of enemies would have been better saved for being spread out over the levels to increase tension of new encounters and such, in my opinion.\n\nThe npcs and the story are pretty good and interesting, though the backstory that you read through the notes scattered through the level aren't terribly interesting. You'll have about 5 different interactions with NPCs across the levels.\n\nThe locations, of which there are about 7, are also pretty cool. The most interesting place, the 'outdoor' city area, also happens to be the most poorly optimized, which causes a ton of framerate dips and such even with a 1080. \n\nOverall this is an Okay/Good game. It could be better, but it's what I would consider to be one of the better if not of the best of the VR survival horror games that are available at the time of this writing.

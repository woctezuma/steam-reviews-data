DoDonPachi DaiFukkatsu)[/h1]\n\n[b]The Good[/b]\n- Really fun and satisfying gameplay\n- Scoring mechanics are god-tier\n- Music is absolute banger\n- Difficulty keeps itself objectively fair while still being absolute insanity\n- A lot of different playstyles to try\n- A multitude of different version releases into 1 package.\n- Movement is really tight and responsive\n- Replayability is at its absolute highest\n- Loads of new stuff to be done as you get better\n- Slowdown being used for making impossible attacks possible.\n\n[b]The OK[/b]\n- The basics of the game can require research via guides or by searching it up\n- Game's difficulty is a bit harsh for those with absolutely no experience\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\n[i]It's really hard to find any[/i]\nuh\n- I guess how all the mechanics are very cryptic and hard to blindly understand, as mentioned above\n\n\nDetailed review below\n\n\nTouhou is to bullet hells, what Guitar Hero is to rhythm games.\non the other side of the spectrum, DoDonPachi (or any CAVE shmup) is to bullet hells, what Beatmania IIDX is to rhythm games.\n\nTouhou has definitely got some fun in it, but it has felt kind of lack luster in recent times. Also most people think of it when Bullet Hell is mentioned.\nDoDonPachi, not anywhere as much people know or play this, barrier to play them is pretty high (like it originally being arcades) and the difficulty can go way off the charts. But all around, it feels much more polished, fun and downright addictive compared to more well-known games.\n\nDoDonPachi Resurrection made me open my eyes during a period where I was playing ZUN games less often and was in need for something refreshingly new and fun. Not only did this game provide me some really fun mechanics, but it also showed how great and fast shmups can be, all along with providing a soundtrack with some of the biggest bangers and a fuck-ton of different modes to play and mess around with.\n\nGameplay by a basic standpoint is fitting term for shmup fun. Moving around, dodging and streaming millions of bullets and huge lasers all the while blasting enemies to bits with millions of bullets and huge lasers in return. Satisfying all around and it never gets old. This is not even going into the depth of it, which is worthy of a couple of long paragraphs. CAVE implemented so many mechanics that somehow blend together so well which makes the gameplay and the scoring system so amazingly fun, and nothing even feels like a gimmick. It makes a clear line which separate the Newbies, Regular Players and the Professionals.\n\nBosses aren't what you'd expect from touhou, I'd rather not compare them but I wanted point out a comment I remember hearing which required bringing it up:\n[i]\"Touhou's boss patterns are meant to look aesthetically pleasing, CAVE boss patterns are made to kill you.\"[/i]\nDespite that, [i]most[/i] bosses are made to be still readable, some of their attacks are pure adrenaline to dodge and the slowdown mechanic makes bosses really eye-opening. In short, they're fun.\n\nThat's going by mentioning the difficulty, this is NOT easy by any means. I still have trouble beating stage 5 without using a continue in 1.5 Normal. With all the bullets covering the screen, believe it or not, but this game isn't unfair. In other words, there's a lot of knowledge and gitting gud required, especially on the topic of the final boss and true final bosses (which is way out of my reach of skill). Similar to IIDX mentioned at the top, you'd need some experience in its genre before trying this.\nThankfully there is a Novice mode for those not wanting to be plopped right at the front lines, but it's still kind of difficult however. :l\n\nThe music in this game fits in one of the many definitions of a Headbanger, and they're all so memorable. You'd listen to the stage music, good electronic stuff. Listen to a true final boss song, good 999bpm electrionic stuff.\nSome examples of the great music from DoDonPachi:\nhttps://youtu.be/sOg-j3DeeNg (DaiFukkatsu - Stage 5)\nhttps://youtu.be/8YvZl5m74IM (DaiFukkatsu BL - Ship Select)\nhttps://youtu.be/6eA8qi5H5BU (DaiFukkatsu BL - Stage 4-B)\nhttps://youtu.be/aesOh9XvYu4 (DaiFukkatsu BL Arrange - Stage 2)\nhttps://youtu.be/BLK6hcbddQs (DaiFukkatsu BL - Zatsuza True Final Boss)\nhttps://youtu.be/hjWyvuDNOcU (SaiDaiOuJou - True Final Boss) --- SDOJ is not in Resurrection\n\nFor a shmup, especially the arcade ones, there would be a lot of focus on how good the replayability is.\nDo I still want to play more after 15 hours of playing the same 5 stages?\nThe answer is Yes, there's so much to do, and as I said the fun gameplay never gets old. You get better and the game gets more enjoyable, making you want to play more. Then you discover new tricks, new mechanics that help, you play more.\nYou get your butt kicked? That's fine, you play more anyway because this game is so bloody good.\n\nIf there is anything you'd gather by this review, Resurrection is not really friendly to brand new shmup players, it can otherwise be scary. The mechanics are hard to figure out without a guide, I remember my first couple of games I didn't know how I died or not die when getting hit. Without a guide, there is going to be a lot of confusion and brain-dead lack of good scores and wondering how the others are doing it so well. That's pretty much the only bad point of the game that my mind can come up with, but the problem can be overcome, so after some research you've got yourself an amazingly fine game to play.\n\nI love this game, I can't stop playing it, I can't stop thinking about it. If you've played bullet hells in the past and have somehow not stumbled upon the DoDonPachi games before, do yourself a favor and buy this. It's got everything to love.\n\n[b]Game Ranking:[/b] A masterpiece of its genre", "timestamp_created": 1513436089, "timestamp_updated": 1513436089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588228", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38175251": {"recommendationid": "38175251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198420808508", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512813324}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01", "timestamp_created": 1512813529, "timestamp_updated": 1512813529, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38146471": {"recommendationid": "38146471", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995909787", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1514492544}, "language": "english", "review": "Sorry.

Though I suppose it had to be for battalions of mechanized armies, swarms of aircraft squadrons, and super weapons of all sizes to be mobilized. DoDonPachi Resurrection is the fourth in this saga of cyclical violence. After the most violent event in its history, the Blissful Death Wars, one would hope for a true lasting peace...though it was never meant to be. The vengeful shadows of the Blissful Death Wars now invade the past, forcing the elite DonPachi Corps' hand into action to preserve the course of human history. A single fighter craft exits the time portal to a past Earth and is immediately beset by legions of foes... welcome to the past, dear pilot, but it's time to die.\n\nI've enjoyed these styles of games casually. They provide a formidable challenge for the uninitiated whilst for myself getting one more stage or wave of bullets further without continuing is reward enough. The essence of the game is shooting for high scores, chaining score boosting hyper charges, and maintaining large multipliers. With 8 modes of play available mastering one version of the game leaves you plenty to look forward to if this is your sort of challenge.\n\nNew to the series are lasers, that you can block with your narrow beam Shot, whilst bullet cancelling is accomplished with your wide fanning Turbo Shot whilst in Hyper mode. You'll appreciate these tools (even if some veterans found it to make it oh so easy) as you weave into the gaps of wave after wave of bullets. Stages that start quite tame suddenly become quite lively as larger foes step forward to protect their lighter brethren. You'll be in quite a zone of focus to succeed even as wave after wave of enemies brilliantly explode at the hands of your arsenal.\n\nSpeaking further about your arsenal, there are three ships to pick from: the red Type A with its powerful narrow firing weapons, the green Type B and its movement controlled weapons, and the blue Type C that fires with the widest fan of bullets. Even after selecting your craft you have three styles of operation to choose from: Bomb Style which emphasizes the availability of bullet discarding Bombs, Power Style which allows you to immediately toggle the strength of your Shot weapons, and finally Strong Style which combines the advantages of the other two styles (at the cost of a higher difficulty). DoDonPachi Resurrection gives the player many choices in how they want to tackle its challenges.\n\nThere's a large array of bosses present in DoDonPachi Resurrection. Not only are you fighting androids styled after those that served in the Blissful Death Wars, there are also returning super weapons from previous Donpachi titles, some are even hidden on exclusive Stage Routes that can only be uncovered by meeting certain conditions in the stage itself... Depending what route you take and how well you struggle a timeless enemy awaits for you at the end of this war displaced across time: the Golden Disaster Hibachi. Will you be able to overcome the final onslaught and see what lies beyond it?\n\nThe emulation of this beloved title is apparently not precise in places.

pegar um true ending? Ou quer mirar na high score, lidar com mec\u00e2nicas complexas de pontua\u00e7\u00e3o e maximizar sua performance?\n\nIrrelevante da sua resposta, DoDonpachi Ressurection, na minha opini\u00e3o, \u00e9 uma das melhores op\u00e7\u00f5es dispon\u00edveis na Steam para quem quer adentrar no universo dos shoot'em up hardcore (talvez um pouco abaixo do Ikaruga).\n\nDonpachi \u00e9 uma franquia dif\u00edcil. Dark Souls, Nioh, Devil May Cry... Nenhum desses jogos \u00e9 um comparativo justo com a dificuldade brutal que a s\u00e9rie apresentou durante os anos:  DoDonpachi Daioujou Death Label demorou anos para ser finalizado, por exemplo. E DoDonpachi Ressurection faz jus: o primeiro level j\u00e1 \u00e9 um bom desafio, que te manter\u00e1 atento em cada pixel da tela. Sua dificuldade \u00e9 arcade: com sistemas que dificultam o jogo dependendo do seu n\u00edvel de habilidade em sua longplay. Para possibilitar que um jogador comum veja parte dos desafios que o jogo apresenta, voc\u00ea tem cr\u00e9ditos infinitos e poder\u00e1 presenciar uns 5 ou 6 levels diferentes, presenciando padr\u00f5es de bala hipnotizantes e se impressionando com os desafios cada vez mais pesados que o jogo proporciona. Entretanto, isso n\u00e3o significa que \u00e9 um jogo ruim para iniciantes do g\u00eanero.\n\nO jogo, na verdade \u00e9 uma cole\u00e7\u00e3o contendo todas as vers\u00f5es do DoDonpachi Ressurection: desde a vers\u00e3o 1.5 facilitada para novatos, at\u00e9 a fren\u00e9tica Black Label, focada mais em pontua\u00e7\u00e3o. Quer uma dificuldade n\u00edvel Donpachi comum? Jogue a 1.5. Quer uma vers\u00e3o mais f\u00e1cil para novatos? Jogue a 1.5 Novice. Mas j\u00e1 vou avisando: \u00e9 um jogo de treino, de aprendizado e pr\u00e1tica. N\u00e3o \u00e9 um jogo que voc\u00ea pode esperar finalizar em poucas horas sem adquirir o jeito do jogo.\n\nMas claro: o jogo n\u00e3o se vende simplesmente pela sua dificuldade. A trilha sonora \u00e9 muito boa e faz at\u00e9 alguns tributos aos jogos mais antigos da s\u00e9rie, menos mel\u00f3dica mas mais r\u00edtmica que Touhou Project. Os gr\u00e1ficos s\u00e3o \u00d3TIMOS para um jogo 2D, muito bem animado e bem polido, mesmo que acabe poluindo muito e confundindo o jogador demais (at\u00e9 para o padr\u00e3o de um STG). A hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 bem profunda para um STG, seguindo a tradi\u00e7\u00e3o da franquia de ter uma narrativa c\u00e9tica e brutal, mesmo que simples. Infelizmente, \u00e9 provavel que n\u00e3o ir\u00e1 entender a hist\u00f3ria se n\u00e3o ler sobre a lore da franquia Donpachi ou se n\u00e3o tiver pego os finais verdadeiros dos jogos passados.\n\nNum geral, \u00e9 uma experi\u00eancia MUITO positiva. \u00d3tima para quem \u00e9 f\u00e3 desse nicho.\n\nSom - 10/10\n   \nGr\u00e1ficos - 8/10 (Perdeu pontos pelo excesso de polui\u00e7\u00e3o visual, ao contr\u00e1rio do seu antecessor Daioujou, cl\u00e1ssico dos arcades.)\n\nJogabilidade - 9/10 (A polui\u00e7\u00e3o visual acaba influenciando na gameplay negativamente, fazendo voc\u00ea errar muito pelo excesso de efeitos visuais. N\u00e3o tirei pontos por dificuldade, pois apela muito bem ao seu nicho.)\n\nNarrativa - 8/10 (Confusa e muito dependente dos jogos antepassados, n\u00e3o presentes na Steam, mas s\u00f3lida.)\n\n\nNota final - 8,75. \n\n\nCONCLUS\u00c3O:\n\n\n\nLonge de ser o melhor jogo da CAVE, mas \u00e9 um \u00f3timo come\u00e7o e um \u00f3timo jogo.\n", "timestamp_created": 1509140606,

"last_played": 1506396298}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, I'd just like to state that I freaking ADORE this game (and I've played this soooooooo much more than my hours here show, over the course of years, via other versions).  As those who know me are surely aware of, I've played about 80 squillion shmups, usually of the bullet hell style, and I tend to favor Cave's games over most others.  As far as I'm concerned, THIS is the greatest of them all. Period. This is, probably, the single highest bit of praise I could ever give to a game.  However, I'm still going to review this in a more objective way, and some of this WILL sound negative.  \n\nDodonpachi is a long-running bullet-hell series, which tends to showcase very well the excitement and absurd levels of challenge of the genre.  Simple idea that any shmup fan is used to:  5 stages, a nasty boss at the end of each.... try not to die.  Preferrably, try to score high in the process of continuing to not be dead.   Also like most games of this type, the difficulty can be extremely brutal.  Bullet hell games are famous for their insane difficulty, with 10 squillion glowing death balls flying all over the screen at once in different directions from a ton of different sources.  When I see a new player going at this type of game for the first time, the reaction is usually \"OMG WTF WTF WTF\" along with lots of random flailing, bombing, and dying.  A bloody miracle if they beat a boss without getting melted.  That's just how this genre goes.\n\nThis game, however, is by far one of the more approachable (in it's main mode... I'll get to that later).  The game features \"hyper mode\", a state you can enter whenever the meter for it fills.  While in hyper mode, your shots will CANCEL enemy bullets, turning them into stars that then earn you tons of points, and raising your combo meter.  Aside from being buckets of fun to do (I love \"cancel\" mechanics in these), this also gives newer players a way out of bad situations.  Things getting overwhelming?  Hyper mode!  Of course, using this mode as a panic button usually results in a low score... as you increase in skill, you'll preferrably learn to use it at the times that are best to score high, rather than best to just keep you from dying.  This type of game really is all about DODGING, after all.  But the existence of and focus on this ability means that the game is great for beginners.   The actual difficulty of the enemy patterns, also, isnt THAT hard.  Most other Cave games (and most bullet-hell games) are outright murderous compared to this.  Well, until you reach stage 5, which is a horrid difficulty spike.... you'll see what I mean when you get there.  I hope someone got fired for that.\n\nThat, however, is just ONE mode, specifically, 1.5.  The game contains EIGHT seperate modes.  Each one uses different scoring systems, mechanics, and can have wildly varying levels of difficulty.  For example, Black Label mode, played with a Strong type ship, and with the meter at the top kept filled (I call it the Pain Meter, because the higher it is, the more berserk the patterns get), the difficulty is outright absurd; the patterns are insane, the bullets start to resist cancelling, they cancel into MORE bullets which then also resist, and all sorts of crazy stuff happens.  Or there's something like Arrange B, a mode with a whole different idea, which constantly intensifies the patterns over the course of many runs depending on how you do.  When that mode is getting loopy, it redefines the word \"insanity\".   With so many modes, this game has something for everyone.  Not just in terms of difficulty, but in terms of gameplay styles as well.  There is even a mode often called \"Ketsupachi\", which combines this with the scoring mechanic of one of Cave's best games, Ketsui, and also has you piloting the helicopter from that game instead of the usual ship.  It's like a love letter to the fans, and it is brilliant.   It'd take a LONG time to explain every mode whatsoever... just know that there's quite alot here.\n\nOverall, fans of the genre are going to find so very, very much to love here.  Of course, this game being what it is, if you DONT like playing games for score, you're definitely going to get much less out of it.  Most shmups are designed from the ground up for score-based play (as such, Score Attack is where you'll want to be most of the time, regardless of mode).  This also means no continues.  You have the option to play with continues if you want, usually for starting out and learning the game, but when in Score Attack, you wont have any, and that's probably best... a game like this isnt ACTUALLY beaten until you can do it without continuing.  And even then, chances are, there's still probably more to it, like a second loop and some sort of ultimate hell boss.  Fortunately those arent required for victory, and only the most hardcore of players will ever see them.  For normal play, there's no need to worry about them (and some modes dont have either).   Also know that even though this game is \"approachable\", newer players are still probably going to die alot.  Expect some possible frustration.\n\nOnto the bad stuff.  There are two main issues that I see with the game.  First:  The replay system is utterly and completely broken.  Dont even bother with it, because much of the time, it doesnt work at all.  Oh, it'll save your replay.  But when you go to play it again, there's a good chance that partway through, it'll \"desync\", and you'll start seeing your ship do things you didnt actually do, smacking into things at random and running out of lives, not showing what ACTUALLY happened at all.   Secondly, there's the slowdown.  As a rule these games have slowdown when there are too many bullets on screen.  It's rather expected with games from the arcade, and in other ports, they do a good job of replicating it properly.  But THIS version screws it up all over the place.  For those players that learned the game through a different version, this can be a huge problem.  Not to mention that some things that were never in the original arcade version are balanced around the original type of slowdown.  They can break down quite hard in this version.  I see it most often in Arrange B, where patterns with a kersquillion tiny shots that previously were slow moving are flung at the speed of sound.  Or other spots may have funky \"micro slowdown\" in odd spots, creating wonky jittering effects.  This all can differ from one PC to the next, I hear.  But even on an ultra high-end machine, you're going to get some weirdness.  I dont think this detracts from the game as a whole, but it's definitely something that needed to be mentioned.   There are a few other issues with the port, but they're much more minor than these.\n\nAnd of course, this has a mean learning curve... \"approachable' is relative to the rest of the genre (and again only in specific modes).  This is for players that are after a true challenge, for those that get satisfaction out of improving their skill and overcoming great difficulty.   So... definitely not for everyone.  And as always with this genre, dont expect a story here.\n\nBut if this is your type of game, well... yeah.  As I said, there's no higher recommendation I can give.  And really, I could rant about this game for pages and pages.  If you like bullet-hell games, do yourself a favor and grab this one right away.

To be specific, slowdown had to be emulated for PCs since hardware is different across systems where the Xbox could throttle the processor until it more or less matches the arcade performance. This causes a few issues, but my biggest problem with it is that situations where I'd expect slowdown to ease in/ease out the transition can be almost instantaneous, so in some situations you're slow-mo weaving through bullets and then suddenly the game's back at regular speed and you're dead or farting out one of your autobombs. Not a good feeling, but you can still play around it.\n\nSo if you want the best way to play it, this probably isn't it - that's the Xbox version.

Dodonpachi this, dodonpachi that; they'd rant and rave about how long they've waited to play this game. So when the time came and the game was finally finished, I purchased it.\n\nDoes it live up to the hype? Read on, fellow gamer.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with games like dodonpachi, it is what is called a \"galaga\" style game. Galaga was a commodore 64 game that was very popular in the early 90s, if you are old enough to remember. The objective is to survive long enough while an onslaught of aliens slowly crept up in front of you all the while you try to kill them with your lasers. Obviously, dodonpachi has better graphics, and a japanimation style, but unfortunately not without problems.\n\nI own a very nice 50\" 4k HDTV and I'm used to being treated to masterpieces like Watch Dogs 2 and Horizon: Zero Dawn, so when I first started up dodonpachi I was expecting comparable graphics. For a game that was made in 2016, it unfortunately disappoints. CAVE (the creators of this game) try to fool you into thinking it is a 4k game by filling the screen with hand drawn oriental cartoon art (me so sneaky!). Unfortunately, the actual play area is confined to an oddly shaped area in the center of the screen. I really don't get it, you've got all this room and you can't figure out a way to use it? Anyway, to top this off I spotted many jaggies and pixelation so the 3D rendering engine must have some bugs or they're not using much anti-aliasing. The 2d inspired graphics look nice, but are far inferior stylistically to the indie artgame masterpieces such as \"brink\" and \"fez\".\n\nThe story is underdeveloped (or perhaps abstruse to the \"gweilo\" mind?) and I don't understand it. There are no cutscenes or anything to explain it. Instead you are thrown directly into thousands of bullets without a why or a what-for. No effort is made to tell you why they are shooting at you, why you are shooting at them, and the story behind it. I felt sort of guilty slaughtering so many enemies without knowing if they were russian or something first. There was no philosophical underpinning- no exploration of deep themes in seminal art games such as gone home or the stanley parable. You have no choices in the game that unlock different endings. You just shoot from your little spaceship, and get to the ending 20 minutes later. Is this really an acceptable level of content?\n\nThe gameplay is slightly more redeeming. You pilot a ship in a 2d plane of movement. This allows you to move along a y axis unlike previous galaga style games, squaring the possibilities. As this was designed for PC (us master race, right? seriously, check out /r/pcmasterrace on reddit), it was built for a keyboard and mouse, allowing great precision compared to, say, a controller, or arcade stick for this style of retrogame. However, my mouse must not have been set up correctly as it did nothing considering this is a pc game. I think you are able to change the yaw or elevation of your craft with your mouse, but I could just not get it working. I use a razer chroma deathadder, as a hardcore gamer and e-sports enthusiast, and perhaps it had too many DPIs for the primitive engine of this game.\n\nAs far as soundtracks go, it is surprisingly quite good. The music fits the levels, and seems to be a form of japanese dubstep. It has a lot of synthesizers, like an 80s style song. It has not caught up to electronic music on the level of skrillex, but for a videogame, it does not disappoint and is great ambient noise for your space battles against the large robot schoolgirl bosses with anime powers (which were a bit offputting, objectifying, a bit misogynistic, and made me sexually uncomfortable, but I can forgive the cultural gap).\n\nAnyway, I easily completed the game in 20 minutes on my first attempt. Besides promising gameplay this is just not the kind of thing for hardcore gamers such as myself. Although it has much artificial difficulty like a game such as dark souls where you constantly die, you immediately are revived by pressing 'continue' right where you left off, making all those deaths pointless, and even rewarded by the game! There are no checkpoints and you just continue indefinitely until you reach the final boss. Where are the alternative endings, or replay value? Where is the extra content that rewards skilled players? Something like a secret level or boss after you beat the game would have been nice, but make no mistake- this is a credit feeder for sure- much like the old arcade games that preceded it. In addition, there is no online multiplayer besides a primitive arcade-style leaderboard for those who try to play the mathematics minigame that gives you higher scores by increasing the numbers on your screen. I barely passed algebra 2 in highschool, and am a sociology major, so I don't find mathematical puzzles in my games to be worthwhile or exciting to pursue. Sadly, I am not a japanese math PhD that can do integrationals and sign/co-sign, and this kind a of contrived form of difficulty is not for me.\n\nAll in all - Dodonpachi? More like dodonpasse. Super Nintendo quality games just don't live up to their contemporaries anymore, and it's time to change. Maybe CAVE should start making mobile phone games, or arcade games, instead. When I am on my pc or console, I want a game to deliver. I want fast paced action oriented multiplayer of a game like overwatch or call of duty, not slow old primitve ones such as quake or unreal tournament. I want the cinematic cutscenes and story of something like watch dogs or jordan peele's postmodern masterpiece \"get out\", not planetscape: tormentor or those black and white snoozefests by that old fat italian guy (felloni? fullani? I can't remember). Some things are better off left in the past. It's time for the japanese to come out of hiding in their caves and accept they lost the war- the videogame war- and incorporate western technology and engrossing stories into their AAA titles.\n\nOverall, I give dodonpachi 7/10 gameplay, 6/10 soundtrack, and 3/10 hardcores, for a cumulative score of 5.85.

Um dieser Entwicklung mit neuen Innovationen in diesem traditionell in 2d gehalttenem Genre entgegenzutreten, zeigte CAVE beindruckend, was mit den damals aktuellen 32-Bit Systemen im 2d-Bereich m\u00f6glich war: Das erste Spiel des mittlerweile legend\u00e4ren Shoot'm Up Entwicklers begr\u00fcndete das Genre der Bullet Hells: Der Spieler sah sich hier erstmals mit bilschirmf\u00fcllenden Kugelteppichen frontiert. Die Danmakus waren geboren - Willkommen in der Kugelh\u00f6lle! Hier suchte man nicht mehr nach Kugeln, denen man Ausweichen musste, sondern eher nach L\u00fccken in den Kugelteppichen, die einen umgaben. Auch das innovative Scoring-System machte Donpachi 1996 zu einem Kulttitel. Auf die \"b\u00f6se Biene\" folgte DoDonpachi, die gro\u00dfe B\u00f6se Biene. Nach einem Ableger f\u00fcr die Playstation 2 hielt mit Dodonpachi Resurrection die Serie auf Microsofts Xbox360 Einzug, und das - im Gegensatz zu seinen Vorg\u00e4ngern - auch in Europa. W\u00e4hrend dieses Spiel einem auf Amazon mittlerweile nachgeschmissen wird - was bei dem Genre keinesfalls die Regel ist - werden f\u00fcr die Editionen des Spiels, welche die zus\u00e4tzlichen Inhalte wie Version 1.5 und Black Label enthalten, auf der Microsoft Konsole durchaus h\u00f6here Summen f\u00e4llig. Au\u00dferdem sind diese zumeist Region-Locked, und daher nicht auf der europ\u00e4ischen Version der Konsole spielbar. Daher ist das auf den ersten Blick unverh\u00e4ltnis teuer erscheinende Angebot hier auf Steam fast schon wieder g\u00fcnstig: Man erh\u00e4lt neben dem Hauptpiel verschiedene alternative Spielvarianten mit neuen Kugelmustern, Waffen und neuen Scoring-Systemen. Insgesamt sind es sechs Modi plus 2 verschiedene Novice-Modi f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger. Mir pers\u00f6nlich gefallen Black Label und Black Label Arange besonders gut. Die unendliche Zufuhr von Punktemultiplikatoren, mit denen gute Kombos in Black Label Arrange belohnt werden, sind einfach unglaublich motivierend. Ohne Zweifel eines der besten Shoot'm Ups hier auf Steam. F\u00fcr Shoot'm Up Fans ist Die R\u00fcckkehr der gro\u00dfen, b\u00f6sen Biene daher Pflicht!\n\nDIe 8 Modi sind:\n\n1.

You really get your money's worth with Resurrection.  Not only are you getting Dodonpachi Daifukkatsu 1.5, you're getting 1.51 (previously Europe-only paid DLC), Black Label, and 3 arrange modes.  1.5 and 1.51 are fairly similar, but even discounting those (and the Novice modes), you still have 5 distinct shmups in this one package!  \n\nAdd onto that the built-in variety of ship types and shot types for those ships, and you have a crazy amount of content and ways to play.  You've got your usual (well, except for Daioujou) Types A, B, and C here.  You can choose between Bomb Style, Power Style, or Strong Style, similar to the Element Dolls system of DOJ or the dresses of SDOJ.  Strong Style had to be unlocked in the arcades, but here they just give it to you.  Bomb Style is your usual \"shot\" type, Power features two modes to switch between with their own properties and is good for scoring but you can't manually bomb, and Strong Style has the best features of Bomb and Power, but your hyper builds very slowly.\n\nThe main gameplay of DFK revolves around bullet cancelling.  When you use your hyper, your shot will cancel enemy bullets, increasing both your score and your chances of survival.  This mechanic, coupled with the unusual 4-button layout, makes DFK a very accessible game for newcomers to the series.  In fact, on my first time picking up Novice mode, I accidentally 1CCed it.  Normal mode does present a number of interesting challenges even for veterans of the DDP series (I'm looking at you, stage 5 laser rings).  Another unique mechanic in DFK is the ability to \"push back\" enemy lasers with your own laser, which is pretty cool.  This is one with both a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling, and it's very satisfying and feels good to play.\n\nArrange A of DFK is \"daioujou\" style.  Instead of building a meter for hypers, you get hyper pickups like DOJ, though you're locked into a particular ship type.  Arrange B is an infinite lives score attack mode where the color of bee pickups and using shot or laser (as well as replaying stages) will determine the strength of enemies and the speed and density of their bullet patterns.\n\nBlack Label introduces the \"RED\" mechanic, where holding down rapid-shot and the laser button at the same time will do a ShotLaser similar to the 360 mode of Saidaioujou.  In that game, using the ShotLaser drained your health.  Here, it increases the RED meter, making enemy patterns more difficult at certain thresholds.  Black Label also gives you the ability to turn off auto-bombing if you like.  Selecting Strong Style in BL will give you the harder Loop 2 patterns from 1.5 right off the bat, making it similar to Expert dress from SDOJ.\n\nBlack Label Arrange is the wonderful \"ketsuipachi\", where you play through Black Label but using the Tiger Schwert ship from Ketsui, complete with lock-on laser and even scoring chips.  The OST is also an arranged version of the Ketsui OST, done by the very skilled Virt.  It can't be overstated how good the music in Black Label Arrange is; it even outclasses the already amazing Black Label OST, in my opinion.\n\nIn most of these modes, you have a 2nd route through each stage (the \"hidden\" or Ura route), featuring more difficult patterns and some throwback midbosses to tickle your nostalgia.  You also have a 2nd loop which can also have 2 routes, as well as a grand total of 3 or 4 TLBs.\n\nI really can't recommend this one highly enough.  If you're a fan of the Dodonpachi series at all, this is a must-have just for the sheer amount of content on offer here.  If you're unsure about whether or not you're a fan, this is an excellent game to cut your teeth on, with its beginner-friendly 4-button layout and bullet canceling mechanic.", "timestamp_created": 1483236343, "timestamp_updated": 1483236982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28883835": {"recommendationid": "28883835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161784019", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507510503}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Exelente juego, adictivo y con un nivel dificultad que permite que entre mas sea jugado sea mas entretenido y relajante de jugar.", "timestamp_created": 1483223358, "timestamp_updated": 1483223358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28876371": {"recommendationid": "28876371", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975983497", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492493760}, "language": "english", "review": "I shoot giant anime girls and beat the living shit out of myself when I fail.\n\nIt's a lot like dating.", "timestamp_created": 1483205879, "timestamp_updated": 1483205879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28850248": {"recommendationid": "28850248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076191562", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483762193}, "language": "english", "review": "This game destroyed my free time many years back, and now that it's on steam with all the arrange modes (and you don't have to hack/get a japanese xbox to run them) is probably going to consume a couple more hours again.\n\nFirst impressions are that the port is pretty well done and sports the features you'd expect of a decent port.

They are the masters of bullet hell. And this game... DoDonPachi Resurrection, or DoDonPachi DaiFukkatsu as it's known overseas, is pretty much their magnum opus. As per the norm for the genre, as soon as you start the game you'll be wading through bullets as you fight your way to the end of the stage to the final showdown with each stage's main boss, which always comes in the form of a transforming giant robot girl.\n\nIf that sounds weird, then you've obviously not experienced the signature weirdness of Cave's games (which I for one find quite charming TBH). Cave consistently makes great games with bizarre settings that definitely are not cliche by any standard, and that just adds to the appeal in my opinion. Add to that the high production values and replayability of the experience and you have a damn sweet package. As always the artwork is amazing with massive sprites that fill the screen (the giant robot boss girls are pretty cool too!), and the soundtrack is nice all around.\n\nOn top of all that is a deep scoring system that will take quite a long time to master the intricacies of, as well as the fact that EVERY revision of DodDonPachi Resurrection is included in the package, from the original all the way up to Black label Arrange for a total of 8 versions. Each one has multiple ships and multiple playstyles per ship, so there's enough variation here that you won't get bored of blowing the clothes off giant robot babes. So what are you waiting for?

Every stage features a mid-boss as well. Whatever stage you're playing, they feel handcrafted. It is worth noting that the exacting enemy positioning can be overwhelming for less inclined players. \n\n[b]The bosses[/b] are unique and vary greatly in difficulty. From the \"yeah, I can do that just fine\" stage one boss, to the \"how am I supposed to win\" true last boss there is a little something for everybody. However, in order to get a 1cc you will need to practice each one for consistancy.\n\n[b]The loops and routes[/b] add another layer of complexity to this game. For a 2-all you're required to clear the game twice in a row on one credit. Additionally, the game features two seperate routes through its stages, each route having its own mid-boss as well. The alternative route is relatively easy to get into, but staying in it gets progressively harder. Newcomers will find themselves sticking to the \"normal\" route for quite a bit of time, before they can handle the secret route consistantly enough.\n\n[b]The scoring system[/b] in the flagship modes is the traditional DoDonPachi combo system, which requires you to build a \"kill-combo-chain\" throughout each stage for maximum scoring. It is also a very unforgiving scoring system, because even a small mistake can cost you an entire scoring run, when you find your chain being reset to zero. If you're anything like me, you will want to try pushing your score after getting comfortable with the game, and this is where frustration can quickly set in. This game asks a lot of you, if you want to score somewhat properly, and at times it might seem as if the game does not respect your time when it drops your chain and you can't do anything about it anymore, because you messed up something along the way.\n\n[b]The training mode[/b] is the most comprehensive and customizable one of any CAVE game I have seen here on steam to this point. Routes, loops, midbosses and bosses can all be selected in the training mode, which is as close to \"savestate-practice\" as you can possibly get, though you will find yourself doing things you don't want to practice many times over, just to get to the one particular spot that you have issues with. Nevertheless, if you're anything like me, this is where you will spend most of your time, and once you've figured out what's what in terms of options available, it becomes a nice tool.\n\n[b]The O.S.T[/b] is killer, and it's available as DLC as well. It is so good that the DLC was an instant purchase for me. No regrets.\n\n[b]If you want to get started with this game[/b] you will simply have to accept that [b]it does not come with a manual[/b]. As is par for the course for CAVE, they simply can't be bothered to explain even the most basic mechanics of this game in any way shape or form. Not even a lousy .pdf covering the most basic mechanics. If you want to learn how scoring works, or what the \"hyper-mode\" can and can't do while performing certain shot-types, your best friend is your search engine of choice. In short: No manual, no tutorial, nothing at all.\n\n[h1]The summary[/h1]\n+Lots of replayability\n+Different ship types and styles\n+Nicely designed stages\n+Unique boss encounters\n+Great OST\n\n+/- Comprehensive training mode, unfortunately poorly explained\n\n-Not necessarily accessible for newcomers\n-punishing scoring system\n-No manual, no tutorial", "timestamp_created": 1479305987, "timestamp_updated": 1479306217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612031", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26624168": {"recommendationid": "26624168", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989801201", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476565742}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is freaking awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1479262554, "timestamp_updated": 1479262554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26447882": {"recommendationid": "26447882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063075931", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478990441}, "language": "english", "review": "[u] This review is only for usage by earthlings! [/u]\n\nDoDonPachi is one of CAVE Interactive's first games, and it seems to be upheld as a classic in bullet hells. But is this just some weeaboo, overhyped trash, or does DoDonPachi still hold up to its reputation after all these years?\n\nNote: DoDonPachi: Resurrection is 29.99 USD because it features both the base game, the \"Special\" edition, and Black Label. These are older/newer versions of the game that play out differently. \n\n[u] Gameplay [/u]\n\nGameplay, as you'd expect, is in standard bullet hell fashion. The basics are simple, you play as a ship that flies through an auto-scrolling battlefield while dodging and dishing out walls of bullets. What makes DoDonPachi unique is its switch system between fire types. You have normal bullets/missiles, and then you have the beam. The high-powered beam, also known and to be referred to as, The Laser, is a powerful beam of energy that slows your ship down exponentially, doing heavy damage to anything in its radius... but more importantly, it also deflects enemy lasers as well, which is very important when fighting enemies with powerful, slow moving laser projectiles. This mechanic is fairly well placed into the game, never feeling unnecessarily overused or infrequent.\n\nYour normal bullets/missiles do the job just as well though, minus the laser clearing part, and for the most part, everything feels nice. From being a badass and having a standoff with another laser enemy (think Dragon Ball Z but with aircraft) to blowing up entire stations of turrets and wiring, you'll never get bored. You also get a real arcade-y sense from the game, which makes sense considering its an arcade port. \n\n[u] Story [/u]\n\nThe story is a bit hard to describe without spoiling, but it takes place after the events of DoDonPachi: DaiOuJou, and (in)directly follows on. It's nothing particularly special but it's got a nice twist and multiple endings, if you're that kind of player. Weirdo. \n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\n\nDespite being an arcade port, the game still looks absolutely beautiful. Everything looks nice and is wonderfully animated, especially the Elemental Doll bosses, who transform on-the-fly and jitter as they take damage. It's certainly outdated looking, but damn if it isn't still mesmerizing to watch some of the backgrounds and enemies. \n\n[u] Overall [/u]\n\nDefinitely a bullet hell worth your price. Not some indie game pretending to be the real thing or a shoddily made gamemaker file, this is the quality stuff you've wanted if you're a schump player. Recommended if you like this kind of stuff.\n\nShotia is the best, by the way.

Et si l\u2019iPhone devenait la console de jeu des shoot\u2019em up au m\u00eame titre que les consoles class\u00e9es Oldies? Depuis quelques temps, les sorties de ce genre se font plus nombreuses. Preuve que le genre plait aux fans de la marque Apple, les gros \u00e9diteurs, comme Irem et son c\u00e9l\u00e8bre R-Type ou Taito et Space Invaders par exemple, n\u2019h\u00e9sitent pas \u00e0 ressortir de leurs tiroirs d\u2019antiques titres sortis \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 80. Avec succ\u00e8s. D\u2019autres, sortent simultan\u00e9ment leurs productions sur Xbox 360 en version japonais \u00e0 notre grand regret (sauf pour Espgaluda 2, lisible sur les machines Eur.), comme c\u2019est le cas avec Dodonpachi Resurrection sur l\u2019I-Phone. Quel plaisir !\n\n. Br\u00e8ve analyse\nSega et quelques autres \u00e9diteurs sont entr\u00e9s dans la br\u00e8che des portables. Il est vrai que des jeux comme Streets of Rage ou Espgaluda II ont retrouv\u00e9 une nouvelle jeunesse aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un nouveau public, avide de nouvelles technologies qui se penche malgr\u00e9 tout sur le pass\u00e9 culturel vid\u00e9oludique.\n\n. L\u2019arcade \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main\nLes titres r\u00e9cents qui sortent sur l\u2019Apple Store rivalisent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d\u2019ing\u00e9niosit\u00e9 et nous font passer d\u2019excellents moments.\nC\u2019est le cas de ce Dodonpachi Resurrection. Derri\u00e8re un nom \u00e0 \u00ab dormir debout \u00bb, se cache en fait la suite d\u2019un jeu sorti dans les salles d\u2019arcade en 1996, d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par Cave et \u00e9dit\u00e9 par Atlus. R\u00e9f\u00e9rence du genre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, ce jeu est class\u00e9 dans les maniac shooter, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les tirs envahissent litt\u00e9ralement l\u2019\u00e9cran. Ce style a permis de relancer les shoots them up dans les salles d\u2019arcade, en les pla\u00e7ant au m\u00eame titre que la gamme des versus fighting. \nNiveau sc\u00e9nario dans Dodonpachi Resurrection c\u2019est un peu comme parler de dialogues avec pour acteur le gouvernator Arnold Schwarzenegger. C\u2019est juste n\u2019importe quoi. D\u2019ailleurs, on s\u2019en passe volontiers : on est l\u00e0 pour tirer sur tout ce qui bouge sans se poser de questions. H\u00e9 oui, comme dans un film de Schwarzie justement !\n\n. Pur maniac shooter\nDans Dodonpachi Resurrection, le joueur dirige au choix trois vaisseaux dont l\u2019armement diff\u00e8re suivant le mod\u00e8le choisi. Quel que soit votre choix, rassurez-vous, cela a peu d\u2019incidence sur la suite du jeu : la puissance de feu de votre vaisseau est impressionnante, une v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9monstration de force qui fait peur \u00e0 voir ! L\u2019\u00e9cran est perp\u00e9tuellement rempli de vos tirs et de ceux de vos ennemis. On ne sait plus o\u00f9 donner de l\u2019\u0153il ! Un v\u00e9ritable feu d\u2019artifice !\nChose remarquable dans ce titre, contrairement \u00e0 d\u2019autres productions, ici on ne perd pas de vie quand on se fait toucher par un tir adverse. Un choix judicieux quand on voit ce que l\u2019ennemi nous balance dans les gencives ! Non, comme dans un bon jeu de baston, on dispose d\u2019une jauge de vie qui diminue \u00e0 chaque impact que l\u2019on re\u00e7oit. Bien \u00e9videmment, si la jauge venait \u00e0 se vider totalement, la partie de terminerait imm\u00e9diatement. Logique. Au joueur de se montrer le plus habile possible afin d\u2019\u00e9viter ce genre d\u2019inconv\u00e9nient.\nSi on se prend des impacts, cela influent sur notre jauge de vie, sachez que cela a aussi une incidence sur vos tirs. En effet, on d\u00e9bute une partie \u00e0 pleine puissance de ses moyens. L\u2019ennemi, d\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res secondes du jeu s\u2019en prend plein les dents. Malheureusement pour vous, si vous vous faites toucher, vos tirs deviennent moins puissants, donc moins efficaces, alors que vos adversaires sont toujours aussi nombreux et vous allument comme des canards un jour d\u2019ouverture de chasse.\n\nRassurez-vous, l\u2019op\u00e9ration n\u2019est pas irr\u00e9versible. En effet, chaque ennemi abattu laisse apparaitre de petites \u00e9toiles. Si vous en r\u00e9coltez suffisamment, cela regonfle votre \u00e9nergie et votre potentiel de feu retrouve alors toute sa superbe. Une puissance qu\u2019il vaut mieux conserver quand on fait face aux boss de fin de niveau. Ils sont d\u2019une redoutable efficacit\u00e9 et font feu de tout bois. C\u2019est dans des moments comme ceux l\u00e0 qu\u2019il faut utiliser votre botte sp\u00e9ciale\u2026\nEt cette botte est constitu\u00e9e de trois boutons qui sont plac\u00e9s sur la gauche de l\u2019\u00e9cran. Une fois qu\u2019on les actionne, ils permettent de d\u00e9clencher une variation de tir, comme un laser puissant par exemple, ou encore de l\u00e2cher une lourde bombe sur l\u2019\u00e9cran. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les ennemis la sentent passer et les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts provoqu\u00e9s sont tr\u00e8s lourds.\n\n\n. Le shoot \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de main\nQue dire, vous avez dans votre portable, sans doute l\u2019un des shoots them up les plus dynamiques. L\u2019avantage du format reste son tarif tr\u00e8s abordable face au support original ou la conversion sur Xbox 360 (version japonaise).\nAvec une r\u00e9alisation au top, Dodonpachi Ressurection pourrait bien \u00eatre le renouveau du genre et apporter une nouvelle joie pour les gamers de tout genre. De plus, la prise en main reste un mod\u00e8le du genre, tout s\u2019anime \u00e0 la perfection. J\u2019ai constat\u00e9 quelques l\u00e9gers ralentissements, mais ceci est bien souvent volontaire pour les maniac shooters.\nConnaissant tr\u00e8s peu la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Cave, le n\u00e9ophyte ne pourra qu\u2019appr\u00e9cier les talents de cet \u00e9diteur japonais, on sent toute l\u2019adr\u00e9naline d\u2019un grand jeu. Certes l\u2019\u00e9motion que procure ce titre montre un v\u00e9ritable enthousiasme et on d\u00e9sirait bien avoir d\u2019autres p\u00e9pites dans ce domaine que ce soit portable ou console de salon.\n\nA l\u2019heure o\u00f9 les graphismes et autres technologies se placent en avant pour impressionner les joueurs, le jeu vid\u00e9o a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 perdre son \u00e2me. Heureusement que la r\u00e9sistance s\u2019organise avec quelques \u00e9diteurs de talents, montrant que la puissance sans la maitrise n\u2019apportent que des titres fades. Le shoot them up au d\u00e9but restait un genre r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 une certaine \u00e9lite, mais \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent et avec l\u2019influence des portables dans ce cadre, les shoots peuvent donner du plaisir \u00e0 tous et Dodonpachi Ressurection en fait d\u00e9sormais partie.", "timestamp_created": 1478176080, "timestamp_updated": 1478176154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5,

DoDonpachi Resurrection (Daifukkatsu) is the 5th game in the DoDonpachi line and in it you play as 1 of 3 futuristic jets in a vertical shooter to destroy an enemy army who are lead by giantess flying loli.   DoDonpachi Resurrection is filled with nice looking sprites which have great animation that crowd the screen with an insane amount of bullets to dodge.  The music is pretty pumping and the flashing particles make you feel like you're on the dance floor.  I can't stress enough how much action you get out of this title. \n\nBut, with all this there is a down side.  For the price you get 5 stages to play.  Sure you can play the 5 stages remixed 8 ways, with different difficulties and enemy/visual arrangement, but it's mostly the exact same.  So the way I see it you're paying $5 per stage and a stage maybe takes wo and a half minutes to beat.  That's pretty poor mileage!  In contrast the game for cellphone in Japan is $17.   I don't feel you get a good deal with this so here's what I'm going to tell you:  These Cave titles go on sale for something like $9.99 a few months in, so unless you make bank or have low living expenses wait a little bit until this seems like a good investment.  \n\nI'm still recommending it though since it's a good game.", "timestamp_created": 1477254541, "timestamp_updated": 1477254541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.416627", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26184397": {"recommendationid": "26184397", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977492300", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505814926}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the prettiest shmup ever made, with one of the best sound tracks in any game.

If you have never played done before then it is more like an action puzzle game which sees you avoiding patterns and waves of bullets while shooting at enemies. As with most shmups the game is short but designed to be played on progressively harder difficulties and perfected. \n\nThe scoring in the game is key, each time you kill an enemy a timer starts\u2026 kill another before the time ends and a combo gauge starts to build up. As the combo builds the score you get for each kill increases. There are also a number of ways to kill certain enemies with certain weapons to fill the hyper meter. When using your hyper weapon, the combo gauge fills super-fast and gives you extra bonuses but at the expense of increasing the game\u2019s difficulty. \n\nPure Bullet Hell shmups are a very niche subgenre but Cave are experts at them and this is one of the best. \n\nI would also recommend Deathsmiles which we reviewed a few months ago. \n\nThis review came from our Shmup special which can be found here: [url=http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-examines/161022_game-tutors-shmups-special] Shmup Special[/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1477179885, "timestamp_updated": 1477179885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26170834": {"recommendationid": "26170834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049436130", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507168231}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best bullet hells ever made finally on steam\n\nthanks degica\n\nalso the port wasnt a hot mess on release so thanks for that", "timestamp_created": 1477170329, "timestamp_updated": 1477170329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519231", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26169434": {"recommendationid": "26169434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212048707", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 2779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513728629}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing through Mushihimesama I was very excited to learn that CAVE would be releasing another game on Steam.  While I would have preferred Mushihimesama Futari, I wasn't about to turn down the possibility of playing an entry in their longest running shooting game series.  DoDonPachi Resurrection (also known as DoDonPachi DaiFukkatsu) was released in Japanese arcades in May 2008.  Since then it has been released on Xbox 360 and mobile devices.  Perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise that this is the game CAVE chose after having already made it so widely available.\n\nPresumably in an effort to entice individuals that already purchased the game on other platforms, the Steam edition of DoDonPachi Resurrection is the most complete version available.  Unlike Mushihimesama, there is no gameplay related DLC.  There are an almost overwhelming number of modes including: 1.5, 1.51, Arrange A, Arrange B, Black Label, and Black Label Arrange.  Although there are basic similarities between the modes, each one is essentially a different game.  There is so much content that it's a little overwhelming if you're not already familiar with everything.  The game doesn't offer much of an explanation for anything. I searched the internet to learn about the differences between modes.\n\nI won't go into a detailed description of everything because it would require pages of text.  The feature that really defines DoDonPachi Resurrection is the hyper ability.  Ships can enter hyper mode for a brief period of time after filling the hyper gauge.  While hyper is active your bullets destroy enemy fire.  This can be used not only for surviving tricky situations, but is also an important part of the scoring system.  If hyper is used excessively it becomes less effective and floating \u201cdanger lasers\u201d will appear and attempt to shoot you down.  Other notable features of the game are secret boss routes and special loops.  Depending on the game mode, there are hidden loops that can be accessed by fulfilling certain requirements. Although the game doesn't explicitly tell you about it, there are a wide range of difficulty  options available.  A simple 1-ALL (a clear without continuing or looping) with strong style should be achievable for newer players while a 2-ALL of the second secret loop with power style will challenge shooting game veterans.\n\nWhatever your goal is, be it survival or score, it's probably going to take practice.  You'll likely find yourself repeatedly playing the same stages to seek perfection.  Fortunately, all of the OSTs are outstanding.  Black Label in particular has some of the best tracks I've ever heard in a shmup.  The graphics are beautiful as well.  Not only do the ships look cool, but the hit box is made clear by glowing at all times.  As much as I enjoy the graphics I do have a few criticisms.  The game crashed the first time I switched to full screen, though it did work correctly once starting it again.  I also experience quite a bit of screen tearing.  There isn't an in game v-sync option either.  I've read it's possible to toggle in one of the .ini files but haven't bothered to check it out because I'd rather not have the v-sync input lag.  Lastly, the default language on release day was Japanese.  It was easily fixed by going into the options, but it made me wonder if they bothered to test the game at all before releasing it.\n\nSadly, the aforementioned graphical/menu issues aren't the only problems with this port (as of October 22, 2016).  Black Label Arrange has extra slowdown, making that mode easier than it would be under normal circumstances.  The opposite is true in Arrange A which has missing slowdown.  Personally, this didn't bother me because I was primarily interested in the arcade modes and they work fine.  If those modes are a main selling point for you, it might be more of an issue.  I've had a great time with this game so far, and have found it to be one of the most enjoyable shooting games I've played in some time. I'd recommend this game, but with the caveat that two arrange modes do not work properly and may never be fixed.  DoDonPachi Resurrection is a whole lot of fun and still has a ton of content even if you ignore those two modes.\n\nNovember 20, 2016 - edit: A few days ago there was a patch that fixed the excessive slowdown in Black Label Arrange.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review?

Oh and the games pretty good too. At first glance, since I have never been a die hard CAVE fan, but love smhups and only a casual gamer, it seems it glitches out. But after some discussion with others who know why its there it puts things in perspective. There are a few different styles of game, so at first its a little hard to take all in. But give it a chance, personally i prefer Novice Blacklabel. I find if i shoot a certain way it makes everything move slower, I've still not really gotten my head around it, but it does make it easier and funner. Because dying isnt fun. I'm not a 1CC kind of dude in bullet hell games, nor am I really sure what TATE even means. I will not being learning Japanese to understand Touhou. $33CAD for a game that I will not get heavily into is almost not worth it to someone like me. But I can say its a great addition to anyone who has any interest at all in shmups. But I do find there are some really die hard fans out there ready to clear up any confusion you have with this game. It has a certain amount of deep strategy in it. There have already been a few minor updates that have seemed to make it a little more enjoyable, so its not abandonware out of the gate.

seeing as how it would be freaking impossible for these guys match slowdown from static hardware to that of dynamic hardware. \n\nYou ask most people who have bought this game who aren't elitist diehards who own PCBs of the originals and they will tell you that this is an awesome game. And THAT is all you need to know. You have people who don't want others to enjoy a different version of DoDonPachi, because to them it's some kind of sacrilegious act since scores from this version can't be compared to scores from other versions. \n\nI sort of had this mindset with Cave's first release on STEAM with Mushihimesama and I quickly learned to just look at these releases as stand-alones. It causes less stress and it helps me enjoy the game. Cave is releasing these games so that they can hopefully bring in thousands of new fans instead of pleasing a handful of grumpy elitists. They need to continue going this route. \n\nDoDonPachi Resurrection is a fantastic package offering up numerous modes of play that I still need time to explore. Each mode brings different dynamics that require the player to put in more time to master. Patterns are different, ships are different, scoring mechanics are different, speed is different. You're basically getting thousands of dollars of arcade games in one neat bundle for around $26 (during the sale). \n\nYou've got fantastic art direction with all the designs of the enemies, backgrounds, player's ships, bullet spreads, sparkly bonus items, and debris/explosion. Every thing is just a joy to behold while playing the game. It's pretty destracting, but in a good way. I'll end up losing concentration and getting destroyed because I just want to take the time and enjoy the hard work that went into creating these wonderful designs. \n\nMusic and sound design are also top notch. The music helps me focus while the sounds from attacks and explosions help me feel like I'm an unstoppable force of complete annihilation. \n\nTechnically this game does have it's issues in terms of a boss disappearing on stage 5 of BLA and some unwarranted slowdown (this I don't care about because I never played the original releases and could care less). But if you've bought products from Degica before they are quick to release patches. Hell, they've already released 3 patches since the game's release YESTERDAY. Even on just now as of writing this to fix the sound tracks. When you buy from Degica you know you're going to get support for your software. Unlike other companies like Koei Tecmo. \n\nIf you're hesitant about buying this game don't be. Don't listen to the elitists. They are just angry people who don't want others to enjoy a different version of their precious games. Hopefully Cave releases something brand new on this platform so they can argue about nothing.", "timestamp_created": 1476505868, "timestamp_updated": 1476505868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38,

Daifukkatsu (quinto della serie dal lontano 1995) uscito prima arcade nelle sale giapponesi (2008) poi esclusivo su Xbox 360 (2010 JPN, 2011 USA, EU 2012) e qualche parentesi su mobile. Pazzesco shmup verticale classico appartenente a un sottogenere definito bullet-hell/manic shooter/danmaku, inferno letterale di proiettili da schivare fronteggiando al tempo stesso muri di nemici e boss giganteschi. Istinto e riflessi sovraumani (sperando che le dita li seguano) vanno uniti alla gestione millimetrico-chirurgica del proprio hit point sulla nave, arrivando ad esaltare le capacit\u00e0 del giocatore partita dopo partita (con ovvia ricompensa nello score). Non mi dilungo sui vari meccanismi e novit\u00e0 introdotte in questo episodio come l\u2019assenza di classici Power Up, gauge dell'Hyper, moltiplicatori, modalit\u00e0 di fuoco/bombe e livelli segreti. Baster\u00e0 dire che a differenza del crudo arcade il tasso di sfida sar\u00e0 ben modulabile (sacrificando classifiche e achievements) e troveremo una versione novice del gioco per imparare i fondamentali. La versione PC in pratica mutua il port su 360, quindi HD rimasterizzato pi\u00f9 le versioni extra 1.51, Black Label e i seguenti arrange, sostanzialmente tutti aggiornamenti e rivisitazioni dello stesso gioco per il mercato arcade. Tristemente siamo a constatare come il giappone videoludico odierno sia in declino, ed \u00e8 un dato di fatto. Ma se qualcosa resiste da 40'anni dove i giappi non scazzano mai \u00e8 negli sparatutto a scorrimento e qui ne abbiamo un capolavoro assoluto, per gameplay e direzione artistica (sia grafica che sonora). \nMi preme ricordare che il timing di gioco \u00e8 basso ma contate almeno una trentina di ore di giocato passato all'epoca su 360.\n\nVi lascio con un paio di curiosit\u00e0. La serie di DoDonPachi \u00e8 storica per esser stato il precursore di questa derivazione degli shmup tradizionali nati a fine anni '70. Dopo orge di cloni con Galaga e Space Invaders (grazie Namco), un abbozzo 3D con Space Harrier di SEGA, si giocava fondamentalmente ai vari shooter a scorrimento made in Capcom e i 1940, Taito e gli Xevious/Darius, Konami con Gradius/Twinbee ed Irem con R-Type, sembrava che gli sbocchi fossero finiti. Il terremoto arriver\u00e0 per mano di Toaplan con Batsugun (1993) e dal triste fallimento di questa company i membri chiave si riorganizzarono formando la Cave con il lancio del primo DoDonPachi e da allora un botto dietro l'altro, contrastati solo dalla combo Radiant Silvergun e Ikaruga dei Treasure.

DDP DFK builds up from it's previous installment by pushing a more understanable scoring and chaining system, far more bullets on the screen, and a more easier to grasp and use Hyper system to give the player more tools and options to survive and score large. This installment comes with the notable 1.5, 1.51, Arrange A&B, and then the long desired Black Label and the fan nicknamed \"Ketsuipachi\" arranged with Jake \"Virt\" Kauffman's soundtrack fully intact, a first for oversea players to obtain without importing!\n\nWhile it is a first for the entire DDP DFK experance to be together at last as a single package, there did come a lot of current issues in turn that hopfully will be fixed in the future. As it stands, the Arrange A suffers from the lack of slowdown period, leading towards it being far harder then ever intended, while in turn the \"Ketsuipachi\" suffers from FAR more slowdown then it should have at all, making it's experance far easier then it should be. Add onto this that the Stage 5 boss might not even show up visable, andd the OST currently corrupted with static, and the package feels almost rushed in many ways. Given it's somewhat steep asking price, and the fact that most people buying the will more then likely find theirself only playing Black Label/BLA, it might be best to hold off buying till fixes are applyed. Otherwise if you're willing to look past these flaws, this is the most complete DDP DFK package to date, and it's PC release ensures that you'll not need to hunt down a JP 360 ever again.",

I've only played the 360 version at conventions and rarely at friends houses in the past, so to have the game to play whenever I like is a boon. I've only ran through the game once, but it plays fantastically-- 60fps with no lag (other than the pre-programmed lag that Cave puts in, which is totally acceptable.)\n\nFor those that have never played a Cave shmup before, or for those that aren't into the shmup genre as a whole, I don't really know if I'd recommend it. But for someone that's either a shmup fan or looking to get into it, this is a great place to start-- the music is memorable and addictive, the game as a whole is challenging but not COMPLETELY impossible, and the game is much-better built on launch than Mushihimesama was when it first came out. \n\n[spoiler]Now to grind until I can face Hibachi.[/spoiler]\n\nEDIT: If you're having trouble getting used to the Z/X/C/V four-button setup that is the default with the keyboard, try rebinding V to the spacebar. Using space to hit hypers is a lot easier if you're more used to the Touhou style of \"holding in one button for constant fire and holding in another to focus your fire & slow down movements\" like I am.\n\nEDIT 2: This initial review was written before the details of the soundtrack being free DLC for the first week were announced.

The Developers deserve all the praise in the world for creating such a unique experience. But it does need some improvements. \n\nFirst I'd like to see a clearer persentage meter for the stars (as is I have no clue what levels I need to replay to get 100% because I'm in around 98% - 99%, which is visually identical too 100% and there is no way of seeing what persentage I'm actually on) or make the star system more generous (like not needing 100% but instead 90% or 95%).\n\nSecond please make leaving the stage, when you reach the check point thing, optional. There were far too many instances of me trying to get 100% and accidently touching the check point because it was in the way of the only secure route I had to an objective. Kicking me out and my only option being to replay the entire level.\n\nThird eating and building objects is tediously precise, any movement disrupts any clay you touch so building the pyramid for example had me spending far to long repetadly building one square - building the second square - slightly damaging my previous square- and repeat several times. I would just recomend not making the requirements so perfect, a little more margin for error would go a long way.\n\nFourth If we are not to jump, could we instead have more control over the rewind function, like rather then just 0 - 100mph it could slowly speed up so if you need to make a quick/small rewind, that you don't overshoot were you want to be.\n\nAnd that's it, hopefully after some more levels and variety in objectives, maybe a more fleshed out sound track and I could see this game as a true PC classic.", "timestamp_created": 1514222508, "timestamp_updated": 1514223520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554250", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38658453": {"recommendationid": "38658453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119589659", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514202606}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is great, artistic, lively and makes you like a child again", "timestamp_created": 1514209475, "timestamp_updated": 1514209475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38656291": {"recommendationid": "38656291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335271676", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514204874}, "language": "english", "review": "You need a good PC or it will never load I still recommend it if your PC is good and how do u get a refund", "timestamp_created": 1514205058, "timestamp_updated": 1514205058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38654286": {"recommendationid": "38654286", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999638883", "num_games_owned": 1186, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514142684}, "language": "english", "review": "Claydream =)", "timestamp_created": 1514200639, "timestamp_updated": 1514200639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38583147": {"recommendationid": "38583147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042192591", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512639188}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a relaxing and satisfying game.

For this, you use the amazing real-time clay deformation physics to carve, create and destroy your way through this 100% moldable world. You can possess different objects and different shapes, get on a clay rocket and fly around, possess a clay tap and spray \"water\" all over the level, create pathways, destroy others, duplicate your own form to creat platforms, make yourself bigger, change into all kinds of different shapes. The game currently has 16 levels that show you all of the crazy things you are able to do in this game and how to mold its world. While there are only sixteen levels currently, the later ones can be quite long and are filled with many objectives. Each level also has time leaderboards which increases replayability for speedrunners. The devs plan to continously add new levels as the Early Access continues. In addition to this, the game also has a sandbox/level creator mode that allows you to screw around on a world of your own creation, and even add different objectives and goals, levels you can then share with the rest of the community thanks to the wonderful Steam Workshop support.\nThe game also supports local multiplayer which is amazing fun especially in the sandbox mode.\nThe game is extremely satisfying and it's finally a great implementation of the crazy physics tech demos people have seen shown around in game in recent years, finally making use of them in a actual game to great effect. And runs pretty well on even modest computers. \n\nThis is a game I heartily recommend to everyone. At 9.99$ in the current sale, and with the full launch planned for early 2018, this is the time to jump in.

So I decided to make my own bridge with the reverse/clone mechanic which reverses time and creates a clone of your shape in the position you iniate the reversal - this means you can create things by replicating your shape over and over. It worked really well and I bounced on my badly formed bridge to victory! \n\nIt just made me realize that there's alot of potential in user creations (which are included as the game has a whole editor mode and a community sharing hub all setup already!) which will really take advantage of this awesome physics system.

It is absolutely gorgeous there is so much to look at, and it really takes a good bit of work to finish the levels. I can't wait to play some more levels and see what is in store for me next! I definitely recommend getting this game. You will be amazed! I also recorded it if you are interested in checking that out.

This game truly pushes the tech further and just playing with the realtime liquids makes one happy. The music and atmosphere is nice and relaxed :) Game has a lot of promise and it comes with and editor for making and sharing your own levels. Pre made levels are nice, but it left me wanting more. The game is early access so I'm sure they will expand and add more content. I suppose thats where the community comes in too: I can see ppl making amazing stuff with the editor. \nThere are surely some bugs to be found (early access) but the game feels really polished for what it is. Plays really well with controller too. I was testing this game in closed beta, so I played some earlier builds too. Good progress since then, feels really promising.

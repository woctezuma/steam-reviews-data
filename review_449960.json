This game realy got alot of love and you can feel it. This game feels like Diablo 3 should. Great sound, great gameplay and nice story! And overall finaly again a game which try to be diffrent and realy be it! Overall you can say this game is a real jewel in the ARPGs, its unfinished and need some polishing but this game can be as good as Diablo 1/2 was in there best times!\n\nOn the card dynamic for the skills i was skeptic, but this got the game was Diablo 3 absolute missed - Possibility to creat your own playstyle. In Diablo was always like, which season is buffed / nerfed and what built you can have to play. Here you can choose your own playstyle and after you finished you start collecting better cards, which realy let you try diffrent playstyles. \nThe MOBs are realy interessting new. There are realy kinda diffrent combats than the most ARPGs out there, you not simple smash tones of them, you have to do them in the right why to be faster. Like one type of enemy which you can't smash all the time, because than you healed itself. (Well you cant do anyway but it took ages to kill them). diffrent card combos better attacks, against diffrent enemys.\nAnother realy interessting aspect is that the MOBs dont have a \"level\", there are simply have tiers, as more as you kill of a special type of monster as more it upgrades itself and got new skills. This concept is very interessting and i love it much, with this you fight against the same type, but sometimes you think yourself \"oh, didn't expect this\" on there attacks.\n\nThere are 3 (elemental) classes (like in every other ARPG): Knight (start-class), Archer, and Mage.\nThis seams not alot, but for the state of the game it is more then enought, and i realy can say i seen worst releases on AAA-titles as this 3 works. The classes realy feel diffrent and you want play them all. I hope for more in the future, but i more like a balanced class then a 15th class which is unbalanced you want play it. Thumbs up on the developers for the balancing!\n\nThe story is kinda plain. You got 3 bosses and yeah that was it. Therefor this 3 are realy a good challenging and interessting fight (not like in Diablo where you onehit some bosses with that one ring). The bosses are less, but this lack of mainbosses are ok, because the figths realy are interessting and very nice. On the way to them you find alot smaller bosses which you can smash (some of them realy challanging ;) ). I hope realy the Mainbosses will be expended, but i hope too that there will be more good bosses and not like Diablo3 a bunch of Mainbosses you onehit and run forward!", "timestamp_created": 1514806094, "timestamp_updated": 1514806094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38927528": {"recommendationid": "38927528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014403378", "num_games_owned": 1268, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 228, "last_played": 1514798678}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc9ec\uc9ec\uc774 \ud558\uae30 \uc88b\ub124\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1514792318, "timestamp_updated": 1514792318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38926139": {"recommendationid": "38926139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119925202", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 198, "last_played": 1514791293}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1514787800, "timestamp_updated": 1514787800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38922488": {"recommendationid": "38922488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009213160", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 393, "last_played": 1514803551}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like this game.\n\nIt is unashamed and frankly completely transparent about its inspirations, namely Diablo. References to Diablo abound, from the slurry old Sage standing next to the well, to the first boss (which I won't spoil). However, it is its own game with its own merits that merely uses Diablo as a platform from which to launch its own trajectory.\n\nAt first, I wasn't sure about the card system. This game isn't really a deck builder, which is how another review presented it to me. Cards are persistent and essentially act as items, equipment, or spells in the same way any drop in Diablo would. The fact that they are cards kind of misrepresented how they work, for me. However, it's part of the pop-up book flavour and really it's just a cosmetic issue. What matters to me is that the way you use them has meaningful gameplay inplications and which ones you choose to equip essentially represents your character build. Some cards have great synergy with others, and it feels good to encounter a pack of enemies that your build is perfectly suited against, and sometimes actually terrifying when you come up against others that seem like perfect counters.\n\nI was initially in danger of not finding the meat of this game, and losing interest early. To begin with, the cards felt kind of inconsequential, as the game seemed quite easy - the enemies were predictable, their behaviours exploitable. Being able to attack anything at range even with a melee weapon felt like I could cheese my way through the whole game. The cards didn't seem to matter too much - my first one gave me a chance to block projectiles, and really that translated to a very small and random advantage against enemies that died in a couple of hits and rarely hit me anyway. However, don't let the slow start fool you. Once the game ramps up its enemy variety, and starts introducing mechanics that change the battlefield, disrupt your mechanics, and more, the magic starts to happen. It doesn't take too long for it to do so.\n\nLevel generation is what you'd expect from a Roguelike that borrows from Diablo - you see the occasional familiar piece, but all in all it is a competent and varied system that never lets things get stale. The fact that you have to stick to the path initially worried me that the game would lack depth, but it has clever systems (namely in enemy behaviour) that are built around this which make it work. Discovery is part of the excitement, so I won't warn you what any of them are.\n\nThe \"Flexiscope\" system is wonderful. Essentially the game breaks itself down into chunks and allows you to tell it how large you want the chunk you're about to enter to be, scaling the difficulty and rewards accordingly. If you've got only 15 minutes to spare you can select the small size option and still have a relatively fulfilling run. The system learns from your playstyle and average completion times of each size and builds a more accurate idea of how long it will take you to complete any given size over time. This system is pretty cool as it means you don't necessarily have to set aside an afternoon to properly enjoy this game, as is the case with many RPGs.\n\nTo top it off, the game has great ambient audio (which is something the first Diablo absolutely nailed compared to its successors), very competent voice acting, and polished presentation. The previously mentioned pop-up book style kind of rubbed me the wrong way at first, because I wasn't sure it was going to adequately convey the isolation and claustrophobia of being a vulnerable human stepping into a dungeon of evils, but it grew on me. They took a risk with the art direction, and it paid off because of their commitment to it and their undying vision of how it would all come together.\n\nIf you like dungeon crawlers and/or Roguelikes, you owe it to yourself to give this a go. It's familiar enough - it has all the elements that you enjoy about those games and many of the staples that the genre demands, which includes the cliches (but in a fun, self-aware way). However, as familiar as it feels, it does everything in its own little nuanced way which gives it some new life in a frankly cluttered genre.", "timestamp_created": 1514775954, "timestamp_updated": 1514776230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38909281": {"recommendationid": "38909281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028124178", "num_games_owned": 801, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 396, "last_played": 1514747935}, "language": "english", "review": "cartoon + diablo 1 = Book of Demons <3", "timestamp_created": 1514742253, "timestamp_updated": 1514742253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38891026": {"recommendationid": "38891026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009937158", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 180, "last_played": 1514454763}, "language": "english", "review": "Overrated.", "timestamp_created": 1514702772, "timestamp_updated": 1514702772, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.416667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38884650": {"recommendationid": "38884650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115318654", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2138, "last_played": 1514795595}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game.

Well let's start of with how the game works and what makes this game just so damn good. To start off with the game has a option before you even begin the game for you to decide how long you want the dungeon to go on for until you reach the end of that section. This sort of mechanic isn't usually shown in many games nowadays, and it really helps with those people who don't have too much time on their hands to play hours upon hours of games everyday. You only want to play for 5 minutes? We've got you covered! Want to go for an hour long play through? No problem, the game is very nice for giving you this option as it provides the player with a reasonable playtime if you're short on time and only want to play through part of a dungeon for a couple of minutes.\n\nAs well as this useful mechanic, the game also provides a deck building mechanic that aid you upon your quest. Even though there isn't much depth to the deck building side of the game, it provide a variety of different play styles, so being able to mix and match cards will be up to your own personal preference. There are 3 different types of cards, artifact cards, item cards and spell cards. Artifact cards are basically passive cards and the ones that I used throughout the entire game, there is a nice variety of these cards, as well as legendary and magical types of each card. Some of them will allow you to cause enemies to slow, whilst others will give you a chance to stun enemies, and even regenerate health. Items cards are basically consumables, healing potions, town portal, toxic bombs etc. and the final one being mana cards, which are spell cards. I personally never used these cards, and never really felt like I needed to.\n\nNow, something that I was slightly concerned about was the way that your character could only move on the set path that is built in the dungeon. I mean why would you need your character to only be able to walk across a one block path? For me this kind of limited the way I could play the game, but didn't make ruin the enjoyment of the game for me. I would've liked maybe a bit more freedom to move around on these set paths, maybe make it 2 or 3 blocks wide so I can move around a bit more. I suppose that the game was designed like this with a purpose to make it more challenging, but for me it didn't really hit the mark. It's a small thing, but something that I think would make me want to play the game more.\n\nSpeaking of dungeons, the game provides procedurally generated dungeons each time that you choose a length time to play through. I really enjoyed this aspect of the game, as this keeps the game fresh and allows for a nice amount of replay ability once you have completed the main storyline of the game. However, I feel like it was slightly lacking a variety of different 'tiles' that are used to piece together each dungeon. I would of like to see a bit more variety with these 'tiles' just to make the dungeons seem different from one another.\n\nSo does the game provide a nice amount of enemy types that co-inside with the randomly generated dungeons in the game? Yes it does, there is wide variety of enemies that you will encounter at different part of the game, all of them having different fighting styles whether they shoot projectiles at you, or run at you knocking you out for a few seconds, every enemy feels well thought out and put together. You will find different enemies in all 3 different areas, from demons to ghosts to goat things each area has it's own arrangement of enemies that you will have to adjust your play style to in order to effectively kill them.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nNeedless to say, the graphics in this game are extremely unique and something that I personally haven't seen much of when it comes to gaming. It's kind of like a pop-up book world, but combines it with dark dungeons that really seems to fit the game and the atmosphere in general. All the characters and enemies look very nice, and it's all very consistent throughout the game.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Choose the length of each dungeon, from a 5 minute run to an hour run. Very useful for people who don't have too much time to play games for hours upon hours.\n+ Even though the deck building isn't very in-depth, it does provide a different play style being able to mix and match different types of cards to suit your play style.\n+ Procedurally generated dungeons makes the game have better replay value.\n+ Nice variety of enemies throughout the game, most enemies are contained in one of the three dungeon areas.\n+ Very unique graphics that isn't really used much in gaming nowadays, works well with the game itself\n+ Good length storyline, 12 - 15 hours of gameplay + freeplay mode for more of a challenge.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Only being able to walk on the set path that is provided, kind of limits where you can go but for me didn't ruin the enjoyment of the game all that much.\n\n[h1]Result / Final Thoughts[/h1]\nOverall this game is extremely well built and put together, even though it's still in early access. The game provides a nice length main storyline (will last about 12 - 15 hours) as well a free play afterwards so you can continue going through these dungeons. I for one am very excited to see where this game goes next, and can't for more game modes, and more storyline (maybe) as the game continues to get updated. Would defiantly recommend this game to any fans who enjoy a good dungeon crawler.\n\n[quote]For more reviews on indie to AAA games, go and follow [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/_YoloArmy]Yolo Amry[/url] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6095538/]curator group here[/url].

It got that Diablo addiction as you go down deeper (exactly like Diablo 1 actually) . They  added all 3 classes at the time of this review, making this game immensely replayable . Love how you can select what size dungeon to generate based on your time available . This is perfect for quick short bursts, i have been playing this in 15min stints resulting in me increasing my dungeon sizes as i get more hooked. For a game in early access it is very stable and seems feature complete (i did not notice anything missing or broken).\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are a rather unique cardboard cutout design which does the job. This definitely seems to make the game perform extremely well (can most likely play this on a tablet). Some might not like this if you are coming straight out of say Grim Dawn / Diablo 3 / Wolcen , but give it a few dungeon runs, it grows on you.\n\nThe card based skill system combined with how you upgrade cards and have to manage your mana pool to equip them is very satisfying to play around with. Love how you have to constantly weigh up between more passive skills vs. active skills etc.\n\nThe game is definitely taking its inspiration from Diablo 1, and there's a ton of throwbacks and humour around this. The game does innovate quite a bit in the actual combat which can be both good or bad. I like that there's various mechanics that you need to take note of with different enemies , like enemies being immune until you do something specific (i.e. killing their guardians first or  destroying their shields first by clicking on a specific shield icon etc) or being able to reduce poison time by clicking on your poisoned health bowl. Even getting stunned has a little mechanic to it allowing you to get out of it faster if you are swift with the mouse.\n\n\nCons:\nIt can get a little chaotic with the clicking when there's alot of enemies and you need to click precisely on specific icons (i.e. to break shields you have to click on the actual enemy shield which is often a tiny thing to click).

One of its selling points is the option to have a short play session\u2014an issue that often is crucial for mobile, but hardly relevant for a PC gamer.

While you can instantly teleport to the end of a dungeon when it's 100% clear, looking for that one pesky pile of gold you've missed means backtracking\u2014excruciatngly slow backtracking.

(Believe me, you will have to click enough times to kill the monsters).\n\nThere are click slots for potions, skills as well, and as a quite good solution imo, you have to put your gear in the slots as well, and for each piece of gear, several of your mana points are blocked/reserved, so you have to balance that as well.\n\nThere are boss fights on every level, and every boss has more stages, cast different spells, summon minions, etc, so it won't get boring.

I bought this game at $10. Forgot why I got the coupon, will look into it. Anyway, this game sort of reminds me of the old C64 game Wizzardry, but much better. The game starts out confusing, and that inmy opinion is because the tutorial that helps you to learn game play starts when you go into the gungeon the first time. It should in my opinion be fixed up so it starts when you start the game up. I was stuck trying to figure out what to do and what keys did what because of this and took a bit of trial an error to get the adventure started. I like playing mages, yet the game makes you pick a fighter until you level up. Thats the only thing I do not like about this game, the ability to choose my character  from the outset. Who wants to work on a character and level them up in order to unlock the one you want. Thats just my opinion. Be forewarned, when you load the game up for the first time, its going to crash, or look like it does. Don't be worried that the game doesnt work with your pc if and when this happens the firt time around. This is caused by the game configuring itself to work with your pc, and also synch with your steam account. Soon as the game crashes, give it about a minute to do what it needs to on fast machines. I recomment 2 minute wait for slower systems, or systems that are limited with ram. \n(BIG WARNING) if the game does not save correctly, or loses data, check to see what version on windows your running on. My son had issues because his system updated to windows 10 pro build 1703 and it's caused a lot of issues with many a games. I had a lot of data loss two weeks ago due to this and even the restore point and windows.old that it made was corrupted so just formatted my pc and made it so it will pass up 1703.\nUpdating my review as of 10/21/2017. For an early access game, the features and playabality are definately fun and challenging. As the author stated in the reply below that the game crashing on first run isn't normal and for me to report it. If this happens to you, follow the same instructions but in my opinion, because my server isnt one of those pre-built systems and that every part of my server is built by myself, some even down to compenent level, the fact it crashes on firt run during setup is actually a normal process for my machine and in most likelyhood, might be for others as well. The reason it crashes on my machine, and other programs as well sometimes on first run is caused by multiple graphic cards and the fact the system shuts down the game while still setting up its files to stop the strain on both motherboard CPU and graphic card CPU's. \nI have played the game for 10 hours, and even delved into the program itself and made changes to play the way I want it to. As I said above, I do not like having to waste my time playing a character type in order to unlock another, which after two hours, went in and changed it so I could play it, and unlocked others I will be trying out after I finish playign with the mage. Sorry Konstantly, whatever my game is reporting to you isn't an issue with the game and the stats you are seeing are what I made to my character so your reading real data after MY changes. I blocked several ports to prevent the game reporting my info to the scores list on things like levels and collections so people actually trying to play fairly don't end up trying to beat something that would obviously be nextto impossible. I mean, how fair would it be if people were trying to beat me on the leaerboard for completing the entire dungeon without dying when I'm using a character with 1k hp and mana? Which is why I am mentioning this here. If something does show up, please let me know so I can remove it. Steam actually needs a feature to shut off leaderboard submissions for specific games. \nAgain, as for playability, challenges, graphics, the game is definately worth the $10 I spent. The fact it's keeping me from my other games I normally play like Starbound and Terraria, this says a lot. I'm not sure what generated the $10 coupon for this game, and still looking into it so others can possibly benefit from it as well if they have not purchased the game yet.

I have not had such fun for a while and this game came as a Remedy (pun intended).\n\nWhat is good?\n\n- As this little game a homage to Diablo, Graphics: strike you first. Without doubt, the Graphics look very cool and oldschool. Fans will love it. \n- Randomized Level Generation: works great. Each game is different from the other.\n- Game Time Manipulation: helps you decide how long you would like to play. This mechanic looks very difficult to adopt in the game but works great. The game learns how much time you spend in a level and calculates estimated completion time for the game size you choose.\n- Cards System: is not like Hearthstone do not worry. Instead of an inventory and equipment screen, you get cards to equip in a hotbar which enables some more interesting mechanics to work.\n- Classic Diablo Characters: Warrior, Mage and Rogue, oh man, needs no description.\n- Classic Diablo Difficulties: Normal, Hard, Nightmare and Massacre, again, no need for any description.\n\nWhat is bad?\n- As this game is a Homage to Diablo, Item Variety: should be wider. Each card has about 10 magic and 1 or 2 legendary variants. I would love to see Rare (Yellow) and Set (Green) variants too.\n- Some Sound Effects: are really annoying. When hit, zombies and shields make an annoying sound effect and these effects have no variety.\n- Difficulty Span: is kind of challenging for such a Casual player like me. There is a steep increase in difficulty from Nightmare to Massacre.\n\nIn all and all, the game is amazing and fun. I hope there will be more content and game types in time. I suggest the developers not to leave Early Access for a long time and keep adding content to it.\n\n(The game is being translated to Turkish by me. More than 50% of the translation is complete. It will be fully completed by the end of October.)", "timestamp_created": 1507475433, "timestamp_updated": 1507475433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35551879": {"recommendationid": "35551879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126743187", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507828107}, "language": "schinese", "review": "we need chinese\uff0cit\u2018s a good game\uff0cif it has chinese\uff0ci think it will be sold well\u3002 thanks", "timestamp_created": 1507400898, "timestamp_updated": 1507400898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687427", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35551505": {"recommendationid": "35551505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044625622", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513403103}, "language": "polish", "review": "Bardzo ciekawe podej\u015bcie do tematu, system kart ciekawie zaimplementowany, stanowi \u015bwietn\u0105 alternetywe dla standardowego i nudnego levelowania postaci.

And then it manages to add interesting mechanic changes on top of that to keep it fresh.\n\nThe flex system is pretty amazing. Even if I do generally end up picking the longer ones, it's nice to have the choice to play a shorter quest and still progress if I'm short on time. It's not something you often think about with this kind of game but it's definitely on my mind now that I've experienced it.\n\nThe card system was something I was very skeptical about, but it works. The upgrade system isn't overly complicated but it is robust enough to make progression feel steady and meaningful.\n\nOverall, I'm excited to see this come out of EA to see what the final product is

Los personajes (que hasta ahora son 3, guerrero, mago y arquero) mantienen un estilo caricaturesco lo cual le da un tinte especial, casi bidimensional, que contrasta con el ambiente 3d.  Los enemigos, tambi\u00e9n caricaturescos, tienen diferentes habilidades que vamos a tener que medir y aprender antes de enfrentarlos (lo cual le suma dificultad). Esta dificultad tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 acrecentada por el tipo de desplazamiento del personaje, ya que los movimientos posibles son 4, hacia arriba, hacia abajo, a la derecha y a la izquierda (nunca nos podemos salir del camino). \nLa historia es simple y est\u00e1 contada por los NPC que son 4. Cada NPC tiene una funci\u00f3n diferente: curarnos, desbloquear espacios para habilidades, mejorar esa habilidades, etc. Las habilidades activas y pasivas se presentan en forma de cartas que vamos encontrando a lo largo del juego y que podemos equipar en los diferentes casilleros, este sistema me pareci\u00f3 bastante interesante ya que una misma habilidad (por ejemplo bola de fuego) puede ser encontrada con diferentes efectos (por ejemplo: cura, reducci\u00f3n de enfriamiento, etc.) lo que hace que el juego no sea tan lineal. Estas cartas pueden aparecer tambi\u00e9n en sus versiones m\u00e1gicas y legendarias. \nAl matar enemigos subimos de nivel y al subir de nivel podemos elegir entre subir vida o mana, no hay m\u00e1s opciones que estas. Eligamos lo que eligamos el punto restante (mana/vida) ir\u00e1n a parar a un caldero junto con diferentes premios que vayamos encontrando a lo largo del camino (en el pueblo podremos comprar estos premios y la vida/mana restante a cambio de oro).\nOtra caracter\u00edstica que me parece muy importante destacar es la posibilidad de elegir antes de iniciar un nivel la dificultad y la cantidad de tiempo que podamos/queramos  dedicarle. As\u00ed podemos elegir si va a durar 5 minutos o 30 minutos, en base a esto se generar\u00e1 una extensi\u00f3n aleatoria de mazmorra (con mayor o menor cantidad de enemigos y longitud, tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1n mejores los premios cuanto mayor sea la dificultad).\nEl sonido en general no es de destacar, pero tampoco molesto, es acertado (quiz\u00e1s el punto m\u00e1s bajo del juego).\n\nEl juego lo recomiendo para cualquier nost\u00e1lgico del Diablo 1, o amantes del hack&slash en general. Est\u00e1 en beta a\u00fan, pero ya tienen bastante contenido como para pasar muchas horas jugando.\n\n\nPD: est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s y polaco por el momento...", "timestamp_created": 1506573102, "timestamp_updated": 1511542816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35253180": {"recommendationid": "35253180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031686167", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508037348}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.

Even if there is a mute function, what a waste of resources.\n\n[*] [b] Severe limitations in world interactivity [/b] The village is not a fully realized, 3D scape, it's a backdrop for cutesy paper people. The cathedral runs exclusively on rails; while it could be argued that this approach is streamlining unnecessary movement, my counter is that the appeal behind Diablo was its gritty, stomach-knot-twisting darkness that drew harsh, dramatic lines of aggro demarcation, accompanied by the bellow of a charging rhino demon. Gone is that enveloping darkness, replaced by amusement park fare and circus peanuts.\n\n[*] [b] Broken combat [/b] Warrior is the only available class as of writing, but you'd guess it were the rogue from the gameplay- kiting is actually integrated, and requires no special effort. For whatever reason, your attack range is mostly determined by sheer visibility while wielding a sword, whereas the demons' is true to life.

With papercraft!\n\nSeriously though, as someone whose first gaming true love was Diablo 2, I always felt bad for being unable to appreciate the original Diablo 1 for what it was, always seeing it as an inferior Diablo 2 prototype. This game, however, gives me that feeling I know I should've experienced when I played D1, but didn't. Its setting, characters and story are as close as you can get without getting sued by Blizzard, and gameplay is a weird kind of streamlined hack'and'slash, where the main character can only move forward and backward on a corridor \"rail\" of sorts. Which could be unfamiliar at first, but really doesn't take away much from the experience.\n\nAll the spells, gear and consumables in the game are called \"cards\". There are 3 classes (guess the archetypes), and the \"cards\" you can get are determined by those. What I liked about this system is that you can put on any card in any slot, so if you want, you either can get loads of spells and survive without any gear at all or, on the contrary, you can ditch the spells, gear up all the way to the teeth, and go left-click everyone to death. Both these possibilities require lots of mana to be viable, but in different ways - spells cost mana as you cast them and you have to refill it once in a while, and gear passively locks some of your mana up, so if you don't have enough free mana, you can't put on any more gear. It's an interesting simplification of the classic level/stat requiement on gear that falls into the whole \"streamlined\" feel this game goes for.\n\nIn short, I'm glad I found this little gem, and I hope one day to see Book of Demons 2: Archon of Ruination, if anything, just to see a papercraft Necromancer raising paper skeletons.", "timestamp_created": 1504143811, "timestamp_updated": 1504149038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34597451": {"recommendationid": "34597451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049498583", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505195830}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun\nEasy to get into\nDiablo-esque feel\nInnovative\nFun!\nIntense\n\nPlus you can pretty much create whatever length of a level you want.

The latest update fixed every issue I had with the controller, targeting, and button identifiers.  It had a huge impact on gameplay.  Have zero issues with the game now!  Before I was really having trouble hitting the correct targets, so I just had to plow through them in the order they appeared, it seemed to get stuck on certain targets.  This is no longer an issue, and my poor mage is surviving a lot better now!  \n\nI'm going to write this from a \"blind\" point of view.  Before yesterday I had not really looked at this game, it was on my wish list, but then again so are like a million other things that I might be interested in.  It popped up on my radar through Steam suggestion, saw the huge positve reviews, and the fact that it had a demo.  So why not try it!  I also don't really know what's on the radar for future updates.  I hate spoilers, and really don't watch videos or read reviews much.  Only enough to get the basic idea of what a game is about.  \n\nPositive: \n\n+I really like how you can adjust how long your run will be, and that it calculates this based on your personal time completing runs.\n+More varied strategy than it at first appears. \n+Very nice visuals/art style.  Pop-up bookish.\n+Nice card upgrades/mechanics, make sure you properly seat each card tightly into it's slot! \n+Enough random goodies to be interesting, but not overdone like Diablo or Torchlight.\n\nNeutral:\n\nI have to say I am a bit worried about Corpse Runs!  I had a real bad flashback to the late 90's playing Everquest. In Everyquest you die 18 levels down in some dungeon and have to painfully run back down and get your ... naked.  This is somewhat similar.  However you don't have to start over from the entrance, and it is not really too painful to get your stuff back.  I died in a room with the mage full of nasty armored dudes, took me a few tries to get my stuff back.  All in all it was NOT very painful.  This could have been a huge turnoff for me, but I think it's done well.  \n\nNegative:\n\n-I use a steam controller for almost everything I play.  I was happy to see they included a Steam Controller profile, I love it when a dev puts some time into making a really nice profile.  However my first run or two in the demo was really not fun.  The buttons are ALL labeled wrong!  So it kept telling me to smash armor with the Y button , when it actually was the B button!  Not a huge negative, but really annoying.  I'm old, it took me a while to remember which buttons to hit when due to the on screen prompts always being wrong!  An hour or so of messing around and it was not really a problem any more.  And I could always make my own steam controller profile for it.  Not a huge issue. Maybe there is a way to set this in options, I did really dig for it.  \n\n-Targeting.  Once again this may just be a steam controller issue.  I had a little difficulty using the right track pad to target.  WIth some practice this was not a terrible issue, I just felt like there could still be some improvement to it.  Not a game breaker for me. \n\n-Atmosphere.  It's early access, and I'm only four hours into the game.  I'm hoping there is a lot more variety to the setting.  It all seems similar.   Maybe I'm not far enough into the game, not sure, just beat the first boss at 4 hours.  \n\n-Also probably because it's early access.  Not a lot of character types to choose from.  Only two at the moment, a warrior and a mage.   A 3rd one says coming soon!  What would make this game absolutely perfect for me is about a dozen unique character types (maybe even DLC packs).  \n\nI am really having a lot of fun with this game.  I rarely buy things full price, took a shot at this after playing the demo.  The game mechanics are unique.  I would have a hard time comparing this to another game, although Diablo comes the closest, if it used cards instead of gear.  I think the difficulty is just right.  My negative points are all very minor.  The corpse run I was worried about seemed to be a non issue (was more my fault dying 4 times in a row, have to learn to play the mage better).", "timestamp_created": 1503434152, "timestamp_updated": 1504887298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572350", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34412322": {"recommendationid": "34412322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080357855", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503346066}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of unique mechanics.

It\u2019s story and intro adds a fantastic ambiance that stays true through the game. The card collecting and upgrading system adds goals, gives satisfaction, and forces you not only to use hand eye coordination, but also strategy to complete this epic game. The difficulty curve isn\u2019t something you would expect a game still in Beta to do right, but, to my astonishment, I found it already perfected. Although basically complete, book of Demons will wait to be released until February 2018 but, to the joy of the community, the long expected Ranger Update will be added sometime before the new year. But this update will only add more play time so you might as well pick up the game now and enjoy saving the world from a duck wielding demon!\n\n[h1]Long story Long, the Game Play[/h1]\nLike a typical hack and slash RPG, you\u2019ll be fighting multiple enemies at once while using different abilities (cards) depending on your current circumstance in game. Simple right? Well of course things are complicated whenever enemies start summoning hordes of skeletons, exploding into poisonous clouds, freezing you\u2019re buns off, and burning your mana with hell fire! With each different level lays a different challenge and, thus, demands a different strategy. All of this forces you to have good planning skills along with proper knee jerk reactions. Although this sounds like it would make the neigh impossible, it only adds a level of challenge without making the game seem impossible. Because of this, It\u2019s difficulty, and how beautifully balanced it is, greatly enhances the gameplay enjoyability.  \n\n[h1]Music, Sound, and Art [/h1]\nPerhaps one of the most praised things about Book of Demons is its soundtrack. I\u2019ve read many raving reviews about how it\u2019s better than the philharmonic orchestra, professional bagpipers, grandpa\u2019s snoring, etc. Perhaps this set my expectation to high. I found it subpar, neither here nor there. It certainly fit all the themes but it was nothing that wowed me. As for the sound effects, I was pleasantly surprised. Often this is a corner cut by developers but I would give it a seven out of ten, a good deal above average. On top of that, on the developer\u2019s timeline he clearly states that he will further improve them. Moving on, the art for Book of Demons is not only original, but simplistic and elegant. The combination of 2 dimensional characters in a 3D environment adds personality, depth, and contrast that most art styles lack. The unnaturalness of this design compliments the dark, brooding atmosphere that really sets apart this game from the masses.\n\n[h1]Why is it still in Beta?[/h1] \nI know everyone\u2019s wondering about how finished the game is and what\u2019s missing at the moment. Well, there are only three major changes that will be made to the game. 1, the developer is making a \u201cstar mechanic\u201d that will probably give you a rating/score upon completing each dungeon depending on how well you did. There are already achievements for this and it should add to your drive to complete each dungeon as perfectly as possible. 2, more achievements!!! This ones pretty straight forward, it\u2019s going to add more goals for you to complete, more play time, and more ways to prove your superiority over your friends. 3 (the big one!), this update will add The Ranger as a playable class. Now this might not seem like a big deal but I promise you it is! Whenever you slaughter the innocent demon of death and doom, you\u2019re encouraged to play through again as the mage. So, adding another play through will increase how much game time you get by 50%! Not only that, but it will also make it possible to get tens of currently walled off achievements. When will these updates come out? Sometime between now and February of 2018. So, as you may for surmised, the game is complete but how long you can play it will be lengthened in the future. \n\n[h1]Conclusion [/h1]\nHours of entertaining game play, beautiful graphics, challenging combat, character and card upgrades, and so much more! What not to love? Truly, his game is a hack-n-slash RPG junkie\u2019s dream. However, like most people, I worry about purchasing games still in development. This is because some companies like to take the money they made and leave the game unfinished. Not so with this game! The game, in my opinion, is ready for release right now and the updates are still pouring in! Honestly, this game is just a treasure. So go ahead, snatch it for its very reasonable price, help support the kindly creator, and have a heck of a time playing Book of Demons!  \n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation] Follow Original Curator Group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1503012987, "timestamp_updated": 1503013923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639826", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34309373": {"recommendationid": "34309373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026031313", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1514684427}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game!", "timestamp_created": 1502983481, "timestamp_updated": 1502983481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493590", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34285310": {"recommendationid": "34285310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004174990", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "last_played": 1514413585}, "language": "english", "review": "Positively surprised about this game.

What will be familiar are the dungeon types, monsters, debuffs, levelling system and so on. But that's really where it ends. In Book of Demons, you are stuck to the 'pathway' or 'roads' in the dungeon level. You move around this path fighting monsters and bosses and gathering gold. This is different to usual games like Grim Dawn or Diablo, as in those you're free to go anywhere in the dungeon, rather than stuck to a path. This means using tactics in order to defeat monsters as you're unable to dodge as well as you could in other games.\n\nThe next difference is that instead of collecting loot, like swords or armour, you collect cards. These cards provide passive buffs or active buffs. They have rarity levels. Each active card costs a certain amount of money to use; while passives will 'lock' a certain amount of mana constantly. This means you have to be careful with how much mana is reserved and how much is available for active skills. The use of these cards is further limited by how many card slots you have unlocked, you start with 3 and each one costs increasingly more gold to unlock. Cards can be upgraded by the NPC's using money and Rune Cards (crafting mats). Furthermore one NPC can identify certain rare cards; for a price. \n\nBook of Demon's is presented in a rather unique style; with a cardboard cutout, popup style graphics. It's pleasant to look at and is enjoyable. The game is humorous and full of character.\n\nOverall the game is very enjoyable and the only reason I'm writing this review is because the game asked me to!

Book of demons has a unique art style and great voice acting, the intro is short but beautiful, building a nice atmosphere, dragging you into the game. Gameplay is as unique as the art is. Book of demons tries to do things different than your usual dungeon crawler or hack and slash game. It is generally slow paced realtime gameplay but with lots of bells and whistles to keep you busy. The core challenge of the gameplay builds around various mechanics that monsters and boss monsters can spawn with and the strategy how to take them down.\n\nEveryone who sees a slight overlap in gaming interests should at least check out the demo. The download is small and absolutely worth it. The game has huge potential and with some serious work it could evolve into a classic.\n\nBut yeah for that some work is required, yes it is still OA, but we're here for feedback right? \n\nDisclaimer: I haven't approached the game in completionist mindset yet, so there may be some lack of knowledge on my side. Also some spoilers incoming.\n\n[h1]Game Progression / Balance[/h1]\nWhat you get right now with the demo is actually better than what you get with the full game. The demo covers the first third of the story mode. The first levels are challenging and you actually feel scared because you have so little life. At the time you get around 40 life it is pretty hard to die. In fact I played through story mode with both chars and didn't even die once (I think I triggered Death Rage twice). Not even in the slightly overtuned archdemon boss fight. Simply put: Later in the game the fights get longer but not harder. Longer to a point where it is draining to facetank a mob for 10 seconds. Don't get me wrong, I am not into games that are super challenging all the time, but if a mob poses no threat to me it is just boring to shoot them down. I feel the player has - at least in the second third of story mode - slightly too much HP. \n\n[h1]Tanky Mobs[/h1]\nGolden/fire/cold hearts and shield mobs are the main mechanics that slow you down. While this is intentional and not a bad idea, the ways to cope with can be impairing. I found myself often picking the right elemental skill manually from the card pane, sometimes switching back and forth mob by mob. With mage I later opted to solely rely on basic attacks with level 2 lightning/fire/cold passive cards. While this solved the constant manual switching I felt cheated. I could also have used the fire/cold attack skills and just switch projectiles but in some messy fights it can be quite hard to hit the right mob. Which leads to golden heart mobs. First of all I wish I could completely disable auto attacks in the options menu. Reliably hitting them in a messy fight can be impossible due to overlapping mobs and I haven't seen a card yet to help with them apart from hard hitters. I see that this is probably hard to fix, maybe this mobs can be just super scarce?\nOverall I found the fights starting normal difficulty and also some story mode parts can happen to to be a bit too lengthy just spamming a single mob or a small pack, quite a bit of boredom came up.\n\n[h1]Archdemon Fight[/h1]\nIt is a mess. Surely intentional. The grand strategy is to camp fountains, have a crowd control skill and shoot mobs or the archdemon if possible. Each time i tried to clean the area after the archdemon was down I got into trouble and left. Is that even possible? Idk, but anyone who claims to know what is going on in that fight is either a liar or a prodigy. While it is doable I feel it is overtuned and out of control. I cannot suggest any fixes here because I don't understand the mechanics of the fight, maybe thats part of the problem but it feels odd to me.\n\n[h1]Endgame[/h1]\nEndgame is where the game begins. I expected more difficulties and got em. More grind, more levels more loot. But the core difficulty mechanic was quite an disappointment. Locking cards? Completely disabling playstyles seems to be trendy right now and it is a mechanic I have a huge personal grief with. Let the player develop his style of playing and then take it away from him is just not cool. Ok there are cards that can protect neighboring cards. Fine. But then again you easily end up reconfiguring your controls because you are forced to put cards on certain slots, which could even contradict between mage and warrior. Not cool. I like for example the nudist achievement, something I seriously would do for the luls. Maybe it isn't that bad in long term because you get plenty of cards that protect your playstyle core cards. I don't know if this is set in stone and I would hope for something different. But one thing to consider: Make the keyboard icons below the cards draggable just like cards.\n\n[h1]Random Downers[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] Shockwave appears here and there, but it is unclear what it is doing.\n[*] Previewing full card upgrade progression would make decisions much easier, especially early on.\n[*] The boss bar can be annoying when it hides mobs spell bubbles.\n[*] It would be helpful to have a quick explanations of the spell bubbles and boss stages somewhere.\n[*] How to counter mana burn? Just wait?\n[*] I can see that magic cauldron delay may be cumbersome at some point.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Random Uppers[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] Tutorials. Compact, imformative and well placed.\n[*] Unique Artwork \n[*] Voice Acting\n[*] Demo and it is great.\n[*] Quick exit on level clear. Truly a gem which you can only find in a indy game, imho.\n[*] Quick mana / life refill in Town.\n[/list]\n\nSo this are my thoughts for now. Hope it helps.

(I almost died there, and pretty darn quickly at that. My only saving grace was constantly moving along with a regenerating amulet and some potions that I had to open my inventory to get).\nCertain things, like the RNG, should be fixed up a bit to make the game a more pleasant experience. Examples: \nI did not enjoy getting a Legendary card that turned out to be a skill card named \"Throw\", when I've never even used that ability, or shown any interest in it. (:'c) I was really hoping for a legendary shadow blade (:c)\nSometimes the game is way too easy, and sometimes you can't help but think to yourself: \"How are humans supposed to beat this?\"\n\nEdit 1:\n\nI'm now currently a level 16 Daredevil Warrior, and let me tell ya, the closest I've ever gotten to dying was when I was prevented from moving by tons of small spiders whilst having 2 bosses, one of which spawns whatever spider that arachnods spawn along with arachnids. I lost 20 hp every time those 2 bosses hit me, and I only had 26 hp in total.\nThough, thanks to this experience, I now know that whenever you open your inventory, the game pauses for like 5 seconds, so you have some short time to drag a potion into your hotbar and quickly use it and then after change it back to whatever you used to keep in the spot you just placed your hp potion card.\n\nMy favourite Card Layout is:\nHeavy Strike, Helmet, Mana Amulet, Health Amulet, Cuirass, Shadow Blade, Buckler, Fire Axe, Frost Flail, Boots.\n\nOverall it's a great experience for HC players, since it will, as time progresses, have challenges better suited for you.", "timestamp_created": 1500762544, "timestamp_updated": 1500808815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33730815": {"recommendationid": "33730815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009043490", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500762279}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a nice simple dungeon crawler.

It can be beaten fairly quickly, but all dungeons are randomly generated (I haven't even gotten close to running into all the monsters and cards you can find yet), and after you've finished it, you can continue playing with more customization in level generation.\n\nYes, it will become obvious very quickly that this is in part a spoof to a big dungeon game (whose name starts with D and is currently on the second sequel), but only as extra flair (anyone else find the voice of the Sage by the fountain somewhat familiar? Hehe).\n\nThe concept and the game play are quite new from what I have played before. The concept is that the game is based on those popout books where you open a page and a whole scene opens up in 3D before you with characters, objects and scenery popping out in glorious cardboard cutouts. Well, everthing in this game is made to look like that, some with a hint of origami paper folding.\n\nYou don't have weapons or potions - you have cards instead that you can emply like a weapon or potion or spell, and there are a few features that you could only do with the concept of cards - some monsters can knock you over and by doing so throw some of your cards out of alignment, so you can't use them until you notice and put them back in their places by clicking on them.\n\nThe random dungeon generator (that supposedly learns from how you play) is quite fun. You get to define how much time you have to play, and while I haven't timed it, it seems reasonably accurate. I have not encountered any issues with the generator at all. Unlike most games, you can only go along a predefined path within the scenery. Sometimes the path will split and give you options where to go first. Sometimes this pathing system can get a bit irritating when a monster straight ahead fires at you, and you can't evade, but that's part of the challenge.\n\nThere are three character classes - fighter (available from the start), mage (available after you've reached level 5 with the fighter), and archer (which doesn't seem to be activated yet as of the time of me writing this).

I got used to it fast and had lots of fun with the game. \n\nUnlike in other games you dont have equipment in traditional sense here. You only have lifepoints, mana and cards. \nThe cards can be spells or can be equipment. If you cast spells, your mana is consumed and you have to refill it with potions, wells, regenerating amulets (nothing new here). If you choose to wear some of the equipmentcards, a portion of your mana gets \u201elocked\u201d. This mana is required to wear the equipment and can't be used for casting spells any more. \nThis leaves you with  some place for tinkering with your equipment and spells (if you upgrade your equip, it will consume more mana). \n\nAnother nice part of the game shows up after the first tutorial. Unlike most games of this type, you can choose how long you want to play for progress in one session. You have to get down into the dungeon to a specific depth to reach a boss. You can choose how big your journey will be from small to really big - 10 minutes to an hour. Depending on your choice the dungeonfloors will get bigger or smaller and your progress will be more or less. \n\nThe enemies differ quite a bit and require slightly different tactics to defeat them - especially the bosses. \nIn deeper floors it can get a little bit annoying / crowded. (Number of enemies can escalate quickly). \n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Storytime >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\nIt was a day like any other, as i wandered deep into the dungeons, entering a room suppressing a yawn.\nWith a broad grin i greated my old friend Mr Gargoyle. \u201eHi there, what's up? Wanna chill a few minutes?\u201c\nI casually walked in, ready to pat Mr Gargoyle gently on his shoulders with my mace of frosting and shaking his hand with my axe of flames. \nA few steps in, i noticed another visitor. Startled i looked at him, sighing \u201edrat, this guy again\u201d. Louder greating him \u201eOh, hello, Mr Priestboss\u201d. With a dark and somehow chilly voice he answered nonchalantly \u201eah, great you could make it, Mr Warrior. We just wanted to invite you to our party. Please, .... take a seat.\u201d\n\u201eThanks alot. I will. Just have to greet Mr Gargoyle properly.\u201d \nI dashed as fast as i could - meaning walking speed - over to Mr Gargoyle and started smashing my club at his read. He shrug if off with a damp thud and a slight crack in his grey and stony skin. \n\u201eHow impolite,\u201c roared Mr Priestboss, \u201eyou even did not let me finish my introduction,\u201c he continued slightly agitated. \n\u201eDo you know my friend over there?\u201d He was pointing to another corner of the room and waved his friend over. \u201cMay i introduce? Mr Other-Priestboss.\u201d\nAt that time, i was whacking the second time at Mr Gargoyles Skull. THUDDDD. \n\u201eOh, and we brought some other friends....\u201c i heard him thundering across the room. \nTurning my head i saw him and Mr Other-Priestboss chanting. Both of them conjuring some Bodyguards (as we all know the law of the adventurers prohibits attacking bosses while they conjure reinforcements). \nDrat. \nI was whacking furiously at Mr Gargoyle now. Big chunks of stone flying left and right. \nSome hits later i managed to look back at Mr Priestboss and Mr Other-Priestboss, again. Their Bodyguards hat just arrived. They greeted with a slight nod of their head and echoed in a chorus \u201eWe.... got.... friends..... too...\u201d\nStill  pummeling Mr Gargoyle - or like he is called now Mr Gravel-on-the-Floor i slightly panicked. \nThink Mr Warrior, think. \nA few seconds later  forming a plan in my mind: First, kill the bodyguards of the bodyguards, then kill the bodyguards, then kill Mr Priestboss, and another go for Mr Other-Priestboss. \nStarting with full running speed - walking the same pace as ever- i charged the first bodyguard, which exploded. Having a run, i smashed a second one with my mace, a third with my flaming axe, leaving a blazing trail in the air, melting the snowflakes of the mace. \nAt that time, i noticed the error i made. I charged into the room, uncovering more of the floor to come. Some of the monsters in front of me, some closing in from behind. I was trapped, for i could not leave the trail in the middle of the room don't get too close to the walls they teach us in explorerschool. Damn that mental imprinting,\nNo time to turn back! \nSwinging my mace and axe in unity, i made a few steps.... and the world exploded. \nSome of the bodyguards conjured more of their pals, mages at the other end of the room spitting magic missiles at me. \nBonearchers shooting flaming arrows of doom at me, some spiders - where the hell did they come from? Are they pals of pals, too? - started to freeze the ground i was walking on. With a meteorite from the sky a bunch of imps came crushing down, immidiately starting to set the floor ablaze - a floor can freeze and burn at the same time? .... i never knew from the books at adventurerschool. More spawns of hell were throwing vials of poison at me....\nTHUDDDDDD. Darkness surrounded me. \nA few moments later i came to my senses again. I was lying in one corne of the room inside a flaming fiasko in front of me stalagmites out of ice, behind me the massive boulder a gargoyle propelled at my head. \nPoisonous gas everywhere. \nThe room filled to the brim with Mr Priestboss, Mr Other-Priestboss, their friends, friends of their friends, friends of their friends friends....  and me lying in one corner, sobbing tremendously, whining with soft voice between the sobs. \n\u201eAll i wanted to do, is chill for a few minutes.\u201d\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<End of Storytim >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nPro: \n+ unique artsyle\n+ flexsystem for timeplanning\n+ good pace (except for backtracking)\n+ Interresting equipmentsystem / cardsystem\n+ if you played diablo you will get the nostalgia\n+ a lot of fun playing\n+ there is a demo (which you should play, if you are not sure about the game)\n+ active developers\n \nContra:\n- sometimes the walking speed is a bit too slow (hello backtracking)\n- some of the mobs can instablock you at the entrance of a dungeon (happened one time)\n- ( sometimes situations escalate quickly - but that happens a lot in these type of games). \n\nConclusion: \n9 / 10\n\nWould definitely chill again with Mr Priesfboss\n\nedit: typos", "timestamp_created": 1500396110, "timestamp_updated": 1511600589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572265", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33631586": {"recommendationid": "33631586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140914901", "num_games_owned": 401, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513253679}, "language": "english", "review": "like this game", "timestamp_created": 1500389655, "timestamp_updated": 1500389655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33630050": {"recommendationid": "33630050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294439315", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500548983}, "language": "dutch", "review": "I am a big fan of Diablo and Diablo type of games.

Character movement is... Rather slow, but this is only really a problem when you're having to backtrack to 100% a dungeon because you missed 32 gold behind a pillar.\n-The sound effects are a bit dull. Not a huge deal either. The music is fine and fitting, but hearing the same casting sound for fireball over and over again gets rather tedious.\n-DOORWAYS. This is honestly my biggest gripe with the game. Doorways are deathtraps in dungeons (I've not died because of one yet, but there's been some close calls.) From time to time you'll come across these structural sadists and on the other side there'll be just a metric booty load of enemies.\n\nSo to anyone who's bothered to read this far into my review, if you've been putting this game off because of the art style or the concept - stop.

An RPG Dungeon Crawler. You run along the paths, left clicking enemies to attack, and using cards against them. In the game, spells, skills, consumable items, and equipment come in the form of cards. You can find cards in chests and the occasional bookshelves.\n\nOne thing I like is that you go down the dungeon in 'quests', where each quest is a certain amount of floors, but before the game generates the next quest, you can use what's called the Flexiscope to adjust how big it'll be. When you choose the size(there's a button and a slider), it'll change how many floors there are, how big those floors are, the minimum amount gold and exp you'll earn on that quest, and roughly how long it'll take. It's done this way so people can choose their preferred size, and feel accomplished when they finish it. Only have about 10-15 minutes to spare? Choose the 'Small' quest size and finish it within that amount of time. Got plenty of time or prefer longer quests? Choose the Large size and it'll give you an hours' worth of Dungeons. Also, before you click to descend into a Dungeon Floor, it'll show you what type of monsters to expect, which is useful.\n\nAll Cards(spells, items, etc) can be upgraded with Rune Cards you find in the dungeon, increases their power(and mana cost) and in the case of items like potions, increases the amount you can carry at once.\n\nDue to the procedural generation of the game, there's plenty of replayability. Theirs also 2 character classes at the time of this review: the Mage and the Warrior, both of which play quite differently from each other. Also, in the future, the Rogue Class will be added, which I know uses a bow, but I don't know too much else. Each Class has 3 character slots, so other people can create their own character.\n\nThis game has a distinct Diablo I/II feel to it. To the characters, the Dungeon(which is obviously the Catacombs from Diablo I), and even the cards.\n\nI highly recommend this game to any fan of RPG's, lite hack n' slash games, or Diablo.", "timestamp_created": 1498649054, "timestamp_updated": 1498649054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32922315": {"recommendationid": "32922315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109307038", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509090500}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6ca1\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u6709\u7684\u9053\u5177\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u4e0d\u8212\u670d\u3002\u6700\u540e\u671f\u5f85\u4e2d\u6587\u3002we need Chinese", "timestamp_created": 1498641242, "timestamp_updated": 1498641242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32899045": {"recommendationid": "32899045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104241023", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "last_played": 1514343523}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Good game ,but we need Chinese", "timestamp_created": 1498607989, "timestamp_updated": 1498607989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32877898": {"recommendationid": "32877898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101699912", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504949669}, "language": "english", "review": "A great potential, i hope the developpers will do the right stuff ! :)\nBecause even now, the game is really good and i enjoy playing it\nThe only con, is the fact that the game is maybe a little bit too easy ^^", "timestamp_created": 1498590238, "timestamp_updated": 1498590238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32865708": {"recommendationid": "32865708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086541046", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "last_played": 1513843399}, "language": "english", "review": "So far so good", "timestamp_created": 1498584213, "timestamp_updated": 1498584213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32844218": {"recommendationid": "32844218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028190218", "num_games_owned": 592, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513230614}, "language": "english", "review": "I rarely have nothing bad to say about something, but this game is one of those things.\nBut please, don't take some random internet stranger's word on it.

A tiny bit grindy, but then I'm an old dude who doesn't have tons of patience for hack and slash.\n\nBut here's why I don't regret paying the $14 summer sale price.  \n\n1. There was a free demo that let me see what I was getting into.  Yes, I know I can get a refund if I really don't like something, but a refund is a hassle compared to the no-hassle demo.  \n\n2. It's a unique indie.  The pop-up book graphics, the card system, the story-- these are what made me want to continue after the demo.  (The unique graphics kind of make the combat a little clunky, but again, the demo will let you know if you can handle the combat or if it's too awkward.) \n\n3. Unlike countless other 'early access' games that haven't changed in years, this one seems to be under active development.  I mentioned the survey; the devs are aware of the potential areas for improvement, and they want to be responsive to the opinions of the players.  \n\n4. Why does the archdemon have a duck?  \n\n5. After the initial game start, the levels allow you to choose your own game-play times.  Have 8 minutes?  13?  Longer?  Good feature.  \n\n6. Did I already clear that area?  Did I miss anything?  This game answers those questions as you go. No more wondering if there is something more to see.  \n\n7.  I'll probably think of another item or two the next time I get into the game.

Not of the game mechanics & look, weirdly, but the setting and general story. Pointless. Anything original about the game is killed by the Diablo setting and story which is so heavily used it's overwhelming.\n\nLong Version: \n\nI really love the look of this game, the mechanics are novel, work very well and are pretty exciting. The voice acting is great, and overall I would give this 100% for presentation and gameplay. I want to love this SO MUCH.\n\nSo why am I not recommending this game? The story setting is basically just Diablo. I mean, almost exactly. The only thing they haven't done is use the same names. The village is recognisable, there's a kindly old sage advising you, and a friendly barmaid, a healer, a witch (sorry... fortune teller), and the Cathedral. The few townsfolk left suspect their Bishop has been kidnapped and is under the cathedral, then in the level preview you see you'll be fighting \"The Cook\", a demon who looks exactly like The Butcher, and there's the corrupted evil Bishop! And under it all, is a devilish boss who looks pretty diabolic. Even with his rubber ducky. The dungeon look and contents feel painfully familiar and unfortunatly take away from the few original and novel monsters. Even the music is just a re-arrangement of Diablo's. It's really killing the joy of the new mechanics for me.\n\nLook, I love a homage as much as the next person. But I've played Diablo for the last 20 years. A few clever references, a loving homage here and there to some beloved character like Cain for example... that would have charmed and delighted me. But basically just copying everything? It feels lazy and tired. I'm not able to really enjoy all the original things done with the mechanics or the novel bosses (like the big Gargoyle and his minions). I feel like a HUGE ball got dropped here and I don't understand why this game is getting such ravingly positive reviews honestly. The unoriginality of the story and setting take away a huge chunk from what otherwise would have been an exciting new game which brings new mechanics to a very \"done\" genre (done as in, there's a LOT of hack & slash games out there, not as in no one wants to play them). \n\nThere are enough Diablo clones out there, and even then most of them only clone the gameplay, I don't get why Thing Trunk thought it would be a good idea to just use the Diablo story instead of come up with something original. I also wouldn't be surprised to see them getting contacted by Blizzard with a C&D, you can't just change the names and pretend it's an original story when it's so painfully recognizable. It's not like they have done a really clever parody of it, it's just the same with different names.\n\nI only hope that each additional \"book\" they add isn't a slavish recreation of something else like this one is.\n\nSo disappointed :(", "timestamp_created": 1498255094, "timestamp_updated": 1498329709, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469723", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1498392602, "developer_response": "Hello!\n\nThe idea is to recreate the experience, create a love letter and start a dialogue with games we played when we were young and genres were fresh. That's why in story layer of the design we operate on an archetypal level. Heroes are archetypes of their respective classes, people in town also fill roles you find in most hack & slash games. They are even named after their roles not with regular names to stress that.  \n\nIt was a conscious decision we made. We focus on creating modern and adaptive gameplay and recreating the atmosphere. Stories are background. There is lore to explore and each character has it's unique personality, it's not a clone because it's an essence of many stories.\n\nNot trying to change your mind, just wanted to let you know our reasoning :-) As a side note we have designed lots of side quests but they didn't make it to the base design due to schedule/budgetary issues (such is indie life).

It's very enjoyable, and so far it's adorable.", "timestamp_created": 1496790516, "timestamp_updated": 1496790516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518080", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32227013": {"recommendationid": "32227013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006376197", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "last_played": 1513956579}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a truly brilliant game, despite being in early access, it feels very polished and complete, only there's even more stuff coming to the game; which is awesome. I'm going to try and make an actual helpful review rather than just saying that the game is good. The game is good. Really good. But also:\n\n[b]Combat:[/b] If you've watched videos, don't be fooled, it's a lot more interactive and satisfying that videos make it look like. It works like most hack n slash games, like Diablo. You point the cursor on an enemy and click to use basic attacks, then you have your abilities. The three classes all have their own distinct abilities. They are nothing like one another - they play very differently. Currently there is the warrior and the mage and soon the rogue is coming.\n\nI do find that the game does not provide many different build opportunities as there may be just 2-3 builds per class. The warrior has one true AoE ability and I think any warrior would always slot this ability in their actionbar because AoE is 100% necessary in mid and late game. But that's all really, you don't choose between different types of abilities, there's an ability for single target, an ability for AoE, plenty of different utlity abilities and passive abilities too.\n\nEvery ability does definitely become useful at one point or another as there's enough monster + elite monster variety to force you to plan fights and react according to what you're fighting.\n\n[b]Environments, atmosphere & the world:[/b] The dungeons are indeed randomly generated and it works really well. It's also a pretty cool feature that you can choose how long your dungeon should be - The game gives you a slider that allows you to choose how long it should be, depending on how much time you have. It's useful for the busy family guys and workaholics.\n\nThere's only 3 different tilesets at the moment and I'm not sure if they're adding more. They're called Maze, Catacombs and Hell. They all look like places you'll find in Diablo 1. When you complete the game you can generate more dungeons and choose which tileset to play on. After 25 hours of gameplay I'm not bored of them yet, the atmosphere is kind of dark and you even have a light radius around your character. You can't expand this light radius as far as I know but it's a reasonable distance.\n\nSomething that's a bit strange about this game is that you can only walk along the path and you cannot leave the path. The warrior also hits from a range rather than fight right there face-on melee. I thought it seemed off putting and quite strange at first but it's actually not bad because it allows completely new and unique game mechanics to work; things you haven't seen in a game before. I can't explain why or how, you'll have to try it yourself (remember there's a free demo).\n\n[b]Character Progression:[/b] Pretty satisfying. You level up, you choose if you want to get 1 more health or 1 more mana. You need both, but you don't have worry about choosing the wrong thing because you also find more permanent health and mana bonuses in chests and treasures. Also - when you level up and choose health or mana, the opposite stat will be stored in something you have called 'The Cauldron' which is located in Town. You can claim the contents of the Cauldron any time you want, but if you die, the content in the cauldron is lost.\n\nAs you level up, monsters you've fought before become easier; something you'd normally see in games like this. As you progress throughout the game, you meet new monsters all the time.\n\nYou don't get equipment in this game, the game has no gear walls, but the difficulty remains reasonable with challenging elite monsters or combinations of smaller monsters that counter you well here and there. On my warrior who is level 33 (I think) I have died twice, but I built him relatively tanky, but I'm not sure how easy it is to die really but I played relatively well I'm guessing.\n\n[b]Card Game (Items and Abilities):[/b] There's not much to it really. You have items and abilities like any hack n slash game. Items and abilities are represented as the cards you're seeing in the pictures for this game. Items and abilities can be placed in your actionbars like you usually can in hack n slash games - there is no card minigame or anything in the game, they are only in a card form to match the paper theme the game is going with. It's cool, it's a nice art style.\n\n[b]Story:[/b] I'm not going to say much - it's a spoof of Diablo 1's storyline. The first major boss is 'The Cook'. What boss from Diablo 1 is it making fun of? Pffft I don't know it's so hard to guess. Lol. The voice actor for The Sage sounds like Deckard Cain and the character looks like him. The dungeon you enter is the local cathedral in a small darkened town that looks like Tristram. It's pretty funny at times.\n\n[b]Music:[/b] I'm sorry but I haven't listened, I intend to do that soon but for now I can't give you information on this. The sound design is not great as it contains a lot of sounds that you hear from all kinds of games and movies, most likely because they are free source samples they obtained from the internet. It's not bad, it all works, it's all timed correctly, it's the correct sound for the actions that occur etc. I must say that it'd be great if certain individual sounds could be switched off (not sure if this can be done by accessing the game files) because the abilities you use the most like pure damage abilities all use the same audio file at the moment and it's a pretty loud sound and it drives me a bit mad sometimes.\n\n[b]Art Style:[/b] I really like the style. It's really cartoony, really elegant and kinda hipster (but it's nice). I advise you to look at the pictures the devs have provided here on the Steam Store page (scroll up) and click on them to see them bigger so you can really see what you're gonna get. I don't know if there are people who would have a problem with this style, but it's hard to even notice when you're fighting a bunch of monsters and avoiding fire on the floor etc.\n\n[b]Miscellanous:[/b] The game is pretty polished in general, I haven't noticed anything gamebreaking. I've personally reported some grammar and tooltip errors, one single bug and a couple of small suggestions. The game has an in-game feedback tab so you can very easily and very quickly report anything to the developers. They even responded to me the day after. Incredible communication with the people that are interested in actually testing the game and want to help the devs out squishing bugs etc.\n\n42/42 will play for many many more hours and I'm really looking forward to try the rogue class.", "timestamp_created": 1496780654, "timestamp_updated": 1496780654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.783142", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32215085": {"recommendationid": "32215085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059333121", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510314504}, "language": "english", "review": "Book of Demons has been surprisingly fun, a good little dungeon crawl game that needs a bit of thought when it comes to deciding what to slot in your activity/gear action bar and a few tactics.

Just about any machine can run this game. No serious graphics card needed. It's like Diablo 1. If your looking for a RPG that delivers, this is an excellent choice. The game has some exception mechanics. I love the ability to choose the length of the game and the size of the dungeons. The game monitors your play speed and pace and then offers different sizes marked small, mediums, large and extra large and gives a time for the run through based on the data it has collected from your previous runs. This gives you the ability to pick a map no bigger than you have time for.\n\nThe game awards cards instead of weapons. The cards give you abilities such as health and mana regeneration and also physical attributes such as knocking back enemies and armor enhancements. You get all the abilities you would expect from an RPG just in a slightly cooler format. I like the cards. It\u2019s easier than always searching for armor and weapons like most RPGS. The cards can be upgraded by the blood sucking leeches in town that you are protecting. :) So, you protect them and collect gold and they take all your money just like all RPGS. :) \n\nI do recommend this game. As of today, it\u2019s still a beta but it has run perfectly. No crashes or any other problems so don't let that concern you. \n\nThe games progresses you through dungeons that go deeper and deeper under the cathedral. It's seems to have a lot of replay value as well. Which is something I wish all RPG's had. There are lot of levels and a lot of monsters. This is a really fun RPG. I'm glad I took a chance on it. I think at the end of the game it goes into free play mode so you can go back and play any level you wish. \n\nThe only thing I wish this game had was an online co op mode so you can team up and play with friends. That would be awesome. and I wish it was a little more in-depth on character creation. But these are wishes not complaints. I do give this game 5 stars.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1495694697, "timestamp_updated": 1495694697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31946207": {"recommendationid": "31946207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054436285", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496085302}, "language": "german", "review": "Es ist ein gutes spiel ich kann es nur weiterempfelen", "timestamp_created": 1495690948, "timestamp_updated": 1495690948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31946093": {"recommendationid": "31946093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120800692", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509428233}, "language": "english", "review": "So far I've only been playing this game for a few hours and I already find myself loving this game.

I a Fan on DIablo 1 , i played the game on Playstation 1 and 5 Years later on the Pc Version and i love the Style of Diablo 1 for me is Dibalo one the best Dibalo better than Diablo 2 . Why ? In this Game and in Diablo 1 the most importet on this Game and Content of some Cenre is the fact ... ( Its a Game you go in the Hell !!! I mean you go the a Place with most Panic Atmosphare and Horror Creatures like Demons,Guhls and Scelletons wait for Kill you) . I love Book of Demons its like Dibalo 1 but, the gameplay is not the same and the Attack and spells its a combination of Monoboly + Fusion with Cards = Than you have Book of Demons . Ok ok this Game is in a Alpha version but , With my i5 6600K and 16 Gb Ramm DDR 4 with GPU (Graficcard) 1060GTX 6 GB VRAM run this game Perfect with not one lags , no freeze , not Error , i cant\u00b4 find a bug in this game so for me i can say run\u00b4s Perfect very good for a Alpha version . \nTOP Importen Points why for me is this Game the best i have play in the last 10 years .\n1. Soundtracks or Level Music is very deep of Panic and nice Horror Atmosphare .\n2. You play us Warrior the First time you unlock when you lvl 10 the Mage and than the Hunter with Bow .\nThe cards is in Category like = Normal,Magical, Legendary Quality of Cards and you need to Farm the good cards\nand makes fun to littel bit grind but not to much in 3 Hours new char i have 2 Legendary Cards by ma Mage.\n3. The special Items with Attributes or char Buffs very cool and you must look for a good way you will play\nmore Mana to can cast a lot of Fireballs or better more Live and def to live longer its you way and you can chance it every time, in the Dungeon and the game is Pause . Better than run every time to town to must do this .\n4. If you good Higher on the Level the enemys go better and better and the Difficult not so easy but its not to hard you can finish the level ( I play with X-Box Controller runs very good no bugs or Errors) for me is this very importent than this game have Full Controller support i am sick and i can\u00b4t sit longer than a hour . I must play without Keyboard . I have no choice .\n5. The Story of the Game is not the Best a Hero came in town and must help ... like a Hollywood Story . I hope the developers work on it and chance littel bit more Realistic Story and why help the Hero the town he works for free? He is a good Man ... thats to easy !!! But its a Alpha \n6.Played Book of Demons 10 Hours only but i will play it over 100 Hours if the game have enough stages and more content more Boss enemys and very importent more enemy Creatures . \n\nThe points i miss in this game \n\n1. Why i have no Equipt like Armor or chancing my Clothes.\n2. Why i cant play by a new char Woman or Male i must play a Male mage more Optons will be better.\n3 Ok only 3 classes i hop you can play a Necromance, Arcane Mage, or a Duellant with Sworts or a Wiking with Doubel Axt, Kung Fu fighter with Magical Power or a Assasine with Claws like in Diablo 2 .\n4. Its not the biggest Point but i can play this game only for me not enjoy coop with friends with 2 or max 3 players .\nand include more Difficults for coop players .\n5.The looting options only is Gold or Cards . Why not Armors , Clothes for Style need to chance littel bit the chars form look, no Rings no Amullets . Ok you not Attributes like Def, Str or Dex think thats the fact why you have nor Equipt to loot int his game you have no inverntory . No town with Market that the point why you have only loot cards on a longer time you play this game over 50 Hours , can be a problem than tha loot system not attractiv enough to play or Grind to find new special items this game need over 1000 Cards System .\n6. Its only a idee but is not a must have what need this game . \n\n\n\n\nI buy this game with 20% and the end price was .  14\u20ac for this Game . \nThe price is fair for the content in the Alpha i have a lot of fun and i hope the Developers make more Cards and Chars in this Game and work clear and Professional for better littel bit longer and bug Free than you cant play it more of to much bugs thats kill me , its haven . and good luck for the Future and make a Amazing Fullverion on Book of Demons .", "timestamp_created": 1495328441, "timestamp_updated": 1495328441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31870278": {"recommendationid": "31870278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007430054", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505753053}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a lot of fun.

Not a bad mix (especially when you lucky to get it on sales). Please, take a note that game still in EA! (for some kind of peoples like myself it's a sentence with nowadays tons of [i]stuff[/i] in EA)\n\nShort summary : it's EA (nobody know how much game will be polished at final release), it's bring strong Diablo 1 nostalgia and somewhat look like complete D1 remake and have interesting card mechanic. If EA don't scare you I'm recommend you to try that game on sales.\n\nAlso, I should note that I'm don't big fan of ARPG and played mostly only in titans of that genre (D-series, PoE, etc, etc), so I may miss some good sides of that game thinking it's oblivious.\n\nFirst positive sides :\n[list]\n    [*]Quite fresh card mechanic when you're choice both from skills and \"gear\" (it can be pure passive bonus or some expendables like potions).\n    [*]Nice solution to allow player interrupt mobs most nasty skills without making CC abilities mandatory.\n    [*]Despite my initial disappointment from linear moverment of player (yes, we're stick to roads. in dungeeon.) - after first levels with boring dull monsters, later game became quite active and full of actions.\n    [*]Cute graphic (it's just IMHO).\n    [*]Cool \"periscope\" feature - you're choice yourself length of your game and game create more/less rooms and mobs.\n[/list]\n\nAnd now time for negative sides:\n[list]\n    [*]Currently there's available only 2 classes (and another one is on beta-testing and [i]will be soon[/i] (c)). I know that it's indie game, etc, etc.\n    [*]And it's followed by quite small variability of cards currently - something around 42 cards for every class. Don't forget that some of that cards are common for both classes + some of them are passive bonuses. Yes, game have magic cards with additional random bonuses plus epic cards, but I'm still scared that there's not enough end-game content to farm.\n    [*]Manual dodging of enemy projectiles not very fun when combined with moverment on rails. Sometimes you're unable to dodge and forced to eat them all.\n    [*]UI is somewhat lacking information (while being quite polished). For example - how is determined cost of [i]next[/i] magic cauldron? Seems that it's somehow related to amount of prizes in current, but well... I can't determine optimal strategy and feel a bit frustated by it. Also some cards have not very clear description of what they will do.\n   [*]Gargoyles agro trigger. Sometimes that nasty creatures don't react when I'm approaching directly to them and strike into my back. Nasty, nasty ... creatures :)\n   [*] It's still Diablo 1 remake even if using completely new mechanic. So if you're spend many hours in D1, then you may not like it.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1495226890, "timestamp_updated": 1495226890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31845007": {"recommendationid": "31845007", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999270678", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511630779}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, it's fun even though it is still in early access, and 2 out of 3 classes are playable for now, pretty good for the state it is in, can only recommend.\n\nThe Flexiscope is also great, but the rewards are way better if you choose the biggest settings.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1495217277, "timestamp_updated": 1495217277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31831636": {"recommendationid": "31831636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035485306", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513302266}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had my eye on this title since some time last year, as a huge fan of Diablo and the C/ARPG genre as a whole. I eventually caved and purchased Book of Demons last week and have just started playing it tonight.\n\nI'm not far through, I've just slain The Cook and got my first Legendary card (an enhanced copy of Mighty Blow for my Warrior) and am so far totally loving my time with the game! I am enjoying all the old Tristram vibes with the Sage and the Demon infested Cathedral, the obvious but well spiced up Butcher reference and many other little touches that solidify the tone and feel of the game as being something akin to the original Diablo or Darkest Dungeon, but with a very firm tongue in the cheek.\n\nI find the card based system quite interesting and entertaining. As a Warrior at the moment I am spending almost all of my card slots and mana on artefacts (weapons and armour) and an essential slot dedicated to Healing potions, but I honestly haven't felt the need to use many spells or abilities. Not that I would have enough mana to do so with the amount of enchanted gear I'm wearing. I don't think this is a problem for me, per se, but I imagine some people may find the trade off between passive bonuses from artefacts (green cards) and active abilities from spells (blue cards) to be... unnecessary?\n\nThe game is well paced, allowing for relaxing and cathartic monster slaying in just the right sized chunks, and with the dungeon lengths easily customised to be tailored to however long you wish to spend playing.\n\nI haven't tried the Mage yet and as of writing this review the Rogue class is unavailable, but I am very much looking forward to trying both of them out and seeing how the game feels different. Presumably with the Mage class I will find the balance shifting more heavily towards the use of Blue Spell cards for active abilities. I may be a bit disappointed if this was not the case and I still felt that passive bonuses were worth more than spells and abilities on a Mage character.\n\nI adore the art, which is heavily stylised in a Papercraft fashion and even down to the way the newly generated dungeon literally unfolds before you like a folded up game board being unfurled across a table. The music is very reminiscent of Diablo and the voice acting is actually very impressive compared to my expectations, with the Barmaid sounding very sweet and compassionate and the Sage being a dead ringer for a certain other series' iconic well-leaning identifier of unknown bric-a-brac.\n\nOverall I give this a healthy 8.5-9/10 so far and anticipate that I will be playing this for a good while to come. Rating slightly lowered for the so far perceived imbalance in the usefulness of green cards vs blue cards and small number of playable classes, though of course I know the Rogue is still in development and will complete the dungeon delving trio that matches off against the original Diablo.

I do really like the fact that you get to choose the length of the dungeon you are about to run, helps a lot when playing while the girlfriend is putting on make up or so, then I can just put it on the largest dungeon and kill 2 hours, wonderful.", "timestamp_created": 1494254117, "timestamp_updated": 1494254117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31615175": {"recommendationid": "31615175", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997465678", "num_games_owned": 2955, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494284569}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u043f\u0433?\n\u041f\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0451 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f.\n\n\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u044b \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b, \u043d\u043e \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b.\n\n\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0444\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u043c\u0438\u043c\u043e.\n\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0432\u0435\u04409000 \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f. \u0412 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c -

Nothing sounds overdramatic; all the characters so far have their own stories to tell and listening to them is less of a chore than most ARPGs\n+ the actual dungeon crawling is... repetitive, yes.  But ARPGs past will tell you that dungeon crawling is repetitive anyway\n+ Let's say... unique controller setup.  The left thumbstick moves you around the dungeon and your right thumbstick allows you to pick up items, target enemies and the like.  Overall not a bad button scheme for the controller\n\nCons:\n- the actual roleplaying part of the game is out of touch just a bit.  Yes, the cards you place on your person do influence your character but as far as that goes that's it\n- limited character customization to literally just your name (it's not a deal breaker but it does put me out of touch with the character a little)\n- Male/female genders per character aren't a thing.  Doesn't bug me that much but it might some\n- the \"on rails\" system may bother some people but this IS a distilled version of Diablo/most ARPGs so it's not THAT big of a con\n\n666/666: would definitely kill demons from hell in any format again... and again... and again... and again.

This allows the player the time to make an intelligent decsision that they as a player cannot make as fast as the warrior of fable they are playing. \n\nEverytime you delve into the dungeon the game asks how long you'd wish to play.  Want to play for 10 minutes? Sure. How about 60 minutes? That's great, go for it.  It does take a few delves to unlock the longer play sessions, but that's ok.  You need these delves to learn your character and the game.\n\nThe art style is that of a pop-up book.  This allows the game to be whimsical and sincere at the same time.\n\nThe equipment is represented by cards.  This is not a card game.  It just is part of the unique art style.  It does allow the player to fullfil the need to collect things.\n\nI really enjoy this game.

If you've played diablo 1 or are at least familiar with the diablo series hack and slash type of games or generally just enjoy a good endless amount of monster slaying from an isometric perspective then this game should definitely be on your wishlist. \n\nThe game adds a couple of unique features such as the boardgame style graphics and playstyle and the cool 'collectable cards instead of skills' as well as the ability to set the length of your dungeon according to your available time.\n\nI think it's worth noting that this game doesn't offer you the 'freeroam' abilities afforded to you in other hack and slashes as the movement is restricted according to set paths in dungeons (kind of like driving a mining cart around interconnected rails). This can make dodging stuff a near impossibile task sometimes and also makes it easier to get boxed in by fires, icycles, rocks, monsters and anything else that decides to block your path.\n\nAll in all I am really enjoying my time in Book of Demons and see no reason to not recommend this to anyone who likes a straight forward hack and slash with filled with quips and references to it's spiritual predecessor.\n\n8/10 would let Teleport kill me again by sending me to an unpexpected location", "timestamp_created": 1489857739, "timestamp_updated": 1489945183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488782", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30591954": {"recommendationid": "30591954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009268614", "num_games_owned": 1890, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513262277}, "language": "dutch", "review": "good game but there are only 3 classes in diablo there is a fourth class the priest and an extra dungeon", "timestamp_created": 1489844795, "timestamp_updated": 1489844795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30587721": {"recommendationid": "30587721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015243070", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 516, "last_played": 1514682625}, "language": "french", "review": "H/S vraiment particulier.\nUnique, tr\u00e8s personnel, j'aime beaucoup le style, la patte graphique et le boulot des dev.\nMises \u00e0 jour r\u00e9guli\u00e8res, tr\u00e8s suivi, je n'attends peut \u00eatre plus qu'un client Fr et la release officiel du jeu!\nContinuez comme ca!", "timestamp_created": 1489830831, "timestamp_updated": 1489830831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30584212": {"recommendationid": "30584212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001247036", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503116600}, "language": "english", "review": "Been playing this game for a whle now - in an awesome state for an EA game.\n\nA fun and irreverent look back at the oiriginal Diablo in a isometric \"paper cutout\" game.\n\nGreat fun to play and challenging to boot. \n\nWorth every penny", "timestamp_created": 1489815850, "timestamp_updated": 1489815850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30582633": {"recommendationid": "30582633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019166374", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489809595}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u5f8c\u671f\u7684\u6210\u9577\u96e3\u5ea6 \u8b93\u904a\u6232\u7684\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u66f4\u52a0\u8c50\u5bcc", "timestamp_created": 1489808014, "timestamp_updated": 1489808014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30568521": {"recommendationid": "30568521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079505533", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508584740}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game with charming visuals", "timestamp_created": 1489756350, "timestamp_updated": 1489756350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30549247": {"recommendationid": "30549247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022847552", "num_games_owned": 578, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 82, "last_played": 1514673559}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a lot like playing Diablo 1 without the white-trash-loot and the backtracking.

You will get to see how the game works (quite a lot of it actually) so you can make your own mind up.\n\nAs for my opinion:\n  Graphics are nice - not too demanding, yet still very functional, entertaining and enjoyable to look at.  Only real complaint at this point is that the game is just screaming for more content. There are 7 major groups of monsters, with up to 15 variants of each (total looks to be around 65 to 70, I haven't seen the last group - the first 6 have 58 combined). These variants do use different graphics so they aren't just different colours).\n\n  Gameplay uses a mechanic of cards to represent equipment and spells, as well as \"crafting\" components - these are for upgrading your cards (each has 3 levels). The card system works pretty well - it forces you to make strategic choices, and you can tune these choices based ont he kind of opponents you are encountering in a dungeon. \n \n  As mentioned elsewhere, your character has to follow the paths, but you do get to choose which way you want to go on these paths. Its not as limiting as you might think (this is where the demo really helps the game shine). Level size is configurable which allows you some control over how long you want to play in a session (time estimates are provided, seem not too far off). And you can return to town at almost any time, your progress will be saved (you do have to either use an item, or walk back to the level entrance to get to town).\n\n  Combat works pretty good and is explained in the tutorial (make sure you follwo along or you will get destroyed!), with only a couple of concerns in the present version. The big one is that sometimes it is hard to get your charater to run away when you want to/need to - he may go a couple steps then stop, move nothing at all, or move where you want.  Also sometimes it is hard to target the monster you want to (or to hit their shield) when there is a crowd.\n\n The character progression system seems to encourage play, and exploration. You need gold to buy some improvements (more card capacity, upgrades, identify cards, etc), while every level you get a point of health or mana. Mana is used for both spells and to power equipment. Makes you think strategically :-)\n\n  This is part of a series of 7 games (check the publisher's website) - so we will see how the rest goes. This one is a good start, and at this point is quite playable and looks to have a good future. \n\n  And most importantly, its fun!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1488773236, "timestamp_updated": 1488773236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30327814": {"recommendationid": "30327814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299403667", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496799694}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey folks.

Are you here to face the ARCHDEMON? You see the old Cathedral on the hill over there, this is where you\u2019ll find the entrance to the dungeons. Oh, before you do so, you might want to visit our village square. We have a fabulous fortune teller, a barmaid, a healer and a sage. They will help you in your quest to defeat the ARCHDEMON. I hope to see you again champion and good luck!\n\nBook of Demons is a hack and slash / dungeon crawler game where you take your champion into dungeons setup in a paper verse world. \n\nAs this game is still in development, you can choose between two classes of heroes at this stage: a warrior or a mage. One of the first aspects of the game that I really like is the fact that you can choose how long each dungeon can be (you have to unlock it though). If you have thirty minutes to spare, then make them short but if you have a couple of hours on hand, make the dungeons bigger.  \n  \nThere are three quests to complete in this game with three bosses to defeat. The first one is the cook, then the Antipope and the almighty ARCHDEMON! Before you get face to face with one of these bosses, there are plenty of dungeons to go through.  As you progress through the game, you\u2019ll find cards; these are usually in golden chests, but may also drop when you eliminate a high ranking enemy. They are basically skill cards with three different coloured backgrounds: the red ones are for potion (health, mana, etc), the blue ones are spells and the green ones are abilities. There are runes cards too, which can be used at the fortune teller to upgrade one or several of your existing cards. As you find a new card you can allocate it to your hero, but you will only have three open slots out of ten at the start of the game. To unlock the other slots, you\u2019ll need coins, so make sure you pick up everything in each dungeon and visit the sage to purchase your new slot.\n\nYou character will gain experience as you slaughter your enemies, and each time he levels up, you will be given a choice to get either an additional life point or mana point at that time. If you decide to take a life point, the mana point will be placed in the cauldron which you can purchase back from the barmaid. \n\nThere are stacks of different enemies, some with melee and other with long range weapons. Some will explode while others might teleport themselves to another location to make it harder for you. Fire and freeze spells will come at you from every corner \u2013 it\u2019s hectic and really fun! \n\nYour character will have to follow a specific path within the dungeon, and it will be equipped with an automatic attack as soon as he is within a certain range from his enemies. However, as it is a click type of setup, you can move your mouse on an enemy and click on him until he dies. Click on all pots and chests, as a fair number of them have coins in them. If you are running low on life or mana, you can use a potion if you have a few in your inventory.  Otherwise look at the red and blue fountains. Click on them and your life or mana will be fully regenerated.\n\nI really like the artwork; it is just splendid. The soundtrack is not great and could be improved. However, I do think that the voice over is well done.

Despite being a role playing game which is not an unfamiliar concept, the game\u2019s overall appearance is much different. This game is actually set up like a pop-up story book which makes it rather interesting. The simplicity of the graphics in this game make for somewhat of a comical time. It\u2019s funny to see a little story book warrior exploring dungeons and slaying monsters, although that is exactly the case with this particular campaign.\n\nUpon choosing a character (warrior, mage, etc..) you are introduced to a small town where a barmaid, a healer and a couple of other characters reside. These characters are in the game to assist you in your quests as well as heal you and offer you power up opportunities. The healings and other rewards from your companions are very helpful as you continue your quests through dungeons and into the depths of hell. With a wide range cards (power ups), this game offers high levels of characters customization similar to Van Helsing.\n\nFor the full preview go here - http://www.gamingcypher.com/book-demons-preview-pc/", "timestamp_created": 1487114788, "timestamp_updated": 1487114788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29893042": {"recommendationid": "29893042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120805274", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488760410}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.

Everything requires clicking. movement, attacking (there is an autoattack funtion but it's slow compared to clicking, but it's there still), clicking away to cure poison, stun and freeze effects. You play the game, so it makes sense to click. Movement has a WASD alternative that is how I like to play and is easy to figure out. If there's a way going upper right, you press W and D, if you want to go bottom road, you press S, etc. so it works as implemented. The game is a great tribute to Diablo 1 be it voice lines, atmosphere and NPCs. Oh by the way, game has good atmosphere and paper graphics\n\nConcerning the card system in the game which is an innovative take on genre, I have unlocked all of them and seriously, there are great combinations to make the game even more fun (and to kill monsters without having a hard time). For example, there's a \"burning axe\" card which has a chance to grant burn effect on monsters, upgrading grants higher chance and a fire AoE on ground, blast wave etc. Or there's a card called \"amulet of life\" which grants HP regen, an \"armor\" card which grants a chance to pickup lost hearts upon being hit. There are lots of cards which I don't want to spoil, and the game is getting an update which will grant cards have rarity tiers. (like a common burning axe drops, but there will be rare burning axe and legendary burning axes to drop too which will grant different effects)\n\nI hope developers won't make easier since this is a hack'n slash dungeon crawler and difficulty curve is good as it is (beware last boss, it was hard and my hardcore character was almost dead).

It went straight into my backlog behind a lot of other games. But one day I was in the mood to try something different, and as I was scrolling through my library I found Book of Demons. I thought to myself, why not? It was a good a time as ever to give it a shot. I quickly installed it and proceeded to play it for an entire afternoon. I even skipped lunch! \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n==========\nBook of Demons is a point and click deck-based action adventure dungeon crawler with RPG elements. That's the fairest way I can think of to describe it. You begin the game with the Warrior class, with other classes (Mage and Rogue) unlocking as you level up. You start in a small town where you are greeted by the Barmaid. She tells you of a terrible evil spreading throughout the land, and directs you to the Sage. He tells you of the evil permeating throughout the old cathedral and how the town's bishop was dragged into the catacombs beneath it.\n\nGeneral gameplay has your character following a pathway through each level. You can only move on this path, back and forth, as you choose. This is how you can avoid spells and attacks. Footprints are shown on the path wherever you have been, and gold footprints are shown if you hav ereached the end of that particular path. To interact with the environment, just click anything. Pots, chests, enemies...everything is clickable as long as you are close enough to it. When yoru character is in range of an enemy, he will automatically attack it slowly. Clicking enemies is MUCH faster though, so I highly encourage you to do so. Basically the goal is to clear out all enemies and check out all the special \"spots\" on each floors. Spots can be chests, shrines, and other such objects. Once you have cleared at least all the enemies from each floor, you can move onto the next floor. This returns you to the \"map\" where you can see the next floor and the enemies it contains.\n\nAs you met new types of enemies, some of them come with a very specific gimmick or special mechanic. As an example, some enemies explode in a cloud of poison gas when defeated, while some enemies can spawn more enemies. There ar even more complicated mechanics as well...like the goat demons. They tend to charge at you, and if you are hit, your character will have stars spinning around his head. These stars then pop up on screen and move around in a circular fashion. Your character will stay stunned until you manage to click each star and make them all go away. All enemies have a heart counter above their heads, and as you click them, they empty out and die.\n\nAs you defeat enemies, you earn EXP, gold, and sometimes special cards. These cards can be spells, abilities, special equipment, or Runes. You can only equip as many cards as you have slots unlocked. Each slot can be bought as you progress, but they are expensive. Rune Cards are used to upgrade your other cards. Each time you level up, you can choose between gaining more HP or more Mana. Whichever you do NOT choose, goes into a special cauldron that you can buy the upgrade from back in town later. All special loot/money items go into this cauldron as well, and the cost of emptying it goes up each time you empty it.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n==========\nThis game has a very special aesthetic that is kind of difficult to describe. Everything is origami/folded paper, that surprisingly works very well for this game. I love how it manages to be very dark, yet very charming at the same time. The theme and tone of the game really shines with this art style.\n\nThe UI is very crisp and defined. Health on the left, Mana on the right, cards and extra slots in between them. The icons on each card ar clear and well defined. I really like the look and feel of them, and of everything to be honest. \n\n[b]Sound and Music[/b]\n==========\nSadly, this is the part of the game that comes up short. Usually I can be hooked into a game on the sound direction and music alone, but Book of Demons doesn't have much. It has some basic, creepy theme songs as you explore, and a town theme...and that's pretty much it. Attacks with the Warrior has this fwip fwip sound, the clink of coins can be heard when picking up gold, and pots shattering as you destroy them sound pretty good. \n\n[b]Performance[/b]\n==========\n30 FPS minimum? Yep! It can hit 60 FPS easily, for all those who care about that. I used my mouse almost exclusively to play, and I didn't even think to use a controller so I can't comment on that. It's probably best with just the mouse. I didn't experience any weird hiccups, stalls, freezes, lag, or random crashes...and that's always a plus. If you're curious how your system might compare, my PC specs are on my profile as usual. If they are higher than mine (and let's be honest...they most likely are), you'll have even better performance.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\n==========\nI absolutely love this game. Pick it up if/when you can, it's great for passing the time and can get fairly challenging in the later levels; you can see an example of this in my gameplay video below. I can't wait to unlock the last class (Rogue) and play around with it and the Mage more. Oh, and did I mention you can set how long of a play session you want before diving into the catacombs (after a few adventures first)? Yep, you can do that! Book of Demons is great for short or longer sessions, and very playable for people of almost any skill level. At least give the free demo a try!\n\n[b]Gameplay Demo[/b]\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNwyx1742E4\n\n[b]Nerd House Verdict[/b]:\n==========\n[h1][b]Highly Recommended[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1485748508, "timestamp_updated": 1485749873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628192", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29533158": {"recommendationid": "29533158", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998071058", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501176091}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally a game that captures what made the first Diablo game great, rather than making yet another loot-grinding simulator modeled after Diablo II.

Hero Siege for me is lack lustre and very repetitive, if you gain enough poweryou can easily just stand around and let monsters come to you and then kill them. This game is the complete opposite, having only one book at the time of this review, there is a lot more going on for this game than any I have encountered. I was blown away by the charm of the game, the graphics are great without taking away from the performance of the game. Despite being early access, it is extremely stable. The game itself has a great amount of mechanics to it, such as card based spells, attacks, equips etc. I highly recommend this game as it is a true gem and more people should be playing it.

The game has unique affixes to the dungeon and the bosses based on the difficulty, but nothing so sinister as to make the game frusterating or unplayable.  Hard adds a new feature where engaged bosses will 'lock-out' the usage of X-Y number of cards (increasing the range of X and Y as difficulty further increases), the next difficulty adds a feature in which when you start a dungeon you have a set number of cards (again same X-Y # of cards that increases range when you further increase the difficulty) that you MUST use within your build for that dungeon.  There are more things added with additional difficulties to make the replayability quite high, and all the more entertaining.\n\nI also should note I am not big on Single Player games and typically opt-in to Multiplayer games so I can play with friends and family - not since childhood in the early ages of gaming where everything was innovative as there was no set or defined norm - but this game has not only relit a love of engaging single player games but also bringing with it quite the nostalgic memories of my early gaming experiences with Dungeon (D&D) and Turn Based gaming.\n\nWhen I first was thinking of leaving a review, my only complaint - at that time - would have been about the controls within game; but, that being said, after having put more hours into the game at this point I have gotten used to the controls and any potential stemming frustration has been curbed.  It can take a couple hours to get used to it, but you become quickly acustomed to the controls.\n\nI am looking forward to the other 'Books' from the Developer [Thing Trunk] as well as the completion

But this game is soo much better!\n\nIt really makes me proud as a human, because it makes it evident that we also make good progress in regards to game design. Instead of just clicking at the monsters the whole time, you have lots of stuff to pay attention to (what other reviewers also mentioned)\nYou can even slow time and exchange your cards, so in that moment it becomes kinda like a turnbased final fantasy game where you can think about your strategy.\nI also love the Music.\n\nAfter some time though my finger gets tired like in a Diablo game.\nSo I tried the gamepad controls and they are surprisingly good. The thing that breaks it for me though is monster selection and that you can not cast spells directly but need to select them via D-Pad.\nI think a radial menu would work better here. (Somewhere in the forum there where already good ideas for the monster selection) So I am back to mouse and keyboard for now.\n\nI haven't played it through yet, but I will soon.\n\nDevs, keep up the

It's also kind of a trip down memory lane, and the pop-up-book art is really eye-catching.  The game is visually quite impressive.\n\nCons: Whew.  I wanted to like this game so bad, but it really isn't good.  Lets start from the general problems and work our way to the specific.  The writing is pretty bad.  It's mostly grammatically correct, but it's just very bland, especially for something directly taken from another game.  I understand homage, but this game makes these tenative attempts at poking fun at the original (Showing[strike]diablo[/strike] the Archdemon on the map soaking in a lake of fire whilst holding a goth rubber ducky, slightly retheming the butcher to be the chef) but it doesn't really follow through on this.  It's a missed opportunity, because the art style lends itself to making this game at least passing funny.  Instead, the dialogue and event scripting is just bland.\nThe combat system is equal parts brillant and bad.  The card system mentioned above is genius.  It's totally overshadowed by the fact that all dungeon crawling is done on rails.  Let me put a fine point on this.  There are defined, linear tracks that run throughout the dungeon that are the only paths of movement available to the characters.  This causes extraordinary amounts of frustration when trying to dodge enemy attacks.  If they're on the same rail as you, you're going to get hit.  This doesn't happen often, as they're all free roaming.  Additionally,  these rails have bad directional detection.  You can control them with mouse or keyboard, although I had more luck with the keyboard, the game still does not have consistent interpretation of direction, so at a critical point, your character can fatally turn the wrong way at a T-junction if you're not careful.  Games like this are meant to be a fight, but the fight shouldn't be against the controls.\nThe character's ability to interact with the dungeon or its inhabitants is limited by a light radius.  If an enemy isn't in your light radius, you can't click them.  Since there's no such thing as melee, per se, this is the big limiting factor on attacking.  The problem is that it's pretty indistinct as to when things are in your light radius.  However, it also acts as a limit for most range attacks.  This is particularly problematic with the Mage, who really needs to do what casters in every Hack & Slash game have done since the genre's inception and fire blazing death blindly into adjacent, unseen areas to kill/weaken the things in there enough that the squishy person can survive the ensuing fight.  This isn't really possible in this game and the game suffers for it.\nThe postgame is also just bad.  The levels are are randomly generated, and therefore, theoretically endlessly replayable, but you take xp and gold penalties for death.  XP hurts (especially since there's no way to build survivability in this game) but the gold is arguably worse.  Gold is a hot commodity in this game as it's required to get new card slots, upgrade your cards, and upgrade your upgrade materials.  On nightmare difficulty (the first challenge difficulty) you'll lose 30% of yours for every death.  I'm not against a challenge and a failure penalty, but there's no tools avaialable to use for success.  I mean at least let me move laterally.\n\nTL;DR: Pros: Card system of abilities good.\nCons: Actual dungeon crawl is restrictive and poorly executed.\n", "timestamp_created": 1481311389, "timestamp_updated": 1481311389, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587623", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1481320155, "developer_response": "While you have full right to find the game not to your tastes, I will take this opportunity to address a few of issues you have with the game and clarify. \n\nFirst of all, at the time of writing this review you have spent 40 hours in the game. Book of Demons is in Early Access and story mode provides ~8 hours per character. This means you have spent over 50% of play time in the end game, which we have not yet finished!\nThere is a lot of content planned for the end game. We will rework card system to offer more flexibility, add quest mastering, golden stars mechanic and mythic tier cards that will, in some cases, literally change game mechanics (check the roadmap in the forums for more details on what is planned when). \nBalancing of the endgame is also an ongoing process - if you read changelogs we make balance tweaks every few days.\n\nYou point out the range of the Mage - but he does have a longer range than Warrior (20-30%) and his missiles are guided. You can fire them towards enemies outside of your range and they will hit them. However, range in this game isn't the differentiating factor. Cards are. \n\nKeyboard movement - there are two modes, you can switch the \"smart\" movement off and turning will become predictable. As I mentioned this is early access and so far players are split as to which control scheme works best, so both modes are in the game. \n\nLast, but not least, there is no XP penalty for death on a higher difficulty. Only gold and cards. And playing on that difficulty is purely optional.\n\nI will not comment on humor or writing because that's matter of personal tastes :-)\n\nI hope you will revisit the game later during development and review the review in case you find things have improved. You have put a lot of thought into that review, so I'm confident you will appreciate the direction we will take with the endgame.\n\nPS And check out that keyboard movement option, it can work better for you than the default one. \n\nPPS And I'm glad you enjoyed at least some aspects of the game :-)"}, "28268882": {"recommendationid": "28268882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051501262", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499625669}, "language": "english", "review": "great game. didn't have as much fun since diablo 1!", "timestamp_created": 1481285089, "timestamp_updated": 1481285089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541960", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28266790": {"recommendationid": "28266790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067864958", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504841320}, "language": "english", "review": "This really snuck up on me.

Retrouver du gameplay alors innovant pour l\u2019\u00e9poque, garder cette exp\u00e9rience famili\u00e8re et la remettre au go\u00fbt du jour, sans pour autant reproduire trait pour trait des jeux existants. Cr\u00e9er des hommages, non des suites.\nL\u2019intention est \u00e9galement de proposer une exp\u00e9rience qui s\u2019adresse \u00e0 tous. Fans de jeux classiques, casuals, joueurs plus confirm\u00e9s : l\u2019objectif recherch\u00e9 reste le fun.\n\n[b]Puisque l\u2019on parle d\u2019hommage\u2026[/b]\n\n\u2026 Les plus habitu\u00e9s ne manqueront pas de le remarquer ici, et tr\u00e8s rapidement. Un aventurier, une cath\u00e9drale, descendre toujours plus dans les catacombes face \u00e0 des hordes de squelettes et d\u00e9mons pour s\u2019engouffrer en enfer : la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au premier opus de Diablo est \u00e9vidente.\nLe village avec son ancien sage devant le puits, les trois arch\u00e9types des classes jouables, la musique d\u2019ambiance dans les donjons, l\u2019aspect sombre des profondeurs, tout y est.\n\n[b]Au c\u0153ur du gameplay[/b]\n\nSi vous recherchez un hack\u2019n\u2019slash traditionnel tel que Diablo, Sacred, Titan Quest ou encore Torchlight, ce jeu risque de ne pas r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 vos attentes. L\u00e0 encore, il convient de rappeler que Book of Demons s\u2019inspire, mais suit son propre chemin.\n\nEn ville, plusieurs PNJ seront \u00e0 votre disposition. Vous ne dirigez pas votre personnage \u00e0 ce moment, vous interagissez simplement avec eux. Chacun poss\u00e8de sa sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 : l\u2019ancien peut identifier des cartes inconnues, la mystique recharge et am\u00e9liore les objets, l\u2019aubergiste permet d\u2019obtenir du butin en plus via un chaudron magique et le soigneur vous remettra d\u2019aplomb.\n\nAu niveau de l\u2019interface, l\u2019ensemble est clair et accessible : la r\u00e9serve d\u2019or, deux globes pour indiquer votre r\u00e9serve de vie et de mana, un bouton d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux statistiques du personnage, un bouton d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019inventaire de vos cartes, et enfin la barre d\u2019action, o\u00f9 vous pourrez disposer vos diff\u00e9rentes cartes.\n\nParlons des cartes justement. Vous en obtiendrez en guise de butin au cours de vos aventures, que ce soit en tuant des monstres, en ouvrant des coffres ou encore dans le chaudron de l\u2019aubergiste. Les cartes, ce sont vos sorts, votre \u00e9quipement, vos potions. Vous en trouverez donc diff\u00e9rents types : objet (les potions et parchemins), sort, art\u00e9fact (armes, bijoux et armures), sp\u00e9cial (des runes qui vous permettront d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les autres cartes). \n\nEn donjon, vous vous retrouvez alors devant une vision plus famili\u00e8re en terme de hack\u2019n\u2019slash, avec votre personnage au centre de l\u2019\u00e9cran, en vue isom\u00e9trique. \n\nLes d\u00e9placements sont plus restreints, vous suivez un r\u00e9seau de chemins sans pouvoir en sortir. Cela peut s\u2019av\u00e9rer d\u00e9routant. Que vous ramassiez un objet ou de l\u2019or, ouvriez un tombeau, cassiez une urne ou combattiez un monstre, votre personnage reste dans son rail. L\u00e0 encore, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du jeu dont il s\u2019inspire, Book of Demons se diff\u00e9rencie.\n\nConcernant les combats, la m\u00e9canique est plut\u00f4t simple. De base, sans que vous ne fassiez quoi que ce soit, votre personnage effectuera une attaque automatique dans un certain rayon. En cliquant, vous infligerez des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts suppl\u00e9mentaires. Enfin, il est possible d\u2019utiliser des sorts si vous en disposez.\n\nChaque monstre poss\u00e8de un capital de c\u0153urs, faisant office de barre de vie. A chaque attaque de votre part, ce capital de c\u0153urs diminue. Des monstres disposeront d\u2019une armure qu\u2019il vous faudra d\u2019abord casser, d\u2019autres demanderont que vous brisiez leur sort, ou certains encore laisseront une aura de poison se r\u00e9pandre \u00e0 leur mort. Bien entendu, c\u2019est en cumulant ces diff\u00e9rents effets et le nombre d\u2019ennemis \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cran que le d\u00e9fi grandira. En cas de mort, il vous faudra alors retourner chercher votre d\u00e9pouille pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les cartes de votre barre d\u2019action. Pour les plus t\u00e9m\u00e9raires, Book of Devils dispose du classique mode hardcore, nomm\u00e9 Daredevil pour l\u2019occasion, qui propose une mort permanente.\n\n[b]Des donjons \u00ab \u00e0 la carte \u00bb[/b]\n\nBook of Devil dispose d\u2019une m\u00e9canique vous permettant des sessions de jeu adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 votre temps, le \u00ab Flexiscope \u00bb.\nLorsque vous terminez une s\u00e9rie de donjons, une nouvelle s\u00e9rie apparait. Vous devez alors choisir la taille de cette derni\u00e8re : Very small, Small\u2026\n\nA chaque taille correspond une dur\u00e9e. Par exemple, \u00ab Very small \u00bb vous indiquera que la session prendra en moyenne 6 minutes, contre 12 minutes pour \u00ab Small \u00bb.\nBien entendu, plus la session sera grande, meilleures seront les r\u00e9compenses : quantit\u00e9 minimale d\u2019or, nombre de cartes et ingr\u00e9dients pour le chaudron, taux de progression dans l\u2019aventure.\n", "timestamp_created": 1481049190, "timestamp_updated": 1481049190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514991", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28220508": {"recommendationid": "28220508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024231503", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481585911}, "language": "english", "review": "I had this title on my wishlist for a while without realizing that they offered a demo to play - if you're even the slightest bit curious, play the demo!

With that said, if you're a fan of hack and slash, actionRPGs, dumped countless hours into Diablo I or II, I think you'll recognize the charm.  Book of Demons captures what made those two entries successful.  If you've played Card Hunter, or any similar type \"card\" RPG - you'll recognize those gameplay elements at work here too.  There is a lot of \"tongue-in-cheek\" humor here, and again I say, a lot of charm that can be enjoyed by new players and veterans alike. \n\nThe Flexiscope\u2122 system is great.  This system allows you to choose the length of your quest.  So if you only have 5 or 10 minutes to spare, you can set Flexiscope to small and have a quick romp to scratch that itch, or if you have no time constraints, set it to it's highest option and sink some time into a foray through the dungeons... \n\nNever the same dungeon twice, a great selection of mobs, skills, and items.

Once one started the trend of Alpha/Beta/EAing their games for essentially a preorder price they all did. What is rare to see is an Early access game that has as much polish and working game mechanics as Book of Demons.\nss_91c9958dfd4582e01c2bc5df7418e85218d51ac9-1920x1080\n\nBook of Demons is a hack/slash, ARPG which boasts an impressive amount of customisation to your own requirements. I have sat down for a fair amount of time to see if it\u2019s worth picking up and if you should hop on to help provide valuable feedback for this Early Access or to avoid at all costs\u2026 So far\u2026 Help them out with all the feedback. It\u2019s fun and could be a winner guys.\n\nThe art style is charming and simplistic so it should be available to anyone with a machine, even if it\u2019s a potato. The papercraft universe the appear to be building on keeps it simple but the animations and spell effects provide enough to show promise.\n\nss_bfa47e981fd1e85684acfd289634b97363cf67c0-1920x1080\n\nOn first log in you are met with a classic dungeon crawler ARPG setting (evil, plague, desolate towns blah blah) and a dungeon in the background. You click on it and you see that there is a progress bar (TO HELL) and you will see 2 key points (The cook and the Antipope) I assumed these as \u201cAct\u201d bosses and I was not wrong. Each time you play the game it\u2019s split into a session on which YOU determine the length. You only have a quick 30 minutes? that\u2019s fine. Set it to medium and it\u2019ll give you enough content that will fill out a 30 minute slot, along with providing you some progress towards your next act boss. The more you choose to do, the more rewards, gold and progress. Simple!\n\nss_60bf772669557e76c149375dab82cd55164c3dd5-1920x1080\n\nThe combat is taught to you on your first few levels and it couldn\u2019t be any simpler to start with. You click, you attack, it dies\u2026 This combat does evolve from a simplistic clickfest to actually using your keyboard for abilities and focusing or you\u2019ll die. Death in the game is treated with classic dungeon crawler Hardcore (Daredevil) or normal mode. I opted for the balls of steel approach and was clenching rectally a few times\u2026\n\nAs you progress you will earn cards. These cards act as spells, artifact or items and can be equipped to your action bar.\n\nA consumable does not cost any mana but does spend a charge (replenished through RNGesus drops or via the fortuneteller)\nA spell costs mana and will perform the function outline on the card (charge/bladestorms/mighty blow etc)\nArtifact cards are essentially equipment cards and reserve mana but provided you have a card slot and the mana available will be active at all time\nYou start with only 3 slots available but can increase them through Deckard Ca\u2026I mean\u2026the Sage\u2026 *wink wink*\n\nss_73815aa7580cee8025d886686991364ba3cfd108-1920x1080\n\nEach time you level up you only have 2 options. Health, or Mana. Whatever you didn\u2019t choose is thrown into a \u201ccauldron\u201d and the barmaid back in town will keep it safe until you pay to get it. This will stack up but the cost will not until you purchase it. So the idea behind this is buy only when you need a big boost but there is the risk of dying and losing it all. (For Daredevils this is vital to balance!) Through your travels, you will be lucky and obtain +1 health/mana as a drop from bookshelves/chests and bosses.\n\nThe bosses appear to all have clearly outline abilities and when you reach the \u201cCook\u201d it appears all mechanics taught to you through the act are used in one massive boss fight. This led to an interesting boss fight with actual mechanics.\n\nDue to this game being in Early access, all of the above is subject to change but hopefully in great ways. I did not experience many issues in this early access game.\n\nIf any of the above didn\u2019t sway you\u2026it has a free demo. Literally, decide for yourself, but if you won\u2019t be displeased.\n\nReview from - Noobgrind. http://www.noobgrind.com/book-of-demons-early-access/", "timestamp_created": 1480187523, "timestamp_updated": 1480187523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499840", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27692866": {"recommendationid": "27692866", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989112819", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1514468619}, "language": "polish", "review": "Polski Diablo z papieru.

You start out with 3 card slots out of the maximum of 10 available. Card slots are unlocked using gold and cost incrementally more. As of the build I played (0.75.11062+), only the Warrior class is available. The other 2 classes - Mage and Rogue will be released at a later date according to the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/449960/discussions/0/355043117510126581/]roadmap[/url] but apart from this the game is pretty complete for an Early Access game. The total of 32 cards in the Warrior's arsenal are divided into Artifacts (equipment - e.g. weapons, armor, trinkets), Items (e.g. potions, bombs, town portal scroll) and Spells (e.g. Mighty Blow, Charge, Blade Storm). All Artifacts have a mana cost which effectively reduces your mana pool available for using Spells (Items have no mana cost). Leveling up allows you to increase your health or mana, which translates to taking more hits / casting more spells. You do not actually grow stronger by levelling up. Instead you increase in strength by discovering new cards or upgrading your existing cards using gold and runes you find.\n\n[h1]Dungeoneering [/h1]\nYour goal is of course to take care of The Archdemon that awaits you in the depths of hell. At major intervals you'll find 3 familiar main bosses of Diablo I - The Archdemon being the final boss. So how do the dungeons play out? \n\nThe Flexiscope system let's you decide how big / long a session you wish to play and randomly generates an appropriate dungeon of that size / depth. The range available for selection goes from Very Small (2 floors, ~8 mins) to Very Big (~4-7 floors, ~40+ mins). Note that the progress / rewards are balanced across all sizes that you choose. What it really means is, even if you have only a few minutes Flexiscope will give you a dungeon that still fits your needs. Pure awesome! =)\n\nYou traverse the dungeons in set paths and eliminate the various enemies that you come across by clicking on them. Enemies with elements will have their own quirks e.g. fire enemies are easier to take out with a ice weapon equiped. Boss monsters are pretty fun too. They are like multi-stage enemies in that each stage brings out a different attack pattern / attribute. Having said that, being constrained to a set path can be annoying but for the most part the game has designed it's way around it fairly well. Unlike you, the enemies can swarm at you from all directions however you are given spells / items to get out of those difficult situations.\n\nThe one thing that did trouble me was the fact that [b]you cannot walk through enemies - they block your path[/b]. So if you're surrounded the only way you're getting out is to clear the enemies on either side. It sounds trivial but the combat mechanics of later enemies compound this problem. Shielded enemies can only be damaged after you take out their shields, enemies may charge at you or teleport onto you and archers will be raining death on to you whilst summoners add to their growing numbers. I think you can see how a situation can quickly get out of hand especially when your auto-attack can only hit 3 enemies at a time with a fully upgraded Shadow Sword (Artifact).\n\nOnce you complete Adventure Mode (by taking out The Archdemon), you unlock Freeplay mode and slowly you will unlock the higher difficulties which are made more difficult by forcing you to use a certain number of random cards during a session, having bosses which curse your cards rendering them useless while the boss lives and having harsh penalties for dying (gold loss, card loss, etc). Lastly if that isn\u2019t enough of a challenge there\u2019s Daredevil mode (equivalent of Diablo\u2019s Hardcore mode) and a leaderboard for that.\n\n[h1]Worldbuilding[/h1]\nThe NPCs available - Healer, Barmaid, Sage, Fortune Teller all have clear counterparts to Diablo (except The Healer). The links to Diablo are fairly obvious but are done tastefully in my opinion and I would think they must have chose the voice actors carefully. Reason being they sound remarkably similiar to the voices in Diablo but at the same time are clearly different (hope that makes sense!). It's a pity that they have limited lines of gossip to go through. There are cutscenes for each major boss and I think nobody gives the devs enough credit for the rhymes they put in there. =)\n\n[h1]Conclusion [/h1]\nAll in all, it\u2019s a good game that I hope becomes better with the remaining features on the roadmap. I think it would definitely help to have more cards and better balance (some upgrades feel less meaningful). Some have complained about the difficulty / lack of variety in the enemies and / or procedurally generated dungeons but personally I did not find this a problem. For the record, I did not encounter any bugs during my entire time with the game.\n\n[EDIT] Although Adventure Mode can be completed without experimenting with the card combinations, the late game at higher difficulties requires understanding what combos are viable with the imposed hand. For example, if Blade Storm gets imposed. Do I build a powerful crowd control build - Blade Storm + Shadow Sword + Burning Axe / Frozen Flail or a more flexible build \u2013 Blade Storm + Dagger + Amulet of Mana? In either case, you are still free to swap out cards on the fly to adjust your build to the enemies you are currently facing. Conclusion : Late game is surprisingly well balanced and those hardcore achievements (no equiped cards / no healing) are truly difficult BUT achievable.", "timestamp_created": 1478404616, "timestamp_updated": 1479960350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714159", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26433239": {"recommendationid": "26433239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015782039", "num_games_owned": 621, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1513490091}, "language": "german", "review": "Gro\u00dfartiges Spiel welches den Spielfluss mit immer neuen, genialen Ideen frisch h\u00e4lt und begeistert", "timestamp_created": 1478345021, "timestamp_updated": 1478345021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26431391": {"recommendationid": "26431391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071100655", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490011550}, "language": "italian", "review": "Buon gioco, se provate la demo vi fate un'idea delle meccaniche anche se in modo superficiale; andando avanti si possono potenziare le carte dando la possibilit\u00e0 di provare diverse build.

Describir lo que ha supuesto este videojuego me llevar\u00eda m\u00e1s letras que toda la saga de Harry Potter en \u00e9lfico, as\u00ed que por mi salud,voy a dar por hecho de que tod@s lo conocemos. A modo de resumen, dir\u00e9 que m\u00e1s le vale que no le salga ni un s\u00f3lo gallo al grupo lo suficientemente pirado para hacer algo as\u00ed, o no van a recibir una lluvia de tomates, sino de calabazas de Hallowen cargadas por el mism\u00edsimo Duende Verde.\n\nLo primero en lo que uno se fijar\u00eda es en la est\u00e9tica de semejantes temerarios. Pues bien, te dir\u00e9 que tanto el entorno como los personajes son como de papel, parecen sacados de una serie de dibujos animados de un canal de esos para los  m\u00e1s peques.\n\nAqu\u00ed es cuando empiezas a sangrar por los ojos y a montarte tu ritual a los Dioses Oscuros para que castiguen semejante insulto... Yo te dir\u00eda que antes de que cierres el pentagrama con la cabra dentro,  te tranquilizases un momento.\nEl concierto tiene lugar en un pueblo acojonado porque se ha despertado un mal muy chungo, sus habitantes ofrecer\u00e1n ayuda a la persona con las pedradas suficientes en la cabeza como para investigar ese mal y entre tanto, tendr\u00e1n tiempo para rajar de sus vecinos.La fuente del mal parece ser una Iglesia en la que han mezclado clorh\u00eddico con sulf\u00farico y la han \"liao parda\".\u00bfTe va tranquilizando un poco?.\n\n\u00bfQui\u00e9n va a acudir a semejante festival?.Pues est\u00e1n invitados esqueletucos y otros no muertos con ganas de tirarte los dientes.Como toda gran banda, hay unas groupies que se hacen llamar S\u00facubos, \u00bfte acuerdas de ellas?. Esas demonios ligeritas de ropa que no hac\u00edan otra cosa que levantarte migra\u00f1as de la mucha lata que daban.Hasta hay un palco VIP en el que est\u00e1 alg\u00fan que otro jefote m\u00edtico del t\u00edtulo original.\n\n\u00bfEntonces por qu\u00e9 iban a querer convertir tu t\u00edtulo de culto en un libro de Teo y su familia van al Santuario del Mal?.Realmente no tengo una respuesta que te haga dormir m\u00e1s tranquil@, pero te dir\u00e9 que no se c\u00f3mo, pero este motor logra captar la esencia del titulo de Blizzard a la vez que es capaz de ser original.Supongo que tiene algo de eso que llaman personalidad. Es un motor gr\u00e1fico dise\u00f1ado de cero para la ocasi\u00f3n, su optimizaci\u00f3n es buena, y a pesar de su \"infantilismo\" a primera vista es capaz de ponernos en tensi\u00f3n porque el juego es tan adulto como el que m\u00e1s ya que por mucho dibujito de cart\u00f3n aqu\u00ed o matas pe\u00f1a de ultratumba, o te unes t\u00fa a ella, porque mucha risa y todo lo que t\u00fa quieras pero aqu\u00ed tambi\u00e9n hay su modo con Permadeath.\n\n\u00bfTodav\u00eda tienes la cabra berreando en tu habitaci\u00f3n?.Yo te dir\u00eda que sueltes el cuchillo  y escuches antes de lo que te tengo que decir, porque con este homenaje se le ha intentado quitar algo de hierro al asunto, por no decir que hasta tiene un toque c\u00f3mico. Hay muchos ejemplos, pero quiz\u00e1 el m\u00e1s claro sea que aqu\u00ed, el mism\u00edsimo Diablo pasa sus tardes libres en su ba\u00f1era de lava con un pato de goma.Si has sobrevivido al ictus que te ha producido leer esto y buscas respuestas, te dir\u00e9 lo mismo que antes.No tengo ninguna que te llegue a complacer, s\u00f3lo te puedo decir que no enturbia para nada la experiencia matademonios que se le presupone a un jeugo as\u00ed.\n\nY si has llegado hasta aqu\u00ed sin completar tu ritual oscuro o sin desangrarte por leer tanta herej\u00eda, creo que te mereces que te cuente un poco sobre las mec\u00e1nicas del juego.\n\nEn la versi\u00f3n final tendr\u00e1s 3 personajes a elegir ( actualmente s\u00f3lo el  Guerrero est\u00e1 disponible y pr\u00f3ximamente meter\u00e1n un mago y una arquera).Los personajes van a entrar en la iglesia a repartir ostias sagrad\u00edsimas e ir\u00e1n encontrando equipo, potis y encantamientos. Todos ellos est\u00e1n representados con cartas pero el impacto que tiene esto respecto a un juego de loot tradicional no var\u00eda demasiado. Las cartas de hechizo te consumir\u00e1n man\u00e1 al utilizarse y los de equipamiento de dar\u00e1n propiedades extra adem\u00e1s de ayudarte a reventar a los poco amigables inquilinos de la Iglesia.\n\nSin embargo,a lo largo de tus aventur\u00e1s encontrar\u00e1s muchas m\u00e1s cartas que equipo de inventario tienes, aqu\u00ed es d\u00f3nde entra en juego el tema cartas.El equipo que no utilices aqu\u00ed no lo vender\u00e1s sino que pasar\u00e1 a formar parte de tu mazo y antes de iniciar una aventura, podr\u00e1s quitar y poner las cartas que m\u00e1s te gusten para ir probando combinaciones.\n\n\u00bfMe parece esto una decisi\u00f3n acertada?, pues la verdad es que s\u00ed.El ansia por conseguir nuevo bot\u00edn se logra mantener durante la partida, el equipo no es numeros\u00edsimo pero s\u00ed que te permite experimentar diferentes combinaciones y adem\u00e1s se puede mejorar varios niveles mediante runas que ir\u00e1s encontrando y desbloquear as\u00ed nuevas bonificaciones.En definitiva,cartas s\u00ed, pero sigue siendo un juego de buscar y equiparse loot para ir lo m\u00e1s cheto posible.\n\n\u00bfY como de dif\u00edcil va a ser salvar al mundo ( o al menos al pueblo de 5 amigotes al que has llegado)?, pues la dificultad Normal no creo que te suponga ning\u00fan problema. Sin embargo, las dificultades superiores adem\u00e1s de pincharles esteroides en el culete a tus enemigos introducen unas mec\u00e1nicas bastantes peculiares.Por ejemplo, algunos jefes bloquearan ciertas cartas, por lo que no podr\u00e1s usarlas lo que dure el combate, otras veces al iniciar un run se te \"obligara\" a usar X cartas s\u00ed o s\u00ed, con lo que tendr\u00e1s que crear un mazo a partir de ellas, en definitiva, se le van a\u00f1adiendo toques de roguelike que creo que le dan bastante salsilla al asunto.\n\nUna vez que termines las dificultades principales, se desbloquea un modo \"infinito\", en el que la muerte es permanente y seg\u00fan lo lejos que llegues obtendr\u00e1s una puntuaci\u00f3n para competir en leaderboards, o dicho de otra manera, esto se supone que es el denominado endgame. Aqu\u00ed poco te puedo decir porque hay gente a la que esto el dar\u00e1 para muchas horas y otra que pasar\u00e1 de ello ol\u00edmpicamente.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, los desarrolladores planean a\u00f1adir cartas m\u00e1s raras de encontrar que un espa\u00f1ol que no adore la siesta ( para motivar algo m\u00e1s el farmeo), retocar algo el endgame y a\u00f1adir todas las clases que faltan.\n\nEn definitiva, Book of Demons me parece un homenaje necesario a uno de los titulos que marcaron una \u00e9poca.El homenaje tiene suficientes puntos para ser considerado original sin llegar a perder la esencia.\nParafraseando al gran Sinatra...

This is very possibly due to the fact its in early acess and I am encouraged by survey system they have in place that they are interested in fixing problems found in early acess.\n\nwhat causing me to call it so shallow is its combat. to few items, no synergy with other tiems and a difficulty that so low that  completing the game I did not die once. there are difficutly setting you unlock completing the game but at that point you will likelyl have unlocked all the items/spells/etc and long since past the point of losing interest. combat is not strategic its basicly cookie clicker.\n\nOne thing that got ppl to keep playing diablo was that next rng drop, there is none of that really in this game.I completed the game in large part becase like cookie clicker its one of those games you can just mindlessly play while watching tv etc.\n\nI look forward to seeing if they fix some of the issues I had with it.", "timestamp_created": 1477792055, "timestamp_updated": 1477792055, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602813", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26298250": {"recommendationid": "26298250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032095296", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513253589}, "language": "polish", "review": "ma\u0142o postaci do wybotu wojownk jest jak czarodziej atkuje z daleka niem zr\u00f3wnicowania kla ,niema zbroi jak na przeciwnik\u00f3w tarcza jet prowizozyczna miecze tesz potrzeba lowcy z pistoletami i szczelnami i oczywisie czarodziej i papierowee zwrzeta np wrona i pies kot.......gra jest dobra malo kart i postaci powinno byc mnogo. 5/10 plus za pomysl PS dlaczegonie mam tarczt ..?", "timestamp_created": 1477767067, "timestamp_updated": 1477767067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.412371", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26279607": {"recommendationid": "26279607", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984211875", "num_games_owned": 760, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "last_played": 1514175673}, "language": "english", "review": "I had put this off for a bit when I initially saw it pop up in EA and decided to pick it up after finally getting a little hands on with the demo to actually get a feel for what it is. Everything about this game just feels \"comfy\". The papercraft assets all pop into place with nice little sounds, the clicks and pops of the UI all have a nice feel as you go through them, and theres a lot of little touches to the UI and play experience that show some definite thought was put into the player experience beyond the gameplay. As far as the gameplay itself, its a more straightforward ARPG thats more about staying alive, reacting appropriately to enemy types and managing your cards as you progress, rathe than furiously clicking and seeing huge numbers pop up everywhere. Character advancement is more about gathering the cards, upgrading them, and making subtle adjustments over grinding gear (there is no \"gear\" to speak out outside of the cards which have rarity). Its a bit more laid back but definitely pleasant. The setting and story have kept pretty true to having that \"storybook\" feel it's going for, with the game maintaining its own sense of identity and charm while not feeling overly cheesy with references. \n\nI've still got quite a bit to go with it as of this review, but it's a damn charming game and I wanted to say something about it. I actually had no idea about the Return 2 Games project part of all this until I had booted up the game for the first time and it's a very neat concept. I'd love to see what they do with the other books planned in the future. The planned \"popup sandbox) looks like it will also be an amusing addition. As someone who's a sucker for unlocking, collecting, and arranging trophies, having a little popup book area you can pose and screenshot your own little papercraft unlocks is a cool plan I hope ends up panning out. \n\ntl;dr: Solid little ARPG that looks and feels like a storybook, definitely worth giving the demo a shot if you remotely seem into it.", "timestamp_created": 1477702680, "timestamp_updated": 1478385993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26247398": {"recommendationid": "26247398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252240216", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485106451}, "language": "polish", "review": "Papierowe Diablo zajebista gierka polecam ! :D", "timestamp_created": 1477584478, "timestamp_updated": 1477584478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522230", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26244660": {"recommendationid": "26244660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037046125", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508479175}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8d85\u7ea7\u597d\u73a9!!\u6ce2\u5170\u4eba\u505a\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u90fd\u8fd9\u4e48\u539a\u9053,,\u7f8e\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u975e\u5e38\u8ba8\u6211\u559c\u6b22,\u800c\u4e14\u73b0\u5728\u53c8\u662f\u5927\u83e0\u841d1\u7684\u9898\u6750,\u521a\u5f00\u59cb\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u53ef\u80fd\u89c9\u5f97\u592a\u8f7b\u5ea6\u4e86.\u968f\u7740\u6e38\u620f\u8fdb\u5ea6\u7ee7\u7eed\uff0c\u5361\u724c\u7684\u642d\u914d\u53d8\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u89c9\u5f97\u8d85\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u602a\u7269\u8fd8\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6253\u53d1\uff0c\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u505a\u5230\u624b\u6e38\u4e0a\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u5427\uff01\u5236\u4f5c\u56e2\u961f\u52a0\u6cb9\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u5176\u4ed6\u4e24\u4e2a\u804c\u4e1a\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7bc7\u7ae0\uff0c\u51fa\u4e86DLC\u6211\u4e5f\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\u7684\uff01!", "timestamp_created": 1477571757, "timestamp_updated": 1477571757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26237362": {"recommendationid": "26237362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068803001", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482434521}, "language": "french", "review": "Les graphismes et le deisgn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sont vraiment tr\u00e8s bons.

Although these Books will be self-contained and unique in their own right, they will all share a \"grand vision,\" set in a stylish paper-cut universe. Book of Demons marks the release of the first Book in the Return 2 Games project.\n\nBook of Demons is a fully voiced, Hack & Slash ARPG dungeon crawler coupled with deck-building aspects. Collect skill cards and upgrade them in order to save the world from demonic annihilation. Currently in Early Access, this ARPG manages to provide a very fun take on a popular classic many know and love, Diablo. In its current state, only one of three classes are unlocked (Warrior); however, the single-player campaign is complete, and nearly all of the spell cards are available. The story is mostly provided in bits and pieces through NPC gossip and creature descriptions throughout the duration of the campaign, along with minor cut scenes from the 3 major bosses. The bulk and core content comprising the gameplay focuses on pure, unadulterated, Hack & Slash dungeon crawling with intermittent trips to the town for healing and upgrades.\n\n[h1]Fight to Loot Another Day[/h1]\n\nWhen you first venture into the deep unknown, the Flexiscope system will make itself known. This system aids in tailoring the upcoming set of procedurally generated dungeon levels to match a desired playtime. Although it will take a few tries to hone in on your playstyle, this innovative system manages to do a great job designing to your needs. Almost every end-game dungeon generation and boss fight length approximation was spot on. The game increases your time in the dungeon based on increasing the dungeon's physical map size, creature density, and number of creature types. Larger dungeons will reward you with more obtainable gold and chests. \n\nBook of Demon's combat is fairly simplistic. With only your health and mana to manage, BoD's take on Diablo's combat system takes shape in the form of a static deck-building system (deck is not randomized), along with predetermined and confined movement paths. As opposed to a traditional skill bar filled with skills and consumables, BoD utilizes unlockable card slots to equip skill cards. These skill cards come in the form of pseudo-consumables that must be recharged, spells, and equipment. They must also be individually discovered as loot from your dungeon crawling expeditions. In an ARPG with minimal story elements, the goal is to foster a loot/combat-based addiction in order to motivate progression, and I feel that the developers did a great job in making me feel like a loot junkie. Almost every droppable item will be useful in some shape or form, and the creature mechanics are extremely varied between races. Certain creatures have shields that must be physically targeted with your cursor before damage can be dealt directly to the creature itself. Other monsters can be categorized by their tendencies to jump, charge, warp, spell cast, or spawn henchmen.\n\nAfter defeating the Archdemon, you will unlock Freeplay along with 4 different difficulty levels (Normal, Hard, Nightmare, and Massacre). Everything carries over, and the new mode allows you to generate dungeons from each of the 3 different locations (Labyrinth, Catacombs, Hell). Defeating the bosses in higher difficulties, collecting all remaining cards, player levels, and achievements will add a lot of extra playtime while waiting for the rest of the Early Access content to unlock.\n\n[h1]Early Access Advice[/h1]\n\nThere is an aspect of micro-management in combat that is very fun, and it revolves around the poison, dazed, disrupt, and knocked loose mechanics. These mechanics are implemented by: breaking your poison status (click on health pool), recovering the stars (floating around when dazed), interrupting enemy spell casts (by discharging their cast bubbles), and re-orientating your cards when knocked loose. These mechanics help break up the Hack & Slash monotony; however, this can quickly turn into a clicker game when swarms of creatures start to overwhelm you. For most ARPGs, a single auto attack will instakill grunt-type enemies. Imagine the tedium when a basic grunt takes 3+ hits to kill, while managing a swarm of them on top of much deadlier, spell casters, bowmen, or boss creatures mucking things up. To make things worse, you are also confined to a 2 directional path, so strafing is out of the question. There are certain items that will alleviate the strain when under a swarming ambush (extra phantom attacks, etc.); however, there needs to be a scatter auto-attack weapon, a weapon with a skill shot/aoe placement, or a weapon that can instakill enemies so that the fighting doesn't begin to feel tiresome. Providing more cards that can alter the character\u2019s auto attack properties is also desirable.\n\nRegarding the dungeons themselves, one major downside I have seen in almost every procedurally generated game is the lack of hand-crafted or detailed scenery and events, and upon closer inspection, Book of Demons shows this with too similar environments regardless of room layouts. It takes a little too long to change locations, and combat begins to feel like a chore since nothing special really happens until you reach the area boss (only 3 in the game). A new creature here or there really helps stem this feeling of repetitiveness, although if only for a short while. More interaction with the dungeons would also alleviate some of the strain, such as incorporating puzzle, lever, or switch-type elements along with dynamic tile-changes (moving platforms, trap doors, etc.).\n\n[h1]Complete Walkthrough Playlist[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu2K7KBirQI&index=1&list=PLeavCsRFiP54QIqz4aK8be2rzDdGoLdtp \n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nWith so many weaknesses covered regarding combat mechanics and procedural generation, it's important to know that Book of Demons still does a lot of things well. Don't let my previous scatterbrained thoughts paint a dreary image about this game, because I still had a blast making my way to the Devil's hot tub. The Antipope fight and lair leading up to the boss contained some really fun gameplay elements. In that specific area, your first encounter with the Antipope starts with him scattering all of your cards throughout the dungeon, forcing you to trek through the darkness recovering them all. This was a definite stroke of genius on the developers\u2019 part, as it not only provided a unique twist, but it also made me appreciate cards that I never thought had much usefulness.\n\nThe most important thing to take away from this is that Book of Demons still has an amazing and very solid foundation for improvement, and since the game is still in development, there is a chance that the developers will manage to improve the weaker areas. Adding more cards and classes will already make the game have much more replayability, but to improve the depth, it really needs more story, side objectives, locations, and true boss fights. Fortunately, these ideas are listed in their long-term roadmap of planned features. Going back to what the game does right, the card-based combat and equipment system is fairly refreshing to use, and enables an addictive loot-based progression system. The Flexiscope system also manages to create dungeons in such a way to match your available playtime. Taking all of this into consideration, I am able to confidently recommend Book of Demons to fans of the dungeon-crawling/Hack & Slash ARPG genres.\n\n[table][tr][td]Press copy provided by Thing Trunk[/td][/tr][/table]\n\n[table][tr][td][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BeforeYouBuy]Before You Buy[/url] \u2013 analyses of newly released indie games[/td][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1476073946, "timestamp_updated": 1485200342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562391", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25865841": {"recommendationid": "25865841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028612209", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513028221}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gra jest po prostu kozacka.

Loot in this case is mainly gold and of course cards. Cards consist of your abilities. (A nice feature as it gives lots of ways to play the game!) And rune cards, which are used as a means to upgrading said ability cards coupled with a gold sum.\n\nThe game shows an amazing amount of promise and the devs certainly deserve to be recognized for it's beautiful aesthetic and really addicting, easy to get into gameplay. \n\nAnother incredibly nice feature is this game is great for if you have small amount of time as you can select how much you want to progress from simple 5 minute sessions to 45. \n\nThe devs have also been very vocal on the steam forums about questions, curiosities, concerns, feedback be it negative or positive.

And am I glad I did! I am absolutely loving this gem of a game and I can't wait to see more of it.\n\nI have to say that for an early access game, this one has a ton of content already. I really like how they have implemented feedback within the game, so you don't even have to go to the forums if you find any niggles or come up with suggestions as you play. The immediate impression I got from the game is that the developers have poured a lot of love, hard work, and attention to detail into this game. The price did initially look a little steep, but after having a good look at how much work has gone into the game, I think it's more than fair.\n\nThe backstory of the game goes along your generic Diablo-esque trend: you are an adventurer trying to defeat the forces of evil. The game's approach to dungeoneering, however, is very novel, as it features progress through a combination of stat improvements and cards that you can equip (and level up on their own). While the concept is simple, it is incredibly well implemented, and very well balanced, even at this stage. The subtle humour and gorgeous design (which reminds me a bit of Paper Mario) make it stand out from the crowd even further.\n\nIn brief:\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Gorgeous design! Lots of attention to detail.\n[*]Gameplay that adjusts to how much time you can spare.\n[*]Balanced combat and learning curve, and a progression that feels natural.\n[*]Nice soundtrack.\n[*]Great developers, involved with the community, they have even implemented an in-game [*]feedback system. You really couldn't ask for better on this front.\n[*]Good replayability value (especially when the other classes are implemented).\n[/list]\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Movement/combat (with mouse/keyboard) feels a little awkward at the beginning, until you get used to it. Perhaps it's more natural using a controller.\n[*]Some content is still not accessible (obviously, as the game is not finished, but take it into account before buying!)\n[/list]\n\nAt this stage I'd give it a 9/10, and strongly encourage you to buy it, if you want to be involved in the game's development, or keep an eye on it for when it's released.", "timestamp_created": 1473105235, "timestamp_updated": 1473105323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25365817": {"recommendationid": "25365817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012388063", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489703348}, "language": "english", "review": "Need to get my Diablo1 fix every now and then.

No sense of any real completion - just grinding.\n\nI love games like this, Nethack, Rogue and anything like that. Hours and hours have been put into them and many ASCII characters have lain slain and destroyed by myself and the \"k\".\n\nThe Book of Demons was the first game in a long while that captured the experience for me.  Today I have put a solid two hours into this since purchasing it.  I got as far as the first major boss, The Cook.\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me was the variations on the monsters, you know things got fairly exciting for my hands as they danced across the keyboard and clicked insanely on the mouse to ensure that I was the champion of the fight.\n\nThe graphics are very retro, they remind me of a cross between some elements of those silly PSX sackboy games and paper mario where characters are like cardboard monsters.  The sound effects as well were perfect for the graphic style of game and everything seemed to blend like a smooth cup of coffee and a plate of custard creams before you go to bed.\n\nI loved the fact that I posted on the board asking for an endless NetHack type mode and had an immediate response from the developers on this game.\n\nThe price to me is absolutely worth this.  I could get five tubes of Pringles ( mixed flavours ) and have about one hour and forty three minutes of eating time with enough tubes to make several WiFi signal boosters or a stupid amount of gametime with this that I can return to, time and time again.\n\nYou know what - this game wins hands down and I am delighted with my purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1473003030, "timestamp_updated": 1473003185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521552", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25346314": {"recommendationid": "25346314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190272606", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487479125}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u53e3\u6c14\u4e24\u5929\u73a9\u4e869\u4e2a\u591a\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd8\u4e0d\u662f\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u5f88\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u8ba9\u6211\u56de\u60f3\u8d77\u73a9\u4e86\u5f88\u4e45\u7684diablo2\u548c\u73a9\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u7684diablo3\u3002\n\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u62ab\u7740\u5361\u724c\u5916\u5957\u7684\u7c7bdiablo\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u533a\u522b\u5728\u4e8e\u5361\u724c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u6cd5\u672f\u88c5\u5907\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\n\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u662f\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u53ea\u80fd\u9009\u9a91\u58eb\u4e00\u4e2a\u804c\u4e1a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u88c5\u5907\u8ddf\u6cd5\u672f\u7684\u53d6\u820d\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u94b1\u548c\u7b26\u6587\uff09\u7684\u5408\u7406\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8ba9\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u65b0\u610f\u3002\n\u5230\u540e\u9762\u90a3\u79cd\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u625b\u7740\u4e00\u5806\u602a\uff0c\u8eab\u4e0a\u88ab\u51b0\u51bb\u707c\u70e7\u4e2d\u6bd2\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4e0d\u80fd\u52a8\uff0c\u88ab\u602a\u56f4\u7740\u76f4\u5230\u628a\u836f\u5403\u5b8c\u7684\u7edd\u671b\u771f\u662f\u8ba9\u4eba\u89c9\u5f97\u5f88coooooool\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1472997538, "timestamp_updated": 1472997538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543396", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25344456": {"recommendationid": "25344456", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964866568", "num_games_owned": 935, "num_reviews": 139, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472986679}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice indie (yet solid) take on hack&slash genre.\nIt is based mostly on Diablo 1 by the looks of it, but with a simple walking mechanism and card system\ninstead of skills.\nKilling mobs and getting loot is just as rewarding though.

However, I do want to make sure that other buyers of the game understand what they're getting. I was looking for a new game with controller support in the dungeon crawling and hack and slash genres, and this game came up. That's not exactly accurate, though.\n\nBook of Dungeons is understandably a dungeon crawler, because it takes place for the most part in dungeons that go deeper and deeper as the game progresses. However, it's also a CCG with turn-based combat. A variety of monsters are encountered and unlocked in the bestiary as you progress through the game, and cards of varying uses and rarity are obtained and utilized to build your deck. Players will be able to equip more cards as the game progresses and card slots are unlocked with gold and loot drops.\n\nCombat is turn-based and automatic, so your only options as a player during combat are to move in a grid-like formation along a path to avoid and/or target enemies and projectiles, use consumable cards (like health and mana) click a button to disarm a shield or interrupt a spell to make an emeny vulnerable, or use an ability card, like a spell. No offensive combat happens while your character is in motion, so your choice is to be still and attack or maneuver around to avoid/engage enemies and obtain loot. That's not exactly, \"Hack and slash\" to me, and I have a hunch that this would be confusing to other players as well. Since I paid full price for my copy, and didn't get what I thought I was buying, I want to be very clear about what this game actually is.\n\nIn regard to controller support, the tag is accurate that this game currently provides partial controller support. You will still need a mouse and/or keyboard to access menus, such as those used to level up your character, switch out cards, and upgrade or identify cards. The controller support that is provided works very well. I didn't have any issues on that front, and I would bet that a Steam Controller or controller mapping program could be used for the remaining functions if a gamer was so inclined.\n\nA positive aspect of the game is that it doesn't require a lengthy gaming session to enjoy. Games range from a few minutes to very long, and the player has the ability to set these parameters. Those with short attention spans and those who \"bounce\" between games will appreciate that the developers provided this feature. I know I certainly do.\n\nGraphically, the game is beautiful. I love the angular features of the characters and scenery. It really does look like a world all its own, and it's fun to be a part of it. Overall, I'm having a lot of fun with it, and since I don't usually enjoy turn-based games of any kind, this is a testament to how very well this game has been developed. \n\nIt's a great combination of a lot of different elements, but it's really not categorized very well for browsing by tags. Of the dungeon crawling and hack and slash tags that have been attributed to this game, it's neither one nor the other. I'd classify it as a CCG with turn-based combat and dungeon crawling elements, with the dungeon environment and looting being fundamental to the game. \n\nMost games have elements of other genres, like strategy, which is common and can be attributed to nearly any game, so I realize categorization isn't as simple as it once was. That's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, a lot of great gaming combinations are available now, like one of my favorites which is actually an RPG/Pinball mashup. So while I don't believe these genre fusions are a negative thing, I do think that more attention should be paid to categorization, tags, and descriptions. Games like this with a $20 price tag aren't so easy to dismiss when \"unwrapping\" a game that isn't quite what you thought you had at the checkout.", "timestamp_created": 1472502987, "timestamp_updated": 1472536247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.799636", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25225444": {"recommendationid": "25225444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016717060", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477082476}, "language": "polish", "review": "Przez ostatnie 10 lat zagra\u0142em zaledwie w garst\u0119 tytu\u0142\u00f3w, a tylko kilka z nich da\u0142o mi jak\u0105\u015b przyjemno\u015b\u0107 (L4D2,SC2).

Das ganze funktioniert indem man sich verschiedene Dungeonbereiche \u00fcber das sogenannte \"Flexiscope\" erstellt und diese dann abschlie\u00dft.\n\n[h1]Das Bewegungssystem[/h1]\nMan kann sich mit der Maus oder mit der Tastatur bewegen. Das Spiel hat vorgegebene Pfade in denen man laufen kann. Bereits betretene Wege werden mit grauen Fu\u00dfspuren markiert und wenn ein Pfad abegschlossen ist wird dieser mit goldenen Fu\u00dfspuren markiert. Das SPiel hat eine Art 4 Achsen Bewegungssystem so das die Wege wie in vielen klassischen RPGs recht einfach gehalten sind und man sich nicht frei durch das ganze Bild bewegen kann.\n\n[h1]Das Kampfsystem[/h1]\nDer Charakter k\u00e4mpft automatisch ach ohne Spielereinfluss mit einem Hieb auf einen zuf\u00e4lligen Gegner, man kann jedoch die Kampfgeschwindigkeit stark erh\u00f6hen und einen Gegner fokusieren indem man ihn immer wieder anklickt oder die linke Maustaste auf ihm gedr\u00fcckt h\u00e4lt. Jeder Gegner hat eine gewisse Anzahl an Herzen \u00fcber dem Kopf welche man vernichten muss um ihn zu besiegen.\n\n[h1]Die F\u00e4higkeiten/Ausr\u00fcstung/Tr\u00e4nke/... [/h1]\nAlle F\u00e4higkeiten, Tr\u00e4nke usw sind im Spiel Karten wie bei einem Kartenspiel. Man kann sich im Spiel gesamt 10 karten Schnellslots freispielen in denen man Karten zur Benutzung ablegen kann. Hier muss man entscheiden welche denn alle Karten brauchen die gleichen Slots. Es gibt z.B Artefakte welche einem zus\u00e4tzliche automatische F\u00e4higkeiten geben wie den Gegner in Flammen zu setzen, ihn einzufrieren, bestimmte positive Gegnereffekte schneller zu durchbrechen und vieles mehr. Manche Karten wie Heiltrankkarten m\u00fcssen aufgeladen werden und haben immer nur eine beschr\u00e4nkte nutzbarkeit z.B 4 nutzungen bevor man sie in der STadt wieder aufladen kann. Alle Karten haben 3 STufen, wenn man sie droppt haben sie Stufe 1, k\u00f6nnen aber mit Runenkarten auf Stufe 3 erh\u00f6ht werden was ihre Wirkung verbessert aber auch ihre Kosten erh\u00f6ht.\n\n[h1]Die Gegner[/h1]\nDie Gegner sind zahlreich und haben viele verschiedene Eigenschaften, Es gibt nah und Fernk\u00e4mpfer, Magier und Physische gegner, Gegner die andere Gegner spawnen, Gegner mit R\u00fcstungen und vieles mehr.\n\n[h1]Die Bosse[/h1]\nEs gibt in vielen Dungeons kleine Bosse welche mehrere Stufen besitzen, Ein Boss ist erkennbar da das Spiel vor dem Kampf eine kleine Animation zeigt in der sie den Boss anvisiert und zum anderen da am oberen mittleren Bildschirmrand eine Leiste erscheint mit mehreren Kugeln. Jede kugel zeigt eine ander Stufe an und zwischen den Kugeln ist ein hinweis darauf wie dieser zu ebsiegen ist. hier gibt es viele verschiedene varianten wie z.B das man eine bestimmte zeit in der n\u00e4he des Bosses \u00fcberleben muss, Ihm die Herzen zerst\u00f6ren muss, seine Leibgare ausschalten muss, usw...\nWenn die gesamte Leiste ausgef\u00fcllt ist und die Leiste bei der letzten kugel mit dem Totenkopf ankommt ist der Boss besiegt.\nKleine und gro\u00dfe Bosse funktionieren vom Hauptsystem gleich nur das die gro\u00dfen Bosse etwas schwerer sind. Die kleinen Bosse k\u00f6nnen ein oder mehrfach in einem Dungeon vorkommen, die gro\u00dfen Bosse kommen nur am Ende der 3 Kapitel vor und m\u00fcssen zum Kapitelwechsel besiegt werden.\n\n[h1]Das Levelsystem[/h1]\nDurch Erfahrung levelt der Char nach und nach auf bis zu einem Maximallevel von 50, bei jedem Level kann man einen Punkt auf Leben oder Magie setzen und wird dadurch st\u00e4rker. Zus\u00e4tzlich evrlieren die Gegner 1 Herz vom Maximalleben und sind dadurch schw\u00e4cher, was sozusagen simuliert das der CHarakter st\u00e4rker wurde.\nBei Level 10,20,35 erreicht man einen neuen Rang was jedoch nur das Aussehen des Charakters ver\u00e4ndert.\n\n[h1]Spielmodis[/h1]\nEs gibt 2 Spielmodis, Story und Freeplay, wobei der Freeplay Modus erst freigeschalten wird wenn man die Story abgeschlossen hat.\n\n[h1]Die Helden[/h1]\nEs gibt gesamt 3 Helden, den Krieger, den Magier und dden Bogensch\u00fctzen. Momentan ist nur der Krieger spielbar.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n- Sch\u00f6ne papercut Grafik\n- Keine Abst\u00fcrze\n- Sch\u00f6nes Spielsystem\n- Viele anlehnungen an alte Klassiker wie z.B Diablo 1\n- ca 8-10h Spielzeit pro Durchlauf\n- Durch Freeplaymodus kanna uch nach der Story weitrgespielt werden\n- Viele M\u00f6glichkeiten\n- Mehrere Schwierigkeitsgrade\n- Bossk\u00e4mpfe\n\n[h1]Neutrales[/h1]\n- Viele Achievements\n- Sammelkarten\n- Controllerunterst\u00fctzung\n- Gute Ingame STatistiken\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n- Manchmal bleibt man zwischen monstern stecken und kommt kaum noch raus.\n- Manchmal war ein Weg von einem gegner belegt wodurch man mit der Maus nicht rauskam aber mit der Tastatur noch rauslaufen konnte\n- Gegner die \u00fcbereinander stehen sind schwer zu t\u00f6ten da man nicht steuern kann welcher davon attackiert wird, besonders st\u00f6rend wenn diese noch Schild haben und man das vom Unteren nicht sieht.\n- Teilweise sind Gegner schwerer als die Bosse, besonders im ENdteil des Spieles\n- Die Gro\u00dfen bosse sind zu einfach\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nEin tolles Spiel das jedem Fan dieser Spielart gefallen w\u00fcrde, jedoch sollte sich ejder klar sein das es noch im EA ist und viele Funktionen wie Quests, weitere Helden, Sternensystem usw noch nicht fertig.

This is especially frustrating since the clickable circle hitboxes under the enemies don't appear until AFTER you have clicked them. \n\nSecondly the \"Force Stand Still\" button is left shift (not space) and having it there when space is not mapped to anything either will leads to sore pinky fingers.\n\nOther than that the game is great, a cool dungeon crawler with a twist that has some really cool ideas.

We are also enlarging hit areas on monsters (by the way - you don't have to click circles under the monsters, but the monsters themselves) so hitting smaller monsters should be easier. You could also consider using WASD steering with disabled mouse movement - it eliminates misclick entirely). \n\nI hope this update will allow you to enjoy the game to the fullest - consider joining the community in the forums.

If you have a 1440p or higher resolution monitor, be aware of this. I also do not know if it supports aspect ratios other than 16:10 and 16:9. If you have an ultrawide monitor, I cannot guarantee they offer a suitable resolution.\nAt the bottom of this review is a link to the game's discussions where the developers say higher resolutions aren't coming in the future either. \n\nThe good: \nThe game itself feels pretty innovative and I really liked the card system for your skills, equipment and consumables. The dungeon size slider is also a nice touch. The art style is very nice as well. It has a little \"Don't Starve\" influence, with everything being made out of paper, but in its very own way. \n\nThe bad:\nAside from the resolution problems mentioned under \"The technical\", the game suffers from immense swings in difficulty because of the procedural generation. Long corridors with archers can be a pain, as well as rooms being packed to the bring with monsters. This can be extra frustrating because monsters block your movement.

The paper motif takes a little getting used to, and you're limited to moving where the paths in the game go (and mobs don't have this limitation), so fights take some planning, and the card system is deeper than it originally looked (it's a card system instead of the usual RPG skill tree), but I count all of those as positives.  It's worth playing with the combination of armor cards and active spell cards.  You can trade them pretty much on the fly, so if you get stuck on a level it's worth mixing and matching.   I love that there's a slider that lets you choose the dungeon size; sometimes I just don't have a ton of time to play, but I can still get my fix in with a smaller dungeon.\n\nIt's early release, but a lot smoother than I've seen with other early release games.  There are some tweaks they could work on: \n1/ difficulty in freeplay doesn't seem to scale up that much (currently in .\n2/ I love completing a dungeon level, but sometimes loot and/or mobs are hidden or bugged, even when I've walked through repeatedly (seemed to happen more in story mode than freeplay mode).\n3/ Some of the copious Steam achievements don't seem to sync (eg. warrior level 3 cards).\n\n I can't wait for the rogue and mage to be unlocked, and for more books to be released!

I personally love the art style, but the real selling point for me are things that deviate from the current Diablo 3 style of hack and slash game, that annoy me.\n\n1) Equipment and abilities. Rather than collecting gear and going for a cookie cutter \"optimal build\" you collect cards, with the intention of being able to switch them around with at whim. This means you do not suffer from tedious inventory/stash issues, and can change your build on the fly to deal with whatever you encounter along the way. You have to balance your resources between passive \"equipment\" type cards and active abilities/items with on use properties.\n\n2) Mousing over collection of basic resources. Seriously, how long have people asked in D3 to not have to click on materials to pick them up? Here you can just mouse over gold, and whilst you have to click other items you find, they are more sparse and therefore a lot less annoying to pick up.\n\n3) Mechanics. Don't stand in the shit on the ground, pull carefully, interrupt casters, and dodge missiles. Thus far missiles have been dodgeable since you get an indicator of where they will hit allowing you to sidestep. Pretty much everything frustrating that is encountered in this game has an answer in the cards. \n\n4) Restrained use of visual effects. If you're like me, you get super tired of incessant, flashy, pixel vomit explosions. This game uses visual effects sparingly which allows you to more easily see where e.g. ranged mobs are shooting from, where missiles will hit, and nasty stuff that you don't want to be standing in.\n\nTL;DR - if you liked classic games that weren't just mindless spamming of noisy/flashy spell effects, then give this one a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1470121523, "timestamp_updated": 1470121523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600307", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24663756": {"recommendationid": "24663756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084605668", "num_games_owned": 765, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496416731}, "language": "english", "review": "[B] 90% Origasmic\n10% SHIFT is your friend[/B]\n\nWhat can I say? \nThe one that lives in a world made of paper shouldn't throw Molotovs at other people's houses.\n\nTalking about the game, is pretty good, I  can't see none of the other reviews bad points.\nLow gold?

This is my first ever review and the first ever early access game I bought on steam and it was worth it for this game. You want to know why?\n\nBook of Demons, while still Early Access, is incredibly polished in it's current state. This game just oozes atmosphere. You find yourself in a little town and your goal is to purge the church (and what's under it) from evil. Sounds close to Diablo, right? And that's what's so great about this game. Being an homage it takes the best the Diablo series has to offer and presents it in a whole new package. One of the greatest thing about this game is its graphics and art design. The game is set in a papercrafted world, which has its own unique charme to it.\n\nYour goal is to clear procedually generated dungeons till you reach the utter bottom where an evil awaits you that likes to play with rubber ducks while bathing in fire (game has great humor), get new cards which you can collect and equip, get loot and gold. Book of Demons offers several sub-systems, such as upgrading your looted cards which are your skills you use in the game. These cards can also be charged in between each dungeon. You can also open the so called cauldron for gold, which gives you a prize (or prizes) and either HP or mana. \n\nWhile in a dungeon you move your character on predetermined paths by clicking in the direction you want to go. Enemies are also fought by clicking on them and often require different approaches. Sometimes you have to first click away their block before you can attack them, other times you have to stop mages from casting so they don't become a bigger threat than they already are. The game keeps these encounters fresh by introducing new mechanics and enemies all the time. The movement of the character could be improved (don't forget that it's fresh in early access) and the developers are already working on enabling WASD as a movement option.\n\nTo keep it short I'm gonna list some positives/negatives:\n\n[b]Thumbs up[/b]\n\n-Graphics and art design\n-Oozes atmosphere\n-Good Soundtrack and voice work\n-Humor\n-Variety of enemies\n-Almost no bugs and no crashes so far\n-Good performance\n-Great card collecting and skill system\n-3 distinct classes (mage, rogue and warrior) -> only warrior enabled right now though\n-Procedually generated dungeons\n-Cool boss encounters which keep you on your toes\n-Integrated Feedback system\n-Absolutely great involvement from the developers concerning the community. Issues and feedback threads are getting noticed almost immediately and are getting individual responses from the developer team. They really want to make a great game (they are almost there).\n\n[b]Thumbs Down[/b]\n\n-Could use a little bit snappier movement (WASD option already in work though!)\n-Sometimes frustrating encounters with countless archers and mages shooting at you\n-Some balancing issues concerning encounters and dungeon rooms\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1470079037, "timestamp_updated": 1470079037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24650910": {"recommendationid": "24650910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067379788", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470131388}, "language": "english", "review": "much fun, reminded me of playing diablo when i was a younger.  if you enjoyed the diablo franchise and want a fresh take on it check this game out.", "timestamp_created": 1470052039, "timestamp_updated": 1470052039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24646420": {"recommendationid": "24646420", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975255072", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470004131}, "language": "english", "review": "I have mixed experiences about this game. Also, please note that this review is from an Early Access version of the game (first release to be specific). I've played Book of Demons for two hours and have experienced a fair amount of the game to write this review. Now this review is very much my opinion, but I will be explaining the positives and negatives with both facts and feeling.\n\nBook of Demons is an ARPG that is ment to be a Paperverse parody of the first Diablo game. It uses a familiar feel of the Diablo franchise (both in looks, gameplay, and story) but makes itself a unique take on the hack-n-slash classic. \n\nSo in Book of Demons you have a hand made up of cards obtained throughout the dungeons you explore. You start out with the capacity for only three cards but can begin to expand to a maxamum of 10 cards in your hand. These cards can be interchanged at any time, allowing for various ways of playing your character. When you die in a dungeon you lose everything in your hand, as well as all of your money; the only way to get your cards and money back is by finding your body in the dungeon and picking up your items. This sounds simple enough but can become quite problematic. \n\nA big issue with this is that you can easily and quickly become overwhelmed by mobs of enemies that: poison upon death, freeze you in place, can stun you, surround you (which stops you from escaping), and many other things. If you become surrounded, poisoned, frozen and so forth you can very quickly die. The worst offender of them all becomes the stun mechanic which forces you to catch several wandering stars inorder to take any action in the game again, all the while the enemies are killing you... horribly. \n\nIn additon, the movement while in combat is atrocious. When you go to attack an enemy, there are times when it doesnt register right, or you miss click ever so slightly, and begin charging to the enemy horde. Meanwhile, when you try to move away from the enemies, you have to spam click only to be rewarded with the character hesitently moving away from the mobs. Getting your character to backtrack away from enemies is one of the most frustrating things about this game. \n\nNot to mention everything costs money. Everything. And a LOT of it. First hand expansion slot? 5,000 gold. The second? 10,000. Rune merging, card charging (the ones that require it), card upgrading, culdron of rewards, identifying an unknown item, and more... all cost. Its quite excessive, unnecessarily so. Even for a grindy dungeon crawling hack-n-slash.\n\nNow while I have some grievences I do have things that I love about this game. The art style for one. I absolutely love the pop-up style design of Book of Demons. Then theres the voice acting, which is rich and captivating. The funny nuances and unique beastery, mixed with a wondeful ambeance, really bring this game to life in a spectacular way. Not to mention all the different combinations of cards you can set as your hand, giving you many different ways to play Book of Demons.\n\nSo, allow me to simplify this with a pro's and cons list to allow for a more condensed viewing:\n\nPro's:\n*Art\n*Music\n*Voice Acting\n*Random Dungeon Generation\n*Conceptulization\n*Card System\n*Reward System\n*Runs Smooth\n\nCon's:\n*Stun System\n*Overly Brutal at Early Levels\n*Just Overly Brutal in General\n*Movement While in Combat \n*Death is too Harsh\n*Everything is Costly\n*Monsteres Swarm You Stopping You From Escaping\n\nThese are just a few of the Pro's and Con's, as going into an even further explination would make this review become much longer. In the end, there were so many issues with my dungeon experience, it made progressing impossible. I've played Diablo II and Diablo III for a very long time, and have completed them on the most extreme of difficulties. This, however, made me struggle out of nowhere. \n\nFor the first hour everything was okay with minor challenge as I was learning how to play. During the second hour the difficulty shot to a level that you would expect from the end layers of the game. I wanted this game to be amazing, and during the beginning it was... it was only after the first hour that my fun turned into an unbearable frustration of inpassability. \n\nIf you are a fan of the Diablo franchise, and were expecting it to be like Diablo but with a unique comedic twist, then this game is not for you. If however, you enjoy ARPG hack-n-slash games and do not mind the current issues that may or may not ever be resolved, then please, buy this game and have fun. Maybe oneday I will re-purchase this game, but so long as it remains a game that I cannot complete with all the issues I had encountered then I shall move on to the next thing.\n\nI recomend this game to people who love ARPG's and hack-n-slash game who do not mind the extreme difficulty and wonky mechanics. For anyone else, take some time to watch a lot of videos on it and research if this really is a game you would enjoy. Don't just go for it over the first few glances you see. Just be weary, prospective buyer.

It could have been a great game, but there are so many things that I find so annoying when I play that I have to wonder why they were put in the game in the first place.  These aren't bugs.  This isn't a case of early access working the kinks out of the game.  These are features of the game which serve only to detract from the enjoyment.\n\nOne issue I have, and the one that became the most annoying to me, is that whenever your character gets stunned, a circle of stars appear on the screen, and you have to catch them all so that you can end the stun and get back to the game.  It feels like an N64 Mario minigame being randomly activated while I'm playing.  Really, it's hard for me to explain how stupid this is unless you've played the game, and I'm not for a minute suggesting that you do.  Look, imagine that every time you sat down to eat a meal, every so often someone would start waving crap in front of your face and you had to grab  it before you could take another bite.  This is how Book of Demons do.\n\nOn it goes, from the ability cards that get deactivated or \u201ctilted\u201d with no notice, to the wandering around to find the piece of gold laying behind a statue somewhere because the level isn't \u201ccomplete\u201d without it, to the monsters that can attack you from offscreen, well, you get the idea.\n\nI've almost finished Book of Demons, and I'm going to see it through to the end.  It's such a cool idea that I want to like it so much more than I do.  I guess I plan to finish it not because of what it is, but what it could have been.  It could have been a great game.\n\n**edit**  Well, despite saying I was going to finish this game, I ran into another issue that seems to be a major roadblock.  I'm pretty close to the bottom of the dungeon, and monsters are rather numerous.  Three summoners are sitting on the stairs to the previous level.  Every time I try to click on them to fight, I go up the stairs.  All I can do is continuously fight the minons they summon.  This is getting tedious.\n\n8-13-2016 update:  Despite the horrid creatures that lurk within the Book of Demons, I do check back on the game to see if any of the issues I have had are fixed.  By horrid creatures, I don't mean the monsters in the game, I mean the people who play it, but anyway.  I will gladly remove each issue I mentioned as they go away, if they do, but so far it has been the same.  At least by now all of the special needs children who trolled my review and profile have either been blocked by me, or have moved on to more pressing issues such as eating paint chips.  So there's that at least.\n\n4-17-17 update:  Forgot this game existed until the developer commented on this review.  Reinstalled it, and feel pretty much the same as before.  Got stunned and had to catch the stars.  I know they say there is an item that prevents that, but I don't have one, and it's still an annoying mechanic.  So is the transition between rooms, which often wind up with me doing a dance in and out of a room because there are several enemies standing by the door.  I very quickly noticed the same old annoyances from before. You know, this game has been available for sale for long enough to consider this my final revision.

This takes some getting used to especially since the controls are still a bit clunky and unresponsive (I have almost died several times because my character was going in a direction it wasn't supposed to or it wasn't moving at all despite frantically clicking with the mouse). However, the voice acting, art style, graphics, and deck building mechanics are top notch. A lot of times the game feels less hack and slash and more action-puzzle (like Legend of Zelda) since a wrong move can spell either escape or utter defeat (and believe me, dying in this game really sucks). In this sense, it somehow becomes a rogue-lite.\n\nPROS:\n+ Exquisite art style, beautiful sound design, and a thoroughly immersive theme and atmosphere\n+ Interesting combat mechanic (sadly marred by clunky mouse controls - hoping it gets fixed in the future)\n+ High replay value due to procedurally generated dungeons\n+ You feel that this game was made with just so much heart and love for the genre\n\nCONS:\n- Clunky/unresponsive movements\n- Game difficulty ramps up too quickly for comfort. This is not a game you can just relax with and just hack and slash and kill monsters with like Diablo or Torchlight\n- Dying equates to significant loss in cauldron rewards (which is a big deal as cauldron rewards award life or mana points)\n- Some bugs (like my character disappearing all of sudden) but hopefully this gets ironed out when the game leaves early access\n\n\nTLDR: Get it.

I also enjoy the fact that instead of regular items you have these CARDS that you can switch and upgrade whenever you want. Because of this, the possibilities to play your character are endless. Well, maybe not \"infinite,\" but you can try multiple builds with the same character. For instance: AoE build, Single-attack Glass Cannon or Bomb thrower - just to name a few.  \n\nLearning curve is great too. Our class is well-balanced even if you sometimes have problems defeating certain levels. After those 8 hours I know, that if I can't defeat an enemy I just have to switch build and use all the cards I have to progress in the storyline. \n\nOverall, a must-have for any fan of the genre.

I love hack and slash/ diablo like games. The loot grind calls my name. But the artistic direction threw me off of an impulse buy. But I am so glad that I picked it up.\n\nSo, this game is the first in a 7 game series to pay homeage to old pc gems. This is obviously based on the first Diablo game. How did they do?  Fantastic. This game is just great. I dont feel like i am playing diablo at all, but I can see the inspiration. That is what makes me so happy. If I want to play Diablo, I'll just go do that. But this game is unique in its art direction and game mechanics in a great way.\n\nSo how was my experience? Well, I thought I woud write my review after an hour-hour and a half. At around the point where people debate refunds from steam. So what am I thinking? Well, after about 20 minutes in the game, a bit of world building an a small dungeon later, I encounter one of this games best features, IMO. \n\nSo, I am a husband and a PhD student working on his disertation in post-quantum crypto. So my gaming hobby doesnt get all the time i wish it did. But, sometimes I ahve 15 minutes of nothing and would liek to hop into a game. I cant try to get back into a game like witcher3 where I would barely get into a side quest. Not enough time for a round of my moba or mmo of the month. Yet, Book of Demons has a beautiful solution. So, when you go to enther the dungeon, after your first one, you encounter a slider bar, which changes the lenth of dungeon you can enter, with a time estimator. This time estimator will learn based on your previous dungeon runs to become more accurate. This feature alone made me go to the main website and purchase the founders bundle for all 7 games. (I dont expect this feature in all 7, but this game just made me too happy to not want to throw my money at R2G)\n\nSo, now when I have 10 minutes or an hour, I can choose a dungeon of appropiate length, and have a blast with the card based ability/armor/loot system. I know there is a good amount of humor and movie/game references in this game, which I look forward to finding. Also, for achievement hunters, this game has 150 i believe? I read that in a forum post, so dont quote me on that. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the long review, but just a fantastic job Return 2 Games. I look forward to the final product of Book of Demons and the other 6 installments of your series. I gladly throw my money at you for your hard work and will continue to be a happy customer.", "timestamp_created": 1469765446, "timestamp_updated": 1469765446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24588701": {"recommendationid": "24588701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130244381", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474199216}, "language": "french", "review": "Super jeu dynamique et rapide si on a pas trop de temps devant nous , tr\u00e8s jolie graphisme et assez adictif , je conseil entre deux game de LoL ca peut toujours apaiser :p", "timestamp_created": 1469763329, "timestamp_updated": 1469763329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24588017": {"recommendationid": "24588017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010702467", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471730105}, "language": "english", "review": "If you don\u2019t have time (or desire to read a review) I\u2019m giving R2G:BoD a BUY rating. \n\nThing Trunk did a great job on the execution of this game.

As a new person to this type of hash and slash adventure game (featuring deck building), I can say I really enjoyed it. As it stands it is almost fully complete already and the campaign is fully playable. I made a pros and cons list below:\n\nPro:\n- Campaign is complete and features the first class of three\n- Dungeons (campaign) are really fun to play though and have adjustable lengths you can set\n- Controls are pretty fun, although auto-walk was weird to get use to\n- Loot is rewarding and fun to obtain\n- It is a nice difficulty with it being hard enough but not impossible\n- Animations and cut scenes were amazing to watch and see\n- Story was very involving and progress felt earned and visible\n- Bug free\n- VOICE ACTING IS AMAZING\n- Bosses are creative and fun to beat\n- Only $15 on sale which is a steal!\n\nCons:\n- Tutorial throws alot of information at you, but it is not terrible\n- Lots of dialogue (if you don't like that)\n\nOverall: 9/10 - Very high potential",

It's similar to run in roguelike - you finish it and get rewards after that. Before session you see how much time your game will take and how many gold/rewards you will get. Have only 10 mins free? Play a short game and kill couple small bosses. Friends called and said they will be hour late? Play a long one and dig deep into dungeon.

Just wow!\nThis game is so good, I had to write my first ever review about it^^\n\nOn first sight, the rather unusual papercut aesthetic looks a bit weird and, together with the you-can-only-move-along-a-fixed-path-mechanic, might give the impression of a silly game with rather light mechanisms.\nBut thats so not the case. The graphics are spot on and convey just the right mood and atmosphere. Its very much like Diablo in that regard, just a tiny bit more funny.\nContrary to that, the mechanics couldn't be more different. Although still a hack'n'slash dungeon crawler, the way to go about your business is very different and refreshingly new. \nJust to name a few:\n-inside a dungeon you can only move along a fixed path from junction to junction (although the levels a randomly generated).\n-shielded enemies have an actual shield icon somewhere near them, that you have to destroy first before you can damage them.\n-gold and health pickups are gathered automatically once you hover your mouse over them.\n-random(?) boss monsters have various stages where they use different skills.\n-skills from regular monsters (like teleporting or summoning minions) can be cancelled by clicking on them.\n\nGranted, those things make the game sound like some mobile clicker game, but it is not! Its difficult to explain, but as soon as everything is in motion, the game plays very smooth and tactically challenging while still being fast and (once you got used to the unusual ways of controlling) easy at the same time.\n\nAbout the card mechanics... Don't assume, there is a card game mechanic here. Its just that skills/spells/items are represented as cards. They are equipped on a shared skillbar and can either be passive, activatable for mana or activatable for a specific amount of times before they need to be recharged.\n\nI know I haven't covered all aspects of the game, like the wonderful random dungeon generation with a \"learning\" time prediction to make the game last exactly as long as you want it to.\n\nThis game offeres many new mechanics that at the same time tie in very well to the gameplay we are used to from previous dungeon crawlers. Granted, I've just played one of the three characters for about 90 minutes, but at this point the game feels very polished and I can't wait to see what the devs have up their sleeves for the coming months.\n\nIf you like dungeon crawl hack'n'slays - buy it!\nIf you are interested in cool new mechanics - buy it!", "timestamp_created": 1469730880, "timestamp_updated": 1469730880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639909", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24580285": {"recommendationid": "24580285", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998420060", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470155509}, "language": "english", "review": "Loving it more the more I play.

It looked weird, yet I gave it a shot and after starting it up the first time, I played for several hours, untill that game started crashing on one level and I couldn't proceed (played before it was released, didn't encounter any crashes as of today). And I was crushed that I can't continue on, I've been enjoying my time with this title a lot! This day marks the release so I jumped right on it and finished the main story.\n\nIf you are seeing this title for the first time, let me tell you why it's worth your time.\nThis is a hack & slash done right, there's a big enemy pool the game is drawing from and you're seeing something new all the time from basic skeletons and zombies to crazy mages that will fill the screen with spawned enemies and then, if you escape, teleport all of them right on top of you again. You gain loot in the form of money, consumables and most importantly, relics and runes to upgrade these relics in the form of cards. You essentially create your deck of cards that your character will equip and that defines your build. There are 32 cards available for the knight character and you can equip up to 10 of them at a time. You can freely switch your cards even when curently in a dungeon.\n\nAt this stage of early access you only have the knight available, your character is stuck in a created path that you can't divert from, yet anemies occupy the whole place. No worries, it works well (although I had to get used to the auto-walk mechanic, where you click in a direction you want to go and your character walks untill he bumps into a cross-road, an enemy or you click behind him) and you can attack in all directions with a surprising ammount of range for a melee character, it feels like you have a bow equiped but honestly with the ammount of enemies you have to deal with in later levels, this only makes sense as you'd get swarmed and killed in no time without this range.\n\nAdmitedly, the game felt rather easy, I have yet to die a single time and I have finished the story and done a little of free-play, the first two levels were hardly a challange but once I got into hell it started to be a bit more interesting, there I got to finally see my character's ability when his HP reaches 0 (you gain some HP back and push enemies back, sort of a second-wind mechanic). The difficulty spike in the final area is pretty big and it felt like I jumped over a step before that. Once you enter free-play, enemies do much more damage, feels like a new game +, you keep all your loot and upgrades, but you can replay previous levels and unlock more difficulties for free-play, I can see how the high difficulties will be a big challange.\n\nBosses are well done, outside of the 3 main bosses, the random ones you encounter in dungeons have various phases that you have to beat in order to kill it. Sometimes you have to stand nearby the boss, sometimes you have to kill his summoned enemies and sometimes you just have to go trigger happy on him , I always feel excited when a boss pops-up and it's a shame they don't seem to appear as often in free-play (from what I can tell you get one at the end of the final dungeon in a level where as in the main mode you can sometimes encounter as many as 3 in a single dungeon). I believe they are randomly generated so sometimes you get a really weak one and sometimes you just wish it would die already. The main trio felt unique, I am going to spoil the first one where you have to destroy many pots to find a key but the pots are trapped with explosives, enemies and really no loot outside of junk, you can get a chain-reaction going there pretty easily as some pots spawn more pots with random properities so if you failed to kill that bomb that explodes into 3 more boms and these explode into 9 more bombs and so on, there's suddenly a swarm of enemies going after you. And that's the first main boss, or at least a path to it, good stuff. I felt that the final boss could have been more unique tho, it felt anticlimactic compared to the other two.\n\nOverall I've had a great time and will most likely be returning to this game from time to time.

P.S. do the \"hardcore\" mode it's a lot better, you just can't die but it adds a bit more fun and risk.\n\nThe game recognizes dungeon sizes & the average amount of play time to beat the dungeons this is a great feature. This allows for you to get an idea of how long you can play, just in case your life is very busy/hectic. The difficulty isn't that hard when it's set to normal, the builds are each unique. \n\nI would watch a youtube play through.

Currently (Jan 2018) the full game is playable and very polished. BoD is showing no signs of being an abandoned cash grab as some Early Access games seem to end up (Looking at YOU, Godus devs!).\n\nClone of Diablo? -- YES! Take all the great things about Diablo (hack-n-slash, dungeon crawling. multiple classes) and strip away the more cumbersome aspects (inventory managemant, large never ending areas) and you have a core game that has become an industry classic.\n\nInstead of inventory theres a card mechanic. You find, collect, equip, and even upgrade various cards to grant certain abilities, spells, or items. When attacked by spiders my Rogue fav tactic is to cast my 'Fear' spell, making mobs run from me, then activate my fire arrows to burn them all to ashes. No worries however, my mana rechage amulet makes sure I'll be ready again soon for the next wave around the corner. \n\nBoD provides the basic core Diablo experiance in a simpler format. This game is VERY easy to simply pickup and play at any time, at any level, for as long as you choose.\n\nAs long as i choose? -- The Flexiscope concept is genius! Each 'game' length is adjusted by you! Pick how long you want to play, a short game for 15 mins or a big game for 45 minutes, it's up to YOU! The game studies past performance and can estimate how long the amount of levels you've picked will take to play. At first it was a bit inaccuate, but now after 25+ hours of gameplay the system fairly accuarately can predict the time needed for the size of the game I pick. Its all adjustible whenever i start a new 'game' or more accuately a 'round'. A HUGE gameplay conveinence that I'd LOVE to see more games adopt.\n\nWhat's the mood? -- A fun and almost whimsical papercraft visual presentation imeadiately cuts some of the 'heavyweight' tones of the Diablo storyline, letting you know this game isnt too serious, and yet detailed enough to feel substantial. This isnt a completely causal game. It is very polished, wonderfully voiced acted, excellent mood setting score, and even a bit humerous as well.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1516641412, "timestamp_updated": 1516641412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39530658": {"recommendationid": "39530658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049734351", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 674, "last_played": 1516865847}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun take on ARPGs with a geat unique look and playstyle.

etwas f\u00fcr Trading Card Games \u00fcbrig hat, macht mit diesem Spiel nix falsch. Zwar sind einige Spielinhalte fast eins zu eins vom Klassiker entliehen, aber w\u00e4hrend des Spielens \u00fcberwiegt f\u00fcr mich doch das Gef\u00fchl, ein neuartiges Spiel vor mir zu haben, in das viel Herzblut eingeflossen ist. Im Grunde gibt es wie im Original zwei sich abwechselnde Spielabschnitte: Im Dorf gibt es die aus Diablo 1 bekannten Charaktere, die Heilung und Identifikation (soweit bekannt) sowie Upgrades und den magischen Kessel (neu) \u00fcbernehmen. Hat man sich hier eingedeckt, geht es in den Dungeon. Hier gilt es erstmal, den Schock zu \u00fcberwinden, dass man sich \"auf Schienen\" durch das Verlies bewegt. Seltsame Design-Entscheidung. Vor allem die ersten Level wirken dadurch besonders langweilig. Danach entfaltet das Spiel trotzdem schnell sein Suchtpotenzial, weil die Gegner sehr abwechslungsreich sind und man sich auf die Jagd nach Karten macht, die in diesem Spiel F\u00e4higkeiten, Buffs und Items darstellen. Diese Karten kann man in erweiterbare Slots legen, um sie schnell benutzen zu k\u00f6nnen bzw., im Falle von Buffs, auszur\u00fcsten. Das Spiel enth\u00e4lt sinnvolle Features, die man sich fr\u00fcher in Diablo I gew\u00fcnscht h\u00e4tte. Z.B. erh\u00e4lt man jetzt eine Benachrichtigung, wenn man alles an Loot auf einer Ebene eingesammelt hat. Hat man sich am Ende durch alle Ebenen durchgek\u00e4mpft und Diablos Origami-Vetter besiegt, kann man unendlich oft weiterspielen, um neue Schwierigkeitsgrade und Karten-Upgrades freizuspielen. Es gibt auch viele Achievements, die etwa zur H\u00e4lfte leicht zu erhalten sind und zur anderen H\u00e4lfte unendlich weit fern f\u00fcr einen Gelegenheitszocker sind. Die Achievements haben sogar ingame eine Bedeutung, wenn auch nur eine kosmetische. Sie halten zumindest nach dem ersten Durchspielen an der Stange.\n\nHier sind die positiven und negativen Aspekte, die mir beim Spielen ins Auge gefallen sind:\n\n+ Sehr h\u00fcbscher Grafikstil :)\n+ Fl\u00fcssiges Gameplay mit sinnvollen Skills und Items\n+ Sammelfieber beim Finden von neuen Karten\n+ Spiel wird regelm\u00e4\u00dfig geupdatet und hat eine einfache Feedback-Funktion\n+ Fairer Schwierigkeitsgrad\n+ Alle Gegnerf\u00e4higkeiten werden beim ersten Auftreten kurz erl\u00e4utert\n+ Convenience-Features\n+ Man kann nicht wie im Original an explodierenden F\u00e4ssern sterben\n\n+- Es gibt noch keine Quests (ist wohl noch geplant)\n\n- Magischer Kessel macht es sinnlos, sich bei Level-Aufstieg zwischen HP- oder MP-Upgrade zu entscheiden. Man erh\u00e4lt eh beides\n- Stellenweise zu einfach, manche Buffs sind overpowered\n- Story ist vorhanden, aber belanglos und nicht in Szene gesetzt. Halt wie im Original. Ist vielleicht auch ganz gut so...\n- Flexiscope-Feature ist sinnlos. W\u00fcrde auch ohne funktionieren\n- Vergiftungen und Stuns nerven sehr!\n- Kein Feedback, wenn man Gegner trifft (keine Schadensanimation)\n- Feindlichen Geschossen kann man kaum ausweichen. Und es gibt keine \"Abwehren\"-Taste/Funktion\n\nEines sollte man bei diesem Spiel echt im Kopf behalten: Wer sich dieses Spiel kauft und es nicht als das wahrnehmen will, was es ist, n\u00e4mlich eine einzige Tributzollung an das gro\u00dfe Diablo I, der wird sich die ganze Zeit \u00e4rgern, dass so viele Dinge 1 zu 1 \u00fcbernommen wurden: Angefangen bei den D\u00f6rflern (von denen der Elder tats\u00e4chlich sogar wie Deckard Cain klingt) \u00fcber die Szenerie und den Gegnern ist wirklich alles von Diablo I abgekupfert. Der eine freut sich vielleicht \u00fcber die Reminiszenz, der andere mag sich \u00fcber die freche Selbstbedienung am Klassiker \u00e4rgern. \u00dcber den Grafikstil l\u00e4sst sich \u00e4hnlich streiten.", "timestamp_created": 1520892666, "timestamp_updated": 1520892666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40724279": {"recommendationid": "40724279", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980935147", "num_games_owned": 686, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 316, "last_played": 1521416894}, "language": "english", "review": "Deck building, dungeon crawling, and looting.

That's why I bought it right after finishing the demo.\nSecond - this particular demo will lie to you.\n\nI can not recommend this game, and not due to some bug (it works perfectly, and visuals are good) - its core is rotten. Whole campaign gives you great casual 5-6 hours long experience (0 deaths, 100% completion on every level). If it worth its price tag - it's up to you to decide.\n\nThen comes the freeplay. Same randomly generated levels, but with increased difficulty. And here comes the issue - how this difficulty is achieved. In my previous deck-building dame (Slay the Spire) creators made enemies stronger with every Ascension level, simultaneously adding new cards that might help you to build your deck in a new way. And in my opinion it's the right way to make games like this harder.\n\nBook of demons takes oppposite approach. It just ***ks up your deck to make game more difficult, blocking some cards in boss battles and forcing you to keep some cards in your hand. It's particularly obvious with the archer, which can randomly trigger bosses from across half of the map with a stray arrow. If random strikes successfully - you can be left with 10% of your damage output and no options to escape/heal. It didn't happen to me (I survived few close calls), but I can easily picture it happening, especially on dificulties after second.\n\nTL;DR: Deck-building game that doesn't let you to build your deck with the cards you have, choose, and spend fortune to upgrade.

I'm only 3 hours into it--3 hours of solid gaming, by the way, of which I've enjoyed every last minute, but I'm already VERY HAPPY that I bought this! The graphics are delightful, the game is tons of fun--not too easy, not too hard! and I have a steady feeling of accomplishment. I also love the TONS of different monsters, and different types of monsters, in the game, and I'm glad to see that Book of Demons has a sense of humor, as well. \n\nA couple of things: I do hope that they add more cards! There are over 30 now, and they're fun to play with, but I'd love to see these get added to; hopefully, on a regular basis. Honestly, with a game like this, I really hope that they add more of everything, because constantly discovering NEW STUFF!!! is a lot of the fun! It's not necessary, of course, but it would help keep the game fresh, and that's important, I feel. I also hope that they make something that gives us the random abilities of the original Diablo, where, going in, we never really knew what powers our heroes would end up with. That always made the game more interesting and replayable, because your strategy was never exactly the same. I'm hoping to see more of that, in Book of Demons. It exists now, but it could really be pushed. \n\nReplayability absolutely ought to be maximized to it's utmost limit, here, and in this kind of game--and yes, I WILL pay for DLC that keeps pushing that limit, on and on.\n\nThis is already a really FUN game, that does remind me of the original Diablo--which, to be honest, I actually did like better than the sequel. (It also reminds me of Gauntlet, which was the forefather of Diablo, and it injects some of the slightly-silly fun that Gauntlet had, back into this genre, while enhancing it.) The original had a dark atmosphere, that always kind of kept me on the edge of my seat. Book of Demons does that too, actually! although definitely in a much more lighthearted, less-gloomy kind of way. I kind of like that, even better. It's not the same, but that's good. If I want the same, I can always go back and play Diablo, after all.

It's all just a very drab, mouse-clicker experience.\n\nTL;DR RATING: 6/10 - Okay but not great.\n\n=== PROS ===\n- THE BEST PART - The Devs are great, very involved with the community, and it's updated often. Even though this game wasn't for me I'm still tempted to back the Studio itself with a \"Supporter Pack\".\n- Artstyle is pretty unique.\n- Narration is top notch.\n- Ability to choose how much time you have to sit down and play.\n\n=== CONS ===\n- The combat is quite dull and uninspired. Your little paper character merely hops when he attacks, the monsters don't flinch or anything from powerful spells, and overall it just feels like you're clicking what's on the screen.\n- Movement is restricted to straight lines.\n- Mouse / Keyboard is kinda wonky when targeting and moving at the same time.\n- Gameplay elements constantly draw your attention away from the action. When you get poisoned for instance, a little icon appears above your healthpool that you click to cure yourself; well you have to manage that while being attacked from all sides. I get that it's probably to make the game difficult but it definitely limited my immersion having to constantly check for effects that I needed to click on away from all the action almost offscreen.\n- Leveling up does nothing for you but increase health or mana.\n- There's no equipment or loot in the way you would expect from a Diablo-esque game. It's all cards that are basically abilities you would've gotten from leveling up in any other ARPG.

Looking forward to finish my first playthrough with the warrior.\n\nFor those that want to know more about the game here goes....\nThere's no gear in this game, none! You only have skills you get from cards that you will get as drops and must equip in the skill bar. Those are a bit like Path of Exile skill gems except there's with no support gems and they don't level with experience. You simply need to get special cards and gold to upgrade your skill cards.  Even the skills for different types of potions like health and mana are cards you get as drops and equip them to be able to use them.  So you main focus will be buying more card slots to equip more skills and upgrade those cards.  \nWhen you level, you will get points to invest in Health or Mana.  But you can also get extra Health or Mana points from just killing and looting stuff.  Some of these items will end up in a cauldron that the lady npc in the village has.  This will accumulate and you will need to buy from her so she can brew that cauldron.  once she does, it's random but you might get all kinds of stuff like extra permanent health of mana points, gold or other stuff (havent played too much so far so not sure what else it can drop).  Also, the cards can drop Magical and legendary versions of them which can have extra properties on them.\n\nYour character can only walk on this predefined road that you can't move out of like a car road with a single lane but you can only go forward or back so you cannot turn until you hit an intersections and decide where to go from there.  \n\nThe different type of monsters will sometimes swarm all around you and block you in so you better always have a skill that will knock them out of your way else you might have more difficulty surviving.\n\nYou must at least try this game!\n\nThing Trunk has a good games on their hands, I wish them the best and please make more games like this.\n\nThis is already part of my 2018 favorites list.", "timestamp_created": 1520185206, "timestamp_updated": 1520185206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40564251": {"recommendationid": "40564251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178970669", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "last_played": 1521328033}, "language": "english", "review": "EARLY-ACCESS-REVIEW\ngreat game, awesome and very responsive devs\n\ntry and enjoy, it\u00b4s worth it!\n", "timestamp_created": 1520174893, "timestamp_updated": 1520174893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40450567": {"recommendationid": "40450567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045810995", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520141452}, "language": "english", "review": "**Book of Demons** is a blast! **Slay the Spire** meets **Diablo**, to put it simply. \n\nIf I had to buy this game again to keep playing, I would.

It ultimately fails by trying to invent new mechanics that are less fun and more tedious than necessary. I\u2019ll be listening the positives and negatives below.\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n[b]Modernized Adventuring: [/b]  you get too choose how long it takes to progress through levels in the dungeon, these range from a few minutes to an hour, letting you enjoy the adventure at your own pace.\n[b]Town Without a Portal: [/b]  You can venture to town in-between floors, reducing the necessity for Town-Portal spells, but this also comes with a draw back as there\u2019s no real point to the Town-Portal spell they put in game.\n[b]Multi-Stage Bosses: [/b]  Mini-Bosses and regular Bosses are designed to be more like a puzzle than a meat-sack with a billion health, there\u2019s more focus on the mechanics rather than the classic Diablo Hit>Dodge>Hit repetition.\n[b]Card Me:[/b] Lots of variety in the different attack/defense/passive/limited-use cards, with each one having additional variants that can be found in the dungeon.\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n[b]Elemental Mechanics: [/b] Quite possibly one of the most annoying features depending on class. Certain monsters have elemental health, meaning you need to counter it with the corresponding elemental spell. Problem is, characters like the Rogue only have Arrow-Spells that have a % chance to inflict elemental damage, so you\u2019re stuck grinding away on some monsters for a very long time.\n[b]On-Death Spam: [/b]  Finally grind down that elemental monster? Chances are, another different elemental monster will spawn on it\u2019s death. This isn\u2019t an issue at first, but becomes huge after the second act, where almost every monster spawns a second monster, forcing you to sit there and play whack-a-mole.\n[b]Hit-And-Wait: [/b]  Certain monsters \u2018rage\u2019 if you hit them too fast, too many times. You have to wait between shots or else the monster regenerates health. None of them are a challenge to fight, it just wastes your time as you sit there slowly plinking away on some +10 health monster for a minute.\n[b]Hitboxes: [/b]  For an isometric game, this one is fairly punishing as far as hitboxes go. Play as the rogue, and watch as your arrows phase through monsters as you try and figure out what exactly constitutes as a hitbox. Diablo was much more lenient in this regard.\n[b]Why-Upgrade?: [/b]  Each spell/ability/passive card has multiple magical versions of itself. You don\u2019t know what they are, or when you\u2019ll get them, but chances are you probably has a shitty version of whatever card you\u2019re using. It\u2019s extremely expensive upgrading cards through two additional stages, making it feel pointless to upgrade unless you get a Legendary version of a card.\n[b]Movement System: [/b]   You move along a preselect path, which isn\u2019t bad, but the game can have a really bad time figuring out which direction you want to head if you\u2019re using the WASD keys, it's 2018 people, stop doing this.\n[b]Crippling FPS: [/b]  Got too many enemies on screen? This game will bring your computer to a crawl unless you\u2019re running a 1080. This is surprising given that Diablo2 could have six times the amount of enemies on screen.\n[b]Respawning Shields:[/b] Certain monsters have \u2018shields\u2019 that require you to be a certain distance in order to break. Fine, this isn\u2019t bad, but combine it with an elemental monster, and the fact that shields respawn without a visible timer, means you\u2019re going to spend a lot of time slowly grinding down some non-threatening monster. \n\n[h1]Overall:[/h1] I can\u2019t recommend this game because it figuratively takes two steps forward, and then one back for each new mechanic it reinvents to try and be different from it\u2019s older cousins. The mechanics aren\u2019t exactly punishing, but are designed to extend the grind as you sit there and whittle away an enemy\u2019s defenses.

Not worth the price.\n\nI only played one hour and something stroke me immediately: this is a game designed for a future mobile port.\nThis might no be necessarily a bad thing, but it is in this case for a couple of reasons:\n\n-You are in a dungeon but you are constrained in specific corridors (look at the trailer), your character moves automatically in a direction you choose until you stop. This gives an oversemplicistic feel to the game that just bothers me when i have a mouse i could do tons of quick and precise actions with.\n\n-You attack monsters in sight automatically (you attack at range with a SWORD!). Again, a mechanic that is perfect for mobile since you don't have precise control with the touchscreen, but just feels so lame on a PC hack n slash.\n\n-Since you walk along corridors where there is no space whatsoever for dodging (you can't move on the side, only forward or backward) all the projectiles coming towards you are almost impossible to dodge. Also there are some monsters attacks that are impossible to dodge too. Paired with the fact that recovering health requires gold (you pay gold in town to refill your potions), it means that the game is designed to FORCE you to pay gold (i can see the in game purchase at the horizon...).\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game is really well done for a mobile game, but again i expect something very different for a price of over 12\u20ac.", "timestamp_created": 1519427562, "timestamp_updated": 1519427562, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40337618": {"recommendationid": "40337618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029113272", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520188244}, "language": "english", "review": "well, it's realy nice mix of diablo and card collectable.

That is to say that I killed the Lord of Darkness at the bottom of the dungeon. You can keep going deeper, which I did for a couple of more games to see how the \"free play\" worked, and it was fun too.\n\nWhat can I say? The game has charm. I can't explain why it pulled me in so much. Maybe it was the cards (skills) that you acquire and level-up. Maybe it's the cauldron prize system... So what that is, is as you play thru the dungeons, you pick up weird stuff like teeth, ham bones, green juice, etc, and then the lady back at town pitches it all in the cauldron. The longer you go, and the longer you get more ingredients, the better the brew gets. The brew is actually just a bunch of random prizes, from piles of gold, to runes (used to level up your skills), to new skills. If you die, the brew vanishes uncollected and you start over, so you have to decide when you want to cash out. Cashing out means that you spend an increasing amount of gold each time to get the prizes out. Anyhow, it's an interesting mechanic to make you scared of dying even if you aren't playing Hardcore, which I think is pure genius. In diablo, who cares if you die? It doesn't matter. Here, it does.\n\nI like how the game lets you pick your dungeon size, based on how much time you have. When you start the game, you are presented with a half a dozen or so dungeon sizes, and how long they should take to complete, based on your normal speed. So, it's personalized that way.\n\nThere are lots of different enemy mechanics, but you learn them pretty quickly, and if you're a seasoned ARPG player, they are little more than speed bumps. They have one mechanic where you can't kill the mini boss until you kill certain minions around him (noted by dotted lines). There are a couple of interesting fights where you fight a boss like that, but his \"minions\" are actually two other bosses, so the fight stretches fairly long.\n\nOne thing they do get right is the feel of combat. It's fast and responsive, just as it should be.\n\nThey have limited tile sets and monsters, you can only walk on certain paths, there is no map (woe is me), but they do have a breadcrumb system that shows you where you've been. Your character hops around the map like a board game piece, and the monsters, players and npcs all look like cardboard cut-outs. These are some of the things that I rolled my eyes at in the beginning until the actual game play pulled me in.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think it's the cauldron, the card hunt, the card leveling system, the ability to pick your dungeon size, and the ease of play that makes the game alluring. After each run you don't have to disenchant a bunch of crap, repair, throw a bunch of crap in the stash, or anything like that. It's stripped down to the basic fun - kill monsters and level up your cards. The inventory system is clean and easy.\n\n\nFor $13, I'm glad I played it.", "timestamp_created": 1519398392, "timestamp_updated": 1519398392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40325739": {"recommendationid": "40325739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035564924", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3308, "last_played": 1521730210}, "language": "english", "review": "After I had an issue which causes the game not to start anymore, I wrote to the support and... wow.

I find that grating. In addition, there are share buttons all over the place. I find that even more grating.

You move along preset paths, by clicking or WASD (though WASD doesn't work terribly well at some intersections, due to the way it gives priority to going certain ways). This simplifies movement. Okay... why? I'm genuinely curious. Because it doesn't remove any challenge, so far as I can see.

And you still would need two hands to use all your abilities on the number keys, unless you had a many-buttoned mouse. I genuinely don't get the point of it, unless it's for a mobile port down the line.\n\nAnd the card system. They basically just replaced... everything, in terms of loot and abilities, with cards. I also don't get why that innovation was needed. It just means you get far less loot (not even counting junk loot), and it has a bit of a different theme.\n\nAlso, they removed attributes like strength, dexterity, intelligence, and just have health and mana. I don't find that simplification necessary either, but maybe that at least is because I'm not the target audience. And it does fit with their goal of \"accessibility\" - even if the on-rails control scheme doesn't, as far as I can tell.\n\nThere is one very good mechanic they have: the \"Flexiverse.\" Which is basically the ability to decide how big a level is. That is certainly good for accessibility. It's a neat feature more games should have. Because people have lives. And I respect a game that respects my time for that, at least.\n\nIt's interesting, and I didn't hate any of its systems (though I did hate the ads), but I just found them less interesting than what they came from. It seems like a step back. Maybe it'd be an excellent mobile ARPG, if the business model wasn't scummy.

As you mouse over them, your character will excitedly whack them until they run out of hearts. You can also click on them for better control of which creature is getting whacked.\n\nUnlike an ARPG, the loot in the game comes in the forms of cards. The simple attack mechanics are augmented with cards that drop from foes and chests, granting additional attacks, elemental effects, armor, and more. \nMana is used to fuel the cards. With a limited pool, you\u2019ll have to balance, as an example, an expensive suit of armor and a shield that can block 50% of incoming arrows, against a spell that lets you smite foes with a mighty fist. Leveling up allows you to put additional points into your health or mana pool, so some pre-planning is important.\n\nAs you dive deeper into the dungeon, foes begin to use special powers and attacks as well. Enemies might have a shield that your auto-attack won\u2019t penetrate, requiring the player to furiously click on the shield until it breaks. Other enemies might explode, poisoning both friends and foes in range. \n\nSub-bosses are named creatures you\u2019ll encounter that have special attacks. They may summon buddies that render them invincible until you dispatch all of them. They could also have a shield, explode with poison, freeze you, leap across the screen and stun you, or a combination of those and many more. Add in the fact that they have to be dropped to zero health multiple times before they are dispatched, and are randomly placed in the dungeon, and you have a recipe for replay as well as surprise.\n\nWhile the game is still Early Access [b][i]Book of Demons[/i][/b] are already off to a great start with a great looking and unique papercraft style.

I am running through using the mage now. As you would expect, it is quite a bit different as a mage. It is also much differerent because of the cards that I am getting on this run through which I did not get last time as the warrior. I have yet to try the third class.\n\nMy intitial reaction was that the walking speed is a little slow, but when you've played it a bit it matches the somewhat relaxed play style (as I am not using the hardcore mode - it is relaxed!).\n\nPlaying in 'expert' or hardcore mode is something I will do next.\n\nThe novel way that you interact with the foes you encounter is interesting and fun. As a totally different alternative to the way other games out there play, it seems to work well. For example, if a foe has a shield you have to literally click on the shield they are holding to break it with your attacks. This means you have to concentrate on that and can't do much else about whatever is attacking you. Similarly, to break a boss or mini-boss's special attacks you'll need to click and hold on a marker for that. It sounds somewhat odd, but it works to keep you always busy.\n\nIt sounds like it might not work - but it does work.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, grab the demo and then buy it! I do not regret donating the supporter package having now had the full game for even a short time. Because of the way the random cards are dealt and the monsters are generated and interact, it has a lot of replayability even at this early stage of development.\n\nIt has never crashed on me or had any bugged feature.\n\np.s.

This game has only 3 bossfights and the rest is repetative gameplay.

Then play this game now.\"\n\"Paper-cuts have never been this fun!\"\n\nI rarely ever decide to write reviews for a game, but this game has made me absolutely want to leave one for anyone wondering about the quality of this game. I originally purchased this game a year or two ago when I was on a Diablo kick, and found it irresistably charming, but with only one class at the time and many other features pending it was a work in progress so while I enjoyed it immensely I shelved it for a bit so as to see if the devs would continue to update it, and holy crap have they ever been working hard!\n\nFast forward two years later, I picked it up again and this game is more feature rich than many currently released games, and this game is still a few months away according to the (very active) developers and their roadmap. Let me explain the current state of the game:\nIt is absolutely brilliant. All 3 classes have now been released, and all are at a extreme level of polish. The last class--the Rogue--was released at the tail end of last year after the other two had been out a while, the devs ensured it was not released until it was truly good and ready. The game itself is maybe 6 months away from release, but that is because they wish to add in even MORE features and polish it even more. This game is perfectly enjoyable as is, and I recommend anyone who enjoys Diablo type ARPGs to give this a try.\n\nPros:\n+Perfectly captures the Diablo feel without any of the excess trimmings (could be positive or negative depending on your viewpoint, for me it's a positive)\n+3 distinct and complete classes (Warrior, Mage, Rogue)\n+Amazingly deep and feature rich card system for abilities that is FAR more than I can ever explain here\n+Has a Flexiscope which lets you select the size and time length of the dungeon you want to run. Only have 15 minutes? Run a small dungeon and still get your rewards!\n+Extreme replayability, all dungeons are randomly generated like ARPG fans enjoy!\n+Combat system is just like Diablo, click or hold to attack and number keys or right-click on cards to use spells/abilities\n+Can run on just about any computer\n+Absolutely charming paper-cut art style\n+No in-game transactions or cash shop, at ALL. Everything is earned in game only\n+Is the first of (I believe) 7 games to be released by this company, each encapsulating a gaming genre perfectly like this\n\nCons:\n-Is strictly focused on capturing and encapsulating Diablo without the frills that accompanied it, strictly on the ARPG combat and dungeoneering aspect (As I said, can be positive or negative depending on what you want out of it)\n-Art style may not be for everyone or some may think it is too 'cartoon-y'\n-Movement can feel restricted as your path, while branching, is somewhat set (Hard to explain, easier to see in action. I enjoy it quite a bit now as it helps keep things going but it seems to be the #1 detraction I hear from people)\n-No skill trees like Diablo, all abilities are gained from cards you loot  (Note: All cards are earned in game, there is 100% NO cash shop or any possible way to get them besides playing the game, so do not worry about that aspect)\n-Is still technically in 'Early Access' though the game is feature-rich enough for release, the developers just want a even higher standard for their product before they will establish the game as 'Released'\n-Can be very difficult as the game goes on, throws many enemies at you with very innovative and different mechanics (A positive in my opinion, but some people dislike a nice ramping difficulty and/or multiple enemy mechanics so I left it down here)\n-No online play or lobbies like is common in Diablo II and other such games (I don't particularly mind the lack of it as I prefer the single player aspect, and the developers have stated it's not totally off the table in the future if they ever wanted to add it) but I know a lot of ARPG players expect online play to be standard\n\nTLDR for the lazy: If you're here, you are likely a fan of Diablo/ARPGs.

The paper art-style and obvious inspirations from Diablo make for a satisfying experience at $20. The developers nail their intent to tap into the nostalgia of older gamers, while at the same time appealing to broader audiences.\n \nThere\u2019s quite a bit to be happy about here. With 3 playable classes I\u2019d imagine that you could easily get 40-60 hours out of the game if you try and squeeze the most out of it. The item/card system is fairly unique and does a good job of pulling those strings that make me want to complete \u201cone more run\u201d. The fact that you can also determine the average length of time to commit to each run is also implemented in a very cool way. \n\nOn the flip side, Book of Demons itself does have some optimization issues. I\u2019m running a Core i7-4770k system with 16 GB of ram and a 1080 GTX, but get some disappointing frame issues later in the game when moderately larger amounts of mobs are spawning. I also find that the movement, while on rails, \u201cfelt\u201d unresponsive though this may just be a factor of the rail system itself. Lastly, in my opinion, there\u2019s just not a ton of depth here for an ARPG. It\u2019s a clear straight shot down the dungeon levels until you hit the end boss. If you\u2019re looking for a vastness and diversity of content like you\u2019ll find in D3, Grim Dawn of POE, you won\u2019t find it here.  \n\nThere are more books to come, an implied 7 total, which will be added to this collection bearing the same art-style. I assume each installment will cost the same $20, so we can gather that in the end the full collection will be around $140. No clear time table has been determined for when future offerings will be added. Nor is there any specific indication of what genres will be represented with each release. In looking at the Support pack upgrade at $50, you can discern that it may ultimately be a great deal.\n\nAll in all I can recommend Book of Demons to just about anyone.

Of the thousands of hours I have spent playing ARPG, Book of Demons offer a fresh and fun experience. Its core offerings to me are three.\n\n(1) Replayability. Dungeons are randomly generated. Boss stages are random. The cards or builds that you bring to the higher difficulty or against each boss could also have a random element to it that either work for or against you.\n\n(2) Flexibility on time. I can determine the dungeon size based on the time I have to play this game. Be it as a 10 mins run. Or a 40 mins run. I have total control over it. I will still get the reward in the end. For someone who has a certain real life obligation, this is wonderful.\n\n(3) Catered for \"mid-core\" players. I.e. appealing for both casual and hard core players. There aren't any complicated mathematic formula behind the scene that I would need to research upon. Everything is intuitive. When I spend time playing and learning the game, I can be a good players. It is less reliance on the hours long gear grinding in the traditional ARPG sense but the ability to counter each mob type around me given the constraints I have. And that would include the positioning of my character that some may find it strange while I find it an absolutely necessity (and genius design really). This design makes the concept of enemy strong tanks in front and powerful but fragile casters behind works. This design also makes enemy summoners really scary at times.\n\nOther than the above three core strengths of the game, I like the artwork of Book of Demons. The voice acting is fantastic. At the time of writing this review, I have played 30+ hours. My warrior is at level 50 now playing nightmare difficulty. I can't wait to see this game coming out of early access.

You movement is restricted to back and forth making it impossible in many cases to manouvre, so the only thing you do is move forward or backwards and spam the attack button. There is almost no gameplay involved except for picking some equipment from the cards that take away your ability to use Mana, which is absolutly fine because you really dont need it as long as you spam that button. Oh but there is a twist.... armored oponents require you to spam a different button before you can continue spamming the attack button... \n\nSomeone compared it to Diablo, but the only thing this game has in comon with Diablo is the viewpoint of the camera.", "timestamp_created": 1516988777, "timestamp_updated": 1516988777, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39619707": {"recommendationid": "39619707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198773791597", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517392131}, "language": "english", "review": "This game brings me back to the days of old school Diablo without the headaches. The game is more of a stylistic redo of the original Diablo than it is a game that pays homage to it. I'm personally not much into card based RPGs but the system put in place here makes it feel more like they are actual pieces of equipment than they are consumable items that go away after one use. It's fast paced but does require you to actually pay attention to everything around you otherwise you'll get overwhelmed. I've yet to get frustrated with this game as I have with other action RPGs and this is a great way to kill time in between your main game between updates or if you're just waiting for the next big title to come out. Overall this RPG is solid, not overbearing, easy to understand and can hold it's own against many of the other \"budget\" RPGs on steam and I would dare even say it's better than some of the most popular of titles. I recommend giving this game a chance and let yourself get lost in the story, gameplay and visuals. For what this game tries to do, it does it well and I've yet to come across any glaring issues. The only thing that I would recommend is a faster walk speed in the dungeons but this isn't really a complaint, more of a quality of life suggestion. Try out the game guys and gals, you shouldn't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1516934104, "timestamp_updated": 1516934104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}}

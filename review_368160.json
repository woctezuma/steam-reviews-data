He lives in a city on the moon which is a nation on its own, but where government have almost no say in anything, it is an economic free zone, it is a bit like early US, and Hong Kong used to be and to some degree still is. It tells his story his downs and ups and about his dream, and how he works towards his goal using his brains. There is some religious elements thrown in there, but fortunately they are minor. The focus is on the hero and how he fights to achieve his dreams and for what he believes in using his brains. Towards the end I expected to be majorly dissapointed, but was positively surprised.

Some of the main characters have their names changed.. for some dumb reason. All i can notice for now is that\n\nLisa - Risa\nSerrault - Cerrow\n\nI don't know why they did this, maybe as a nickname like \"Hal\" was for the main protagonist sometimes in the first episode, but to me it's just really confusing.\n\n2. The text scrolling is weird compared to the first one. Before, it was smooth and effortless before, it felt like nothing. But this time, every time i click, it felt.. off to me, different from before.

And better, mostly.\n\n[b]Graphics: 7/10[/b]\n\nIt's an improvement of most things from part one, and graphics aren't an exception; character sprites are more varied, backgrounds are nicer and fit better with the rest of the art, and CGs are much better; the final CG itself is a work of art. Same as part one, however, the CG gallery isn't unlocked until you finish the VN.\n\n[b]Sound: 6/10[/b]\n\nAlso a marked improvement over the first part; still no voice acting, and the music is rather forgettable, but it's no longer irritating and does its work well.\n\n[b]Story: 10/10[/b]\n\nIn many regards, this is also an improvement over the first volume; it's darker and shows a much more marked character growth for the protagonist and people around him. It's slow at the start, taking time to rebuild its setting after the timeskip, but once it gets going it's just as gripping and emotional as the earlier volume, all the way up to its grand conclusion.\n\nSadly, one area where it's actually worse is in its use of economics jargon; as befitting a second part, it touches more complex concepts of finance throughout the plot, such as options trading, but actually manages to explain them [i]less[/i] than part one, to the point I'd recommend to keep Wikipedia handy if you haven't studied the field before even in passing. Another possible point of contention is the change in romanization of character names, which took me some time to get used to; part three uses a mix of one and two, so at least the series is consistent in its inconsistency.\n\nOne warning, though: unlike part one, you [i]will[/i] need to read part three as soon as you finish with this one.\n\n[b]Longevity: 6/10[/b]\n\nAs the first part, it's a kinetic novel with no choices whatsoever. Took me around 6 hours to read it all, but I can't say whether it took me longer than the first because it's longer, or because of its jargon; I did have a bit of trouble following it at times.\n\nReplay value is just as with part one: pretty high for a kinetic VN due to foreshadowing of later events, as well as the jargon used throughout.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nMuch like part one, this is a wonderful VN that will toy with your feelings over and over again, all while teaching you about the world of finance in a realistic way, even if it's set on the moon. However, if by some reason you can't purchase the third volume, I'd skip this one until you can read all three; it'd be sheer torture otherwise.", "timestamp_created": 1493006385, "timestamp_updated": 1493006385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30360045": {"recommendationid": "30360045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010395496", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488797556}, "language": "english", "review": "Avg Read: 4-6hrs\nType: Kinetic\n\nDescription:  Haru woke up with his life but without his dream. 4 years after the incident, he finds a new cause, as a driven young lady offers him a chance to return to investing and to find justice.\n\nThoughts: I really enjoyed this build up to the final stage for the third part novel. Haru has been changed by his past failure and is struggling to get back on his feet to look for Hagana. To sum up this second part without spoilers would be its the training arc of an anime.

Even though my recommendation wasn't exactly glowing for the previous one, I would definitely recommend this one if you made it through the first. In my honest opinion, it was definitely better than the first.\n\nThe story this time around is four years on from the end of WEE episode 1 and is still economics based but the plots shift a bit. He is no longer making money for the sake of some ludicrous dream. In fact, he is no longer making much money at all. He and some Swiss (?) noble attempt to fight the corrupt giants of the financial world and a romantic sub-plot creeps in. He is stuck in a love polygon between several girls (yes this is a visual novel) but, this being WEE you do not get a choice in the matter. Fighting for justice is not simple and Haru (this translation team changed his name from Hal) must learn this while walking the razor's edge and not lose sight of what really matters.\n\nSome new characters are introduced in this installation of WEE. Eleanor, a Swiss noble and heir to a large financial company. A real \"little princess\". A little princess who is also mentioned to be 18 (apparently that was necessary) and is actually quite cute - both her and Haru accept their closeness but, she has a few problems revealed in this VN. Le Goff is Eleanor's advisor / guardian / butler and while he does not get much screen time, he and Haru immediately begin getting along as one quickly realises the other's mountain of experience with the financial world. Another character to mention is Chris; while she is not new, she is a late bloomer and, well... she has a few issues to sort out with Haru. Four years of closeness and care had an impact on both of them.\n\nThe artwork, again, is nothing to gawk at but I still enjoyed it. The soundtrack, however, is much better this time.The tracks loop much better and not once was I taken out of my immersion by a stutter between end and beginning of a track this time. And on top of that, I enjoyed it, I actually enjoyed the music.\n\nAll in all, this was definitely an improvement on the first and I am not actually angry about the ending this time. While it was a cliffhanger, it wasn't as things turned to crap. It was as a major plot point was resloved and the next goal of the main character was stated. The artwork is still decent and the music is actually good.", "timestamp_created": 1486152175, "timestamp_updated": 1486153894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29403006": {"recommendationid": "29403006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042228090", "num_games_owned": 831, "num_reviews": 191, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449273163}, "language": "english", "review": "While I do recommend episode 1, WEE: episode 2 introduces new characters and situations without making any progress on the previous game's storyline or characters.

Like in the first episode, you take on the role of Hal/Haru although the events take place 4 years after the end of episode 1. As this is a kinetic novel, again, I'll do my best not to give away spoilers. So basically, Haru is in a place where he has moved away from investing, stocks, the business world, etc. He is now in university, majoring in legal studies. Although most of the characters from episode 1 make a return here, one very important character, Hagana, has disappeared and Haru feels responsible because of how he behaved towards her. Of course, there are new characters as well but I'll get to them soon. So this is Haru's life until a chance encounter with a young woman, Eleanor, motivates him to return to his previous life. However, he clearly isn't the same person as he was 4 years ago so he makes his decisions more cautiously now. As you delve deeper into the story, you find out the reason that Eleanor really wants Haru's help with her company as well as Haru's emotional issues that developed at the end of episode 1. There is more character development as well, such as the changing relationship between Haru and Chris (Hagana's math student from episode 1). The end of episode 2 leaves off on a cliffhanger, more so than in episode 1, although I'm clearly not going to reveal what that is. ;)\n\nCompared to episode 1, I liked episode 2 more. I felt that the events moved at a faster pace although it is understandable. (Usually, in trilogies, the first one sets up the story so events move slower while they pick up in the second and third ones.) Also, I liked the new characters, especially Eleanor. At first glance, Eleanor appears to be a young noblewoman who has fallen from grace but it turns out that there is so much more to her once Haru spends time with her. The story was great and I loved that cliffhanger. (It's a good thing I recently bought episode 3 so I can find out how this trilogy will end. XD) The one critique I have with the writing is the lack of proofreading again. There were clearly typos, grammar errors, etc., that really should have been ironed out before the game's release. (I do wonder if the devs use a professional proofreader to check the English writing of their games. If not, they really should.) The art was beautiful although the style was different from the first episode so that takes getting used to. Music tracks were great and placed appropriately and again, I liked that both the music and CG gallery were unlocked after you finish the game. I tend to like looking at all of the CGs I unlocked. XD \n\nOverall, I enjoyed this sequel of WORLD END ECONOMiCA and I can't wait to play episode 3. The end of episode 2 reveals that a major character will return and I can't wait to see the events unfold. I should note that although episode 2 is a sequel, it isn't necessary to have played episode 1 although it does help. ^^", "timestamp_created": 1484979976, "timestamp_updated": 1484979976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480226", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29215320": {"recommendationid": "29215320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067922406", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484274341}, "language": "english", "review": "Part two of the trilogy, completed in 12 hours, this series takes off and improves upon its prequel in every aspect.\n\nCompleted 1/12/2017", "timestamp_created": 1484273256, "timestamp_updated": 1492923171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29106916": {"recommendationid": "29106916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103549961", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484016598}, "language": "english", "review": "I must impress by how improvement happened in Episode 2 by not only Visual but also Soundtrack that is really good and always become memorial Soundtrack to me, I guess the only mistake they make in here is the engine itself now make me cannot take a screenshot of the game and inconsistency on name, well actually it's kinda not a big problem but a bit ruining the experience itself\nbut this VN still deserve some thumbs up because the story as usual always good", "timestamp_created": 1483850263, "timestamp_updated": 1483850263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29091169": {"recommendationid": "29091169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015084130", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483527358}, "language": "english", "review": "A great sequel for the financial space opera, indeed! For those who were impressed by the first entry of the World End Economica series, this installment is a must-not-miss. For those who did not approach the title or were turned down by the flaws of WEE1, please reconsider this work for it had shown much improvement.\n\nFour years after the prequel, our main hero Haru is found in the financial market again. Gradually walking out from his previous disaster, Haru emerges as a mature protagonist and begins to harness his financial instinct to make important decisions on the market. However, he is not alone. Despite his former confidante Hagana not returning to his side, Haru is teamed up with an equally charming and intriguing financial genius \u2013 Eleanor. Throughout the dozen-hour long story, you will follow their adventures on the Moon and reach its horizon and abyss. It will be exciting and convincing.\n\nThere is no doubt that WEE2 is a major improvement over its predecessor. From the amount of illustrations and its pace, this work deserves its fans\u2019 praises. If you are new to the series, I still recommend you to play WEE2. It functions as an independent entry, more so than WEE1 or WEE3, so you should not have major troubles in understanding the plot. Kudos to Spicy Tails!\n\nGo buy it, even at full price. Eleanor is a fantastic and attractive character and Haru is less of an arse than three years ago.

I actually ended up sympathizing with him almost to the point of tears once or twice, given his developed fixations.  He was easily the worst thing about the first episode for me, and here I could finally count him as an enjoyable POV character.  His medical condition is kind of taken a bit far in my eyes, but I have no real experience in that kind of thing, so maybe truth is stranger than fiction.\n\nAs for the other characters, they continued to be welcome parts of the cast.  Sadly, Lisa doesn't show up quite as much, but being that Haru is actually able to take care of himself and doesn't quite need her instruction on how not to be a terrible human being, that's understandable.  The new character introduced, Eleanor, is also charming and interesting, more so as the story goes on.  I'm trying not to spoil anything big from the plot, but she is definitely much more than the refined princess-type she appears to be at first.  Chris takes up a more active role as well, and her development in the intervening four years have wrought an interesting change in her personality that still feels plausible.\n\nAbout the only other nitpick I have is that I wish they kept the original transliteration of Lisa and Serrault's names, but even that wasn't a big deal.  There's definitely more to say about the plot and characters, but I think I'll sum it up with this:  I bought this game at full price, and I don't regret a single cent of that.", "timestamp_created": 1467529318, "timestamp_updated": 1467529318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23785334": {"recommendationid": "23785334", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992517289", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466808846}, "language": "english", "review": "WEE episode 02 is a great follow up to the strong start of this series.\nI really enjoyed how the story proceeds and I just love the different characters and their development from Ep 1 to 2.\nThe mechanics of the game improved alot and every negative I had pointed out in my previous review got resolved and it plays smoothly without interruptions.\n\nFor everyone who thinks about playing this story I should recommend to wait for the 3rd EP to come out.\nYou can play the first part but then you should wait. \nThis is because it feels like the first episode is a closed story, while the 2nd EP is the first half of a bigger story.", "timestamp_created": 1466847391, "timestamp_updated": 1466847391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.950617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23685266": {"recommendationid": "23685266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055981406", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466359706}, "language": "english", "review": "For starter, don't play this if you haven't played part 1.  Also, there is a part 3, which is not out on Steam as of this writing, so don't be expecting to conclude the whole series with this game.\n\nIf you have played part 1, there is one change that will probably annoy you, which is that the way the names of characters is spelled is different.  This really seemed odd and jarring when I played this game for the first time.  I'm not sure whether I like episode 1 or 2's spellings the best but I definitely do not like that they were changed.  There are some other technical aspects that this episode improved over episode 1, though.  The music loops naturally in this game (unlike the first game), and most of the illustrations are better, especially the regular (non-CG) character portraits.  \n\nThis game lacks the same level of high-tension stock trading that the first game boasted, and is even more character-driven than the first part.  I suspect this episode mostly builds up to an exciting conclusion in volume 3, and for that reason, it does feel incomplete.  It still delves into economics by examining the unusual growth of a corporation and the role that analysts and investment banks play in the trading world.  This game, while lacking as much trading action as the first, still had some adrenaline-inducing high points and good character development.\n\nI think even without episode 3, these first 2 episodes are a worthy read, but if episode 3 is excellent as well, this will become a must-own series.", "timestamp_created": 1466514287, "timestamp_updated": 1466514287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23570321": {"recommendationid": "23570321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164911038", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495659333}, "language": "english", "review": "Where's the episode 3 eng ver ??", "timestamp_created": 1466000636, "timestamp_updated": 1466000636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23531273": {"recommendationid": "23531273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021108979", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465788257}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr: 6/10. Better than Episode 1 and kind of obligatory if you've already started reading that, but still could use some work.\n\n[h1]Full Review:[/h1]\n\nIt's been nearly two years since I played and reviewed the first installment of World End Economica, but I'm back and ready to arrogantly present my opinions as fact once again, so here we go. Since this [i]is[/i] the second episode of the game, I will of course be comparing it to the first part, and I'll also be referring to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/blankaex/recommended/269250/]my previous review[/url] of it as well, so you might find yourself a little lost without that information.\n\nFirst off, my hat goes off to Sekai Project. \u30cf\u30eb's name has now rightly been written \"Haru\" instead of \"Hal\", and I'd like to think that the little comment I left in my first review has influenced this somehow. I could feel the Euphoria\u2122 welling up as I saw the four letters ticker across my screen.\n\nIn any case, on to the game. The story continues off from the ending of the previous game, although it did take a bit of time for me to orientate myself. There was a completely new face on the cover, and I was stumbling around wondering who the hell that was if I was still Haru. Eventually, I started remembering what had happened in the previous game and I was able to begin making heads and tails of the situation. \n\nOverall, it was pretty interesting. I wouldn't go so far as to call it \"good\", but unlike the first episode which left me visibly bored at points, I did enjoy reading World End Economica, episode 2 for the most part. It suffers from a lot of the same problems that the first part did (and rightly so, considering it's the same setting), but at the very least, I wasn't forcing myself to sit through it this time, so props to Spicy Tails for stepping up their game this time.\n\nHowever, I still found myself disappointed at times because I was still able to unearth a number of errors while reading the game. There were quite a few typos and accidental line breaks, and there were also some issues with the floating text animation. The text breaks at parts for you to continue, which makes sense in Japanese, but not with English grammar. This only tells me that corners were cut, which is quite a shame, because even a single mistake in a published work hurts the publisher's credibility quite a lot. Imagine reading Lord of the Flies and spotting a spelling mistake every now and then. Not good. I didn't bother collecting evidence this time because the Steam screenshot function still wasn't working (which also bothered me), and I was too lazy to gather screenshots externally. My hope is that Sekai Project will revise this game as well, like they did with the previous one. At the very least, it would show that they actually do care about the quality of the products they release.\n\nTo complain a little more, the menus and text box were still the same, and I was never much of a fan of it. The text window in particular has a lot of bells and whistles and is overall quite intrusive, and it doesn't really look that nice anyway. A simpler one would have been much more welcome, but I guess it's too late in the game for that now. The default font was also quite atrocious as well. Thankfully there is an option to choose the font, though that shouldn't even need to be there. The developers should choose or create fonts that look good and are appropriate for their game, not the user. \n\nThis is all just nitpicking, though. Overall, it was a rather average game, and a small step up from its predecessor. Since it's a three-part story, we're left at a cliffhanger once again, but it's done a little better this time [spoiler]since you don't just die[/spoiler]. I hesitate to recommend this game, especially at full price (although $13 isn't too much compared to other VN titles on Steam). If you've read the first part, though, you might as well continue reading. You have my word that it does get better.

Overall, a good deal better than part one, although not much of an overall difference.\n\nCharacters: Without going into specifics, the characters of part one are the same as ever. although some display tremendous amounts of growth. The new characters are a pleseant addition, and much more likeable than most of the characters from part one.\n\nStory: Different tone from part one. Very concentrated on the main characters personal struggles but also containing a plot that covers a much wider scope than part one. The story focuses less on the nuances of the stock market, for those who were annoyed by that.\n\nSound: Better, although still not too memorable for me.

[/h1]\n\nFollowing what has happened at WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.01, WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.02 starts a few years after what has occured at the previous episode, and it starts at a very sad tone that slowly engages in a mature nature unlike the previous episode, which greatly emphasizes to what happened at the Main Character in the first episode.\n\nAgain, WORLD END ECONOMiCA is a kinetic Visual Novel made by Isuna Hasekura, which is known for being the author of the renowned Light Novel, Spice & Wolf.\n\nLike the author's previous work, this kinetic Visual Novel has the economical drive within it's repository, joining in the mix of tragedy and love. Isuna Hasekura's previous work, Spice & Wolf, revolves around trading. This time, WORLD END ECONOMiCA, revolves around Stocks and it's Market. I am amazed at how the author succinctly mixes different genres in this Visual Novel, much like Spice & Wolf.\n\nHowever, one should not compare Isuna Hasekura's Spice & Wolf and WORLD END ECONOMiCA, as the former is a Light Novel and the latter being a Visual Novel. Of course the manner of telling the story is significally different, as a Visual Novel introduces music and accompanying CG to maximize the tone of the current atmosphere and situation but with less words to further balance the narration of story by giving the personality to the CGs and sprites, while the words supply the story itself, unlike a Light Novel where the artworks are introduced at the start of reading, but it just introduces the setting and vibe of the story being told, with the descriptive narrative giving most of a Light Novel's shine. Nonetheless, one should not underestimate Isuna Hasekura, and one should know that the author would definitely give a story that is rich and fantastic.\n\nThis time, WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.02 gives more complex narrative and perfectly syncs the Stock Market into the different aspects of the story. This episode this time makes money seem very powerful, both for good and bad, which is awesome because it deviates from the generic sense that 'money is the root of all evil'.\n\n\n\n[b] PROS: [/b]\n- The setting has been made more broad, which introduces many areas unknown to the first episode\n- The characters are mature than ever, which is an upgrade to their past personalities\n- New characters blend into the environment and atmosphere of the story\n- Character personalities are again, well-developed, and makes them stand out at each other. [i] Especially the Main Character this time. What an improvement [/i]\n- The Main Character's personality undergoes a drastic change. He is not the selfish and immature character that he was, however at a price (With what happened to him at the first episode, I wouldn't wonder).\n- Same soundtrack with that is refurbished and fixed this time, preventing the incorrectly looping that has occured in episode.01\n- The CGs are a vast improvement than the first episode\n- Length of the second Visual Novel is shorter than the first, but it's more complex and finely written\n- [i] Also made by Isuna Hasekura! [/i]\n\n[b] CONS: [/b]\n- This is a sequel. [u] NOT READING THE FIRST VISUAL NOVEL WILL MAKE YOU VERY CONFUSED AND LOST [/u]. I suggest reading the first, or wait the third and the last one to be released, THEN reading all of them at the same time.\n- The explanation about Stocks this are [i] longer [/i] and [i] more confusing [/i]. Again, I'd recommend everyone to have a very basic knowledge about Stocks, [i] and reading the first episode, obviously [/i]\n- The soundtracks are recycled (however looped correctly). This might not be a bad thing, but I'd wish a different soundtrack for the new areas.\n- Like the first episode, this Visual Novel does not yet support Steam Overlay, and its current engine does not yet support Achievements and Trading Cards (However, this will be also remedied later on)\n- [u] Sadly, there is AGAIN no Holo the Wisewolf[/u]\n- [spoiler] ANOTHER FUCKING CLIFFHANGER!!! THIS TIME, IT'S MORE SEVERE![/spoiler]\n\n\n\nOverall, I would really recommend WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.02 along with episode.01. Please be reminded that there will be an update that makes it compatible with Steam Overlay, Steam Achievements and Trading Cards, though (Again, I'd advise you to wait for Sekai Project to release all the episodes, because then they would patch them to a different engine.) And this time, episode.02's story is a bit short, but that's based on how fast I read.\n\nHappy Stocking!", "timestamp_created": 1460444527, "timestamp_updated": 1460444553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619114", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22291841": {"recommendationid": "22291841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082739797", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498354248}, "language": "english", "review": "Good characters in a good story, not quite as  confounding as the first episode when getting into financal terms but it shouldn't stop your enjoyment.

La capacit\u00e0 con cui la Hasekura tratteggia i personaggi, la loro evoluzione rispetto alle vicende del primo episodio, l'innesto dei nuovi protagonisti e la gestione dei colpi di scena sono magistrali... si rimane incollati a leggere, si riflette, si individuano alcuni fili della trama per poi venire travolti velocemente dalle rivelazioni, le loro conseguenze nel mondo talmente verosimili da stupire con le adeguate \"contromosse\" scatenate dalle esigenze di trama.\n\nNonostante i temi trattati anche per questo capitolo non \u00e8 necessario avere basi solide di economia-borsa-finanza, anche perch\u00e9 viene spesso spiegato il tutto ai profani: l'engine che muove testo ed immagini \u00e8 lo stesso del primo, niente fuochi d'artificio ma la classica presentazione di testo e musica alternati a semplici effetti di fade in e out per il cambio di schermata. \nMi sembra di aver notato un certo incremento nell'uso delle immagini a tutto schermo, e un numero superiore di BGM anche se un certo riciclo delle stesse \u00e8 inevitabile data la lunghezza di questo episodio: ottima la traduzione di Sekai Project, anche se qualche svista c'\u00e8...(per quanto non abbia letto l'originale giapponese, in un paio di passaggi \u00e8 evidente l'errore di traduzione del soggetto della frase, complice la mancanza nell'originale del pronome personale ma rispetto al primo capitolo ho sofferto meno quell'ansia da voler \"far comprendere tutto ad ogni costo\").

If you've gone through the first episode, you would somehow understand what I mean when I say that you're not captured by the emotions and that the series' selling point isn't any sort of feels; there are some, yes, but there's more to it than that - it's this grasping impact that you cant fully comprehend but can appreciate.\n\nIt is, by no means, an easy read if you intend to learn things about the stock market using this material (it covers newer concepts from the first episode), but at the same time this isn't one of those series that just uses a setting as a simple given; all the talk about flow of money and stocks, even if the finer aspects allude you, build the atmosphere and successfully convince you of the importance of the situation via its brevity and complexity.\n\nAs with the last one, I find myself rather unreasonably attached to the character and series, taking home a handful of wisdoms I already knew or heard from others but didnt sink in the same way as they did when it was told here.

It is written by the same author who wrote Spice and Wolf. Unlike the first episode, the story does not mention too much about economics, thus a basic understanding of economic concepts is not required to fully enjoy the novel.\n\nStory: The story for this episode is okay. It talks about the events that happen four years after Haru, the main character, had suffered from the events from the previous episode. Not too much happens, mainly character development. The plot is mostly about how Haru struggles to conquer his past, and how he tries his hardest to help others so that he does not make the same mistakes as he had done in the past. I really missed the heavy amount of economics which is in the first episode, although this episode did talk about market bubbles and accounting scandals. I would rate the story 7/10.\n\nCharacters: Other than Haru, a few of the characters from the previous episode, Cerrow, Risa and Chris, returned to in this episode. I really like how the characters changed and matured after four years. Haru is a lot more mature and considerate, Chris is less shy, Cerrow has a job as an actual programmer now. A new main character, Eleanor, was introduced. Eleanor's character design was okay. I feel the princess/rich girl side of her was too cliche though. A few minor characters, Le Geoff, Marco and Rena, where introduced, but they did not really add to the plot. Rena helped Haru with his inner turmoil and helped him with some task after, but the other characters did not really do anything. Overall, I would rate the characters 8/10\n\nMusic: The music is okay. About the same quality as the previous episode. Some tracks were reused from the previous episode. I would rate it 7.5/10.\n\nArtwork: The artwork is pretty nice. I still feel there are a bit too many reused scenes, and too many times when the background was blank/just all black. It is an improvement from the previous episode though. I would rate it 7/10.\n\nOverall: I would rate it 7/10. Maybe it is because this is the second episode out of three episodes, but I feel nothing too significant happened, other than the introduction of the new character, Eleanor. The plot is still well done, tying up some loose ends from the previous episode. There are a lot more typos, and grammatical errors in this episode. I really hate how some of the names changed from the previous episode.

The story picks up four years after the end of the first episode, and we're once again placed in appropriately renamed protagonist Haru's shoes. Where the first episode was in many ways a confrontation of Neoliberal logic and an educational piece about modern finance, the second episode is far more of a personal story, it's not quite about the vagaries of market logic and people's place within it as the first one was; instead, it is in many ways about living with guilt & regret, dealing with loss and what it means to struggle from a position of powerlessness.\n\nCompared to the first episode, the visuals in ep. 2 are better in every way - the character art in particular is much improved, especially in terms of proportions, and the backgrounds & CG scenes are well done and do a much better job of giving a more distinct feel to the sci-fi setting. In terms of sound and music, everything is still quite adequate (only adequate, mind you), but there could still be more variety & restraint in terms of music. Silence would have served the VN quite well in some moments. As for the story, it is, as expected, quite good: interesting and informative as always, and the emotional tone is something of a long slow burn, compared to the bipolar highs and lows and emotional gut punches of the first episode.\n\nAs before, I'd continue to recommend this series to its intended audience of political economy/anime nerds, as well as anyone else who might be interested.

Too many characters names have changed in spelling (Hal->Haru, Lisa->Risa, Serault->Cerrow) that it has become distracting. please update at least one of the episodes to be consistent with the other.\n\nSecondly Please do a spell-check of the text/dialogue I've noticed a few minor spelling mistakes along the way. \n\nOtherwise these two episodes so far are the first visual novels I've played.

In the time between the main character has changed from the punk with attitude to a respectable young man who has learned his limits, and along with those changes he also learned how little he truly knew about the world back then. There is a clear schism between how this one plays out from the first. While the first episode felt fairly childish and cliched, falling back on common tropes a number of times, this one is focused on telling the more mature story the first one set up. The childish dreams were shattered, and in the place of those dreams the protagonist was forced by the world to mature. Not the arrogant \"I'm more mature than you\" mature that he was in the first, but legitimate personal growth. Because he was forced into that growth he was still not able to cope with his actions though, and the reader will get to see how that still affects him 4 years after the fact.\n\nIn this episode you can expect a few less walls of text attempting to inform the reader about stocks, and in the place of infodumps the reader is treated to a lot more character development and relationship building than the first. This isn't to say the infodumps that (fairly poorly) attempt to teach the reader about different aspects of the stock market don't exist, but rather that aspect of the storytelling has definitely been dialed down for the better. \n\nIn place of the explanations readers are instead treated with a continuation of the plot that started developing wonderfully toward the end of Episode 1 regarding all of the corruption going on. There are many victories and defeats for the protagonists along their journey along with a pace that accelerates towards the end leaving you begging for more as the credits roll. Unfortunately (fortunately?) the ending of this one leaves on a great cliffhanger (thankfully not wheelchairs and missing tsundere) that will have you waiting impatiently for the final episode to release.\n\nImprovements all around make this a must try for any fan of visual novels, but this is still WEE so if the first wasn't your fancy this probably won't catch your fancy either.\n\nOverall:\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1440491662, "timestamp_updated": 1476834650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578718", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17615571": {"recommendationid": "17615571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042971867", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441037233}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u304c\u6765\u308b\u3089\u3057\u3044\n\n\u8cb7\u3044", "timestamp_created": 1439996139, "timestamp_updated": 1439996139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.391049", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17610076": {"recommendationid": "17610076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084731279", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447870305}, "language": "english", "review": "The sequel to one of the best visual novels, I've ever read.\n", "timestamp_created": 1439963820, "timestamp_updated": 1439963820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17576081": {"recommendationid": "17576081", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995228262", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439774364}, "language": "english", "review": "Much better then the first episode by fixing the music and background issues from the first.

A well-balanced sequel about love, intrigue, introspection, and of course - economics! \n\nNew characters help the story progress forward in a new, broader direction, however Eleanor and her particular group all look quite striking compared to the overall art style of the novel. So much so that the novel itself pokes fun at said characters, but it's something you quickly get used to, due to how well-written they are, which helps them fit in immensely. Unfortunately, some new faces get a *lot* more face time than others, which is a shame considering how human all the other ones feel.\n\nThere are more places to visit on the lunar surface, but the lack of CG's in the first novel is compounded this time by the fact that, not only are there not enough of them still, but the ones that are there fail to stand up to the grandiose writing that describes these places. It's a bit jarring hearing a description of how truly massive the hotel in Clapton Square is, and actually seeing the single-CG they present to you. The novel still truly does suffer from what seems to be either a creative or budget issue in the art department.\n\nThe music score is expanded with some new tracks, most of them somber piano pieces which go with the game's now more grown-up, adult-ish theme. While they're good at setting up the mood, they sometimes unnecessarily bring it down for long periods of time. Some catchy tunes from the previous novel still make a comeback however.\n\nThe writing, like in the first novel, is what truly makes this one shine as well, so much so that it obfuscates everything else. This is not a bad thing: you're constantly left pondering about the emotional state of the characters (though this may be a bit overbearing by the end of the novel), and the intrigue that they're involved in at large. The one bad part of this is that you're no longer in the small-scale enviorment of the first novel, following the exploits of Hal as he tangles with the stock market. Part of the fun of the first novel was the scenes where Hal frantically performed trades and explained at the same time how he was doing them. The player could relate somewhat and experience the thrills Hal had at the time. This takes a backstep in the second novel - it's still present, but much less so, which is ultimately a bit dissapointing.\n\nIsuna Hasekura pulls another powerful story about economics, and throws in another engaging ending in as a bonus.

Hal ist nun \u00e4lter und erwachsener und nicht mehr aktiv im Aktienmarkt. Nach den Ereignissen und Fehlschl\u00e4gen im ersten Teil, ist er mehr oder weniger ein gebrochener Mann. Vor allem dass er Hagena im Stich gelassen hat macht ihn fertig. Auch Chris ist \u00e4lter geworden und hat an dem Programm von Hagena weiter gearbeitet und kann so genug Geld erwirtschaften, um die Kirche in neuen R\u00e4umlichkeiten am Leben zu erhalten. Chris und Hal plus eine neue Charakterin \u00fcbernehmen in diesem Sequel die Hauptrollen. Da Hal mittlerweile eine Art Legende geworden ist, wird er wieder in den Aktienmarkt hineingezogen. Ob es dieses mal besser l\u00e4uft als im ersten Teil, will ich nicht verraten.\n\nAuf jeden Fall ist die Geschichte wieder gut und spannend gestaltet. F\u00fcr diejenigen, denen der erste Teil bereits gefallen hat, wird auch World End Economica Episode 2 eine gro\u00dfe Freude sein, auch wenn Hagena leider nicht darin vorkommt.\n\n[h1]Illustrationen:[/h1]\n\nDie Illustrationen unterscheiden sich nicht wirklich zum ersten Teil. Hier wurde die gleiche solide Arbeit geliefert wie zuvor auch. Dadurch, dass man dieses mal auch kurz auf einer kleinen Raumstation spielt und man etwas mehr vom Mond sieht, ist auch ein st\u00e4rkerer futuristischer Touch vorhanden, welchen ich beim ersten Teil bei den CGs vermisst habe. Die neuen Charaktere haben auch alle h\u00fcbsche Designs bekommen und auch die Entwicklung der Charaktere, von recht Jung zu nun ein bisschen \u00e4lter ist gut gelungen.\n\n[h1]Charaktere:[/h1]\n\nHal und Chris kennt man bereits aus World End Economica Episode 1. Beide haben nat\u00fcrlich aus dem Prequel etwas mitgenommen, entwickeln sich aber auch jetzt wieder glaubhaft weiter. Was ich von der neuen Charakterin, Eleanor, halten sollte, war mir vorher nicht so ganz klar. Ich habe sie erst einmal nur als billigen Hagena-Ersatz gesehen, letztendlich entwickelte sich die Geschichte um sie doch recht interessant und bringt auch ein bisschen mehr Licht in die komplette Handlung. Zwar ist sie eine wirklich gute Charakterin, ein paar ihrer Entscheidungen konnte ich aber nicht wirklich nachvollziehen. Letztendlich konnte ich mich auch bis zum Ende nicht komplett mit ihr anfreunden.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\n\nBeim Soundtrack hat sich eigentlich auch nicht viel ge\u00e4ndert. Es passt immer noch hervorragend zu den Szenen und dieses mal hatte ich auch nicht das Gef\u00fchl, das es zu viele stille Passagen gegeben hat. Insgesamt wirkte es von der Musik her ein bisschen besser abgemischt als das Prequel. Die Musik hat mir im allgemeinen wieder zugesagt.\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1]\n\nDa ich nach dem ersten Teil eh schon ein Fanboy war, f\u00e4llt es mir nat\u00fcrlich schwer, Fehler in World End Economica zu finden. Episode 2 war definitiv ein w\u00fcrdiger Nachfolger. Ich hoffe nur, dass sich Sekai Project nun nicht wieder ein Jahr Zeit l\u00e4sst, um den dritten Teil zu ver\u00f6ffentlichen. Mittlerweile ist da schon m\u00e4chtig Verz\u00f6gerung in dem Ver\u00f6ffentlichungsplan drin\u2026\n\nZwar endet auch Episode 2 wieder mit einem Cliffhanger, diesen finde ich aber nicht so schlimm wie den von Episode 1. Ich kann World End Economica Episode 2 wirklich nur jedem empfehlen, der bereits Episode 1 gelesen hat. Nat\u00fcrlich kann ich weiterhin auch allen Episode 1 empfehlen, die es noch nicht gelesen haben.\n\n[h1]9/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1437826997, "timestamp_updated": 1437826997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17218196": {"recommendationid": "17218196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041874795", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437818308}, "language": "english", "review": "Great writing what i would expect from the 2nd episode as the 1st was great all well.\nAll in All?\nWhen can i stop throwing my money for the 3rd episode.\nAlso i won't lie i cried a bit there at the end.", "timestamp_created": 1437818438, "timestamp_updated": 1437818553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17217305": {"recommendationid": "17217305", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970398622", "num_games_owned": 462, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437809865}, "language": "english", "review": "Picking up 4 years after the first episode, World End Economica episode 2 takes place during the largest economic boom in history. Multiple cities are under construction, and optimism is on an all time high. But behind the scenes the system is dysfunctional. The protagonist is working at a government office, uninterested in what the market is up to. But circumstances pull him back in the game, and he inevitably ends up investigating what\u2019s really going on behind the scenes.\n\nA curious detail about the story is that it isn\u2019t as futuristic as you might expect. It takes place on the moon, but the economic system appears to be on the same technological level as Earth today. This makes it easier to follow, as everything you learn in economics class it directly applicable to the plot. But as sci-fi it becomes a bit unbelievable that they wouldn\u2019t have advanced to something well beyond this. Clearly a stylistic choice, which will make the story retro-futuristic in 5 years when our world leaves the game behind.\n\nI have a couple issues with game, one of the character relations is a bit too awkward. It felt like the author didn\u2019t quite know what to do in some of the scenes, as the emotions come off flat, like an alien trying to describe human feelings. Thankfully toward the end those problems disappear, and the most important scenes are nailed. But before you get there, you\u2019ll see someone\u2019s eyes described as \u201cbeautiful\u201d over five times. It gets a bit weird. On a positive note, everyone\u2019s motives and wants are clearly defined. So even with the weaker parts, on the whole it does a good job at storytelling.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people who feel Batman is outdated as a concept. Crimes today aren\u2019t committed by gangs of goons robbing people on the street. World End Economica shows what modern crime is like. It all happens out of sight, and if you don\u2019t look close enough it\u2019s possible to believe it doesn\u2019t exist. What I like most about it, is how it puts a human face on every party involved, both at the tops and bottoms of society, without losing sight of the main characters. The corporations committing fraud rationalize their actions by blaming the government, while they at the same time lobby to have the rules changed to allow even more corruption. There\u2019s no need to physically hurt anyone to destroy them. Reputation is everything. \n\nThe episode is quite long, just like the first one, and it's well paced. Much time is spent painting a holistic image of the world it takes place in. On the way some characters get lost, as they seem to have no role in the story at all. But on the whole I had a great time, only noticing the obvious flaws after it was over. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how far it goes in the final episode, because here in episode 2 it sets it up for something big.", "timestamp_created": 1437812998, "timestamp_updated": 1437889873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17216025": {"recommendationid": "17216025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018265822", "num_games_owned": 1718, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507604370}, "language": "english", "review": "More great storytelling and characters from Isuna Hasekura.

'Cause it's amazing. The game is full of references to the first game though, so if you haven't played or read that, you're probably going to be pretty lost for the first hour or so, upon which the information is reiterated so many times that you can probably piece together even if you didn't know that yes, there was a WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.1 even though this is episode.2. Really, if you've played one, then you might find the constant reminders irritating. I sure did after, what, the twentieth time?\n\nAnother minor complaint I have about this game is that the font has changed a lot from the first game. This is really personal preference, but I kinda found the bolded thick text less fitting to the game than the thin square text we had in the first version, plus the bolded text sometimes makes weird letters that's a bit irritating to read.\n\nApart from those two points, this was pretty much a perfect visual novel. The game takes a small bit of time to explain what happened after the first game, then jumps right into the plot. Dumps you into it, really. There's a bit of a slow period, which was kinda boring, but considering the circumstances it made sense. Somehow, the game makes you feel like the slow period ends up until the major plot stuff comes up and then you go \"woah, when'd we get here?\" Then it's just a straight shot all the way until the end of the game. Which, is at once both really, really good, and really, really nasty, since the ending is a huge cliffhanger. They didn't even wrap up the plotline they started in this episode!\n\nThe art is lovely, and since that's all you're going to be looking at for the entirety of the game, I think that's pretty important. The soundtrack was excellent as well, you listen to calming music for most of the game, right up to the last bit where everything just goes whoosh and the music also goes whoosh and it's beautiful and then [b]boom credits[/b]\n\nYea, my main issue with this game is that it's a awful fucking cocktease and I swear the whole game was a conspiracy to make me start counting down the seconds until ep.3 is released.\n\nThough, there's European anime girls.

But there was a humanizing element in episode one, and that humanizing element is made much more prominent in episode two. There are much less long infodumps about various qualities and characteristics of the stock market, and more scenes of interactions between characters who are all human and display strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe main character is now a traumatized 20-year-old, four years after the first episode, who is haunted by the memory of the grave mistake he made at the end of the first episode. He is definitely a lot less selfish and arrogant, but you can tell he still has yet to grow (which is why it is important to keep in mind that this is a trilogy).\n\nAll the characters from the first game that reappear here have changed, for me the most notable example being [spoiler]\"Cerrow\", whose name in the first game was Serrault. He lost his afro. That's a bummer.[/spoiler] There is one notable person who's missing who will not be named, who haunts our protagonist throughout the story. The new heroine introduced is a wonderful reversal of the classical princess trope, who shows her own humanity and weakness slowly throughout the novel. [spoiler]That bedroom scene was pretty interesting. If you read this spoiler without reading the novel, it's going to be misconstrued.[/spoiler]\n\nThere are still some weaknesses. Two new minor characters seemed pretty useless, [spoiler]Marco and Le Goff (Marco in particular; at least Le Goff was spotlighted as a prim and proper butler to Eleanor who was helpless to aid her in her quest for justice. Marco was just some pre-teen kid who had a crush on Eleanor. No characterization beyond that whatsoever.)[/spoiler] but I'm hoping they'll be expanded upon somewhat in the final episode. There were a few spelling and grammar mistakes sprinkled throughout the novel, but I suppose they were probably itching to get this out and, despite the alpha and beta testing, couldn't get it perfect. I'm sure they'll fix it soon enough.\n\nOtherwise, this is a great example of a visual novel that does not need to guise itself in the form of a \"pick the heroine you engage in intercourse with\" to attract an audience. While romance is referred to, this is a story about growth and struggle. Of fighting against a machine focused only on keeping itself in power through money, and by keeping that power continuing to earn money. Of selflessness and justice against selfishness and greed.\n\nSolidly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1437571700, "timestamp_updated": 1437608550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17167655": {"recommendationid": "17167655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063905884", "num_games_owned": 1403, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437655697}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\n\u60f3\u8981\u5230\u8fbe\u524d\u4eba\u672a\u81f3\u4e4b\u5730\u7684\u6708\u7403\u5c11\u5e74\uff0c\u5728\u8d4c\u4e0a\u8d2b\u6c11\u68a6\u60f3\u7684\u5bf9\u51b3\u4e2d\u8f93\u6389\u4e86\u4e00\u5207\uff0c4\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u5c11\u5e74\u9082\u9005\u4e86\u4e00\u4f4d\u6765\u81ea\u5730\u7403\u7684\u8d35\u65cf\u5c11\u5973\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86[strike]\u628a\u59b9[/strike]\u7231\u4e0e\u6b63\u4e49\uff0c\u4fe9\u4eba\u5f00\u59cb\u63a2\u5bfb\u6708\u7403\u5784\u65ad\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u79d8(zao)\u5bc6(jia)\u2026\u2026\n\n\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u524d\u4f5c\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u6ca1\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u6700\u591a3\u5c0f\u65f6\u770b\u5b8c\u3002\u5267\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u5f3a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e2d\u4e8c\u5c11\u5e74\u7684\u6210\u957f\u76f8\u5f53\u6709\u611f\u67d3\u529b\uff0c\u5f88\u9002\u5408\u6539\u7f16\u6210\u9752\u5e74\u6f2b\uff0c\u7f3a\u70b9\u662f\u5267\u60c5\u9ad8\u6f6e\u5168\u9760\u524d\u4f5c\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u94fa\u57ab\uff0c\u6ca1\u73a9\u8fc7\u524d\u4f5c\u7684\u4eba\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6709\u592a\u591a\u7684\u71c3\u70b9\u3002\n\n[spoiler]\u610f\u6599\u4e4b\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5361\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u591a\u4e86\u4e9b\u653f\u6cbb\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd8\u662f\u5165\u95e8\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\uff0c\u6309\u5267\u60c5\u8d70\u5411\u770b\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u90e8\u53c8\u662f\u5927\u56e2\u5706\u7684HE\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4ece\u72fc\u4e0e\u9999\u8f9b\u6599\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u4e00\u76f4\u641e\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c11\u5e74\u5c11\u5973\u7f81\u7eca\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u4e0d\u89c9\u5f97\u8001\u5957\u4e48\u2026\u2026[/spoiler]\n\n\u4ef7\u683c\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u524d\u4f5c\u6700\u4f4e\u5230\u8fc775%off\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6ca1\u4e70Kickstarter\u7248\u7684\u7406\u6027\u7c89\u8fd8\u662f\u7b49\u6253\u6298\u5427\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1437541312, "timestamp_updated": 1437541312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666274", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17166459": {"recommendationid": "17166459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023591911", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450127042}, "language": "english", "review": "I started reading this game sometime last year before the translation came out, after having read the English version of episode 1.

Up to this point it has basically been the Anti-Wolf of Wall Street, because this is basically about a gigantic golden boot stomping on young 99%-ers trying to break out of economic inequality on an extreme free-market Moon.  Much of the following aspects of the review will reference events in episode 1 so I'll use spoiler tags.\n\nIf you're familiar with Spice & Wolf and liked it, you will enjoy reading WORLD END ECONOMiCA and should start at episode.01.  \nIf you liked WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.01 and don't mind [spoiler] Hagana's absence [/spoiler] , you're in for a treat.  \n\nThey attempt filling the heroine gap [spoiler]left by Hagana[/spoiler] by introducing a new heorine, Eleanor, who experienced a similar plight as the protagonist in the distant past and is dead set on becoming a public enemy to fight the power.  Our boy protagonist, Haru, is still fresh out of his trauma and much of his character arc for episode.02 pertains to him getting back into the game in his encounters with Eleanor and Chris. This a gripping \"belly of the whale\" arc that really got me jonesing for episode.03.  Oh, and our lovable anti-trap Chris [spoiler] is carrying the team while slowly realizing certain feels for a certain protagonist.

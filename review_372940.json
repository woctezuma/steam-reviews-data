It has a very loose relation to the first game which just means the main character is the same. There is no issue if you don\u2019t have the first game in your library, you won\u2019t be missing anything. \n\nThe story is a little uninteresting to start off. However, I did get more into it the further I progressed. \n\nThe puzzles and HO scenes are good and just like the first game. The HO scenes are more of a collective puzzle scene as each object you find can be used to unlock further items. The puzzles are not too hard and I was able to solve each one without using hints or a guide. \n\nFast travel is still present and a great help.\n\nGraphics and art style are very good and maintain sharp details even at 1440p. Voice overs are hovering around average to below average. \n\nA few basic collectibles are here as well. One of which builds a machine that unlocks 20 bonus puzzles in the Extras menu. This sounds cool, but the 20 puzzles are the same but with different layouts. \n\nI played the game on the hardest difficulty which isn\u2019t too bad. The map still shows you what part of the world has actions available if you get stuck. It doesn\u2019t show you which screen, just which area has one, so you\u2019ll still have to search a bit.\n\nOnly 1 minor interface issue this time. The map button is still too close to the hint button. You could accidentally press it trying to look at the map.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n+60fps\n+Great & vibrant visuals\n+Nice music and sound effects\n+Variety of puzzles (some are similar to the first game)\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n+Map button too close to hint button\n+Ads for other games before you reach the starting screen\n\nThis is another good HOG that has what you expect.

It's not just a long list of random crap that you have to find for no reason; you have to find seemingly random items, but then you have to use those items within that same HO scene until you eventually get to the item that you need for the rest of the game. It seems like such an obvious way to handle this type of game, but for some reason no one else out there ever does it. It's so, SO much more satisfying to actually have the junk you're looking for mean something. As further icing on the cake, I think this game is very well polished all around. The animations in the backgrounds feel much more natural than in other HO games, and I'd say the character acting is above par.\n\nThe only real sin this game commits is, oddly enough, ads. Seriously guys, why do I have to bypass ads for other games before the TITLE screen even comes up? That's just downright tacky.

It's done fairly well, and it does have 2 bonus objects hidden in every big scene.

They share some common features (which is why I recommend it), but Four Horsemen has far more unintuitive gameplay. You'll probably end up using the in-game Strategy Guide way more than expected.\n\nI was really hoping Four Horsemen would live up to its predecessor, Dark Overlord. They're in the same universe with the same protagonist and by the same developers, so what could go wrong, right? Apparently enough to make it a disappointing followup.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe backgrounds and drawn versions of the characters are just as nice as the previous title. A few scenes have some strange or confusing angles to them, but I'll chalk that up to \"artistic freedom\". The character design is definitely better.\n3D cutscenes are also just as clunky where movement is concerned, but I'd still say it's an improvement overall.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe positives fell apart for me here. While Dark Overlord was more-or-less simple to figure out where you needed to go next, Four Horsemen dropped the ball. I often found myself wandering back and forth between locations trying to figure out my next course of action. If you're playing on Easy or Normal and not bothering with achievements, you may not have an issue, since the map and hints directly indicate what you should do next. But playing on Hard mode with the achievement requirement of no Hint use whatsoever (even outside of games/puzzles), it was frustrating enough that I resorted to the in-game Strategy Guide a lot. I try to avoid doing that whenever possible, but some actions were simply too obtuse or unintuitive, like needing to click on a thin, easily-overlooked chain hanging from the ceiling not once, but twice in order to continue. Unless you're pixel-hunting, that chain just looks like a generic fore/background element. And that's only one example. I could write up a whole list.\nI did like that they kept the multi-use tool aspect, and the knife and hammer remain at your disposal until the end of the game.\nThere's one point where an annoying app-style \"rate us\" window pops up, clearly identifying the game as a (lazy) mobile port. I don't know why nobody bothered to just take that screen out, or change the word \"touch\" in the achievements to \"click\".\nThe bonus chapter was okay (minus the \"wtf do I do now\" moments), but somehow felt lacking compared to the first game's bonus chapter.\n\n[h1]Puzzles/HOGs[/h1]\nThe puzzles were good and varied, with the difficulty bumped up a tad from the previous game.\nIf you're going for the \"Lord of Animals\" and \"Artist\" achievements, you're going to need the Steam guide (not the in-game one) and some quick visual thinking, respectively. However if you missed either achievement during gameplay, you can exit and try again via the Extras menu instead of starting a whole new game. I really appreciated that.\nThe HOGs on the other hand, were kind of disappointing. It seemed like most of them were the \"find then use\" silhouette type, but with actions or hiding places that were more of a chore than necessary.\nFour Horsemen also continues the \"beyond objects\" trend, but it seems like the devs got a bit overzealous about it. They doubled (or even tripled) the hunt with a set of parts you need to find for some kind of machine, which means there's 1 morphing object and 1 machine part at every location, plus 20 lorebook pages scattered about. The number of parts and pages you find are accessible via the toolbar and journal, but afaik there's no way to check how many of the morphing objects you found, other than catching the number that pops up when you actually find one. Your best bet is to not leave a location until you find both the object and part. The pages stick out against the backgrounds, so they weren't a problem.\n\n[h1]Story/Writing[/h1]\nPretty solid, though kinda forced at points. You don't have to play Dark Overlord to follow or enjoy this one, but it helps. Suzanne's defeat of the Dark Overlord made her a legendary figure in the Lost Lands (which apparently operates on something akin to \"Narnia Standard Time\" - a few months for us = centuries for them). [strike]Gandalf's brother[/strike] a wizard named Maaron knew of Suzanne and summoned her (what is she, a genie?) to help with their Four Horsemen crisis. Of course nobody thinks to call ahead to find out when's a good time, so Suzanne effectively gets kidnapped in the middle of a shopping trip. The tie-in to the existing Lost Lands universe and previous game did a lot to help the plot, seeing as there's no explanation of why everyone thinks Suzanne is some kind of messiah until you find the last lorebook page, which makes a direct reference to the ending of the first game.\n\nAnd not that it matters for gameplay, but some of the basic facts are a bit inconsistent, at least where Maaron is concerned. In the bonus chapter he talks about summoning Suzanne because he knew of her prior deeds, but in the beginning of the main game he seems utterly surprised that she's a \"fragile female\" (really?) and not some buff and mighty hero. \n\nYou're introduced to some of the lore of [strike]Middle Earth[/strike] the Lost Lands through the pages you find while you're exploring, which is a nice touch if you like reading, but they're really not much more than another collectible (achievement included).\n\nUnfortunately the grammar and spelling suffer in this game. I don't know who slacked off at Five-BN, but it led to a lot of oddly-constructed sentences. To be fair, most of them were in the written parts (only two or three in VOs). Nothing immersion-breaking, but enough to notice.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nVoiceovers were as high quality as Dark Overlord, with the exception of the mermaid, who was only a few notches less annoying than the protagonist of [i]Dreamatorium 2[/i]. Thankfully you don't have to talk to her much. Maaron and Folnur ([strike]Gimli's cousin[/strike] the dwarf) were excellent. There was only one inconsistency I noticed in the bonus chapter, when you speak to Tectonica. At some point the text says \"but you may cut it with a diamond thread\", while the actress says \"but you may smash it with a hammer\". Those would yield wildly different results. :P\nThe music was hit and miss. Most times it suited the context well, but there were several moments that felt out of place. SFX were fine.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIf I was to rate Four Horsemen as a standalone game, I'd probably give it something slightly higher than \"meh, it's decent\". But as a sequel in an existing universe with the same protagonist, it has a little more charm. Unlike Dark Overlord however, I don't see myself going out of my way to replay it in the future. \nPlay Dark Overlord first for a more cohesive experience.", "timestamp_created": 1469318116, "timestamp_updated": 1469320357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591812", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24435026": {"recommendationid": "24435026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166423679", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472181859}, "language": "english", "review": "moves along with smooth transitions", "timestamp_created": 1469066657, "timestamp_updated": 1469066657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24399044": {"recommendationid": "24399044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028098372", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468983545}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent game play, however, the advertisment before starting sucks.", "timestamp_created": 1468885539, "timestamp_updated": 1468885539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24338678": {"recommendationid": "24338678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288984707", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475025809}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muitas horas de muita divers\u00e3o e raciocinio.

Though Lost Lands: A Hidden Object Adventure is created by the same developers, Five-BN, and quite possibly occurs in the same world, these games are not related by storyline.  Though it would be interesting if somehow the developers managed to tie the storylines together.\n\nStoryline: A few centuries have past in the realm of the Lost Lands and a new threat has appeared in the form of the Four Horsemen: Chill, Flare, Death and Darkness.  These Horsemen are slowly and methodically destroying the Lost Lands world and Maraan, the wizard/druid sets a spell in motion to bring the warrioress and once before savior back to the Lost Lands.  The intrepid Suzanne is teleported to the Lost Lands where she embarks on the quest of defeating the Horsemen and finding the Compass of the Worlds (the key to a magical portal) before one of the Horsemen does.  For help on the quest, Maraan sends a dwarf named Folnur to Suzanne as a guide, to protect, and to provide useful information.\n\nGameplay:  A quasi-open world with area based bottlenecks, and more of a Point and Click then Hidden Object quest adventure.  The Hidden Object scenes are silhouette finds of the interactive type.  Each Hidden Object scene shows silhouettes which when found are then used to do other things like open boxes, scrap wax from a table, cut roots out of the way, etc.  until the main object of the scene is obtained.  Nothing overly difficult though some intuition (such as looking in baskets or crates) and careful searching is required.\n\nThe Point and Clicks aspects are more complex and require not only careful searching of an area to find all the needed inventory items but often travel.  There is a no penalty fast travel map which the further and further along in the story the player proceeds the more and more the fast travel map is needed.  Many items and several puzzles found early in the game or in previous chapters can not be accessed until a later time when the needed inventory is eventually found.  If playing on casual mode these items and locations are highlighted.  If playing on Hard mode, notes or a good memory is needed.  The game will give the player hints about where to find something, such as 'Where have I seen that before?' among other comments.  There is also an in-game strategy guide if one gets stuck or can not find an item needed.   \n\nThe puzzles are mostly sliders of some variation, straight picture sliders, put the correct piece in the correct place, and rotating sliders.  There is also matching, codes, and picture puzzles.  Nothing overly hard, but there are a few puzzles that do require some thought to solve.  NOTE: One particular puzzle in the beginning of the game has an achievement attached if the player can solve it in less then 70 moves.  The in-game stategy guide does the puzzle in 92 moves, so achievement hunters will have to earn that one on their own.  (This puzzle can also be accessed through the mini-games in the Extra menu after both the main game and bonus chapter are completed.  So no need to play the entire game again just to play the puzzle.  Love, love this feature.) \n\nThe bonus chapter concerns the dwarf Folnur who Maraan has asked to help Suzanne after her arrival in the Lost Lands, and Folnur's preparations to do that and to craft a magical dwarven hammer.  In the main game the player sees his arrival which is the conclusion of the bonus chapter.\n\nThere are two sets of extra finds: 1) is morphing objects (35 total) and 2) machine parts (35 total) found through out the main game.  If the player finds all 35 pieces of the machine this unlocks a bonus feature which is a set of extra puzzles.     \n\nA few words about achievements: All achievements can be earned in a single playthrough since most are gameplay oriented.  For one achievement the player can not use any hints DURING GAMEPLAY in either the main game or the bonus chapter or in any puzzle or Hidden Object scene which is standard.  One achievement is found in the bonus chapter and is a timed picture puzzle.  Also both the main game and the bonus chapter must be completed to earn a couple of achievements.  If the player missed the puzzle achievements during gameplay they can be earned through the mini-game section in the Extra menu.  That is so innovative and eliminates a forced second playthrough.     \n\nExtras:  First of all there is the in-game strategy guide which makes playing the game on Hard mode the first time through easier if the player gets stuck or misses some needed item.  This game has many extras which become available after completing the bonus chapter.  Extras include wallpapers, concept art, music and cut scenes.  It also includes a replay of the 21 puzzles found in the game and 3 picture puzzles.  If the player found all of the machine parts there are 20 extra pipe puzzles to solve under that bonus feature.  \n\nOverall, an enjoyable game to play, not too hard and not too easy.  Despite a bit of fast traveling near the end of the game, it plays smoothly and relatively logically.

But, there are aspects to it that are horribly frustrating:\n\n- The voice acting is horrible.  The first couple of characters you meet are fine.  But, after that, pretty much everyone's voice acting is cringe-inducing.  Worse, once you meet a dwarven guide, he (and others) insist on giving you an ear-bleeding travelogue of stuff you don't need to hear.  It made me want to not click on things because they'd talk at me.\n\n- The Hidden Object Games (HOGs) aren't really HOGs.  My definition of a HOG is a screen full of objects with a text list of objects to find.  Every HOG in this game is what I call a Chain o' Objects Game (COOG).  In these, you've got a \"list\" of outlines.  You have to find a starting point in the scene and follow the chain of objects until you get to the end point.  Personally, I pretty much hate those COOGs.  It doesn't help that the ones in this game are difficult to do.\n\n- Some of the Achievements are really frustrating.  In my case, I had issues finding some of the collectables.  They're so well camouflaged that after examing each scene minutely 5 times, I finally had to resort to the in-game Strategy Guide to find the last of them.  Similarly, I had another Achievement that I swear I should have gotten, but couldn't without multiple run-throughs.  And, finally, there's one (\"Artist\") where the timing is so tight I physically can't move the pieces fast enough and I've given up (my OCD is driving me nuts).  EDIT:  I finally managed to get this last Achievement after 50 or so tries.\n\n- A few of the key/lock pairs are so obscure that there's really nothing to indicate you should be doing something except that there's nothing left to try (the spinning top \"key\", for example).\n\n- And, finally, a lot of the key/lock pairs are so far apart (not just physically, but temporally) that by the time you find the \"key\" that fits the \"lock\" you've not only forgotten where the \"lock\" is, you've also forgotten its very existence.\n\nIt's really a shame about all of the above.  I liked the previous game (\"Lost Lands:  Dark Overlord\") a lot, and it had much the same design philosophy.

That being said, all the scenes and puzzles offer a good bit of challenge and works your brain so don't think that this is push over game.\n\nWith the puzzles also come an engaging story. You play a woman from the Earth realm summoned to a magical land to save it from doom. Sadly, our hero Susan doesn't say much but everyone else has solid voice acting. I was quite a fan of  the dwarf you gain as a sidekick.\n\nOverall it's a definate buy for fans of puzzle games and hidden item games, it will offer quite a few hours of enjoyment.", "timestamp_created": 1438662044, "timestamp_updated": 1438662044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17179276": {"recommendationid": "17179276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170915222", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437602239}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little puzzler to pass the time.

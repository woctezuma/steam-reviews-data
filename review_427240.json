sinnvollem wie ein schild?inform einer kleinen blase om den betroffenen bot?das nat\u00fcrlich die verteidigung erh\u00f6hen sollte.oder wenn man den bots waffen geben kann, um sie somit zu combinieren und st\u00e4rker zu machen.quasi wie slots f\u00fcr jeden bot, wo man was ausr\u00fcsten kann.\n\n-geb\u00e4ude:wie w\u00e4re es mit einem geb\u00e4ude, die diese kerne der gegnerischen geb\u00e4ude wiederverwerten k\u00f6nnte?eine art recycler.oder eine art schildgenerator?der einen standpunkt mit einem schild bedeckt wie eine kuppel?bei schaden w\u00fcrde die batterie dann nat\u00fcrlich rapide energie verlieren, und somit brauch man auch starke batterien.und was w\u00e4re mit einem automatischen turm?wir haben bereits einen manuel zu bedienenden turm.aber ein automatischer w\u00e4re toll, damit man einen standpunkt auch mal unbeobachtet lassen kann.ausger\u00fcstet mit minigun oder laser oder vielleicht raketen?hmmm.\n\n-Interaktionen:es w\u00e4re doch toll mit buddy bot mehr machen zu k\u00f6nnen, als nur zu steicheln und zu winken.wie w\u00e4re es mit einem minispiel?ein ball, den man kaufen kann, wie die brille und den hut?zum werfen, und buddybot holt ihn zur\u00fcck?oder andere kleine witzige interaktionen wie tanzen?ein kleiner roboter tanz , wenn man zur\u00fcck winkt vielleicht?vielleicht k\u00f6nnte man auch buddy bot wie bei einer playlist musik abspielen lassen?(buddybot als kleines radio.er ist ja eh immer bei einem.hehe)oder man kann ja die roboter auch ansaugen.wie w\u00e4re es, wenn man mit genug schwung diese in die richtung schicken kann zum n\u00e4chsten punkt, fals in der geworfenen richtung einer ist?so k\u00f6nnte man sich das map bewegen sparen und auch einzelne roboter senden mit einem gezielten wurf.hehe.und das raumschiff schaut auch noch etwas trist aus.w\u00e4re toll, wenn die bodenplatten eine/mehr funktionen haben w\u00fcrden. archivements, die man mit gewissen herausforderungen bekommen kann und sich in das schiff packen kann, wie diese 3 pflanzen zb.als deko und um zu sehen, was man schon erreicht hat.\n\n-Co-op/multiplayer:ouhh ich k\u00f6nnte es mir gut vorstellen, wie cool das w\u00e4re.eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere map mit 2-3 spielern gegen computer oder gegen andere spieler.sich gegenseitig helfen mit ressorcen (vielleicht eine art neuer transporter roboter zum \u00fcberbringen der resourcen?)gewaltige bot armeen vereint zum besiegen eines gegners.mehrere spieler im \u00fcberleben/wellenmodus stelle ich mir auch recht witzig vor.das besuchen der standpunkte oder sogar des schiffes des freundes vielleicht?neue interactionen w\u00e4ren dann auch cool.wenn sich 2 buddy roboter treffen, das die dann was machen.tanzen,reden,roboterspiele spielen zur unterhaltung der besitzer/spieler.hehe!\n\nAlles im allem ein wundervolles kleines spiel.so viel potential und m\u00f6glichkeiten dieses game zu etwas besonderem zu machen.\nVielen dank liebe Devs

In primo luogo, \u00e8 un gioco davvero originale e di ardua collocazione, viene definito come uno strategico o come un tower defense, ma in realt\u00e0 non assomiglia a nulla che abbia mai giocato con o senza realt\u00e0 virtuale. In secondo luogo ha la migliore interfaccia utente mai vista, un capolavoro di immediatezza e utilizzabilit\u00e0 che - si spera - altri giochi VR possano copiare o quantomeno utilizzare come fonte di ispirazione. Infine, gli sviluppatori di Cosmic Trip hanno sicuramente fumato roba buona perch\u00e9 il titolo ha uno stile folle ed originale, con uno spiccato gusto anni sessanta misto a robotica emozionale e riferimenti \"Pikminiani\".\n\nAndiamo con ordine. Cosmic Trip nasce ai primordi dell'epoca Vive come primo vero strategico ad usare in modo intensivo il roomscale, ovvero l'intero spazio fisico della stanza in cui ci si muove. La mappa prevede una serie di tappe interconnesse da portali, i quali vengono \"tirati su\" a mano come una serranda e oltrepassati come una porta. Non ha senso a parole, ma di persona una volta compreso il sistema funziona a meraviglia. In ogni tappa possono esserci risorse, che vanno estratte e lavorate, con una catena di tecnologie da costruire, ottenere e manutenere nienteaffatto modesta. Tutto qui ha una forte connotazione fisica, per esempio per costruire robot dovremo prima circondarci di una torre di costruzione, la quale va alimentata a batteria e programmata inserendo una cartuccia software, tutte cose che dovrete fare voi a mano.\n\nAd ostacolare il nostro lavoro ci saranno immancabili creature aliene, anche loro dedite all'espansione sul territorio, e poco amichevoli con noi o con le nostre costruzioni, specie se \"stuzzicati\" dal nostro desiderio di espansione. Tutto ci\u00f2 che manovrerete sar\u00e0 di colore bianco/arancio, rotondeggiante e \"puffoso\": \u00e8 difficile non affezionarsi ai robot, che riconoscendoci salutano o ci svolazzano attorno con area interrogativa se mal indirizzati. Tutto gira a puntino, con ottime musiche e belle illustrazioni (colonna sonora e artbook sono acquistabili come DLC) senza il consueto retrogusto a basso budget tipico delle economiche produzioni VR.\n\nL'unico vero difetto del gioco, se proprio ne si volesse trovare uno, \u00e8 che nonostante le varie modalit\u00e0 di gioco non \u00e8 nato ne' risulta organizzato in forma di campagna. Ovvero, manca una serie di livelli da superare in sequenza, le mappe disponibili potranno essere giocate pi\u00f9 volte impostanto differenti parametri alla ricerca del miglior risultato (idealmente, di conquistare l'intero scenario) ma questo \u00e8 quanto. Il gioco \u00e8 uscito dallo stadio early access, e si vede, ma gli sviluppatori continuano a seguire il progetto quindi non escludo che una tale modalit\u00e0 possa essere un domani aggiunta.\n\nA fronte di questo unico neo, e considerando il prezzo e la qualit\u00e0 offerta, Cosmic Trip \u00e8 un gioco che difficilmente farete mancare nella vostra collezione.", "timestamp_created": 1498669329, "timestamp_updated": 1498669745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32833914": {"recommendationid": "32833914", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978274457", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499580955}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing.

You can die, and when you die you lose.\n\nSo just like many RTS you're building bases, managing resources, and micromanaging your troops and throwing in your personal firepower when needed. The game has a very different feel than any other RTS, not just because you are on the field of battle but also because all base building and combat takes place around a sequence of nodes (in part due to the nature of VR).\n\nI really appreciate the sound and visuals in Cosmic Trip. Seeing the strange life forms floating around in these alien worlds is far more satisfying than I'd have imagined. The sound effects are also very informative and enjoyable, reminding me more of classic games where all the sounds needed to be clearly distinct.\n\nCosmic Trip is one of the most _different_ things I've played in VR.

After some teething issues with choosing the wrong mode(for me) at the start i had a ton of fun, there is nothing quite like ordering a swarm of bots at the enemy location and zipping ahead to see them swooping down a tunnel towards death or glory!\nThis is a very fun RTS with cool designed bots and a surprisingly deep strategy element\n \n[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT[/b] \nThe environments are really beautiful and with the teleport doors you soon find that there is multiple zones all connected, i did have an issue with my play space where part i was a tiny bit limited on one side, there is no movement beyond your feet and the teleport doors.\nThe main lobby is your ship and it has some cool little functionalities and a very nice designed menu.\n \n[b]GRAPHICS[/b] \nThey are awesome! The little bots are very well made and animate so nicely, there is a bot that plays the games music, a mascot if you will who waves at you when you wave to him and loves to have his belly rubbed\u2026.this has to be the only game i can say i gave a bot a belly tickle lol (don't tell my cat!)\nLikewise the stations you place are all well designed and i loved how the turret was done, it feels really awesome to quickly lock your controllers onto it and start blasting aliens and the strut for it realistically animates to your movement. \nWith the bot animations, seeing your medical bot fly about and heal your units looks good and you can tell each robot apart easily.\nYou can also put little hats and glasses on your bots, because...well it is cool ok, there does not need to be a reason lol\n \n[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] \nNo issues at all, even when i ordered a swarm of 10 to 15 battle bots to attack the enemy and watched as they swooped over, at no time did i lose frame or suffer reprojection.\n \n[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] \nThis is a mixed thing, on one hand it has a tutorial and once you get used to the controls its really smooth and intuitive but some things are missing from the guides, i assumed at first the teleport portals were a means to say \u201cthis area done\u201d rather than a means to get about, now i have played for a bit i wonder how i could of been so mistaken lol.\nI am going to say that yes it is intuitive, with minor niggles.\nThe map controls are really well done and it will not be long before you are sending your robot hoard here there and everywhere...though i did manage to get lost lol\n \n \n[b]PROS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] Really well made animations and graphics.\n[*] Under the VR and cutesy graphics there is a good rts engine.\n[*] You can put a top hat on a bot and throw it at an enemy, got to look dappa when you take on aliens!\n[*] The ui is super awesome, it is perfectly suited to vr.\n[*] Nothing can truly describe how awesome it is to see a swarm of your robots swooping past on their way to your enemies!\n[*] You know i said the graphics are really good? Yeah they won awards on them (2016 Proto Awards and best visual design at the 2016 VR Core awards)\n[*] The strategy mode provides you with more of a challenge for those that want it.\n[*] When testing out the ability to disable the ui (see last con additional note) i discovered that you can configure a whole host of the characteristics of the game, you can really tweak it to your hearts content, this is very rare in a non moddable game and simply has to go into the pro section!\n [/list]\n[b]CONS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] No ability to move around the area you are in apart from physical movement, making those with small room-spaces somewhat limited, i would like to see limited teleportation in the areas. * The Developers have replied to this and expressed you can teleport by simply putting your controller in an open teleport node and hitting the trigger, that helps a little but an ability to move around your location beyond physical would be majorly handy (limited of course to a bubble around it, for gameplay sake)\n[*] It could be made clearer chill is easy vs Strategy which is hard (at first glance you think chill is no enemys and strategy is normal, this is not the case) \n[*][i] Twitch logo is shown on the second screen (this is what is normally streamed) advertising twitch can be a no no on some other stream sites for partners.

They've also released a rather awesome user guide. Call me old fashioned, but I miss the days of game manuals. Just had a flick through and they've done a great job with this one.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun and incredibly frantic. You will work up a sweat and for this reason and others I do encourage the developers (as I know others have) to add a proper pause function and/or a save game function.\n\nIt's also not an easy game. It took me 5+ hours spanning several play throughs to get a win in Strategy mode. Maybe I'm just really bad at it, and I guess the challenge is part of what makes it addictive. Having said that it took me a couple of play throughs to really work out what was going on and what I was supposed to be doing. The tutorial is good for explaining the controls, but it feels quite disconnected from the main game and I don't feel like it gave me a good introduction to the genuine gameplay. I do wonder whether some different levels of difficulty could also be introduced. It can be pretty off-putting to play several times in a row and not win, thus obtaining a score of 0 each time (and FYI, I have literally no idea how that scoring system works once you do win).\n\nThe game calls itself an RTS and it definitely is, but it doesn't feel like any RTS I've played before. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just be aware that if you're into traditional RTS games that doesn't necessarily mean this game is for you (and vice versa). This is an RTS for VR. What that means is you're doing a lot of micro-managing and rushing around a lot. And you really do feel like you're rushing around over large distances, despite being in the confines of your living room.\n\nIn this game, you can't keep yourself out of harms way and let your bots do all the work and of course if you die, it's game over. In VR, being overwhelmed by swarms of enemy minions is truly quite terrifying.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is a triumph in what it sets out to achieve.

This is the first VR RTS I'm aware off and now it has finally launched out of early access into the full version. Roomscale strategy game at its finest.\n\n(TL;DR conclusion at the bottom; Disclaimer: I got a free key from the developer to provide feedback before the full release, this may of course cause some unconscious bias which you should take into account)\n\n[b]Visuals[/b]\n\nLooking at the screenshots and watching the trailer should give you a great impression how it will look in-game. The visuals are phenomenal and not many VR games out there (especially indie VR games) have such a coherent art style, polished looks while having a very uniquely-appearing setting. The locales you can play in bombard you with variety, are playable at different times of the day to significantly alter the atmosphere and mood of the game. The bright, colorful visuals are a great fit for the currently available VR HMDs as the game thrives on delivering clean, but pleasant graphics.\n\nEverything oozes with charm. From your own bots that are often very cutesy, to the enemies which have a distinct design which allows you to detect them from far away and judge which one and how many of them are approaching you.\n\nA lot of care also went into the animations. Every building and every item is accompanied by small, but important animations that makes the world feel much more alive.\n\nAnother great selling point is the wonderfully crafted UI. I have never seen an UI as beautiful and as fitting as this one in a VR game. Pushing buttons, putting in batteries, scrolling through the map, everything works great and looks great as well.\n\n[b]Sound[/b]\n\nAnother thing where Cosmic Trip excels. Fitting sound track, an abundance of SFX that accompany all of your actions. Again, this is another part where the game excels. One could criticize that during the more hectic moments filled with > 50 NPCs the sound mixing could be a bit better to put more emphasis on the more important and alarming sounds, however, this is just some small nit-picking for late game scenarios.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nIn this game there are 3 game modes: chill (just relaxing, no stress game mode), strategy (the meat of the game) and wave mode. Chill mode wasn't really exciting (well, it shouldn't be due to its name) and not much to my interest. The other 2 modes, were great, though.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the strategy mode you can play on 3 maps where the objective is to find the 'heart' of the enemy base and destroy it. You have to gather resources (crystals and ectoplasm) to build more bots to either help you harvest the resources, defend your base or attack new places to take over. Over time, the enemy tries to do the same and they are building up their army as well as taking over new places.\n\nResources run out over time, forcing you to go to new 'nodes' to built up bases there and gather new resources. If you're not careful enough when expanding, the enemy could attack prior, defenseless bases and destroy valuable buildings.\n\nBots can be built with the resources and upgraded versions are also available. In the game there are 4 main bots: workers (gathering crystals with only little defense capability), battle bots (melee bots, the cheapest available), laser bots (ranged attack bots) and medics (healer bots and collecting ectoplasm).\n\nBuilding wise there are helpful and often necessary structures that help with harvesting crystals, turrets to build, bot builders, bot 'servers' to expand the maximum of buildable bots, etc. Most buildings will cost more and more to prevent early snowballing.\n\nYou have a map available where you can command your bots to go to different places. The map is very intuitive and allows you to select only specific bots and a specific numbers of bots if you want to. You can also see if any enemies are approaching and you can plan ahead which nodes you want to tackle next.\n\nYou yourself as a player aren't defenseless either. You have a disc thrower for single-target damage, a bubble gun to build up temporary defenses and a shield. Your main 'omni-tool' is also a good way to dispatch enemies' buildings by literally 'pulling their plug'.\n\nA great gameplay mode that can become addicting until you find out the right strategy to beat a certain map. I hope the developers consider adding more difficulties to increase the already excellent replayabiltiy even further.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWave mode allows you to play on 2 different map in a much simpler manner and like the name already implies, here it is all about surviving as long as possible to get onto the leaderboards. While leaderboards also exists for the strategy mode, I think the most activity for score chasers will be in this mode. One of the map is a bigger one with several nodes as seen in the strategy mode. The other map consists of only one node and creates a more hectic gameplay as the difficulty ramps up more quickly when you can only stay at one place. Otherwise the gameplay is essentially the same as in the strategy mode: harvest resources, build your army and buildings, defeat your enemies.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nOne of my favorite VR games right now. This is a finished game that offers a video game genre that hasn't been fully explored in VR yet. The developers obviously have put in a lot of effort and love into this game, polishing it to a degree which is very rare for VR indie games. The game has great visuals, great sound and great gameplay. I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone interested in roomscale games in general, even for non RTS fans like myself.\n\nKudos Funktronic Labs, you've made a real gem.", "timestamp_created": 1495674113, "timestamp_updated": 1495675327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576851", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31902144": {"recommendationid": "31902144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000707026", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500245894}, "language": "english", "review": "The UI alone forces me to give this a positive rating.

I'm not exactly sure how to explain what it is though. Partly because it's an alien experience (in a totally good way!) but partly because there's no goal explanations that I can find.\n\nThe atmosphere, the machines, the interaction...it's absolutely beautiful. The interaction feels so satisdfying. The sound effects match the organic-like machine aesthetics perfectly.\n\nThere is a bit of a learning curve at first and the tutorial glitched, telling me over and over to kill an enemy that wasn't there. Speaking of the tutorial, that would have been an excellent time to explain the actual goals of the gameplay. Or is it just gather, defend repeat? Is there a way to \"win\" the game? \n\nI understand that you gather crystals and defend those areas against enemies, but to what end? If that part is explained, it's gone completely over my head. Am I supposed to set up posts across the entire map before I can progress? Is the goal to travel or to mine? Or both? Should I explore a map before setting up mining? And what is the blue/red bar on my controller supposed to indicate? Is the goal to fill the bar with blue? If so, how? Is figuring out these game details supposed to be part of the gameplay?\n\nPersonal confusion aside, for the most part this game is crazy solid when it comes to mechanics and design. I found some things that might need to be tweaked though:\n\n- Would like to be able to move something after placing it.\n\n- All the gatherer drones look identical. Can't tell the upgraded ones from the standard ones. A simple color change would help tell the difference at a glance.\n\n- Explain goals and controller display in the tutorial or while on the ship.\n\nIf there is an end goal, then I absolutely recommend this game.

I scrambled to plug them back in (Looking like a complete idiot I'm sure). But, the game handled it perfectly and didn't crash (which is kind of remarkable). I only stopped playing much, much later because I completely drained one the controllers.\n\nI'm still seeing bots fly around me as I type...\n\nPros:\n- I love the game mechanics. It's easy to see the potential of an RTS in VR.\n- Controls are very well thought out, and extremely intuitive. Some of the best in VR.\n- Truly addictive gameplay.\n- You can teleport yourself or your little buddies, sending reinforcements to another station (Extra attention to detail).\n\nCons:\n- With a lot of enemies and bots (90+) the game will lag, and lag badly. Feels like it's an affect of AI / collision code, and not the typical graphics processing. The sound gets choppy, and many frames are dropped, but not in a way that would make me woozy. When this happens it can prevent you from controlling a turret.  Hopefully this will get fixed, it's still in preview after all :)\n- A large play space is needed for this game. You will run into problems placing devices outside your walls. I have a decent space, but this game makes me wish I had another couple feet to spread out.\n- There's not a lot of strategy to the game yet. It's mostly action at this point, but it's still early days.\n\nSuggestions for devs:\n- The turret needs some kind of iron sight. There's the little glass rectangle, but with nothing to pair it with, it's just for show and doesn't really help with aiming.\n- More things to build! Maybe walls, a shield generator, a laser/sniper cannon (would be nice to defend a station at a distance). \n- Provide a way to sell/move a device. I made the mistake of placing factories too close to each other making it impossible to load one with new batteries, and I placed my first turret 2 inches outside my reach within a wall. If Items could be moved/sold, then you could allow things to be built in closer proximity (since a poor placement could be fixed) making this more playable for smaller spaces, and thereby more potential players.\n- The beep sound effect for instructions in the tutorial got extremely annoying within the first 20 minutes of play. Suggest something softer or less intrusive. Something more \"Hey, listen!\" and less \"COMPLY HUMAN!\"\n- When first making the bots it's easy to forget which ones do what, maybe add a little label/icon to their skins, so that you can pull one to you and read what they do. There's a missed opportunity to add some whimsy here with such a description/icon.\n- The bubble gun recharges too slow to be helpful to me, so I never use it. Maybe if it were ~25% faster recharging?\n- Switching between bubble gun/shield/disks was the only part of the controls that gave me any problem. Sometimes it just wouldn't let me switch. Needs a bit more \"snap\" range.\n- Add a \"hero\" bot. There currently isn't much strategy to the game aside from placement of the distance-shooting bots and your turrets. During a battle, you don't have the time to direct bots at all, you just have to fight with them which dilutes the \"strategy\" part of the game.

It's very similar to a tower defense game; as a player you build structures and bots, and you can assist your autonomous forces with turrets, frisbee lasers, etc.\n\nThe game is very intuitive, the art design is cute, and the mechanics are very fun. What's in the game is very polished, and aside from some performance issues when there's a lot of robots flying around there's not a lot I can fault it on.\n\nBasic gameplay loop boils down to fighting off waves of enemies with your bots and some of your weapons at your disposal, such as a turret or a slingshot that traps enemies for your bots to kill. While this is going on, the player collects resources (minerals and gas) to build more defenses and structures. The game is true room-scale; there is no locomotion mechanic outside of opening portals to different locations. That's about it. \n\nGather resources, kill enemies, build, rinse, repeat.\n\nNow, this is by no means a mark of a bad game, just a simple one. Cosmic Trip is definitely one of those games that will be gauged based on how much you paid at admission and your enjoyment of the concept.\n\nFor more VR reviews, check out the rest on my Steam Curator page:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/31930555-Auburoks-VR-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1475126142, "timestamp_updated": 1520342571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607815", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25614412": {"recommendationid": "25614412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014027305", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488085232}, "language": "english", "review": "Very pretty and very polished for what little content there is at the moment.

The feeling of creating the laser bots and tossing them into position is satisfying, and creating each stronghold was entertaining.  It get tedious at first, but smoothes out as you build up.  After 40 waves, the game felt too repetative, but im sure there will be new bots, defensive structures, and enemies in time.  \n\nPros: Graphics are incredible.  I really like the animations and design of the game.  The enemies maybe need a redesign, but the overall aesthetic was nice.  Game mechanics are super fun.  The teleport feature works great and doesnt disorient me, although i suspect VR sensative people may complain.\n\nCons: All cons at the moment are mostly due to it being a demo.  Im sure they will be addressed when the full game is completed and released.  There is no quit/exit button when you are in game.  Enemies are very mindless.  Need smarter and more varying enemies.  Two bots is boring.  Cant wait for more bots to defend and collect resources.  I see the turret has a slot load...maybe this is already in the plans, but being able to load a Turret with custom AIs would be cool!  \n\nThats all i feel like writing at the moment...Its a great game and definitely recommend VR peeps to check it out!

So excited to see where it will go.\n\nFirst off, if you're buying this be aware that it is an early access game and thus the gameplay is very limited in the current version. All you are able to do is build a few structures and a couple of different bots and defend your base.\n\nI have to say though, this small taste of the game really fills me with confidence in the developers. \n\nWhen I played it, all I could think was, 'this feels very focussed and beautifully designed'. The beautiful design is evident in the screenshots, but when playing in VR you really appreciate how everything looks and feels. This game really 'takes you somewhere'. This is what VR is all about.\n\nIn terms of 'focus', you really get a feeling from the small amount of gameplay available that the developers put a lot of care into how the game is played. It's fun, satisfying and feels smart. Hopefully they can follow through and deliver a great finished product because I hungry for more!\n\nDunno if anyone relevant will see this, but I just have some feedback on the sound design: One of the sound effects related to harvesting got quite annoying when lots of minerals were being harvested. Also, the sound that the turrent made seemed very out of place and unsatisfying.\n\nApart from those quibbles I love it!", "timestamp_created": 1465872956, "timestamp_updated": 1465873162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23545493": {"recommendationid": "23545493", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981125828", "num_games_owned": 512, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481511973}, "language": "english", "review": "OMG this is excellent!

If you want a game with a lot of content already here, this is the wrong game. There are two bots you can build - harvesting and defense -  and three types of machines - factory, harvest, and defense.\n\nNow, what is here seems to be fairly well done. Lots of attention to minor details.\n\nPros:\n * There have been a lot of comments about the pros, and I pretty much echo them. Haptics, visuals, details, etc. All done well.\n\n\nCons:\n * Popping up the menu on top of an item meant I couldn't interact with the menu. I had to move it first.\n\n * Lag. Enemies attack you wherever you are, so I had swarms of defense bots anywhere I could go. It got laggy - admittedly I had probably over a hundred bots out but in this type of game having huge numbers of units doing all the work is entirely reasonable, and I expect a game to pretty much be able to handle anything I can throw at it.\n\n * Every time I restart my computer I need to set the audio port again, and set the volume. I hadn't done the latter (my fault!) but it meant everything was annoying loud, and beep-beep-beep look at me, and blaring boombox bot and everything was making noise and it wanted my attention RIGHT THE EFFIN NOW.\n\n  I /hated/ the boombox bot.\n\n  I got the volume fixed, but the point is there is a lot going on and vying for your attention at first and it was a bit overwhelming and put me off a little bit initially. It was a lot less annoying once I got accustomed to what was going on, and figured out that the music was useful to know when the boombox bot wanted my attention.\n\n * I couldn't figure out how to repair boombox bot. If it wasn't in the area and a wave was starting, it'd appear in the sky and tumble to my feet blaring music and trying to get my attention - but it never would fly again. :( (It got caught out alone when a wave hit just as I was leaving a node I hadn't built up)\n\n\nAwwwws:\n * I went to one of my areas and discovered the battery in my harvester was dead. I had a handful of harvest bots, each with a crystal, swarm me and shove their crystals at me in a plaintive 'please take these we don't kow what to do. the harvester is broke' kinda way. I couldn't help but to smile at them.\n\n\nOverall, there is a lot of awesome potential. There has definitely been some love put into it already, but there isn't much actual content yet. The game is playable as-is, but limited. You pretty quickly figure out how to trivialize the waves of enemies.

Unbedingt kaufen!\n\nReview bezieht sich auf Early Access, gespielt mit HTC Vive\n\nCosmic Trip ist Tower Defense aus der Ego-Perspektive. Man hat sein kleines Vive-Spielfeld, in dem man seine Maschinen baut. Bisher gibt es eine Roboterfabrik, eine Rafinerie und eine Kanone - Alles hervorragend steuer- und kontrollierbar mit den Controllern. Bauen lassen sich \"Imps\" f\u00fcr den Abbau von Ressourcen oder kleine fliegende Laserkanonen. Gerade letztere sind eine sehr gute Unterst\u00fctzung bei den angreifenden Gegnerwellen. Denen k\u00f6nnte man sonst nur mit Laser-Frisbees begegnen, die sich leider nur relativ unpr\u00e4zise Richtung Gegner werfen lassen. Triifft man ungef\u00e4hr, bekommen sie die Kurve. Normalerweise ist daneben aber daneben. Und das ist meistens so. Nicht schlimm! Die Laser-Bots springen in die Bresche und so kann man seine Controller nutzen, die ankommenden Feindgeschosse abzufangen oder die Frisbee als Kreiss\u00e4ge im Nahkampf einsetzen.\n\nDie Motivation \u00fcbernimmt die ganze Zeit der kleine \"Kumpel\", der um einen rumschwirrt und winkt, wenn man ihn anschaut. Egal, wie stressig gerade die Angriffswelle ist - Man kann nicht anders, man winkt zur\u00fcck! Der k\u00f6nnte von Valve sein. Dazu Funk-Musik wie in den fr\u00fchen Tarantino-Werken. Ein rundes Erlebnis.\n\nSo ist dann auch pl\u00f6tzlich die erste Stunde rum, obwohl das Spiel eigentlich erst sehr wenig Inhalt hat. Ob es nun weitere Bot-Baupl\u00e4ne, Geb\u00e4ude oder die Kartenfunktion sind - \u00fcberall begegnet einem ein freundliches \"Coming Soon\". Zum Gl\u00fcck ist es aber trotzdem schon genug Inhalt, dass man sogar \u00fcber die h\u00fcbschen, aber wenig abwechslungsreichen W\u00fcsten-Settings hinwegsehen kann.\n\nDas Spiel macht viel Lust auf mehr!", "timestamp_created": 1465749114, "timestamp_updated": 1480441343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23522661": {"recommendationid": "23522661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028856167", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511215541}, "language": "english", "review": "This is what VR should be.

I have spent about 15 minutes just moving back and forth between places using them because not only are they well designed, but they are really fun to use.  My only complaint is that some things feel a little unbalanced, but that is completly understandable for an early access game, and I am confident in the developers' ability.

At the time of me writing this review you will read the words \"coming soon\" more often in the menus than actual items.\nHowever, the things you CAN do right now in this game are great. The developer seems to have put a lot of work into designing this game so it really works in VR. And it does. Using the user interface is incredibly intuitive and just \"feels right\". Placing buildings and building robots is very statisfying.\nEven more statisfying is throwing space frisbees at those nasty alien attackers or placing a stationary turret which you use to  blast them down using both controllers as handles.\nThe graphics style is also very pleasant. Everything fits really great together, which helps a lot getting immersed in the game world. Together with the intuitive controls it led to the first small dent one of my controllers got as I was trying to throw space frisbees at some giant alien blob and hit the wall. I was just completely sucked in by the game.\n\nAll in all a great experience which I would recommend to everyone who likes to play around with unfinished software.

The game was short and had it's fair share of bugs, gameplay issues, and was lacking in much content.\n\nIt's been out of Early Access for a while now and it's almost changed completely.\n\nThere are actual tiers of units and weapons, over four times the number of enemies, and a few different modes to choose from ranging from a relaxing easy mode to the new main mode. \n\nThe main game now has you teleporting from area to area and capturing them in order to build the structures you need to make new bots, unlock new weapons, increase the unit cap, ect.  You win by destroying the enemy heart located elsewhere, which requires you to survive a gauntlet of enemies while working on accessing the weakpoints of the enemy base.\n\nThe challenge is fairly high, requiring you to balance building your army and harvesting the limited resources on the map with culling the ever increasing enemy foothold as it captures nodes and spawns generators that make waves of units. If you take too long or don't manage your building properly you can quickly get overwealmed or run out of resources to make bots, making your assault on the base much harder.\n\nThe location you start in as well as the enemy base and resource caches are randomly placed each time you play, so your strategy can change every time, sometimes forcing you to clear out a cave full of enemies, sometimes protecting your base from all sides while making a path to the enemy heart.\n\nThe performance has improved a lot, but the game still gets wonky when massive amounts of enemies are around. It's not too bad and quite understandable with the huge waves that get generated when the enemy is overgrown.\n\nWhile this game didn't become the RTS game I hoped it did, it did become a great RTS/Tower Defense hybrid game that's well worth a purchase.

At this point, I have had my Vive for about 2 weeks and accumulated about 12 games. This is one of the more fun VR games that I have acquired. It has a very groovy soundtrack that completely fits the vibe they are going for. The immersion factor is great and it is very polished for an early release game. The mechanics are fantastic, and it has a great teleport system.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I have about an hour of playtime, so I will be completely honest, I do not know all of the in's and outs of this game. I am not sure how to capture the other towers not am I really sure what to do with the blobs you collect from killing spawns. I know you can teleport to different locations and set up multiple bases. I know you can build Bot factory units, refinery units and and guns that you have to man to fend off waves. As far as bots go, at this point in time, we have Harvester bots and sentry bots, with more features to come as the game matures. The disk mechanic is amazing. I would love to see this expanded on a bit. \n\nAs far as the cons of the game go, I can only think of two. One is the sound as you progress. It gets to be a bit much if you have for example, 6 sentries and 6 harvesters. there are a lot of sounds that can be a bit overwhelming. I haven't researched if you can turn down SFX volume separately from the music volume. If you can, then ignore this as it would correct for that problem. \n\nThe second issue at this time is that under the same scenario of 6 harvesters and 6 sentries, I was noticing some significant frame-rate drops during wave spawns. I am running an R9 290x, and my machine is well within the green for recommended specs for VR.  I didn't notice this during my first 30 minute session, because I didn't get far enough to make it an issue before I logged out, but this afternoon, it became apparent and was one of the reasons I logged out as I was getting woozy. To be clear, I had a lot going on, probably more than I needed for what I was doing. Again, I know this game is in its infancy and optimizations will be coming as it matures.\n\nAt any rate, I do recommend this game. I am not an RTS or Tower defense fan. I got this game because it was a VR game and at this point in time, they are in somewhat of a short supply, but I thoroughly enjoy it and am looking forward to seeing it progress.", "timestamp_created": 1465518422, "timestamp_updated": 1465518422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23475527": {"recommendationid": "23475527", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993494232", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470767424}, "language": "german", "review": "Best VR Game...", "timestamp_created": 1465512057, "timestamp_updated": 1465512057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.411156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23474519": {"recommendationid": "23474519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045328046", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465474219}, "language": "swedish", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEjJo9se2ZE\nUnpolished gameplay, see what you get before you buy!\n\nThis game has SO MUCH potential.

That said, it's definately a fun game and one of the first strategy games for the Vive, so definately worth taking for a whirl. It's also the first strategy game to ever give me a workout. \n\nPros - \n* Enjoy the art style\n* Nice interface\n* The first real strategy game for the Vive\n* I think I lost five pounds during my first game alone.\n\nCons - \n* Small map\n* Laaaaag. After I got a few dozen bots at each of my bases, everything started lagging like crazy, and I have a very high end gaming rig.\n* Get-going fast: No challenge / Slow start: die horribly. The difficulty curve leaves a *lot* to be desired. If your first base gets mostly destroyed, you can pretty much pack up and go home\n* No versus or teams mutliplayer. And RTS without multiplayer is like a JRPG without a plot.\n* \"Waves\" in a game that claims to be an RTS. Let's not kid ourselves, it's not an RTS, it's base defense. In essence, a base defense game is basically a third of an RTS. The other two thirds being tech development and attack. RTS's as a result, don't have to resort to \"waves\". You can hide a secondary base from your enemy and slowly build up while your main base is destroyed, you can do attacks on their base and reduce their numbers, you can turtle or you can early-game rush, or you can come up with strange and weird tactics (in one RTS I recall I used walls - yes walls, basic concrete walls - offensively and wiped out all his capabilities with just walls.... long story, and it was hilarious... for me at least.) \n* Most things are still locked.\n\nNow, all that said, you may see the con list is longer and thing \"Oh well, not worth it.\" Well, it's worth a good solid 3 hours of gameplay at least, and that's on day 1 release. Since it claims to be an RTS, I hope it gets further along that road (only time will tell.) And get more things to unlock and more tech and more RTS elements. Again, it's the only strategy game for the Vive so far, so I hope for good things from it.", "timestamp_created": 1465458143, "timestamp_updated": 1465458143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23463789": {"recommendationid": "23463789", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970951932", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502160149}, "language": "english", "review": "HOLY COW.

Everything works perfectly. Overall the gameplay is addictive and fun.\n\nYou start off on some alien planet with nothing but your two guns. If you wait around a little bit you can fight some enemies. Throwing discs at enemies is as fun as it sounds. You can also hold your fire and turn your thrown projectial into saws for some badass melee combat. Eventually you're going to need some help so you start gathering these blue crystals. These crystals turn into your currency and you can spawn a number of things into the game. Start off with a bot spawner, which only has a gather and defend bot at the moment. Every item in the game requires power so you need to craft batteries. After that you build a drop off node. And usually before you're ready to go you have waves of enemies spawning. You take some out and craft some more bots. Eventually you make a factory where you're pumping out gathering bots and and protection. \n\nSoon after that it's time to move. You move from point to point via these portals you pick up from the ground. The transition looks amazing and it's super smooth. From there you want to do the same thing and start building up a base. Get a couple bases going and you'll soon find the game too easy to play. I started to spawn too many and the game got a bit choppy. I'm running a 960 so I'm sure others can get better framerates. If I had to take a guess I'd say I was around 100-120 bots when I started experiencing lag. \n\nIn the end the game is in early access and needs work. It's definitely fun and I recommend this to anyone who want the full experience of a Vive. Don't go expecting hundreds of hours of game play, but seeing as this game has tons of potential you very well could over the next few months. They're fairly open in showing more content is to come. Currently there are about four enemies to fight and they are all a blast. You get some squid looking thing which is the easiest to fight. Following up that you have these cresent moon looking things that shoot out these black jelly orbs. Lastly you have these bigass orbs.

The characters, buildings, and environment, are all very well done.\n- Moving around the world is done by stepping through portals you open up from the ground.

You can also take out the enemies yourself by throwing razor frisbees at them, by taking their shots and throwing them back, or shooting out of a turret. All of this seems really smooth, and there are no issues with throwing physics or aiming with the turret.\n- Being in early access you've gotta be careful with this mindset, but there is a TON of potential for how the Strategy game mode will be. The core concept is sound, we just have to wait and see what the execution is\n- The devs have been great communicators so far. They hang out in Discord and talk about stuff!\n\nCons:\n- I actually solved the early build. I built 40+ laserbots and was able to let the game sit for 40+ waves. Made it to wave 85 before I stopped.\n- Actually building 40+ laserbots might be problematic for most setups. Running a GTX 1080, I was still able to see a minor performance hit during waves, Anything less than that and you'll start to lag around wave 20 or \n\nI recommend this game highly.

But content will come! I look forward to more enemy types, attacks on different bases (especially not the ones you're currently at) etc.\n\nAs it stands right now the game looks and sounds great, the building menu is really intuitive and I love that I an queue a bot cartridge in each hand for rapid double bot factory building. There are some bugs and quirks, but it's too early to critisize.\n\n...my only problem was that cute friend bot. Quite early on he stopped floating and just lay on the ground, ocassionally waving his little cutesy robot hand at me. I picked him up and tried to feed him a battery, but he just wouldn't take it!

PERIOD. One major issue with VR games is that many don't have a solid tutorial, and leave you to either figure it out, or search the interwebs. For anyone who owns a Vive, the interwebs probably aren't a foriegn land, but having such a solid tutorial is really a standout right now. \n\n\nCons-\n\n\nIts not finished. Straight up, that's the only con. This is the very first release of an Early Access, so of course it isn't finished, but it's very not finished. There's even a little blip in the instructions that seems to refer to capturing towers (of which there are two on the map), but the actual mechanic for capturing them simply doesn't exist. You can also see all of the locked spaces in the menus where they plan on putting more things.\n\n\nOverall-\n\nGet it. Yes, it's severely lacking in content, and if the devs tried to release it right now, as a full game, I would say screw them. But, this is the first in many betas to come, and I will be absulutley astounded if this doesn't jump in price, because the gameplay is just THAT GOOD. \n\n\nTo the Devs-\n\nYou are men, with a very particular set of skills.\nNow, I don't know who you are, but I will find you, and I will play every game you've ever created.\n\nBecause you my friends, are amazing!

It looks like the developers have a lot more planned with plenty \"(coming soon)\" tabs in the game, like maps and various buildings/robots. \n\nAs of right now you'll really experience everything that's in the game within the first 15-20minutes. The current game mode is survival where you are fighting off waves of attacking aliens while trying to defend the bases you've built, I played for an hour straight and had all my bases fully defended and so much income spilling in I couldn't hope to spend it all. That being said, I had an absolute blast doing it! Seriously once you've thrown some laser bots out and are firing away on the turret you'll be having a good time.\nAs far as how the game plays I've noticed a few bugs, none of which were even remotley game breaking and I only had fps issues once when I had way too many bots working on one reactor pretty late into the game.\n\nPros\nGreat atmosphere and graphics style\nIncredibly cute robots that are fun to throw\nSmooth fps\nfun combat\n\nCons\nLack of content\nAI begins to get derpy the longer you play\n\nOverall I enjoy the game and at $14.99 ($13.49 currently on sale) I'd certainly reccomend it. I generally am not a fan of Early Access but I'm quite hopeful for this one as it's already running well and a joy to play.\n\nGameplay Video Here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG0VE9DBiy4", "timestamp_created": 1465413587, "timestamp_updated": 1465414134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655600", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23456676": {"recommendationid": "23456676", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981902228", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481329813}, "language": "english", "review": "Tied with Holopoint for the best VR game out in my opinion.

Not only what FEELS good, but the gorgeous polish they're putting on the environment and models. And seriously that little bot that waves at me is one of the best things ever. He's so fucking cute and I I love it every time he waves at me with his cute little robot wings and his dumb little smiley face. I don't even know his purpose but I'm glad he's there. The guys from Fantastic Contraption need to steal this little guys personality and put it into the kitty that gives you all the parts.\n\nSo a couple things. The haptics on everything you grab or vacuum to your controller feels so good. All the bumps, buzzes, and everything that let you know when to look at your controller, when you're picking something up, everything... feels SO GOOD. The generous amount of vacuum you get to pull things to you and pick things up is so very welcome and perfect. The physics on tossing and throwing stuff around IS SO GOOD. There's this Frisbee weapon that you can equip to help fight off baddies. it has just enough autoaim \"homing\" that makes it amazing feeling. I've played another frisbee VR game and is was terrible. This makes it feel like such a cool weapon. Even just tossing out bots to deploy them feels just like it should. You guys are seriously fucking nailing everything about the \"feel\" of VR. The UI is top notch. The method of choosing things to build and placing them out is top fucking notch. I don't know who you guys are or where you came from but you're a big fucking deal and I'm super excited to see what comes of this game and what you're going to do for VR.\n\nAlso, can I just compliment the controller model for a minute? It feels like such love was put into it. That tiny little window that lets you see through it... I dunno man, you guys are just killing it on attention to detail. <3\n\nThe turret is AWESOME.  That thing just feels amazing when you snap into it and go full Rambo on those aliens.  It feels really neat and I'm excited for more turret modes.  PLEASE GIVE US A CHAIN LIGHTING TURRET MODE TO TAKE OUT SWARMS!  :)\n\nKUDOS.\n\n\nCONS:\n\nI mean I have some negative criticism but I think it's simply because it's not done yet.  I am keeping in mind that this is the very first build of Early Access but here are some things to consider if you're wanting a fully finished game right off the bat.  Granted, keep in mind, early access is only $15 which is a steal because I'm positive this game will be worth double that once finished.  \n\nLike for starters, the goal right now is basically, survive as many waves as you can.  Eventually you either die or you build so many bots the game can't keep up and it lags.  Also, there does seem to be a bug where if sometimes gather bots just won't take minerals to empty, available, powered refineries.  Devs confirmed this bug but just be prepared for some weird behavior there from time to time.\n\nThe other thing to prepare yourself for is how frustrating it can be when you accidentally \"vacuum\" batteries out of your robot factories or refineries.  To remove a battery, you should have to do something like hit a power button first THEN pull the battery.  That would solve that issue.  \n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThese are minor nitpicks and again, keep in mind this is sort of a first draft of what's potentially going to be the single most polished VR game to date.  But holy crap are the Devs nailing the feel of this game.  The haptics, look, feel, design, and heart of this game makes me so happy.  Get this game on early access understanding that there are only 3 structures, a 2 possible robots to build and that it's a survival wave based defense game to show you the core mechanics.  Know that the RTS part of this game IS COMING.  But once you load it up you'll instantly understand the care and love they're putting into all of the details of this game.\n\nI recommend you get this.", "timestamp_created": 1465409860, "timestamp_updated": 1465409860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.884755", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 339, "total_negative": 36, "total_reviews": 375}}

I feel like the people who complain about this game's difficulty are far too used to AAA titles where flash takes presecedence over substance. Not that I don't like AAA games and their graphics.

This is love letter to beat-em-ups of the 90s, and if you grew up with Final Fight, Streets of Rage and the like, this plays like a perfected, smoothed, updated version of those games.\n\nNot only is the guy behind this (literally built by one dude, and I've never seen a game made by one man be so fluid, complete, and not-jank) is obviously a fan of the Street Figher Alpha series as well (as am I, which definitely helps my opinion, but I don't think it's necessary for someone to love this game), from the rotation decals on a spinning enemy being identical to the ones after an Alpha Counter in those games to charaters like Tsong Doo, the rooster who uses Muay Thai and stands on one foot with a mong-kon on, a perfect reference to Adon. Hell, there's a female ninja named Gal who has Guy's exact walk cycle (and F. Norris, the male ninja character, has his exact bread-and-butter combo). There's SF III as well, in the Doberman enemy who boxes you, including Dudley's exact Corkscrew Blow animation. Or the enormous water buffalo named T. Bison who does turnpunches. Or the cat enemy who is dressed exactly like M. Bison (Dictator) and attacks with slide kicks and scissorkicks. Homeboy is a Street Fighter fan, for sure.\n\nThere's three characters, Gal (the quick one), F. Norris (the all-arounder), and Ricardo (a bull with a penchant for wrestling moves, from powerbombs to lariats). The story is some kind of catastrophe went down and annihilated human technology while also mutating animals into sapient, humanoid forms. Suffice it to say, they are displeased with their treatment by people, and you are out to stomp 'em back out. Don't feel bad; they've enslaved and eaten loads of people. Stomp 'em back down to their places on the food chain!\n\nCombat feels wonderful. Animations are smooth and buttery. Basic X-X-X-X combos give way to dash attacks, anti-airs and special moves. Everybody has a completely unique moveset and when you find out you can backfist-combo a dude into a roundhouse, then dash forward and slidekick him before he hits the ground to juggle him into a tatsu, or execute Gal's full basic  combo into a guy, cancel into her special move to launch the poor bastard straight up, bread-and-butter him again, THEN flipkick him until he EXPLODES INTO BONES, well, suffice it to say it is IMMENSELY gratifying. Dudes swarm you, but your verbset, while not particularly expansive, combos and interconnects so well, you can dish out pain commensurate with the enemy floods.\n\nUnlockables are through the ROOF. Extra game modes like difficulties or speed settings, some eleven costumes for each character (I don't even have them all for my favorite character yet), and a battle mode where you can play as each of the enemy types, meaning you've got them to unlock, too. There's an entire grid of endings, with some 30 or so possible permutations. You can even unlock a CPU assist mode where you can play with an AI partner (or two!) to get the endings that require multiple characters, even if you don't have buddies who play beat-em-ups available.\n\nI had a feeling I was going to like this game as soon as it pretended to the RAM check cycle that old arcade cabinets did back in the day. I was further convinced of the love and care of the dev when I saw that there are friggin' video modes to mimic the CRTs of days of old, even simulated GLARE, for Christ's sake. The music is great, the gameplay is so smooth you're liable to slide out of your chair, and the references are charming as all get-out. I cannot say enough good about it, and I legitimately believe it is impossible to go wrong for the price.

B\u00e1sicamente, Fight N Rage tiene todo lo que un buen t\u00edtulo de esta estirpe debe posser: historia simple, acci\u00f3n fren\u00e9tica, dificultad notable y desde ya, el eterno factor de la rejugabilidad, tanto en solitario como entre amigos.\n\nEn un mundo en guerra, los mutantes y los humanos no han logrado llegar a un buen acuerdo, por lo que los primeros mencionados establecen un caos general, asesinando y devastando a mansalva. Un grupo de h\u00e9roes, unidos por la misma causa \u2013 y en algunos casos, con alg\u00fan problema personal con el enemigo -, deciden realizar justicia por mano propia.\n\nInicialmente, contamos con tres personajes distintos para iniciar la aventura: Gal, F. Norris y Ricardo, cada uno con las t\u00edpicas caracter\u00edsticas y balances en cuanto a movilidad o potencia de ataque. A disposici\u00f3n nuestra se encuentra tambi\u00e9n un modo de entrenamiento, realmente \u00fatil para aprender nuevas t\u00e9cnicas, movimientos o combos. Conforme avancemos, notaremos una enorme influencia \u2013 positiva, desde ya \u2013 de t\u00edtulos como Streets of Rage, Final Fight, Cadillacs & Dinosaurs y otras sagas de toda la vida. A priori, tambi\u00e9n tendremos el desaf\u00edo de ver cu\u00e1n oxidados estamos ante un video game cuya dificultad va en notable crecimiento.\n\nLa posibilidad de elegir varios caminos hasta llegar al enemigo final, es otra peculiaridad, favoreciendo tambi\u00e9n el factor \u201crejugabilidad\u201d mencionado al inicio. La enorme variedad de opciones, personajes, modos de juego y extras, son otro motivo m\u00e1s por el cu\u00e1l entender que la primera vez que podamos finalizarlo, en realidad es s\u00f3lo el inicio. Y ni hablar si sos de los que no pueden dejar de completar todos los logros en Steam, claro.\n\nEl despliegue gr\u00e1fico es realmente bueno, con una est\u00e9tica de 16 Bits y detalles interesantes por todas partes. En cuanto a la personalizaci\u00f3n, encontr\u00e9 tambi\u00e9n muy interesante la cantidad de variantes que ofrece para visualizarlo; es decir, que podremos jugarlo con scanlines, en modo \u201climpio\u201d, como si fuera una TV vieja, etc. Detalles no menores y que valen la pena mencionar. En cuanto a la parte del sonido y la m\u00fasica, son magn\u00edficos, evocando tambi\u00e9n aquellas melod\u00edas que acompa\u00f1aban durante la aventura y que en realidad uno termina apreciando la segunda o tercera vez que le dedica tiempo.\n\nSin miedo a equivocarme, Fight N Rage es sin duda alguna un \u201cnuevo cl\u00e1sico\u201d que adem\u00e1s, tiene el orgullo de haberse desarrollado en Sudam\u00e9rica, espec\u00edficamente en Uruguay. Un excelente laburo que por un precio accesible, nos puede proporcionar horas de diversi\u00f3n \u201cc\u00f3mo las de antes\u201d.

Its like where to start? First off the graphics and art are outstanding, lots of the character/enemy sprites for the most part have fluid animations, especially the females...they have bits that jiggle so much that it puts the jiggle physics of DOA Volleyball and Senran Kagura series to shame; some might find it off putting or a nit pick, but me, I enjoy this man's work, attention and detail to those parts; with that aside the other enemies you ecounter in game have unique and interesting designs each with different fighting styles that are heavily influenced by Street Fighter (like come on, there is an enemy that dresses and fights like M.Bison).\n\nNext is the controls and combat, Fight'N Rage has this down to a tee; it's a simple three button layout you got your attack, jump, and a button for you special attack. It's one of these easy to pick up hard to master sort of combat; you got foward attacks, down attacks, jump attacks, running attacks, grabs/throws, parries, cancels, combos, big combos the list goes on. The dev was clearly influence by the Street Fighter combat mechanics and it works so well in a beat em' up so big props to them.\n\nI got not much to say about the music, but I know good music when I hear it and this game totally has it. The main menu music hypes you up for beating up these fucking furries; and track after track keeps the blood pumping. So yeah, compliments to the composer very well done. Might as well also mention the difficulty, this game is pretty rock hard and I will admit with no shame that I havent beaten it yet, it gets to Cuphead levels of hard, maybe a bit harder than that; so just a fair warning. There is an \"easy mode\" but you need to unlock it first with points. \n\nAs for everything else I havent mentioned, like the story; its just there to be there, nothing too deep or a meaning behind it; You as the humans (or the only furry that fights along with the humans) have to fight through stages of \"mutants\" (they are anthros) to get to the boss. Simple and straightfoward yeah, but truth be told, there are branching paths in certain stages that will change the game's ending, so there is high replayability to have here. Along with story mode you got a shop where you can buy a plethora of things from main character skins, game modes, and new characters for your battle mode. And dont worry, no microtransactions on this. Its just a matter of scoring high on story mode to obtain coins and thats how you buy things, so thats another plus there, no lootboxes or microtransaction bullshit.\n\n[b] TL;DR, GOOD BEAT UP FURRIES SIMULATOR [/b]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511399285, "timestamp_updated": 1511399285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36803504": {"recommendationid": "36803504", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965583413", "num_games_owned": 861, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509741081}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best beat em ups on Steam, or ever.", "timestamp_created": 1511384540, "timestamp_updated": 1511384540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36730806": {"recommendationid": "36730806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017399198", "num_games_owned": 830, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506695000}, "language": "french", "review": "Un beat'em up comme \u00e0 la grande \u00e9poque de Capcom, Sega et Konami.\n\nLes d\u00e9veloppeurs ont bien compris ce qui faisait le sel du genre et l'on ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 de belle mani\u00e8re.\n\nSi les tentatives r\u00e9centes de beat'em up \u00e0 l'ancienne se sont sold\u00e9es par des \u00e9checs, ce jeu est, au contraire, une r\u00e9ussite.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511376925, "timestamp_updated": 1511376925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36707005": {"recommendationid": "36707005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046208175", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512932684}, "language": "english", "review": "it's just so good.", "timestamp_created": 1511374498, "timestamp_updated": 1511374498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36643551": {"recommendationid": "36643551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292903036", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512054629}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u3002\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u60c5\u6000\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u867d\u7136\u901a\u5173\u6ca1\u90a3\u4e48\u591a\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u6709\u6316\u6398\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u70b9\u5f88\u597d\u3002\u654c\u6211\u53cc\u65b9\u52a8\u4f5c\u90fd\u505a\u7684\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u624b\u611f\u5f88\u597d\u3002\n\u867d\u7136\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u8d28\u5f88\u9ad8\u3002\n\n\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u65e9\u70b9\u52a0\u5165\u8054\u673a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\n\n\u6574\u4f53\u6d41\u7a0b\u611f\u89c9\u6709\u70b9\u957f\u3002\u8003\u8651\u5230\u9053\u4e2d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b58\u6863\uff0c\u540e\u4e24\u5173\u80cc\u666f\u6709\u4e9b\u5355\u8c03\uff0c\u602a\u7269\u91cd\u590d\u5229\u7528\u592a\u591a\uff0c\u4e00\u8f6e\u901a\u5173\u80fd\u538b\u7f29\u5230\u4e09\u56db\u5341\u5206\u949f\u5c31\u597d\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u5173\u5e95boss\u6709\u70b9\u5931\u671b\uff0c\u6218\u6597\u529b\u6bd4\u4e0d\u8fc7\u95e8\u795e\u5c0f\u602a\u5c31\u4e0d\u8bf4\u4e86\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u786c\u521a\u5bf9\u649e\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\uff0c\u4ed6\u5c45\u7136\u7528\u989d\u5916\u7684\u9053\u5177\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4e2a\u8fdc\u7a0b\uff0c\u9119\u89c6\u554a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1511176336, "timestamp_updated": 1511176336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36556321": {"recommendationid": "36556321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066303245", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1514659999}, "language": "italian", "review": "Great game! deep and satisfiyng combo system and a great variety of routes and locations.

This is inspired by games such as Streets of Rage and Final Fight, games I really enjoyed when I was younger!\n\nDuring my first playthrough I didn't really catch much of the story: Think it's that mutants are running amok and on a genocidal rampage against the humans. Enter you, the protagonist, to beat up hundreds of them. You can unlock a lot of extra characters but you start with 3:\n\n-Gal, a lady who's all about speed, combos, and jiggling---I mean, juggling. And jiggling.\n-F. Morris, a strategic fighter with numerous strategies.\n-Ricardo, a minotaur with massive strength to crush foes.\n\nI played through as Gal the first time, and the fighting felt really good. Pulling off crazy combos while surrounded by enemies feels amazing, and the enemy variety is large enough to the point it never really feels boring. Combine that with an awesome rocking soundtrack and you got all you need for a fantastic beat 'em up. Not to mention very well animated sprites for both the characters and the enemies: Game looks really good.\n\nThe way it differs from many others is how it has multiple routes and endings. You can take different paths to go to different stages, and fight different foes. This gives the game a ton of replayability, and I'm looking forward to my next run!\n\nI played on Normal, and for the most part the game was reasonable in terms of difficulty! There's some REALLY rough stretches in the end stages but with a little strategy you can make things a lot easier for yourself. There's only one stage which started to test my patience, and that was a raft stage where you fight a lot of enemies on a small raft. You can knock them into water, but the same can happen to you and you take a chunk of damage when that happens. It gets worse when you start fighting enemies that cannot fall into the water, and there are zero health drops during this entire section.\n\nThis raft stage ended with a really bad boss, and that leads to one of my bigger complaints: The boss design is kinda inconsistent. This particular boss could not be harmed by anything but jump kicks and special attacks as they were often floating over the water. Most of the fight had me just doing jump kicks as he dove for me, and...It was really bad.\n\nStill, there's a number of enjoyable fights, it's just some weak bosses thrown in there.\n\nOverall, if you loved the beat 'em ups of yesteryear, you'll love this game. The game took me 2 hours to beat the first run, and now that I have a run under my belt I can probably annihilate that time. You also have a ton of unlockables, a ton of modes, a lot of customization...You get a whole lot for $20!\n\nI give this a hearty recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1510529896, "timestamp_updated": 1510529896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36473441": {"recommendationid": "36473441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043404730", "num_games_owned": 799, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511148018}, "language": "english", "review": "[skip to paragraph 3 for an actual review]\nIf I had to say, I'd probably say that I'm a Beat Em' Up novice. I viciously and without remorse cheated to get max stats in Scott Pilgrim, I played Red knight in Castle Crashers and grinded my way to becoming an invincible wall of lightning and in Guardian Heroes I couldn't beat the game without getting that extreme buff from the magic sword. About the only \"real\" beat em ups I ever won were ones that got re-released with infinite continues.\n\nSo why then, did I buy this? Well to be blatantly honest, I had heard about it on a minor gamming site thought to myself \"yeah that looks cool\" and bought it once I had the available cash. My total regrets since then have been negligable. Sure, my first run basically ended in failure, but this time, this time I truly fought the game. I didn't just go \"well time to grind up exp or find an easier route\". Nope. I just went and said \"fine, I'll buy easy mode\". I then proceeded to try again(I won that time), get some practice in the training room, and read a helpful guide. After that, I truly started enjoying the game by blasting hundred of poor rats into thin gruel as Ricardo and my first \"true\" run ended up being my first single credit clear.\n\nWelp, that's my little \"backstory talk\". Let's talk actual game design stuffs. The game is just one big chunk of eye and ear candy. Amazing sprites on amazing backgrounds all while listening to a godly soundtrack. It's just pure nerve pleasing goodness. for gameplay, well, it's bog standard beat em up. You can move around in a \"3D\" envirnment, you have your basic combo button, jump button, and special button(or Lariat button for Ricardo) so you shouldn't have any problems figuring things out. The game is also quite responsive and for everything that goes on(especially in three player co-op) I'm quite happy that my little laptop has only ever had a problem with this game when it's hooked up to my tv. Of course, despite my aformentioned \"domination\" of the game, it isn't roll over levels of easy. There are some enemies(looking at YOU Doberman) that are pretty dang tough. But what's really nice is how addicting and replayable it is. There's a ton of endings to get and metric tons of unlockables(though, easy mode is for some reason one of them). Perhaps the most amusing of which is the ability to play as all those outright useless mooks you slaughter by the dozen. There's just something about watching the two weakest enemies in the game fight each other that is so hilarious.\n\nTl;Dr\nGood:\nVery pretty\nRocking Sound track\nFun characters to learn and master\nUnlockables for days\nGood stress reliever with proper unlocks\nYou can make a rat with an apple peeler fight a lazy electric cat.\nYou can make aformentioned rat and cat EXPLODE into a pile of bones\nAI helpers for when you don't have any friends\n\nNeutral:\nHave to unlock modes that lower the dificulty\nThere's no point in making apple peeler rat and thunder cat fight\nAI helpers won't eat chicken with you\n\nBad:\nNo online(okay there sort of is, and I don't care about online anyway but might as well point it out since \"everything must be online\")\nYou will(most likely) hurl death threats at a knife weilding armadillo thing and subsequently get everyone in the room to look at you funny\nAI helpers have a tendancy to die because they won't eat their chicken", "timestamp_created": 1510502937, "timestamp_updated": 1510502937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36425344": {"recommendationid": "36425344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005260235", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 135, "last_played": 1514317196}, "language": "english", "review": "You can tell from my playtime that I really enjoy playing this game.

Es precioso de ver.\n\nQue decir de su apartado sonoro, los efectos suenan de miedo, y las musicas se adaptan perfectamente a cada escenario.

Pero el modo de dificultad \"Muy Dificil\" puede resultar un autentico infierno, sobre todo para el personaje de Gal, incluso siendo experto jugando con ella.

Esto en la ultima fase es realmente IMPOSIBLE, ya que debes de pasar TOOODO el nivel con tan solo tres vidas, y probablemente no ganes ninguna vida extra.\n\nEl parry a veces no funciona correctamente, incluso haciendo bien el cambio de sentido. Tampoco otorga tiempo de inmunidad, lo que significa que si has bloqueado un golpe de un combo enemigo, recibiras el siguiente golpe, a no ser que lances la habilidad especial de imediato.\n\nAlgunas zonas pueden resultar caoticas debido a la cantidad de enemigos que salen en pantalla. No puedes ni ver a tu personaje entre tanto bicho (Dificil o superior).\n\nVeo a Gal un tanto nerf en comparacion con los demas personajes. Lo unico que veo que destaca es en su habilidad para escapar de los enemigos, pero no es la gran cosa. Su da\u00f1o es bajo pese a que sus combos son largos, su rango es MUY corto, su velocidad es similar a la de Norris y es la mas debil de los tres.\n\nNo hay ningun item que otorgue una vida extra, solo podras conseguir vidas mediante puntos.\n\nNo tiene Coop online, aun que puedes jugar con un amigo online mediante programas como Parsec.\n--------------------------\n\nEste analisis esta sujeto a cambios debido a las actualizaciones del desarrollador.", "timestamp_created": 1510095281, "timestamp_updated": 1510095382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36352385": {"recommendationid": "36352385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042018504", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510084623}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't like beat 'em ups usually.

I didn't want to admit that the game was so unplayable because of me, but after the past 3 hours, I know for certain that it is unplayable because of the way the game is designed and my hardware limitations. \n\nThe game does not recognize my 360 controller (Edit: Congratulations to anyone who got the game to recognize their controller. You are offically better than me. Is that what you wanted to hear? Good, maybe now you can stop commenting about it.) so I needed to first track down Xbox360ce software or use my USB N64 controller that i typically use for retro games so I could even play the game. After that, the combat system's input windows are SO limited that it is practically impossible for me to do anything but the basic combos due to the input lag from needing to use 3rd party software/hardware to even play the game. I spent almost an hour watching people on YouTube do the training, and I even with repeating what they did exactly, I just couldn't meet the tolerance window required for the inputs to be recognized as valid. Basic down up attacks, juggling, and other combos are just impossible for me to perform in this game reliably, even when i regularly do all the above in other games.  \n\nIf I could play on easy mode, I would probably have enjoyed the game more, but that requires in game currency to unlock (Like Seriously? Hard mode is free, but you need to pay for easy mode?). To make matters worse, the game has phantom inputs, even when playing with the keyboard and no hardware emulation. Combos when facing the left of the screen are regularly interrupted with the avatar randomly facing the right of the screen. \n\nEffective attack range for most characters is very limited, which also happens to be less than the attack range of enemies. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if ALL combos acted the same, but in order for a combo to be triggered, you need to hit an enemy. This often resulted in attacks hitting air repetedly until i get smacked instead of inching into attack range with each attack like in... well, nearly every other brawler i've played.", "timestamp_created": 1509909666, "timestamp_updated": 1510536532, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.361996", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36296652": {"recommendationid": "36296652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043173847", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512824953}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Indispens\u00e1vel pra quem curte jogos como Final Fight, Streets of Rage, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, Captain Commando, The Punisher, Sengoku 3, e tantos outros t\u00edtulos desse estilo de game sensacional que \u00e9 o Beat'em Up.

I know I do, and not only is it cathartic, it's fun too.  With a complex combat system that'd make most modern beat'em ups blush Fight'n Rage is definitely worth the price tag.\n\nThe combat in F'N Rage is crunchy, brutal, flashy, fun, and filled with some hidden depth that really pays off if you're willing to take some time to master it.  Each of the three protagonists has their own, unique playstyle, and if you find one isn't working for you odds are one of the others will be more your speed.  Unlike a lot of it's contemporaries, F'N Rage doesn't bullshit around with shoehorned in RPG elements or obnoxious progression systems either.  You don't fill an XP meter to unlock that special or pour a few more points into your HP to make it past that boss, you just get better at the game.  \n\nYes, Fight'N Rage is difficult, almost ball-bustingly so.  Though it's rarely unfair, if you're willing to invest the time and effort into learning the stages and the way certain enemies work, you'll make it through.  If you're not, then you're probably about halfway through leaving a complaint in the community hub about how the difficulty needs to be nerfed.  If you're new, or unsure of your ability, however, have no fear, there IS an easy mode and a training dojo that will help you get to grips with some of the carachters' more complex moves.  However, it is worth noting that these modes are locked behind a virtual paywall within the game, I'm not sure what the logic was behind locking them away at the start, when hard mode is available right off the bat, but you will have to grind through a stage or two on normal difficulty before you can dip your toes into an easier puddle.  \n\nVisually, the game puts most indie titles to shame.  None of that 1 block pixel-art bullshit here, every enemy, protagonist, and big-bouncing titty is rendered in loving detail.  And depending on how old-school you want to go, you can make the game look like it's playing in a shitty arcade cabinet CRT, just like when your momma used to pawn you off in the local mall's arcade in the hopes some strange man would abduct and kill you so she wouldn't have to pay for your school supplies and macaroni no more.  Sadly, the screaming asian kid over at the DDR pad and the cigarette smoke are not graphical features included within this game, which is a shame, because then it'd be TRULY nostalgic.  \n\nThe music is great too, though I found it fading into the background of fights more often than not, it does an excellent job of complimenting the chaos on screen and there are some truly atmospheric tracks here and there that can set a more somber/sinister tone as the moment allows.\n\nIf you're one of those pansies who likes 'story' in their games, there really isn't much here.  Mutants are dicks and you're gonna punch them in the face, though it's worth noting that there are a plethora of routes and endings to unlock, complete with exclusive stages and cutscenes that shed a little more light on the plot.  As of this review I've only managed to snag a couple, but the variance is a nice touch and makes repeat playthroughs just a smidgen more interesting than they might be otherwise.  \n\nSo far, can't recommend it enough if your a fan of the genre or oldschool games in general.  If you're not experienced with this kind of game, however, and don't want to put the effort in to overcome the challenge it offers, then you might want to look elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1509260058, "timestamp_updated": 1509260058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36099068": {"recommendationid": "36099068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034081777", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511567560}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game yesterday and I already have twelve hours on my clock. it's one of the most satisfying brawler/beat 'em up games I've ever played. the only issue is that the amount of boob jiggle goes right past appealing and straight to comedic. but that's got nothing to do with the gameplay, which is fantastic. three buttons and the D-pad, that's all you need, but it is so goddamn deep. joystick felt a bit too lose for this game's mechanics, but I gotta say, I am not used to this kind of intensity on the d-pad. my left thumbnail hurts. the constant pressure is causing pain in my nailbed. on the other side of my thumb. but I can't stop playing, except for right now, which is fine because I have work in the morning.", "timestamp_created": 1509252467, "timestamp_updated": 1509252467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559907", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36096600": {"recommendationid": "36096600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111665713", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511707800}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really solid, espeically considering it was made by one guy (two if you count the guy who did the music), and I've had a lot more fun out of this than I've had in comparison to other side scrolling beat 'em ups.

[Overview positive and negative list at the bottom if you don't wanna read the review]\n\n90s kids... 16-bit generation video gamers of the Sega and Nintendo variety... have been missing out on a lot of button mashing action? Missing the blood pumping fist of fury, cracking suckers skull in with a metal pipe of the old days...? People... Fight'N Rage... IS YOUR CALLING!\n\nFight'N Rage is an action side scrolling beat'em up brawler that seems like a lost gem in the archives of Sega and Nintendo alike. Back before the days of online gaming... you had to invite a friend over [Couch co-op] to help you trash the likes of punks staking the mean streets in this game and I like it like that. (Lets get this out of the way first THERE IS NO ONLINE CO-OP! BUT THIS ISN'T A BAD THING!) This game take me back to those good'ol days of 16-bit gaming at its finest. It wasn't about me vs some player across the world in a STREET FIGHTER match... nope this was me against the evil computer characters and you felt more like a BAD DUDE ridding the STREET OF RAGE full evil on your own and it felt good. A single player optional co-op experience is hard to pull off nowadays, and with new twists and turns added for higher replay value is something you don't see much of in this genre of video gaming.\n\nNo spoilers about the story but lets talk about the presentation: lets just say it has a rave night club style in the menus, and comic book like flare in-game similar to a Sega Genesis game we played called Comic Zone. You can even make the screen look like an old fasion Cathode Ray Tube TV for old school effects! [That's the old heavy CRT TVs before the flat panel ones were out.] Yes I went on about the 16-bits... because the game has the old school style sprites in a 32-bit style fashion, you could say it has a PS1 sprite style upgrade. \n\nCharacters... quite a bit of them... and each with their own story, personality, attacks, moves and patterns, each new stage has new challenging enemies and bosses that you have to learn patterns in and out. The grunge like designs are things that feel like out of the 90s with post-apocalyptic movie like style... oh yea and there are anthropomorphic or furry characters in the game. Nice shout out to the furry community! \n\nAnd the music... man if this kicking soundtrack doesn't get your emotions up and blood pumping to 'Fight'N Rage' I don't know what will. \n\nGameplay is easy to pick up and play but hard to master with only 3 action buttons [Attack, Jump and Special] and each character plays differently Like Streets of Rage 1, 2 and 3, and Final Fight 1, 2 and 3 and is a welcome change from recent beat'em ups. But what makes only 3 buttons so special? Because all the characters have multiple attacks, moves and special attacks...[EVEN HIDDEN MOVES]... Oh and you can juggle enemies for crazy combos. Its like Alien vs Predator arcade's gameplay thrown into the mix to make this game something very special. And you can Overkill [Crushed as the game calls it] enemies for more points... so GO CRAZY ON COMBOS!\n\nNow I'm just gonna list a few game series [and some influences] that this game pays great tribute too:\nStreets of Rage - [characters, weapons, 3's Special attack meter and dash attacks, Bikers!]\nComic Zone - [art style, and story progression format]\nBad Dudes - [Evil Ninjas]\nFinal Fight - [characters, weapons, 3's CPU player characters and Super Meter]\nAlien vs Predator arcade - [Ram Rom check screen, air juggle system and timer countdown system]  \nDouble Dragon - [weapons, environmental hazards]\nStreet Fighter - [Characters and move sets]\nAnd I'm sure there are a lot more but... not gonna say everything...\n\nAnd what is gonna keep you; the player, coming back for more of the difficulty of repetitiveness? Why the many unlocks of course! As you play through the game... points are converted to coins [rather if you clear the game or lose all your lives in a single run] that you can buy characters [for other modes, not story mode], other modes, options and costumes! \n\nBut you are probably saying... \"That's it!?\" No! Want a tougher challenge? Use those coins to unlock harder diffculties give yourself an even harder challenge in story mode and unlock even more things. \n\n\"Harder challenge are you crazy!? What else does the game have?\" Well the big kicker to replay value in this game... In story mode... there are multiple paths, surprises at every corner and multiple endings... FOR EACH CHARACTER!! And group of characters... because this is a 1, 2 or 3 player game... [buy the special CPU-Player option if you are a lonely gamer and let the CPU team up with you as a character... like myself who only plays with online friends. Sad face...] \n\nLike I said, high replay values like unlockables for these kind of games are rather rare and without them make it harder for newcomers in this old genre of video games due to the repetitiveness of action in them to enjoy mulitple times, but here Fight'N Rage has made higher replay value fun and rewarding and has found a place in my gaming list that I will gladly play over and over again and with all of this extra content and you; the player, will probably put this on your list of games you'll probably play until the end of time! You'll probably still be figuring out sweet combo attacks by then. And with periodic updates from the designer, this game totally will be improved for the better overtime.\n\nSo here are overview positives & negatives [gotta be fair] for Fight'N Rage if you don't wanna read my lengthy review:\n\n+ Fast pace button mashing action\n+ Tricky enemy patterns to make you think a little [NOT A LOT] and environments\n+ A great juggling + combo system\n+ Items are everywhere even defeated enemies drop them\n+ Each character feels, plays and acts differently with many moves and attacks with a simple button set\n+ Furry character [+ sexy designs]\n+ The Rock hard music sets the tone of the game\n+  High replay values with MULTIPLE PATHS AND ENDINGS FOR EACH CHARACTER! And makes it feel rewarding with also UNLOCKABLES AND OPTIONS! Using points to convert into in-game currency to buy these hidden goodies\n+ A good thought out story that involves each of the main characters you play as\n+ Classic art design of the 90s video games.\n\n- No online multiplayer... aww...\n- newcomers may feel a bit cheated and overwhelmed with all this craziness and difficulty of action happening at once for the first few times playing.\n- Need to unlock easy mode first before you can use this mode.\n- And a quick save option is needed for those who can't sit for a whole hour or more to 1 credit clear the game.\n- Training mode needs to be re-adjusted with attack combos or add two enemies and remove or increase the timer for black belt promotion.\n- No 1up items only can get extra lives through high scoring.\n\nAnd final few pointers\nYou will need to be patient sometimes and take on a few enemies a time, you will fail quite a number of times [Especially if you charge right in and agro 7, 8 and 9 enemies on screen at once] and on continuing [losing all your lives] the game takes you back sometimes to the beginning of the stage as punishment.\n\nYou will need to learn your character's move sets, enemy move and attack patterns, save food items for when low on health, build up points for extra lives [50,000 points=1up is the only way to get extra lives] or face the consequences!\n\nSo\u00a0fingers, fists and feet do the talking with Fight'n Rage!", "timestamp_created": 1508348574, "timestamp_updated": 1508349035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589936", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35799516": {"recommendationid": "35799516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071172625", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508256659}, "language": "english", "review": "Fight'N Rage is a great game from start to finish. Everything you like from the good ol' days of beat'em ups is here, with a bunch of extras. Simple but hard to master.\n\nWhen you start the game you'll feel right at home if you've ever played any kind of brawler. It's easy for any new comer to just pick up and play this game. Though the game gets more difficult as you get closer to the end, but with infinit continues anyone can beat this game with a bit of persistence.\n\nThings to look forawrd too with this game are:\nLoads of unlockables from Vs. characters, colors, game modes...\nLots branching paths for extra replayablility...\nEnjoyably camios from all kinds of great games. From Guy from Final Fight, to Mai from King of Fighters.\nMusic, the music is great and compliments every level/area you get to explore.\nDid i mention this was made by One Person. This is amazing on his part.\n\nThe only thing i can see as a personal issue with this game, is the lack of online multiplayer. This may serve as a problem for most who can't call friends over for some great coop gameplay. But this game does include an AI alternative, i have yet too try out myself. sounds great but... you need to complete the game once for it too unlock and it costs about 1000$ to get it.\nIf i can set up and online game with a buddy, i'll link an explination after i try it out.\n\nBut in the end, I can fully recommend this game to anyone with the interest of a new beat'em up to play. Playing with 2 other buddys is some of the best times we had playing this great brawler. 9/10 (lack of online, only thing holding this game back) \n", "timestamp_created": 1508258332, "timestamp_updated": 1508258332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35773064": {"recommendationid": "35773064", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998629088", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512837634}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un gran juego que sabe mantener el encanto y el frenes\u00ed de su g\u00e9nero con muchos puntos fuertes como son:\n\n-Personajes Carism\u00e1ticos\n-Varias opciones de \"Rutas alternativas\" pudiendo desbloquear muchos finales\n-Numerosos extras \n-Idiomas en Espa\u00f1ol y en Ingl\u00e9s (para variar) xD\n-Un cuidado de los detalles tanto de los entornos como de PJS apreciables\n-Bastante Re-Jugabilidad pudiendo elegir incluso a PJS desbloqueables\n\nSI ERES UN GRAN FAN DE LOS BEAT EM UP DE LOS 80\u00b4S te aseguro que este gran JUEGAZO sabr\u00e1 hacerte pasar unas muy buenas tardes de acci\u00f3n y frenes\u00ed xD", "timestamp_created": 1508162679, "timestamp_updated": 1508162679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35767774": {"recommendationid": "35767774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427712494", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511031914}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5f80\u5e74\u306e\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u98a8\u5473\u306e\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3001\u3053\u306e\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30eb\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u3089\u6e80\u8db3\u5ea6\u306f\u9ad8\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u611f\u899a\u306f\u30ab\u30d7\u30b3\u30f3\u5f8c\u671f\u4f5c\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u8efd\u5feb\u3055\u3067\u305d\u3053\u304b\u3089\u3055\u3089\u306b\u56fa\u6709\u6280\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d3\u30cd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3001\u6d6e\u304b\u305b\u30b3\u30f3\u30dc\u7b49\u723d\u5feb\u611f\u3082\u5341\u5206\u3067\u3059\n\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u306f\u5341\u5206\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u4e00\u3064\u3060\u3051\u3069\u3046\u3057\u3066\u3082\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u70b9\u304c\u300c\u753b\u9762\u306e\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300d\u3067\u5f8c\u534a\u9762\u3067\u843d\u96f7\u6f14\u51fa\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u753b\u9762\u306e\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u304c\u304d\u3064\u304f\u3001\u5f8c\u534a\u9762\u306a\u306e\u3067\u6575\u3082\u5f37\u3044\u306e\u3067\u305d\u306e\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u306e\u4e2d\u7d50\u69cb\u9577\u3044\u9593\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u3064\u3089\u3044\u3001\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306b\u898b\u5f53\u305f\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u9078\u3079\u308b\u3068\u52a9\u304b\u308b\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3002\n\n\u3084\u308a\u8fbc\u307f\u8981\u7d20\u3082\u591a\u304f\u3001\u304b\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u6210\u9577\u8981\u7d20\u306f\u7121\u3044\u306e\u3067\u30b5\u30af\u3063\u3068\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u6240\u3082\u9577\u6240\u304b\u3068\n\u30a2\u30b1\u30b2\u30fc\u3092\u3084\u308a\u8fbc\u3093\u3067\u30ef\u30f3\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3092\u9811\u5f35\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u4eba\u306b\u306f\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d", "timestamp_created": 1508142692, "timestamp_updated": 1508142692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35766942": {"recommendationid": "35766942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034518813", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508993826}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Beat em up I've played in a really long time and I've played a lot.\n\nPros\n-Multiple Endings per character with different story paths\n-Challenging Enemies and Bosses (Also playable!)\n-Versus mode to play aginst the cpu or your friend\n-Combat system is fun with lots of creative freedom\n-Parry System similar to Street fighter 3rd strike\n-TONS of unlockables*\n-Multiple difficulties\n-Great Soundtrack\n\nCons\n-No Online multiplayer\n-Training Mode is unlocked after finishing the game once \n-One playthrough has to be done in 1 sitting.

This also means that it inherits the flaws that have been in this genre since the 90s. Enemies will stay off screen if they feel like it and also combo you to death when they sorround you. Your characters are balanced differently, but not for the best in most cases. The Bosses will get very cheap to the point of pure frustration. Then again it is the most precious of rewards to finally figure out their patterns and master the game. Once you have done that you can spend points on ingame unlockables (that is a rarity nowadays). The game is its most fun when you combo your way through normal and hard mode. My personal problem with the game is my ambition to beat it on hardest difficulty. Runs in this game take almost over an hour on this mode and the hardest sections are certainly the last two levels. \"Hardest\" might even be an understatement because you are clearly supposed to stock up on extends to this point. Once you have reached \"Death Island\" the smallest of mistakes will cost you everything you have worked for. Now you reach the final boss with one life remaining, whis he is able to shred away with is machine gun. I simply cant invest that much time in such long runs to fail on the last two screens of the game. The only solution would be a stage select to train easier, but I believe the developer is going to keep the game as is.\nSo in short I can reccomend this game to any beat em up fan.

game brings back memories of the old beat em ups, It feels pritty damn hard on the first try but when you grasp the parry system and knowing most enemies movements and use the super from the parry as it fully charges if it worked making a get outta my face doberman or a boss.\n\nThe game has a training mode which requires a few coins which are gained by points earned over you playing the arcade mode that gives a basic grasp of some moves to test then the start of arcades tutorial which is just a video then gets you into some chain combos in the advance to hardcore which are requiring a very fast reaction which i think they need to let you see the move combo first to understand how to execute or if it requires a wall.\n\nThe difficuly is there hard mode does get pritty punishing at the end stages as retrying at the boss puts you to the tower compared to normal which is just in the same room as the boss.\n\nThe multiplayer is local only at the time of this review there is a extra mode in shop that if unlocked to add AI partners with you that did show a big chunk of extra enemies thrown at you which i did lose sight of my character at a couple of point in the game.\n\nI would highly reccomend this for those who played beat them ups maybe some fighting games cause i get a street fighter third strike feel into it i blame the parry system.", "timestamp_created": 1507447478,

I'm impressed that one guy was able to do all of this (albeit over the course of years), and the love and care that went into making it shows.\n\n- The combat, for only three main buttons (attack, jump, special) is surprisingly deep.  Movesets aren't particularly expansive, I don't think, but finding new opportunities to extend your combos is a blast.  Walls will be your best friends in this regard.\n\n- The graphics are crisp and beautiful spritework at their finest.  Some characters, even among the players, are better animated than others for some reason or another, but they're all distinctive.

Roided-out, angular men, ugly mutant furries, dank alleyways, and HUGE bouncing breasts everywhere with the frequency of a sexploitation film... and I don't say that as a negative!

These two I didn't feel made the cut because of aggrivating stage design along with too many annoying enemies to fight. They both like to overwhelm the players with so many enemies that they fill the screen if you choose to play the games with 3 friends. Add to the fact that there isn't an icon showing where the players are, it's easy to lose yourself in the on-screen mob. You get a sense that the developers thought \"Hey, classic beat'em ups were coin eaters so our game should be just like that in terms of difficulty\". Meanwhile the really memorable ones like Final Fight 3 and Streets of Rage 2 had you on fair grounds with your enemies.The playable characters in those two games are way too samey as well. Little to nothing in terms of mechanics that separate the playable characters and just end up feeling like palette swaps.\n\nAll these problems I had with those games aren't present here. Fight'n Rage's developer seems to really understand what makes a great and fun beat'em up, something that's easily lost on others. You get 3 characters to use in the story mode and they feel very different from one another to play as. Each having their strengths and weaknesses in more aspects than something shallow like one being stronger and one being faster (ala Mother Russia Bleeds). They have unique combos and unique ways to perform combos as well as their own special attacks. \n\nIf you choose to play the game with 2 friends, the game won't try to just fill the screen with monsters in a futile attempt to balance the difficulty. There are a few more enemies but at a moderate degree so it's not unreasonable. The game compliments multiplayer as you can help each other extend combos which is incredibly satisfying as you're all making enemies explode into piles of bones.\n\nThe stage design is pretty to look at and very rarely incorporstes an annoying gimmick to insert a \"challenge\". 99 Vidas and MRB liked to do this a lot and those games suffered for it. Only one small sequence comes to mind that was bothersome, which was the bit on the raft. But it doesn't last very long so it didn't sour my enjoyment of the game. \n\nSomething I was exceedingly thankful for was that boss fights were done well. 99Vidas had terrible boss fights that forced you to fight them a specifically limiting way or you had to throw your extra lives at them because they have no hit-stun and attack frequently. MRB had gimmicky fights that also forced you to play in a limiting fashion. In Fight'n Rage you are welcome to combo the hell out the bosses and most allow you to grapple and throw them for added enjoyment.\n\nThe only criticism I and my friends have about the game is that you aren't able to use unlockable characters in story mode; they're only for use in the battle arena mode. We really wanted to go through the game as the Doberman, Muay Thai Birds, and the Bruce Lee monkeys. Hopefully an update will allow this to happen in the future. One other criticism is that there's no online play at the moment but I'm glad the developer spent the majority of his time making sure the core game was complete and well made first-and-foremost.\n\nThere are multiple endings in the game that depend on which path you take, which character you select, and which combination of characters are present during co-op.

You may be able to catch some of them with dashes, but I find it easier to just wait till they decide to stop.\n\nYour character will perform auto grab if it's close enough to the enemy, you will learn to hate this, because it will get you killed, it will make you lose out on damage. It's going to be one of the main reason you take damage in this game. Mostly because going into a grab stops you from being able to hit multiple enemy, and the only way out of it basically throws the enemy away from you dealing practically no damage.  Of course there is also enemy that can't be grab, when your character auto grabs those enemey anyways, causing them to knock you away with a brief stun.\n\nbeside those two gameplay problem, the game itself is pretty good.

For a one man shop, this game is absolutely amazing. One of the mechanically strongest arcade style beat-em-ups out there. \n\nBut I hate its guts for two simple reasons: It runs way too long and it's too damn draining to play. A clear demands at least an hour in a single sitting, no saves. And the game drags that out with endless enemy waves at the end that goes well beyond \"YES! A TEST OF MY SKILLS!\" and into \"Oh great not this bull$#!@ again!\"\n\nAnd Fight N Rage WANTS to kill you, too. The game is balanced to make completing a run successfully hard, even with infinite continues (That restart the zone and then the stage on higher difficulties.) So it's tough, which is good... usually... except here it's an hour long run and all the game has to do is knock you in the water or sneak one BS attack through a hitbox it should not have been able to penetrate and you can lose an incredibly rare life and sink your run 30 minutes later.\n\nI realize all of this is pronounced in damn near every other arcade beat-em-up, but the screws in FnR are tightened so tight that all of this comes to the front. So I end up hating a game that is mechanically and graphically outstanding in every way because I end up furious at the game every time I play it. SoRR has nearly the exact same pacing issues (As it should, FnR is a love letter to SoR2 in many ways.), but it gets around this with saves, with 8 difficulties, and you pretty quickly raise the funds for stage select so if your run bombs out you can just stage select to practice or cheat your way to see the end. FnR doesn't have any of this, sadly, and runs afoul of problems we were able to ignore in earlier beat-em-ups but can't here by being a more hardcore product.", "timestamp_created": 1506146314, "timestamp_updated": 1508482417, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538815", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35142872": {"recommendationid": "35142872", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972594101", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511288265}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a very pleasant surprise!  I decided to try it on a whim since I have not really played a good beat em' up since Castle Crashers and Dungeon Fighter.\n\nThis feels very good to play, hits have impact, there are zoom-in and explosion effects during big combos, and backgrounds and characters are quite colorful with smooth animation throughout.  To think this was made by only two people is really impressive.\n\nFighting has depth, with an excellent combo and parry system that is reminiscent of a 2D fighting game like Street Fighter (Which is referenced a few times throughout the game).  Good crowd control and use of your entire arsenal is needed, as the game is quite challenging.  I beat it on Normal but it took some effort.  There are many unlockables, branching paths, and endings, enough to keep you busy for quite a long time.\n\nOriginally, I was offput by 20 dollars for a beat em' up, but after playing it feel the cost is justified.  Highly recommended to all beat em' up fans.

Es posible avanzar solo machacando el bot\u00f3n de golpe, lo que es ideal para gente sin experiencia en este genero, pero el verdadero potencial del juego consiste en ir creando combos al combinar diferentes movimientos, por ejemplo, puedes correr y entrar con un rodillazo a tu enemigo, en el acto, enlazar con una secuencia de 3 combos para luego elevar a tu enemigo en el aire con una patada digna Guille y rematarlo en el aire con un movimiento especial.\nLa dificultad del juego no es f\u00e1cil y toma tiempo dominarlo para poder llegar al final, sin embargo en ning\u00fan momento se siente injusto, al contrario, el juego siempre te da una oportunidad de esquivar o bloquear.\nEl modo \u00e1rcade no solo nos presenta una historia, si no, que esta depender\u00e1 de nuestras decisiones y acciones, por ejemplo si salvas a la chica del primer nivel, se te abrir\u00e1 un camino nuevo y conocer\u00e1s un poco m\u00e1s de la historia de tu personaje, etc.\nMenci\u00f3n especial tiene el escenario donde vas atropellando mutantes con una moto, en plan Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (el beat en up de \u00e1rcade).\n\nPor si todo esto fuera poco, el juego incorpora un modo de lucha versus, donde podr\u00e1s competir con la CPU o contra un amigo y donde no estar\u00e1s limitado a los 3 personajes iniciales, si no, que podr\u00e1s ir desbloqueando y jugar con las unidades enemigas.\n\nEn un inicio, muchas opciones del juego estar\u00e1n bloqueadas y tendr\u00e1s que ir jugando para poder desbloquearlas, el sistema funciona de forma similar al remake de street of rage, donde cada vez que juegas te dan unas monedas seg\u00fan se el puntaje que consigues, con esas monedas desbloqueas diferentes trajes para tus h\u00e9roes, enemigos para el modo lucha, etc.\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n[/h1]\nUn beat em up cl\u00e1sico, solido, muy bien realizado, que toma prestadas varias referencias y mec\u00e1nicas a otros juegos similares y que lo logra mezclar todo de una forma genial.

Hopefully this will help you make the decision if this game is for you or not.\n\nFirst off, a little about me, because it's very important as to why I picked this game up after only becoming aware of it the day prior to it's release, and why I did so for the $20 price tag, which seemed to have generated a little negative buzz from people who thought $10 was a better price. I'm 31 years old. I was born the year Super Mario Bros. was released, and I grew up with classic 80s leftovers and early 90s 2D pixel hits. I remember playing Final Fight 2 and especially Final Fight 3 on my SNES, and playing Streets of Rage 2 on the Genesis that belonged to the kid across the street. \n\nTwo days prior to my writing this review, I was randomly searching upcoming titles, just to see if there were any gems that weren't given much hype. This game popped up. I looked at the graphics, I looked at the gameplay and I watched a little video on it, and immediately placed it on my wishlist. Why? Because this game looked like it was an homage, or the torch bearer of these old pixelated beat em up classics. So when the game dropped for $20, I bought it - without hesitation - as soon as Steam sent me the alert. And you know what? I was exactly right about this game. \n\nFrom the introduction, I knew this would be a love letter to games I played in my youth. The game opens with the filter set to imitate a tube television already on (scanlines included), and you're treated to some \"technical text\" overlaying a black background. Anyone who waited for the local arcade to turn on the machines in the morning will recognize this instantly as the old arcade startup screen, specifically the one used in Capcom games. \n\nFrom that point on, you are treated to a game that has so many homage or inside joke references to older beat em up and fighting games of this era that you can't help but feel the nostalgia dripping off the screen - provided, of course, that you ARE nostalgic for that period of gaming. There are honestly so many \"old school references\" that I can't remember them all to put down. Firstly, the name of the game - \"Fight'N Rage.\" While not confirmed, it wouldn't surprise me if the developer deliberately crunched the titles Streets of Rage and Final Fight together to come up with this one. The primary character, Gal, has a name that is deliberately a nod toward Guy from Final Fight. Gal's walk animation is nearly identical to the stiff walk that both Guy and SOR's Axel have. Your first boss is an enemy dressed like M. Bison from Street Fighter, who also happens to have the iconic slide move Bison has retained all these years, and his animation frame while doing it identically copies Bison's frame from Street Fighter II. The list goes on and on, and it's best not to spoil everything here. It's strongly recommended you save any other old school references for your playthrough of the game.\n\nSo while this game IS in many ways a torch bearer for the old beat em ups, it does have it's own improvements over these older games. Obviously, controls are far superior, as are the animations of the characters. As with the old beat em ups, your character has a special move (multiple ones, actually), and like the older games of this genre, performing it will decrease some of your health. These moves have always been crowd clearers and escape effort attacks, and beings as they are stronger than standard attacks, the loss of health is justified, lest everyone just mash the attack through the whole game without penalty (Axel's \"Bare Knuckle\" in SOR2 is a good example of this). However, Fight'N Rage offers a decent balance - your character has an additional meter that fills up automatically over time. Once this meter is filled, your special attack is consequence-free. You will not lose health by performing it. Important to note, this meter is NOT a slow meter. It doesn't fill up exceptionally fast, nor is it a slow turtle. It's got a really good balance that means you'll see specials often in a level, but not so much that enemies can't touch you. This whole setup is great, as performing these specials not only help in garnering some breathing room or taking down enemies, but also in \"destroying\" an enemy, netting you additional points as their body explodes into bones. Points are crucial, as you gain a life for every X amount of points.\n\nThat is not uncommon in beat em ups, but the points are more crucial with this game, as it does tend to be on the harder side, and lives do not come easily. The difficulty is something that has garnered criticism for this game. Yes, it is difficult, but when you consider just how closely this is linked to the old beat em ups of yesteryear, it shouldn't be much of a surprise. This game is built like an arcade game set to free play. It's not the easiest walk in the park, and the game doesn't hold your hand for long. Still, I don't think it's the hardest thing out there. In truthfulness, I have yet to beat the game, but I have reached the final boss, and simply lost because of a numbers game with near zero life. Thing is, I KNOW where my dilemma is - it lies with a certain fight right before the final room - and so I know that I have to learn how to counter this enemy in order to save health for the finale. I don't in any way feel stuck, and know it won't be long before I DO beat the final boss. (To give you an idea, my first playthrough only lasted through the first stage of the second level, and in my death, I barely racked up enough points to hit 70 coins [more on coins in a moment]. 3 playthroughs later and I can get to the final stage on the same \"quarter\" I started with)\n\nDespite the difficulty, this game is incredibly accessible. It has enough to it to learn the game and get the gist of it quickly without feeling overwhelmed. I will give an example: as much as I love River City Ransom, and the modernized sequel available on Steam, these games can be far less accessible. RCR has a number of RPG elements to it, and don't me wrong - that's fine; I love River City Ransom - but this means to start out, these games require more effort into getting acustom to everything. River City Ransom: Underground is even moreso like this. Again, that's not to say the game isn't good - it IS a lot of fun, from what I've played of it - but this is the reason why, despite have RCR:U for months now, I've already invested more time in Fight'N Rage. It's ease of gameplay is reminiscent to Streets of Rage, Final Fight, Double Dragon, etc., and it makes this game a classic \"pick up and play.\" For someone like myself, sporting a 9 to 5 office job and a family to boot, I don't have as much time to play games, so I'm going to gravitate toward something I can get right into.\n\nThe game features in-game currency, which you receive by automatically trading in your points every time you die or beat the game. There is a lot to unlock here, including enemies that can be used in a versus battle mode, and alternate costumes [primarily color designs] for the three main characters. I think this certainly increases the replayability of the title.\n\nThere are 7 or 8 stages to this game, depending on the various paths you take (multiple paths, another plus), and I would say the length of a playthrough is about the same, maybe a little longer than the old school beat em ups. In other words, this is a game beatable in one sitting that won't make you feel like your entire day is gone afterward, which is important considering there's no sort of \"save now, play later\" feature.\n\nFinal note, Gal and practically all the women in this game are nice eye candy, even if they are sprites, meaning this game gives you cheesecake to factor in as well, if that rocks your boat. \n\nOverall, if you like 90s nostalgia and a game that sits on the more challenging side, PICK THIS UP.

As soon as you boot it, you're taken to a different time in gaming history -- in the good way -- and put into the mood to put your boot to the opposition.\n\nGood thing, then, that the gameplay that follows is satisfying, challenging, and delightfully brutal, and while the characters' movesets are a bit simple, if still more robust than most such games, the ability to string damn near any attack into another onto a reeling enemy provides an additional layer of skill, incentivizing you to use your toolset to produce spectacular results. Even with the assortment of palette-swapped enemies typical of this genre coming at you in waves, you're constantly trying to maintain impressive juggles with your hapless opponents and keep your combo count up, offsetting potential monotony and giving way instead to white-knuckle, palm-sweating excitement. Timing windows to combo your attacks feel good, and there are several opportunities to cancel and reset your combos mid-way, a la fighting games -- try dashing or jumping in the middle of a combo once you've stunned or lifted your enemy off the ground, and chasing after flying or wall-bounced enemies! -- allowing you to pile on major damage. The touchy commands themselves can cause some occasional accidental chaos, but it generally doesn't cost you too badly, and sometimes even amusingly works in your favor.\n\nThe visuals are also up to speed, with expressive, animated characters and lively backgrounds perfectly framing your path of destruction, itself punctuated with great feedback as you lay waste to the opposition. The style well imitates the times it draws from, but also has lots of polish to bring the game to life in a way that wasn't possible back then. The music is solid and appropriate, if not particularly memorable, and the sound effects are great, with your most vicious hits providing an equally glorious earful. The female characters are a little over-the-top with the thrashing breasts, and thongs apparently being the only lower-body wear in the universe, but it's in good fun, so whatever. There are also several cases of sprites that are outright lifted and adapted from other games, but you won't care about the cut corners too much once the action gets properly underway -- assuming you even noticed them in the first place.\n\nAnother thing the game remembered from the days of yore was the difficulty, and the game definitely provides a meaty challenge that requires you to adapt to your opponents and find openings to safely deliver punishment; even as a veteran of the genre, and a quick study of game mechanics, I met an inglorious end and my first Continue screen midway through the fifth stage of Normal difficulty. But for the more ham-fisted or simply less experienced among us that may struggle sooner and find themselves frustrated, consider taking a breath and adapting to the game before asking that it adapt to you; any enemies in the air or currently hit-stunned is an opportunity to continue your combo, and you can maintain or finish them with your SP gauge, not to mention use it to get yourself out of trouble, so remember to use the tools available to you; they're no good to you if you don't utilize them. Also remember to hit the Extras menu and buy the training mode to get an idea of what you can do with the game's engine; it'll give you some bread and butter combos, as well as some ideas to come up with your own, although I would argue it should've just been available in the first place.\n\nSpeaking of the extras menu, it also contains a suite of other unlockable content and small customization elements, bringing to mind the shop of the fan-made Streets of Rage Remake, and like that shop, more play means more currency to find out what else the game has tucked away, which is additional incentive to dole out some more knuckle sandwiches.\n\nOn the whole, Fight'N Rage is an example of a game that knows what was great about an era of video games, but also knows what needed refinement, and it delivers both to great effect, largely succeeding in its bold mission statements. There are a couple of snags -- flying enemies are as annoying as you remembered them in Streets of Rage, for instance -- but overall the presentation is great, the action is thrilling, and the challenge is fair... mostly. This is a modern classic that doesn't just hang with the best of a bygone era -- it surpasses many of them.

You'll collect coins and unlock all kinds of stuff. Music is all right too, personally I didn't find it to be that memorable, but maybe that's just because I don't listen that much metal. Most of the time the game has a great \"game feel\", you really feel the power of those attacks. As far as I understand, the entire game was made by one person (not counting the music), so the work is very impressive and clearly a lot of effort went into making this game.\n\nThere's just one thing that I don't agree with. The game goes for that arcade experience and you can't save the game between levels. You have to beat the entire game in one sitting, and I am not a huge fan of that. The game is quite short, but I could imagine it can still be too long for some people to finish in one session. The game is very much fast non-stop action and it may get a little exhausting to play it all at once. And I haven't even mentioned that the game throws huge amounts of enemies at you as you make progress, and it won't be easy for those playing in single player mode (in normal mode, at least). I haven't played in multiplayer, but at least I'd think this problem isn't that bad when playing with a friend or two.\n\nI can understand that this is how it was in other retro arcade games back in the day, but I don't see how having the option to save would hurt the game. After all, the game already has infinite continues, so it's not like saving would make finishing the game any easier. The only problem might be that save scumming could be used to cheat and get more coins than you should, but even that could be easily fixed by having it so that saving always resets your score to zero. Naturally this save feature would be completely optional and purists could disable it. Well, this all is just a suggestion. I'm just saying that the lack of saving effectively prevents Fight N' Rage from being a pick up and play -kinda game for shorter sessions. (if you don't wanna play the first levels again, that is)\n\nThat aside, there's a pretty good training mode that will help you to learn the moves and combos. Every character plays differently and it's fun to learn them. Weirdly enough, you start with normal and hard difficulty modes, but easy mode is something you have to unlock by collectiong coins (maybe this was done to encourage people to not play on easy so that their skills would improve more?). I very much recommend all new players to unlock the easy mode as soon as possible and then finish the game once with it, and then try the other difficulty modes after you get better.\n\nStill, very much recommended for all fans of the genre, I've had a lot of fun with this game.\n\n+ Fun gameplay and \"game feel\"\n+ Responsive controls\n+ Three main characters play differently\n+ Great pixel art visuals\n+ Different routes and endings that give it more replay value\n+ Generally it's a well polished game\n- No saving between levels, requires you to finish it in one session\n- Some unlocks require you to finish the game in harder difficulties, that may be really hard for some players\n- I would have liked to see just a few more special moves per character, or even more playable story characters (to be honest this may be unreasonable, as this game must have already been a lot of work for one developer)", "timestamp_created": 1505930377, "timestamp_updated": 1506020476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35088947": {"recommendationid": "35088947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085941437", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512350565}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] To the developer: Support those with average gamer skill, please. [/h1]\n\nFirst of all, let me list the awesome parts of this game.\n\n+ Great soundtrack - needs to be buyable via DLC\n+ Humor - the bones flying everywhere when an enemy is overkilled is one example\n+ Deep battle system - purchase the training mode to get a feel for this\n+ Creativity in character design - chickens that use Muay Thai and a fat cat in a samurai gi, for example\n+ The idea of unlockables - more games need to do this\n+ The idea of an easy mode - a stride in the direction of supporting those with average gamer skill\n+ The idea of SP is great. It allows the player to be able to use a special move (with a cool-down timer) without sacrificing health.\n\n+ Fighting technique options for the gifted gamer - this is a great idea for those gamers that can actually make use of those said options. I just read a tip in the extras section that said that parrying restores SP. That is a GREAT thing for gifted gamers.\n\n+ Fighting technique options that increase score - this is a great idea for those gamers that can actually make use of those said options. One example is the up-down attack that F. Norris and Gal can do. Gifted gamers can use that attack to \"crush\" enemies and increase their score.\n\n+ Multiple game paths are a great idea for increasing replayability. One example is going left to \"escape\" at the beginning of the first level. That provides a different experience than those that charge full steam ahead.\n\n\nSecond of all, let me list the parts of the game that need work.\n\n- Easy mode should really \"make you feel like a boss\" as opposed to barely making the game playable for those with average gamer skill. One simple way of helping that along would be to provide more food in Easy mode.\n\n- Unlockables need to be unlockable for people of average gamer skill. For example, Gal's outfits should be unlockable by everyone. I have only been able to unlock one outfit for Gal, and if I select the other oufits, [b] ALL OTHER OUTFITS will be forever outside of my reach without a cheat tool such as a trainer. [/b] How about making the outfits so that X number of hours played with the character would open up extra outfits instead of game objectives that belong in Steam Achievements (such as beating the game in normal mode, hard mode, or score attack mode with an S)? If gamers can do that stuff, great. But average gamers should not be penalized with something as important as unlockables. Or, you know what, penalize us. Make it so that we have to spend 5000 coins for the outfits instead of 500 or 1000. [b] BUT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO GET THE OUTFITS! [/b]\n\n- Unlockable characters should be available for a normal play-through of the game (even if gamers can't earn coins while playing as enemy mobs). For example, I unlocked the whip girl, but the only thing I can do with her is fight her in the practice mode. Really? I used 500 coins for playing with a character in practice mode?\n\n- Gamers need to be able to adjust the number of lives given to them at the start (even if doing so disables achievements).\n\n- GET RID OF THE <expletive> DOBERMANS and the other mobs that abuse invulnerability frames! They have no business being in the game...particularly when the enemy can abuse invulnerability frames WITHOUT sacrificing SP or health. This would be a different story if SP regenerated MUCH FASTER on Easy mode.\n\n- The Raven boss (the bat boss) is beatable, but it requires a drastic change in fight style from what I use everywhere else in the game. Since I couldn't practice with the boss in practice mode without beating him X times, I had to find out how to beat him from other gamers. Here is what I have learned.\n[spoiler] First, use Gal's lightning stomp whenever you have it. Second, stay on the raft. The boss does chip damage while getting knocked off the raft is a major problem. Third, be patient and use very standard jumping attacks. Conservative play makes this battle possible. Fourthly, some say stay in the middle of the raft and others say stand on one end of the raft. Try both to see what works for you. But pick one. [/spoiler]\n\n- Training mode needs to include a demonstration of the things that actually need to be done. The timing of some of the combos is not intuitive. If the gamer can see the combos being performed, then the gamer has an idea of what is expected.\n\n- Either disable the area timer or provide a way for average gamers to increase their SP in boss fights...particularly in Easy mode. Bosses like to abuse invulnerability frames. The best counter to that is SP attacks which counter most invulnerability moves. The problem is that bosses can use invulnerability attacks 3-5 times more than players can. That is only a problem for patient gamers due to the problem of the area timer that prevents players from walking around until their SP meter is full.\n\n- Multiple game paths is a good idea when all paths have similar benefit. As the game stands, the multiple game paths is a tool only for unlocking characters you can use in practice mode. Once players learn about the \"escape\" and \"bike\" path ( [spoiler] by NOT joining the search in the refugee camp [/spoiler] ), players will ONLY use that path once they learn how many more points they can earn, which then leads to more extra life awards.\n\n- What about parrying? I continue to read forum posts where people ask for changes to the game's parrying system. Some people want a bit of wiggle room. Other people want a separate button programmable for parrying. And if parrying is the developer's solution to the bat boss and to the dobermans, then the developer should think about the suggestions provided for parrying. As things currently stand, the timing required for parrying is just brutal. And the fact that the d-pad must serve as both the parrying mechanism and the movement mechanism doesn't help matters.\n\n\n[b] Please, developer, do not let this game stand as is. This game has far too many REALLY GOOD points. I want to be able to log 100 hours on this game. [/b] Thank you.\n\n\nHere's one more thought. If a gamer buys the Sega Genesis Streets of Rage games on Steam, they can also download mods. Kind modders made it so that average gamers can play Streets of Rage 3 with 99 lives if they choose to do so. And they did that for free. I would actually PAY to get a game mode I can enjoy of this game, since on so many levels it is better than the old arcade brawlers.", "timestamp_created": 1505929593, "timestamp_updated": 1506098384, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.367242", "comment_count": "26", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35088098": {"recommendationid": "35088098", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996797986", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511010227}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, this game has a fantastic soundtrack, if you're a long time fan of the Guilty Gear series you'll feel right at home from the first note. \n\nA quick note before delving into the visuals, if you don't like the CRT mode you can turn it off in the settings, though I loved it, it can be a little distracting at times.\nThe visual design of this game from what I've seen of it so far is superb. The stage tiles are given life by a healthy mix of colors with good shading techniques, detailed background and foregrounds (The foregrounds are just on screen enough to give detail, but not enough to block the screen. I love it.) with animated effects such as raging fires, or down pouring rain with ripple effects, that all come together without making it difficult to navigate the screen.\n\nEnemy and character design follows suit, I've yet to ever lose myself or the enemy on the screen, even when there's a ton of stuff going on. On that note, lets talk about gameplay.\n\nThe game will give you a short, brief little tutorial on the controls at your disposal, how to walk, inputting a directional button twice for a dash or a dodge, and your jump, attack, and super button. As you progress through the stages you'll beat up some dudes and earn points that'll turn into coins you can spend on new characters, costumes, and other cool stuffs.\n\nReal quick note, first thing I strongly advise anyone gets it's the training mode. There's some hidden depth behind all of the characters movesets and this will take you through them all (as far as I know thusfar)\nThe game is challenging without feeling entirely unfair (though it looks like Ricardo has a tougher time on his own given that he doesn't have a dash/dodge) by yourself, and is a blast with a friend or two. \n\nGetting through to the end will take practice, this isn't just a smash attack to win styled beat 'em up.  learning how the various enemies and their AI's function, and most importantly who to prioritize when, and how you can string your combo's together in combination with dashes/dodges, jumps and kicks to avoid damage. (You can jump again when ever your character is above an enemy sprite! There is no limit far as I can tell on how many times you can do this.) \n\nBig thing to note, you have a decent amount of delay time you can make use of between each attack, sometimes hitting one guy as fast and hard as possible isn't the best play at your disposal, but rather drawing a hit string out so that you can get the really dangerous guys into the combo, worst comes to worst, dodge, or super out of it if things look iffy.\n\nThe various different paths are a nice touch I feel, some good examples that come to mind, in one of the stages (on a diversion from the standard path already) you have the choice to either escape upwards down a path, or to continue on facing a seemingly endless horde of enemies. Or, in the first stage, you can flee the burning town to the left just like the rest of the townsfolk are doing. And the final example, for saving a hostages life, before the boss can do them in.\n\nNow, real quickly. I'd like to go over some stuff that would be nice quality of life improvements. If you could map a button to be a context action for dash/dodge, so for example, I use a playstation controller. X is super, O is jump, Triangle is attack, I'd love it if I could map it so that I could press, or hold square, and tap any directional button to trigger it's respective dash or dodge. Just something that would take some pain off my left hand and make the gameplay feel a little less frantic.\n\nSecond thing that would be nice, and might already be in the game, I don't know. (as of yet, I have not beaten the game on normal, just so you know.) It'd be awesome if there was a way to see a roadmap of the stages you've seen, and the possible exits within them, and how many of them you've seen.\nAgain, these aren't stuff that are needed, just feel like it would improve the game a little.\n\nAll in all, I put this right up there with Double Dragon Neon for one of my favorite beat 'em up games and hope to see more from SebaGames! Please keep up the fantastic work!\n\nEdit: Stage 8 is made of nightmares and hopelessness. my hands know only pain. But I won't let this beat me. may want to throw in just one more food drop at some point in that stage, also might want to include a save at level start/check point feature for those of us with hand issues, so we can take a break and come back later when the pain has died down.\nA boss with super armor, in a tiny room, surrounded by mooks, that he wont hit, might not be the best idea.\nof the main three cast, Gal feels to be the weakest of the three with few ways to deal with enemies with super armor, she can't throw the larger enemies (which, is fair. she's the smallest, least muscular of the three.) but she I can't help but feel she needs something that'll let her break through armored enemies.

Quick test makes me think that I fell once again for the obvious trap of \"looks better than it tastes\" problem. I'm not saying it's a bad game but it's my first feeling for the moment. As a final fight and combatribe like maybe tastes good but for one who enjoys the musics of a street of rage also with the hidden mania mode of a street of rage 2... I don't know, I feel a lack of satisfaction without considering SOR games perfect neither the fun remakes that are possible to find around. Definitly has some cool mechanics and very good freedom of move with the run and up or down little dash jumps but the juggles and move panel feels a little limited and makes me think it could have been a bit more satisfying.\nFrom this point I'm changing my review after a longer time playing this game. It's not bad at all as a beat them up. I haven't beaten the most advanced training mode yet. The arcade playthrough is getting challenging in harder mode by more penalising checkpoints which forces the player to play real good without ever finding extra life items but only earning them by scoring every 50k. I enjoy this game more now that I know it better and there is a funny pacifier item to purchase with the game currency for those who won't get into max completion.\nOf course the storyline cannot be taken seriously but the fact some efforts have been made to make it funny and buttered with pretty rocking soundtrack is a good point. Also it interstingly adds the managing of parrying in two different ways which are simultaneous counter attack costing a bit of health and defensive parry SF3 like.

Better yet, he managed to wrangle a surprising amount of depth out of it without having to resort to a \"lane\" system, or requiring you to press a button to toggle which direction you're looking, like some other games in the genre have leaned on in order to shoehorn more fighting-game-style inputs in.\n\nThe presentation is top notch. From the moment you launch it, the CRT filter and arcade cabinet overlay make it clear exactly what kind of game you're getting in to. The musician that was hired gets his own intro, and it's off to the games title screen proper, and you're greeted by the games logo as a tune practically plucked straight out of Guilty Gear blares in the background. Pressing start brings up a neat menu, making it immediately obvious that this game has plenty of secrets to unearth.\n\nMy first foray into the game was by myself, and the pre-game tutorial (which is very arcade appropriate, by the way) tells you just enough to get you going. In the path that I decided to take, new enemy types were slowly introduced, usually by themselves or in pairs, to give you time to figure out how to defeat them. Once you've had some time to practice against them, they start coming in greater numbers, or combined with other enemy types, to create a mental challenge that demands you keep track of all of them. They all telegraph their attacks, but it's up to you to make sure that you can either get out of the way, or throw something into them before they connect with you.\n\nThe game is quite challenging, even on Normal. I found myself falling into button-mashing habits very early on, and got a game over on stage 2. Determined not to credit feed this game, I let the timer run out and gave it another go from stage 1. Everything I'd learned up to that gameover point, and a new-found level of caution got me up to the 6th stage before running out of Steam again. It wasn't until I parked my wife next to me and we played together that we were able to defeat the final boss, using a single continue. After seeing one ending, the game unlocks a new menu item that shows you exactly how much \"progress\" you've made. I won't spoil it for you here, but suffice to say, the game has plenty of replayability.\n\nSince this game is rooted deeply in the days of old, where you buy a game and you own it, and extras are something you unlock and not just fork money over for, there's plenty for you to unlock. Alternate costumes, new colors for any costumes you already have, new playable characters, new modes, and more. Scoring points in Arcade mode and beating the game or getting a game over converts those points into coins, a currency used to unlock things in the extras shop. With the rate that you earn coins, and the number of branching paths available to you, there's plenty of incentive to play the game again and again, including higher difficulty modes that present more of a challenge as you gradually figure out the combo system and how to deal with the enemies. \n\nIf I have any major gripes, it's the absence of online play, and lack of a manual. Only being able to share this experience with local friends is not entirely out of place for the 90s arcade atmosphere the game is promoting very thoroughly, but as a modern title, it's moderately disappointing that I can't share it with my online friends too. I'd also have liked to have some sort of documentation that explains how to pull off the extra moves and combos that, occasionally, I'd pull off entirely by accident. Perhaps this is revealed to you later with the \"tips\" system available in the Extras shop? Still, after having played through once and having familiarized myself with the controls and how to effectively use the one \"combo\" they teach you, I wanted to know more, and was prepared to read for it. Perhaps they're taught to you in the training mode, which is something else you can buy in the Extras shop...but I'm not yet certain, as I haven't bought that extra yet.\n\nThe controls are tight, the overall presentation package is superb, and the length of the game is just about right to casually whip this game out in front of a friend, sibling, or partner and force them to play it with you. Some may protest the price tag, but I think it's a silly notion to expect a game with this much content on offer to be any cheaper than it is.

Beat 'em up games always held a place in my heart though as one of my favorite genres.\n\nIt's a simple, yet solid arcade beat 'em with great pixel art and rocking music. If you ever enjoyed a beat 'em up like Streets of Rage, Final Fight, or Captain Commando, you'll feel right at home with this one. The story is simplistic, but has a surprising amount of depth to it, and won't interfere with the massive thrashing about.\n\nThe spritework is amazing and fluid, with quite a bit of bounce (really, take a look at any of the girls) to the action. The game also has options to emulate old CRT TVs or monitors, in case you wanted that really old feel, but no matter which options you pick, the game looks fantastic.\n\nThe game is simple, with three major buttons (attack, special attack, and jump). Like a lot of arcade games, it's got hidden commands to do some fancier moves, and it helps raise the excitement. Like many old school beat 'em ups, there's also multiple endings depending on which paths you take.\n\nAlso, if you're like me, you get a strangely powerful feeling of catharsis when you kick a furry in the face so hard that they explode into bones. If you like beating up furries and looking at bouncy babes, then this game is for you.\n\nThis has been a Robot Maid review.\nThank you for reading, and I hope to see you again.", "timestamp_created": 1505884220, "timestamp_updated": 1505884220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486520", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35077783": {"recommendationid": "35077783", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980971736", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506888253}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprising amount of depth to this little 2d fighter! In just a few hours of gameplay I have discovered how to parry, special input attacks, combo strings, mix-ups, and combo-string mixups that turn into juggles. Wall juggling is very entertaining, and if you build a super before you launch into one of these, you can pretty much one-shot any bad guy. Do enough overkill damage and they'll explode into blood and bones! This is the side-scroller you played in the 90s, but without the limitations from 90s hardware. Often times there are darn near 20 enemies on screen and the well optimized game handles it all like a champ. \n\nIf you were a fan of Streets of Rage, Final Fight, or even Street Fighter you are in for a surprise. There are nods to these great games and probably more packed into every level. You see where bosses draw inspiration from your favorite characters when their movesets come out. One boss is based off of Zangief from Street Fighter, in a level that appears to be based off of Vega's level. But there's plenty of unique enemy types to the game as well. I particularly enjoyed the flies armed with boxing gloves.\n\nWhat else does this game have besides great combat and great level design? It has a fantastically scored musical track to carry you through your journey. Speaking of your journey, while you're on it you will be collecting in game currency to unlock TONS of extra goodies. It looks like you can unlock the entire roster of enemy fighters for the 1v1 battle mode. Want to use that Zangief-like character to smash your friend with command grabs? Unlock him and use him! This game has no micro-transactions, so all of your unlocks will come via rewards for playing.\n\nIn an era of cookie-cutter triple A games that have stagnated our market, Fight'N Rage is both a breath of fresh air and a fantastic dopamine-induced Nostalgia trip.

It is wonderful to play your standard reinnovated beat em up with very creative characters, bosses, stages and badass music. However, with all of these game modes/content, one must still feel as if something was still missing. For starters, I wish there was a more in depth story mode so we can all be introduced to who each character is. A montage if you will. I would definitely love to see a comic series and a link to the ost as well. There are a lack of beat em ups out there and I am always delighted to try one out. There is just tons and tons of hours of content to play around with but I would have loved to unlock new moves and have a simple punch/kick button where we can create our own combos. Please consider that when you decide to make a sequel or update this game. I was also baffled as to why there was no Xbox One, Nintendo Switch nor PS4 ports. I guess that will all come in due time. Anyway, despite following similar patterns to other beat em ups, I do see a lot of hard work/potential in this one. It offers challenge, it is a blast to play and further more, it has UNLOCKABLE content! Although I wish that the super move, did not drain your health, because it needs its own meter bar.

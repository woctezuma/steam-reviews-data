The developer has referred to it as a \"mini opera\", which is quite accurate seeing as the musical track is modern opera meets rock, somewhere in the vein of Nightwish or Within Temptation. The journey tells a story of a soul, your soul, as it transitions in to the afterlife, seemingly through the River Styx from Greek mythology.\n\nThis release seems to be made out of all low-quality, prerendered graphics that play out in one large cutscene; think Final Fantasy 7, 8, and 9 cutscenes from the original Playstation era. However, among these landscapes are humans that have been captured in FMV sequences and placed in to the renders, somewhat akin to the early Mortal Kombat titles. Due to the low quallity nature of the title, Senza Peso does have quite a blurry aspect to it that somewhat hinders the overall experience.\n\nThat being said, Senza Peso is one of the better free short films available. The entire experience is very dream-like, and there's not much else like it on Steam at the moment. However, the game does like to stay active in the background, thus my inaccurate 1.6 hours on record, so once you close it down make sure that it's off; otherwise your friends may think you enjoyed this a little too much. It's worth the download if you're looking for something short and different to watch while deciding what to play next.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]3.0/5.0[/b] - Average, can take it or leave it.[/h1]\nThe

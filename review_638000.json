Honestly when I bought it, I hadn't paid attention.  The quality and fun this game provides feels like a finished product that I'm already delighted to own.  While you only build the one thing (ski lifts) the challenging physics and local terrain make every build a work of ingenuity that feels oh so satisfying to finally complete.  And with the Steam Workshop allowing for community-made maps, I'll likely never run out of content for the life of the game!\n\nOne of the things I personally adore is the fact that there are no requirements to advance other than to complete the level.  There are medals in the game to encourage you to do certain things (like build under budget), but the game never forces you to work for them or tries to gate later content behind having enough of them.  Don't want to care about the budget?  Spend to your hearts' content.  Feel like the extra challenge is worth it?  Then you can try to get number 1 on the leaderboards!  It allows everyone to go at their own pace and their own challenge level.\n\nVery relaxing, tons of fun, and failure is part of the hilarity.

Every finish is super satisfying. You don't dread starting the simulation because you are able to predict what's going to happen. Because it's built around ski lifts each level is completely different, it's not just about building a tower on every level. There's even different kinds of levels that challenge different thing such as a drag level where the idea is to keep the towline close to the ground or a normal ski level where you have to make a jump. There are near infinite ways to tackle many of the levels and much of the fun comes from finding a new way of building. \n\nAs for the visuals, they're fantastic. The models are clean low-poly that really shine from the lighting. It's a fantastic art style.\n\n\nI should note that I experienced one bug where I couldn't place any structural elements. I reset the game and it was solved and I haven't had any problems with the game since. For 7 hours in an early access game that's really good. \n\nSo yeah, if your thinking of buying the game I would say pick it up. The community is small right now but that's actually a good thing because you have a chance of making the leaderboard on every level. (I'm number 1 on drag queen.) With workshop connection and more development I don't think you could get tired of the game.

The price really attracted me to buy this game and I wondered if it was a case of \"you get what you pay for\". In this instance I can say I got a lot of bang for my buck. The tutorial helped me to understand the slight differences in controls to other games of this type but they are very user friendly and after a few minutes I managed to get to grips with all the hotkey solutions as well.\n\nThe learning curve is not too slow so each level offers a new challenge and as you progress the challenge continues to grow as well (3 hours can easily feel like 10 minutes with this one!)\n\nI complete each level and try to earn every medal and collect the stars. Possibly the most fun part is afer that when I'm trying to top the leader board by getting the skiers across the level with the least expensive construction (where the fate of the skiers is usually death). Crashing and burning, what's not to love!\n\nI was very pleasently surprised when I found there was an element of this game with ski jumps/ramps and going down the mountains as well. I am confident that the developers are all keen riders themselves as they use button/drag lifts, gondolas and a really cool feature is the piste map in between levels, that way you are always immersed in the mountains.\n\nI wanted to leave a review because I have seen youtube videos that have told me this is the developers first game and I think they've done a fantastic job considering this is early release, I'm sure others will agree it is a great package and I am excited to see what more will come it has so much potential for new features.\n\nI spent a few miuntes in the sandbox mode and I think it will really keep me coming back time and time again. I am a big fan of the feature, it feels like the dev's have told us \"These are our puzzles, can you do any better?\" It is super easy to shape the mountains and valleys yourself and the pre-designed levels have given me some good inspiration of the different challenges you can try and create.\n\nOverall, very pleased with the purchase, the game could be twice the price and it wouldn't feel unreasonable at all.\n\nI would happily reccommend to anyone that likes a construction/physics/puzzle game.\n\nSee you on the slopes!", "timestamp_created": 1507551757, "timestamp_updated": 1507551757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35584008": {"recommendationid": "35584008", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999377282", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507499264}, "language": "english", "review": "Well polished.", "timestamp_created": 1507500403, "timestamp_updated": 1507500403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35583453": {"recommendationid": "35583453", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996442277", "num_games_owned": 919, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507495963}, "language": "english", "review": "Carried Away is a physic based game where you build ski lifts, jumps and bridges just to bring Skiers from one point to another.\n\nIt has a nice tutorial to begin with so we can learn the UI and important keys.

Your goal is to build a safe ski lifts, jumps or bridges for skiers to safely pass. Game also allows to make your own level.\n\nThere are 3 types of game modes. First, there is campaign. There are 3 worlds (Tutorial world excluded), and each world has 14 levels. So there are plenty of levels, and you can be certain that each level is uniqe and non-repetitive.\n\nSecond, there is the Sandbox mode. As i mentioned before, you can make your own level and share it with other players via Workshop.\n\nThird and last, is the Workshop. You can download levels made by other players and play them.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something to chill while you play, Carried Away would be perfect for you. You can listen some musics while you play (By the way, Carried Away\u2019s soundtrack is also very chill)\n\nI also have a curator page and review games on there. Would be grateful if you could take a look at it \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/akusarireview#curation", "timestamp_created": 1507134015, "timestamp_updated": 1507134015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578171", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35475244": {"recommendationid": "35475244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042669538", "num_games_owned": 1224, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512581261}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A slick physics puzzler with campaign, sandbox mode and workshop support. Admire your handiwork in 3D and watch your intrepid skiers reach the top or perish in horrific accidents! This is why Health and Safety is a thing.[/h1]\n\nYou create your lift towers on a 2D screen using a selection of materials (planks, logs, supports, wheels etc) and then drag the cable over the wheels to the fixing point at the top of the hill and click Play. The screen switches to 3D view and you can spin it around, drag it and zoom in and out to watch as your skiers jump on the lift to hopefully get to the other end without the whole thing collapsing.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is the way the tolerance of each building item changes colour during the animation according to how much stress it's under. You can watch an entire tower as it turns yellow and orange on one side and stays green on the other, so you can visualise where the strengths and weaknesses are. After it collapses and you're back in 2D view, the struts that broke are shown in red, so you can see exactly where your breaking point was and do something about it. Ingenious.\n\nSuccess is measured by four factors:\n\n1. Whether or not all skiers made it safely - sometimes some of them make it but others don't.\n\n2. Whether everything was still intact at the end. It's possible (and common) to transport enough skiers to complete the level just before it all collapses.\n\n3. Whether you picked up the bonus blue stars along the way.\n\n4. Whether you were within budget. You're allowed a set amount of cash to use on each project.\n\nOn some levels you get to control the skier as he attempts to fling himself at your ski jumps. You can crouch/stand to get better take-off and if you're clever you can do backflips. It's way cool.\n\nAt the end of a successful level you can see where you are on the leaderboard, which is ranked according to how much cash you spent to complete the level, so it's always important to use as few materials as you can to make the most efficient solution.\n\n[h1]Sound & Vision[/h1]\n\nThere's cheery, relaxing 'elevator music' that changes now and then, and never becomes annoying. A nice accompaniment while you work. The 2D working view while you build your system allows you to drag the screen around and zoom in and out so you can focus on each part of your construction. You can switch between 2D and 3D any time, and in 3D you have total freedom of your camera to zoom, pan, rotate to get the best view of your bloodbath... I mean happy skiers on their way to their next run.\n\n[h1]Steam[/h1]\n\nThe devs have made good use of all the Steam options here. There's achievements, Leaderboards and Workshop/Level editor. No Steam Cloud mentioned and I think they need to set this up, it's especially useful for dual-booters like me. Win and Mac are officially supported and I happen to know that Linux is on the way because Jonny asked me to test it for him.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nThe first mountain area (of 3, and more on the way) is quite easy, and gets you into the swing of using the various materials available. After that it starts becoming very challenging and there's a big sense of victory when you succeed. You will see your carefully constructed masterpieces collapse and crumble many times before you reach that point though. If you're easily frustrated, give this a miss.\n\n[h1]Value[/h1]\n\nWhen I'm writing reviews before the release date I like to play a little game with myself and guess the price. I said US$10 for this so I wasn't far off. You won't be disappointed if you pay full price, the leaderboards and workshop will give you as much replay value as you can handle, and the overall quality is top notch.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nThe only other game of this type I've played is World Of Goo so I'm not sure how this compares against the several other bridge building games around these days, but I must say that Carried Away is a very satisfying puzzler in general terms. Easy to learn, hard to master, with great 3D graphics and best of all the in-game currency is good old \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3Pounds Sterling\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3.\n\nIf you're wondering about the Early Access and whether to wait until later, my advice is don't worry because this is already a great, fully functional, bug-free game as far as I can tell. They're going to add a lot more stuff later but go ahead and play it now, you won't regret it.\n\n[quote]More reviews at SaveOrQuit.com[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1507133823, "timestamp_updated": 1507133823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.752030", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35475123": {"recommendationid": "35475123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011161619", "num_games_owned": 2365, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1516036435}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u0412 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f\u043c\u0438. \u041a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0442\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0443 \u043b\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0430 =) \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043c. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435 \"bridge builder\". \u041c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0444\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0443\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e. \u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0443\u0437\u0443 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u041d\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0430 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435\u043c \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0435, \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f!

However, a strange occurrence happens resulting in a plot twist that will lead you to save your sister. While the art style is quite simple, the carefully hand-painted locations and items are pretty nice to look at. Voice acting is plain and forgettable but this is one not a type of game that focus on vocals, in fact, many similar games don\u2019t use voice acting at all. \n\nPuzzles hardly provided a challenge, becoming a game to simply sit back and relax after a long tiresome day instead of make your brain hurt. From logic, to memory there is all sort of puzzles to find out and discover and well, of course, the hidden objects mini games. \n\nIt took me 8 hours to finish the game, without rushing. I took my time to appreciate the paintings and the surrounding world. After you finish the main game you also get The Abyss, a chapter that will give you additional content with a fair share of puzzles. This extra chapter takes around one hour to complete and it serves as a finishing chapter to close all things.\n\nIf you are just looking for a casual game with no big difficulty attached this can be a decent option, specially if it is on a deep discount. There\u2019s a massive amount of hidden object games but this one glued to me until the very end. Perhaps for the soundtrack that not only gave me some Resident Evil 4 save room vibes for some odd reason but because it was always a relaxing and calm tune. \n", "timestamp_created": 1511903265, "timestamp_updated": 1511903265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593840", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37862537": {"recommendationid": "37862537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003690645", "num_games_owned": 540, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467266725}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good, but not Fallout 4 good.\n", "timestamp_created": 1511858357, "timestamp_updated": 1511858357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37508975": {"recommendationid": "37508975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416565657", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513100407}, "language": "english", "review": "This was really good game.

experience with them has primarily involved helping my mom find stuff in her hidden object games. I chose this particular one because reviews made it sound good and because it was on sale. I've now finished it and the little epilogue game that comes after it, although I haven't found all the fairies and \"elusive objects\" yet.\n\nPros:\n- In \"Casual\" mode at least, it wasn't too frustrating. I could usually figure out what I was supposed to do next and where I was supposed to go, with only a few exceptions.\n- Interesting storyline, even though it was [i]really[/i] contrived.\n- Most of the puzzles were fun. The only one I found unnecessarily annoying was the one with the symbols and chains. The artwork made it really hard to figure out which symbol was connected to which.\n- The hidden object artwork was usually pretty clear.\n- The kitten was cute (although easy to forget about).\n- It took me a while to realize there were fairies and \"elusive objects\" hidden throughout the whole game, but once I realized it I really enjoyed trying to find everything. The \"elusive objects\" in particular were (and are) a challenge. I think I've found a little over half of them so far.\n\nCons:\n- Cheesy story and script.\n- It irked me that the heroine [spoiler]started referring to the man who raised her as her \"foster father\" after learning the identity of her birth parents. Emotionally, he was more her father than the man who shared DNA with her.[/spoiler]\n- The kitten's animation was okay, but the people looked stiff and terrible.\n- It often felt more like an adventure game with a very low difficulty level than a hidden object game. Most of the game involved finding items in various locations and then either using them somewhere else right away or combining them.\n- Sometimes the game went a little too far when it came to forcing you to find stuff and combine it, or do one thing before you could do another. For example, at several points you're forced to make some kind of light source. There were lit candles all around - a normal person would have grabbed one and used it, but oh no, not this game's heroine. She also refused to touch stuff if it was dirty or had cobwebs on it, even if her sister's life was actively in danger.\n\nI don't have a whole lot to compare it to, but overall I thought it was okay. I thought it'd be a little more focused on hidden object puzzles, but the difficulty of finding all the fairies and \"elusive objects\" helped make up for the weaker adventure game-like aspects somewhat.", "timestamp_created": 1504062671, "timestamp_updated": 1504062671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34575150": {"recommendationid": "34575150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010899348", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504006358}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc544\ubb34 \uc0dd\uac01\uc5c6\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc8fd\uc774\ub294 \uac8c\uc784...^^", "timestamp_created": 1504006957, "timestamp_updated": 1504006957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34567615": {"recommendationid": "34567615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413532327", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504258302}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good game with plenty of badges and took me 4 and a half hours to complete the whole game.", "timestamp_created": 1503977034, "timestamp_updated": 1503977034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34563487": {"recommendationid": "34563487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130262111", "num_games_owned": 1170, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506023875}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me ha gustado mucho esta aventura de \"Se\u00f1alar y Clickear\".

Today's revelation is that the majority of these things are about a parent saving a child or a child saving their parent. That's all well and good, except they tend to get into the dumbest situations just so that someone will have to assemble crests and shoot crossbows and mix potions to get them out. Grim Legends starts with a pretty thin premise but makes the absolute most of it, turning the story into a pretzel salted with some quality clicking and puzzling.\n\nYou're on your way to your twin sister's wedding at the local quaint village with your father, taking care not to trip and fall into the BOTTOMLESS HELL ABYSS the town was built right on the edge of. A bear of all things crashes the wedding and leads you on a wild chase into the woods, through a spooky castle, and yes, right back to the BOTTOMLESS HELL ABYSS for the grand finale. And grand it is, the whole way through even, because the revelations and secret identities will come thick and fast.\n\nI'm talking this up a bit, it's still a hidden object game so the twists are going to be obvious but that doesn't make them any less entertaining. The Forsaken Bride does a few things that help keep it memorable, even if it does start out a little weak. They'll take you to some truly awesome locations, too, which is one of the big strengths this title has over its peers. Scenes in Grim Legends are colorful, vibrant, and have a lot going on just beyond the puzzles and object scenes. There are little fairies and ghosts to collect if you can spot them, along with some background elements you can poke just for fun.\n\nIt's not just the locales that hit all the right notes, either. There's a refreshing variety of activities to partake in as you progress through the story, not just hunting objects. Every location has sub-scenes where you can find or use items, or launch into one of the game's many puzzles. While there are a few standards like tracing wires or swapping tiles you'll be treated to a few I haven't seen before, such as a rolling ball maze and (no lie) applying make-up. And the hidden object scenes themselves are clear and crisp, with twelve items to find apiece. As with all quality games in the genre you may need to do some assembling or hunting for secondary items to access a few, and there are also special scenes where you find pieces of a specific item you need to make.\n\nTopping all this off are a few particularly involved puzzles where you mix potions or forge metal keys, which always come as a welcome break from scrambling around to use this item on that thing to get another item. Oh, and then there's your kitty. You get a kitten early on which can be used to grab items just out of reach or scare off small critters your character is too dainty to face herself. It's a solid, varied adventure from start to finish that even gets a bonus chapter afterwards that features some extra sinister and trippy locations.\n\nFans of the hidden object genre often have to lower expectations to appreciate the average title, but Grim Legends stands tall among such middling offerings. A great deal of care and artistry has been applied in the making of this game, effort that should be commended by players and emulated by developers. Honestly I have yet to play a bad Artifex Mundi game, and while there are a few little trips on item names and the writing on the whole this is by far one of the best hidden object games I've played. It's the perfect title for newcomers to experience the genre with, or hidden object fans to treat themselves with.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

only owned it because I bought it with some left over money from a gift card. Played it for the first time today. Spent 4 hours beating the game, and didn't let go of the mouse the entire time. While the plot is a bit lackluster (I filled in the missing clues myself after about an hour), the puzzles themselves are actually challenging, but not so much so that the game becomes too hard. The hint system prevents younger players from being stuck on puzzles that might otherwise be confusing, (I admit I had to use it myself a few times), but isn't entirely required for a fun experience.\nOverall, I'd recommend the game if you're looking for something to pass the time, or a way to entertain your kids for a while.", "timestamp_created": 1493008657, "timestamp_updated":

Not only are you attacked by a bear, as the beast kidnaps your sister, and leads you to a deep and mysterious quest.\nTo aid you, a super cute kitten joins you, as well as a mysterious woman who lives in the woods and end up involving your past. A fantastic Hidden Object game filled with magic and moon elements!\n\nLike always, [i]Artifex Mundi[/i] delivers a top quality game, with their typical 2D hand drawn designs, and a 2.5D for some characters like our littler furry helper.\nThe storyline is somewhat predictable, but enjoyable. The developers still followed a very distinct path for the events, as well for the characters' dialogues; simple but complete towards the player objectives.\nThe puzzles are fair as usual, starting from simple and ending with slightly complex ones. Some are originals, others I've seen around in other games, but overall I'd say they mix right in the game's atmosphere.\nThe events occur in a small village, but with fantastic areas to discover, from a small island, to a castle, underground secret caves, and not to forget the forest. You'll never feel like you're in the same place twice, unless you backtrack, which you do, but with different objectives to complete, with a complete new feeling!\nThe mysterious elements of the story fit perfectly with the design and objects we use during our personal, but world changing quest. Creating salves, and measuring ingredients are just a few expanded ideas within [b]Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride[/b], plus if you don't feel like hunting down objects, this time around we can play domino to find that hard-to-find-hidden-object. It's a fantastic extra, and really fun to play!\n\nIt's a relatively regular game in length, although I spend twice as much time searching for extra secrets such as fairies and distinct objects you can add to the collection. This collectors edition includes an extra chapter right after the ending, or if you prefer, an alternative ending. With this comes new sequences, new puzzles and of course, a new ending that adds around 30-40 extra minutes.\n\nWith a good and solid storyline, extra items to collect, this adventure continues to prove how [i]Artifex Mundi[/i] releases some of the best Hidden Object games of today.\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1491269441, "timestamp_updated": 1491269441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30917245": {"recommendationid": "30917245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209141601", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473597205}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend this Game to any who enjoys RPG, Puzzles and a good storyline which draws you in....

(Games talking at her instead of letting her play is super triggering)\n\nThe clickety thing is probably the most objective fault I can find - when you're connecting vague tangles of chains or ropes to an object (not as a part of a mini-game, but in adventure game mode) or when you're asked to find an object broken up into arbitrary and easily concealable shapes, madly clicking on everything and anything is much more likely to do something than clicking an object and getting discouraged when there's no result.\n\nEdit - oh yeah, a few more faults. Later in the game, the \"skip this puzzle\" button is often replaced with \"hint about the next move you get to make\", which... when you have to move a dozen tiles or whatever back and forth, is pretty objectively terrible. Also, someone decided to add some utterly random Hebrew letters as clues... letters that you're supposed to read from left to right, for some misbegotten reason. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KddKAXA.jpg\n\nBut as to people talking at you, it actually made me feel fairly invested in the storyline. The fabula is very simple - your sister was kidnapped by a magic bear on the eve of her marriage to the handsome stranger who came to town literally a few weeks ago. Please don't spoil the highly original and unexpected twist. \n\nBut though your friends and family are vacant-eyed uncanny monstrosities when viewed up close:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dUmch38.jpg\n\nIt's still nice to have someone to talk to. You often have someone ineffectually trying to help you, cheering you on, providing semi-helpful clues... it's a fairly nice change of pace compared to the average \"exposition duties done, now I shall go / turn into a static sprite and never interact with you again\" HOG NPC. Having a proper antagonist to contend against was also highly motivating. \n\nYou progress from the village, through the woods and into the bear's castle, then back again. Makes for a nice excuse to reuse screens and hidden object spots. The game is quite pretty, as you can see from the screenshots, and I didn't mind the setting being limited to nighttime fairy tale village / woods / castle.\n\nThe puzzles were average. I've rarely encountered a genuine stumper, but there were a lot of puzzles that just took forever to solve the proper way. Early in the game hidden object hunts had you hunting for pieces of an object rather than a list of words. Fairly original, but obviously it didn't work that well, as you hunt for words in the latter half of the game.\n\nThe game is stuffed to the brim with needless miscellaneous optional stuff. For instance, you can trace a pattern with domino stones instead of playing through a hidden objects screen. Never used this option, no idea why it's there, but this is an HOG which you can complete without ever finding a single hidden object.\n\nYou carry a kitten around for some unknown reason. You only get to use it on anything five or six times.

I'd stopped playing Artifex Mundi HOGs a while ago because frankly they were just variations on the same formula with the same voice actors (\"oh no, not this scenery-chewing guy with the gravelly voice again!\") and the same six puzzles. However, Grim Legends is a step up. The story is the usual trite nonsense, but it does get interestingly dark towards the end. The hidden object puzzles are actually quite challenging at times (especially if you have no idea what they're asking you to find!), and some of the other puzzles are moderately inventive (no, really). The art is beautiful, the animation and voice acting are... well, certainly better than previous games, and it has a largely but not completely pointless kitten. For some reason it took me 9 hours to complete this including the bonus chapter, which is about 6 hours longer than these things normally last, so that's good right? Either that or I'm just slow.

Opowiadana historia b\u0119dzie budzi\u0107 skojarzenia z ba\u015bniami braci Grimm i w zasadzie s\u0142usznie. Nie b\u0119d\u0119 zdradza\u0142, jakie nawi\u0105zania zawarto, bo to automatyczny spoiler. Jednak nie nastawiajcie si\u0119 na idealne odwzorowanie w\u0105tk\u00f3w, czy przebiegu historii. Grim Legends to typowe wzi\u0119cie pomys\u0142u i dorobienie do niego w\u0142asnej fabu\u0142y, nie adaptacja. Mnie takie podej\u015bcie nie przeszkadza, ale je\u015bli spodziewali\u015bcie si\u0119 czego\u015b innego, zostali\u015bcie ostrze\u017ceni.\n\nGraficznie GL prezentuje si\u0119 cudnie. Jest to mniej wi\u0119cej ten sam poziom, co drugie lub trzecie Koszmary. Kolory s\u0105 \u017cywe, ale nie przesadnie. Pomimo przebogatej palety barw uda\u0142o si\u0119 zachowa\u0107 ponur\u0105 atmosfer\u0119 niekt\u00f3rych informacji oraz miejsc. Na wypadek, gdyby kogo\u015b rozprasza\u0142a kolorystka, z pomoc\u0105 przychodzi oprawa muzyczna, zgrabnie przypominaj\u0105ca o ponurym adwersarzu, skrywanej tajemnicy i scenach rodem z pierwszych adaptacji Frankensteina. Aktorzy mo\u017ce nie dok\u0142adaj\u0105 si\u0119 do oprawy, ale i przynajmniej nie psuj\u0105 jej.\n\nTradycyjnie dla gier tego rodzaju ich serce stanowi\u0105 zagadki. Zdawa\u0142o mi si\u0119, \u017ce po uko\u0144czeniu kilku tytu\u0142\u00f3w Artifex Mundi widzia\u0142em ju\u017c wszystko.

Z kolei dla nowicjuszy Legendy powinny stanowi\u0107 nieco wi\u0119ksze wyzwanie, ni\u017c takie 9 Clues. R\u00f3wnie tradycyjna jest dodatkowa miniprzygoda, dost\u0119pna po uko\u0144czeniu w\u0105tku g\u0142\u00f3wnego i zamykaj\u0105ca fabu\u0142\u0119 na dobre (no prawie, furtk\u0119 sobie zostawiono).\n\nCo mi si\u0119 w Grim Legends nie podoba\u0142o? Mechanizm kota. Przez spor\u0105 cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 gry towarzyszy nam zwierzak. Niby fajny zabieg, bo mo\u017cna go wys\u0142a\u0107 w miejsca niedost\u0119pne dla cz\u0142owieka, ale bior\u0105c pod uwag\u0119, ile razy rzeczywi\u015bcie z tego korzystamy, ma si\u0119 wra\u017cenie, i\u017c dorzucono to na doczepk\u0119.

The meat and potatoes involves a number of puzzles using items from the environment. These are cleverly crafted, with some getting quite intricate and involved as the story progresses.\n\nThere are also many hidden object puzzle sections throughout, as well as some other styles besides these two that I won't spoil for you.\n\nThe artwork is fantastic, and the visuals are impressive in general too. The score is appropriately matched to the mood of the tale. The mystery of the story drives the action fairly well. There are even some hidden hard to find extras. Some of them simply require an attentive eye, but others are even more creatively hidden.\n\nFor the most part, the puzzles had a good logical flow to them as well, by which I mean the actions performed were reasonably sensible. I have played games in the past where that was not at all the case, and it really ruins the immersion and frustrates the player. Thankfully there is extremely little of that here, even with so many puzzles in this game.\n\nSimple examples off the top of my head: using a shard of broken glass to cut a rope, using a coin to loosen a screw, adding coals to embers to stoke a fire for smelting. These are but a few examples of the kinds of reasonably logical puzzle elements that you will encounter throughout the game. In other words, 9 times out of 10 the chain of events you proceed with as a puzzle progresses make sense, and are often ideas that might come to you naturally as you are playing and discovering the various components.\n\nI think the best part overall however is the fact that none of the puzzles ever become so difficult as to make it so you cannot finish the game. There will occasionally be points where you may be stuck, and there is a hint system in place that helps point you in the direction of what you need to do next, which is a welcome feature that I used from time to time during my playthrough. Even were this system not in place however, it's usually just a matter of examining each screen more carefully and making sure you find all possible objects with which you may interact.\n\nOverall I recommend this game for just about anyone. I think it is a game that many people would be able to enjoy, regardless of their skill or experience with games.\n\nIf the rest of the titles Artifex Mundi brings to the table are of this caliber, then I absolutely will be recommending their games to everyone I know.", "timestamp_created": 1483073360, "timestamp_updated": 1483073604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28779464": {"recommendationid": "28779464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130377388", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486520144}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is enjoyable enough and the story line is interesting.

The last few have seemed underwhelming: oh, another of these kinds of puzzles, oh, another gate to open in arcane, intricate, and unlikely ways. Find a way to paint this blue, find something to feed the cat. Ho-hum. They've never been my favorite games, but had I reached saturation? \n\nHappy to report that I've just been playing the wrong ones, doing time-idlers rather than the best of the bunch. This fairy-tale HOG is a primo Artifex Mundi mainstay, and it's just terrific: cleverly drawn, carefully built, thoughtfully paced, and overall a great example of the difference a strong spark of creativity makes. \n\nThere's nothing wildly different about the game format: you're traveling to your sister's pastoral wedding when your cart is run off the road (oops), and when you make it to the celebration everything goes to blazes when a giant bear races in, kidnaps your sister (bears do that, right?) and sends you off on a rescue mission through forest, swamp, castle, tunnel, town, chasm, and floaty weird dimension. \n\nThe quality of storytelling, however, makes all the difference, and this game kept and pleasured my attentions. It isn't wildly difficult or anything, but it all feels good.  Even the extras are entertaining: as this is a Collectors' Edition, there are tricky objects and hidden spirit sprites to collect, which means I had to do a second play-through because I'm never tricksy enough the first time. \n\nI left one achievement unclaimed; each hidden-object puzzle lets you play a domino game if you'd prefer, and one achievement is for beating a domino game in under a minute. My domino speed-skills are not so refined.

If you like puzzling with plots, then this is for you.\n\nNeat Things:\n* YOU GET A CAT. All else is irrelevant good or bad, you get a KITTEN HELPER AND IT MEOWS AT YOU. \n* Like all Artimus Mundi games, the hidden object puzzles were fun (and sensible). And revisiting them doesn't introduce new and random elements into the scene. \n* The puzzles were fun\n* Loved the soundscaping. Dat music was great. A little over the top 'magical' in some ways, but I dug it.\n* THE DOMINOS GAME WAS LEGIT. If you find that you can't complete a hidden object puzzle (either you don't want to or don't want to use the hint), you can play the domino game. And lemme tell you, that game was super fun.\n\nSome Meh Things:\n* The side story.

The gameplay is challenging enough at least for myself and I bet I would've enjoyed this a lot back when I was 13-15; even more than I do now.\n\nAnd those bloody fairies.

However, evil lurks around the corner as the bride to be, Lilly, is kidnapped. It\u2019s up to her twin sister to set things right but she soon uncovers a world of corruption and evil magic. [i]Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride[/i] is a shining example of what a hidden item game should be, it has an engaging story with interesting characters as well as very good gameplay. One of the earlier games of this genre that I played, I found it very enjoyable and happily played it two more times for the sake of this review.\n\nOne of the good parts of this title is the story, the game wastes no time thrusting you into the action as Lilly is kidnapped by a wild bear very earlier on. The first half of the game is spent trying to find her and meeting new characters. Things soon begin to change when you get closer to finding Lilly who has been taken to an abandoned castle. Pieces of the puzzle come together but before the mystery can be solved you become the enemy as dark magic works to keep you away from your sister. The story is told mostly in present day, however there also flashbacks to twenty-five years ago when things started and the dark magic of the Abyss began to control the chess pieces. There is also a beautiful yet tragic love story woven into everything as well as the heart warming tale of sisterly love. \n\nThe game is a traditional point and click adventure with the main focus being on hidden object scenes and puzzles. Everything is completely mouse-controlled as you interact with people and objects, you also have an inventory system to collect useful tools. The hidden object scenes are a mix of the traditional list type where you\u2019re given a written list of items to find in the scene as well ones where the list of items are represented in pictures. I enjoyed the variety this added to the gameplay as it kept each scene fresh since you had to visit some more than once. The game also offers a mahjong mini game that you play as an alternative to the hidden object scenes. I didn\u2019t like this feature since it sort of defeats the purpose of the game and also it forces you to play the game twice if you want to collect all of the achievements since two are connected to playing mahjong. The puzzles are not too difficult but they offer a good challenge. One of my favorites involved having to match your makeup to Lilly\u2019s, it was a bit of silly fun and a nice break from the usual puzzles. \n\nThe game graphics are very high quality. All of the scenes are beautifully done and most objects are not too hard to see if you have bad vision. The characters move smoothly when there is animation as well and their models were very well done. The game has full voice acting and it\u2019s very good quality helping players to stay immersed in the game. The music and sound effects are top notch, I can\u2019t think of any complaints at all.\n\n[i]Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride[/i] is a must-play for fans of hidden object games new and old. This game helped me get into this genre and it is still a great play through to this day; you also are given a cute kitten sidekick to help so that was instant plus for me. The title offers Steam achievements as well as trading cards, there also collectables in the game to find. You\u2019re also given a bonus chapter complete that ties up the story well. It\u2019s well worth the asking price but is often bundled or on sale so if you\u2019re hesitating don\u2019t miss your chance to add this to your library, you won\u2019t be disappointed. \n\n[url=http://lunarproductions.tumblr.com/]Lunar Productions[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1466203183, "timestamp_updated": 1466203222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671694", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23613465": {"recommendationid": "23613465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125914604", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466158471}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Your Standard Hidden Object Game [/h1]\n\nIf there is a scale for measuring all hidden-object-point-and-click games ranging from 1 to 10, with 1 being excruciatingly boring and 10 being the most amazing game there is, this game would fall exactly onto a 5: Its the perfect blend of story and gameplay that\u2019s interesting enough to keep you going until you finish, but also blend enough that at times you might get bored while playing and quit and go do something else for a while.\n\nThis game has all the issues you would usually associate with hidden-object games; examples include weak or no protagonist development and a predictable and unexciting storyline. But if its really story or interesting character you are looking for, then hidden-object games are probably not the best place to look for them anyways. \n\nHowever, if you look past all those problems, as a hidden object game this game is actually quite enjoyable.  The puzzles were nice and fun (I thoroughly enjoyed some of them and one of them actually took me a while to crack), the artwork is aesthetically pleasing, and the animation is fluid enough to connect scenes together.  \n\nSo if you like puzzles, don\u2019t really mind playing hidden-object games over and over again and is content with a predictable story, then this game is good enough to worth buying it and playing it.\n\n\nOh also a final note on the game, if you do end up playing it, play it on expert mode, its not difficult at all and I have always found that the simple mode gives wayyyy too much hints and pretty much ruins all the fun. \n\n\n\n\np.s There are so many plot holes in the story that it\u2019s almost comical if you actually stop and really think about it. \n\n[spoiler] For example, if the evil sprite has to marry one of the daughters then why is he so fixated on marrying the sister? There are all those times he could have just knocked the protagonist out and put a ring on her instead. Also, if the father crushed the wedding to protect her daughter from marrying the evil sprite, where was he when the evil sprite and his daughter dated? (presumably they would have dated as who marries a stranger). On that point also the sprite was happy to play the kind loving fianc\u00e9e for all those time while wooing Lily but when the protagonist shows up he instantly reveals his true evil nature and his eyes flash red? Seriously? Oh, and finally, how awkward must it be for the protagonist\u2019s foster dad that the protagonist\u2019s family is now reunited, i truly feel sorry for the guy.

It isn't really one of my favorite games, and I probably won't replay it, but there is nothing directly bad about it, and it certainly isn\u2019t among any of the games I dislike. It is worth the money, and I don\u2019t regret buying or playing it. I will recommend it for anyone that likes the old kinds of tales (fairy tales, sagas, legends, moral stories), as it gave me that kind of vibe.\n\nI don't understand the choice of making the game in first person. The character has a backstory, voice actor, and no dialogue options. And through the game we see what she looks like. Personally I would have preferred the game in third person, but then again I almost always prefer third person. Doesn't really affect my recommendation of the game, as first or third person is more of a preference. But while I can see the appeal for shooters and games where your character is a blank slate, I don\u2019t think it matches for an adventure game.\n\nThe story is nice and very easy to follow, but still manages to have some twists along the way, that I didn\u2019t see coming from the start. That being said\u2026 I felt it was a bit too dramatic at times for the gameplay and puzzle solving. Being point and click and relying on puzzle solving invites for a more thoughtful and calculating approach, which doesn\u2019t really match well with a story that presents characters with immediate danger and side characters trying to make you hurry. But most of the puzzles were fun.\n\nAs for the characters themselves. Like I said it felt very much like the old kinds of tales, so the characters aren\u2019t really all that deep or interesting to me, BUT I don\u2019t feel they are meant to be. The way I see it, it is a type of story where the characters are meant to be quickly identifiable, keeping the focus on the events and enchanting tale rather than the characters experiencing them.", "timestamp_created": 1465337673, "timestamp_updated": 1465485121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642095", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23439174": {"recommendationid": "23439174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300583412", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465322834}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Otro juego interesante de Artifex. \n\nMismo esquema y mismos puzzles.

The puzzles and hidden objects scenes are fairly shared.\n\nThe game features an inventory where you can store items to combine with the environment to go deeper in the story. Earlier in the game you also find a very useful fellow who will help you many times through your adventure.\n\nThe game have several difficulties and have a guest feature : all the family can play the game and resume it where they left. There is also a map which is useful to fast travel through the different places and that can have some hints if you play in an easier mode. Also you can use the Hint/Skip hourglass whenever you want and wait until its refill to use it again. But be warned that you may not skip or use a hint in any puzzle or hidden objects scene if you wish to have some achievements.\n\nThere is a wide choice of puzzles and there are two kind of Hidden objects scenes. The first Hidden objects scene features the name of the objects to find some are found easily (normal one) and some others need you to interact with the environment or to combine two items to found them. The second Hidden objects scene let you find the shape of the objects in the scene and sometimes ask you to use them in order to obtain the others.\n\n(*) :\nThe game has some achievements that can be missed even some story related achievements and also some challenging achievements including finishing the game on hard mode. There is a guide on steam that will help you to not miss any of these achievements. The challenging achievements require you to finish a puzzle or an hidden objects scene or a domino game under a minute. And two achievements require you to find 3 objects in 3 seconds or find all objects without any misclick in the hidden object scenes.\n\n(#):\nAs I said in the key features, you need two playthrough to finish the game.

If you're looking for a \"real\" hidden object game, like the early Big Fish titles, then you might be dissapointed, because this offers a lot more than that. For me though, it was a delight with variety. The story was ok, even if the voice cast was... not so great. But it doesn't matter for me, I played it for the puzzles and I was not dissapointed. The whole map system is great, in which you can travel back to previous scenes. They even mark then map with a \"!\" if there is anything interacive to do in a specific location, which eliminates one of the more frustrating moment these game usually have, running around to look if there is something to do.

We know what we are getting ourselves into after this point. Amazing artwork, an engaging story and an exceedingly well gameplay for the HOG genre. But here I am, smiling peculiarly, thanks to the fact that [i]Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride[/i] embraces my favorite setting and concept to tell a tale ever: folktales.\n\nIn a nameless forest of Middle Eastern Europe, a young nameless girl clad in a simple hood runs - alone and frustrated - in a dreary rain. As she runs desperately, she asks out loud, as if expecting a possible answer: \"Why did you leave me? How could you do it?\" She runs towards a gruesome tree, sitting atop a jagged cliff. She keeps on with her soliloquy as she keeps climbing towards the top, looking over the bottomless chasm: \"All your professions of love! All your promises...\" As she reaches the top of the tree, she removes a beautiful emerald ring from her slender finger as she sheds one more tear. \"They were all lies!\"...and she throws the ring to the chasm with all her broken might, as she utters a final damnation for the one who broke her innocent heart: \"Curse you and your heartless kin!\"\n\n25 years after the fateful event, we take the role of a young woman in a journey towards the village of Haugwitz with her father in a silent evening. Our twin sister Lilly will be marrying to a handsome young man soon, and we are trying to arrive in time for the wedding. As we manage to reach after bit of a trouble and hope for Lilly's smiling face, the warmth of an inn and maybe getting to know the groom a bit better - not necessarily in that order - a dire bear attacks the village and kidnaps our sister before our very eyes! With the young groom who seems eager to play the hero, we venture out into the forest to get out sister back safe and sound. What dreadful business is this? Who is a friend, and who is a foe? More importantly, who is our family?\n\nOkay, I'm not usually in the habit of telling the introduction scene of HOGs this elaborately in my reviews, but for one reason or the other, this story and its opening scene really got me. It is desperate, reckless and dangerous - gothic in a romantic way; and maybe just the right amount of eerie to make out a wondrous folktale! Artifex Mundi goes forward to craft a beautiful game worthy of its reputation: gorgeous artwork, enchanting color palette and authentic cultural anecdotes combined into a wonderful setting for this first instalment of Grim Legends series. Every single scene is wallpaper quality, I tell you! Added decent enough voice acting and sorrowful soundtrack, the game presents high quality atmosphere for a HOG.\n\nHidden object scenes are various and quite enjoyable with a domino gameplay alternative if you get bored. Puzzles are interesting, yet not really challenging. Interactive map is there, but you won't be needing it a lot since the backtracking is little to none. Gameplay is really story oriented in this one, so you keep moving according the plot anyhow. You'll be needing at least 2 playthroughs to collect all achievements - one for HOG scenes, one for domino completions - and over all, the game presents you 6-8 hours of play time - including a bonus chapter for your enjoyment.\n\nYou can grab [i]Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride[/i] with peace of mind to experience a beautiful and simple adventure. It's nothing complicated and the ending isn't anything miraculous, but I strongly recommend this one if you enjoy the genre or would like to try just for the sake of beautiful artworks.

Ich sollte wohl eher sagen: Das dieses Wimmelbildspiel fast alles hat, was ich mir von einem sehr guten w\u00fcnsche. Als ich dieses Spiel vor Kurzem erneut gespielt habe, war ich wieder \u00fcberrascht, wie sehr mich die Atmosph\u00e4re in seinen Bann gezogen hat. Und das als Wimmelbildspiel. \n\nDie Grafik ist erstaunlich gut. Die gezeichneten Hintergr\u00fcnde sind wirklich sehr sch\u00f6n und verst\u00e4rken den \u201em\u00e4rchenhaften\u201c Eindruck. Die Szenen sind gut durchdacht, sodass es keine Gegenst\u00e4nde, Sachen gab, die deplatziert wirkten oder sofort so ins Auge springen.\n\nF\u00fcr ein Wimmelbildspiel hat Grim Legends auch gute Animationen. In den Bewegungen der Personen, der Katze und auch in den Zwischensequenzen kann man das deutlich sehen. Nachholbedarf besteht jedoch in den Gesichtsanimationen, diese fallen aus der Reihe. Ist f\u00fcr mich kein direkter Mangel aber es f\u00e4llt auf, da der Rest gut gelungen ist. \n\nDie Geschichte ist an M\u00e4rchen angelehnt, worauf der Name schon hindeuten soll. Wer mit M\u00e4rchen etwas anfangen kann oder sie liebt, ist mit diesem Spiel sehr gut beraten. Die Story war interessant und auch ziemlich gut erz\u00e4hlt. Es gab interessante Wendungen und auch sonst konnte ich den Verlauf der Geschichte nicht von Beginn an vorhersagen.  \n\nDie Wimmelbilder sind auf einem guten Niveau. Die Szenen wirken nicht \u00fcberladen, alle Suchgegenst\u00e4nde sind gut gezeichnet und erkenntlich. \u00dcbersetzungsfehler habe ich in meinem Spieldurchgang keine gehabt. Und wenn man mal keine Lust auf wimmeln hat, kann man die Szenen immer noch mit der Ersatzm\u00f6glichkeit, Domino, l\u00f6sen. Wer Wert auf Errungenschaften legt, sollte bedenken, dass man das Spiel zwei Mal durchspielen muss, um alle zu erreichen. Da es f\u00fcr Domino und Wimmelbilder Errungenschaften gibt. Ich muss allerdings sagen, dass Domino am Anfang interessant ist aber mit der Zeit deutlich an Spannung verliert. \n\nUm kurz auf die R\u00e4tsel einzugehen: Die R\u00e4tsel sind bekannte Artifex Mundi Qualit\u00e4t. Sie sind gut gemacht und haben in der Regel einen leichten bis mittleren Schwierigkeitsgrad. \n\nWo Licht ist, muss es auch Schatten geben, so hei\u00dft es. Und trifft leider auch auf Grim Legends zu. Es gab leider eine Sache, die mich bei Grim Legends wahnsinnig gest\u00f6rt hat. Der Textbalken. Ja, der Textbalken. In Grim Legends ist er sehr gro\u00df und blendet sich nur sehr langsam aus. Gerade wenn ich Bereiche im oberen Teil des Bildschirm absuchen wollte, fand ich das sehr st\u00f6rend. (Besonders wenn man etwas anklickte und sofort eine neue Meldung bekam.)\n\nTrotzdem ist Grim Legends einfach ein tolles Spiel. Und gerade der kleine Begleiter macht das Spiel so besonders, weil er einfach so s\u00fc\u00df ist. Eigentlich verfalle ich nicht so leicht den Charme von Katzen, aber diese hat es mir angetan. \n\n[b][i]Fazit:[/i][/b] Mein Fazit kann nur lauten: Kauft euch das Spiel, wenn ihr Wimmelbildspiele m\u00f6gt. Und wenn ihr mit einem anfangen wollt, ist Grim Legends auch keine schlechte Wahl, da es nicht zu leicht aber auch nicht zu kompliziert ist. Zudem grafisch sehr sch\u00f6n anzusehen ist und auch eine gute Geschichte erz\u00e4hlt.", "timestamp_created": 1456518507, "timestamp_updated": 1456518507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21372529": {"recommendationid": "21372529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282479990", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455980834}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the story and music.

Sometimes it is nice to move away from all the violence, fast paced war whcih of course, we all enjoy so much, and come back down to earth with a somewhat slower, more simple game that still has an intresting story, but doesn't require too much effort. \n\nThis game is really nice, i will not give any of the story line away, but it is very magical, much like most games mae by this company. The game is well made, and though relatively shrot i do not regret buying it. I am satisfied with the story, and i really anjoyed playing through it. There is enough to do inside the game so that you don't feel like you are lost for activity's, though i must confess i do get tired of the Hidden Object scenes sometimes. Other than that, the graphics are nice in this game, and i really like the setting and the story. \n\nI can't really fault it, it is short and sweet, and on sale i would reccomend it to anyone that is up for it. It is a suitable game for most audiences, with different difficulty settings and such. Maybe full price, 6 British Pounds, is a bit too much for some, but i don't begrudge it. Nonetheless, for the time you get out of it, a sale price is more suitable. \n\nAll in all 10/10 i really like this game, and i hope you will too, if you have not yet played it.", "timestamp_created": 1450736161, "timestamp_updated": 1450736161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544628", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19823302": {"recommendationid": "19823302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121272715", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450704183}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u76f8\u5f53\u6709\u8da3!", "timestamp_created": 1450704229, "timestamp_updated": 1450704229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19820233": {"recommendationid": "19820233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184869534", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450689553}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gra super op\u0142aca si\u0119 kupi\u0107 t\u0105 gre", "timestamp_created": 1450689406, "timestamp_updated": 1450689406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19810813": {"recommendationid": "19810813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017843065", "num_games_owned": 1408, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450640144}, "language": "english", "review": "Fairly easy, good long length, casual Hidden Object game.\n\nStory is interesting and well spread throughout the game.

I liked this game well enough.\nThe Hidden Object puzzles are nicely presented scenes, lots to find, not glitchy - there is only a little repetition. They each come with a counterpart domino game, again nicely done.\nNearly all the logic puzzles have the answer provided in clues found nearby and most are easy, some a little more challenging on the first go.\nThere is a map with teleport, but the areas are close together so backtracking is not too bad.\nAchievements are mostly story driven and all easy, requires second play through to 100%.\n\nThis is game is suitable for crayon-eaters who have graduated to sucking felt tips.", "timestamp_created": 1450642167, "timestamp_updated": 1450642167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19801344": {"recommendationid": "19801344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216761932", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452093785}, "language": "english", "review": "^^", "timestamp_created": 1450610553, "timestamp_updated": 1450610553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19799129": {"recommendationid": "19799129", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971532357", "num_games_owned": 2287, "num_reviews": 368, "playtime_forever": 723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463389969}, "language": "english", "review": "Coming back to your hometown for the wedding of your twin sister, a terrifying bear kidnapped her. Helped by her fianc\u00e9, you're going to save her... But who is really saving who? And who is really your family?\n\nArtifex Mundi is trying to deliver a sad and creepy fairy tale, though creepy isn't really the right word for it. The plot is well-written and full of twists. As usual, they managed to get you captived. And you really want to know the last word of the story.\n\nThe gameplay is not innovative as it's always find items, clear hidden objects scenes, solve puzzles, find beyond objects BUT everything is well polished. Everything is well polished. The puzzles are quite easy and the hidden objects scenes are clear. There is also the hunt for the spirits (fairies) and beyond objects (changing appearances), which is adding some spice to the game.\n\nThe reason why Grim Legends is one of my favorite series from AM are the graphics and the soundtrack. Indeed, given the fact that they're mastering the mysterious and dark side, Grim Legends is at the same time colorful and surrounded by an aura of lurking evil, as you're playing mainly during the night, that you're also visiting places tied to that kind of ambiance (forest, witch's cabin, castle, etc.). What is nice too is also the fact that you're discovering the tale as a bonus too. The soundtrack is as usual well fit.\n\nBesides, I've noticed something: I've rarely saw the main protagonist as being male. For the games released on Steam, you're always a woman, that has brains and can survive by herself despite the era or the world. I mean by that that here, in Grim Legends, you're not the damsel in distress even if it's another woman - though your twin sister is as strong as you.\n\nAnyway, if anything, Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride is one of the HO you must have and you must try.

Hrdinkami jsou dve sestry, kona se svatba, do toho tajemne sily... Pribeh je po par rozhovorech vpodstate jasny a inteligentniho hrace story opravdu neprekvapi, ale na pomery tohoto typu her je akorat, dava smysl, a HLAVNE nema otevreny konec, coz je rarita jak blazen a za to davam oba palce nahoru. \nPostup ve hre mi prisel trochu obtiznejsi nez u jinych her Artifexu (mluvim samozrejme o nastaveni na experta), ale to bylo spise absenci manualu, coz je vec, kterou jsem nikdy u techto her nepotreboval, ale tady by se par rad hodilo. Tak sem napisu to nejdulezitejsi, aniz bych tim neco prozradil, jinak se ve hre muzete neprijemne zaseknout.\n1) Ctete a klikejte na kazdy papir a stranku, hlavne pokud maji ohnuty rozek, coz znaci, ze je stranek vic. Predejdete tim neprijemnemu zakysu jako se stal mne a navic je za to achievement. \n2) Pokud chcete jako ja mit uplne komplet hru, tedy i s iluzornimi objekty a vilami, nespechejte a sledujte modre banky u spodniho okraje obrazovky, kde se cervenym krizkem oznaci, pokud dany screen neco z toho obsahuje. Iluzorni predmety jsou na hlavnim screenu, vily pak v podoknech. Vzdy max jeden od kazdeho. Oboje je docela snadno prehlednutelne - zvlaste \"prchave predmety\", jak je nazyvaji v ceskem prekladu, jsou velmi subtilni a meni se jen na chvili, kdy na ne muze clovek kliknout. S dostatkem trpelivosti se ale daji najit hned napoprve. Co ovsem nechapu. ze za toto neni achiev, coz je skoda. \nNaopak je achievement za domino hry, coz je nejvetsi pakarna, jakou Artifex do svych her cpe. Mit volbu misto hidden object screenu (HOS) udelat minihru s dominem je samo o sobe fajn napad. Ale kdyz to daji do achievementu, znamena to jako vzdy, ze hru musite dohrat 2x, coz je desna otrava. A je to jeden z mala minusu jejich her.\nDruhym (subjektivnim) minusem konkretne u teto hry je na muj vkus prece jen hodne kycovite zpracovani, predevsim vyber barevne palety, kdy obrazovky doslova hyri barvami, casto prekypuji ruzemi, keriky a jinymi malymi objekty, to vse v syte zelene, cervene a fialove. Holt zamereno na zeny. Ale tak je to pohadka, takze se to zkousnout da. Namalovane je to opravdu hezky, vcetne HOS, ktere jsou celkem vyzvou. Vizuelne mi to hodne pripominalo \"Enigmatis 2\", dokonce je v bonusove kapitole uplne stejna jedna z miniher.\nPokud chcete hru cesky, musite jako vzdy stahovat z Alawaru. V CE edici dostanete wallpapery, OST ci artworky a zminenou bonusovou epizodu, ktera prodluzuje pribeh, ale nema otevreny konec, jak uz bylo receno, coz je nejvetsi plus hry.

How could you do it?! All your professions of love! All your promises...! They were all lies. Curse you and your heartless kin!\"[/b] \n\nAnd so goes the dramatic intro scene of [i]Grim legends: the forsaken bride[/i]. Not knowing what I was getting myself into, I bought the game at a discounted price after seeing a very good friend play it. I remember looking at the store page and ridiculing it at first, thinking it was a 'stupid, little game'. Well in essence, it actually is that ... But it is so much fun that I told myself to review it right after completing the game. Now that I did, it is time to talk about what this game has to offer.\n\nFirst, I'd like to mention that this game probably won't be for everyone. Just like certain puzzle and point & click games, this game is played by a fairly limited amount of people. Not because it is bad, but because it is a very specific genre (that not everyone will like) that is targeted at a certain audience. So please keep that in mind.\n\nThis game is specified as a HOG (hidden object game) and as its name implies, you play through the game finding hidden objects so that you can advance your adventure. You play through several scenes (or environments) and have to find objects that you can then use for certain actions, puzzles, hidden object scenes ... This pretty much sums up the gameplay and may not sound very exciting, but it's actually very satisfying. Even little and simple actions and puzzles are fun to do and solve.\n\nThe great and calm soundtrack that I hear in the background really makes it a very soothing experience. The story kept me motivated to complete the game, even though it may not have been a unique one. I just loved playing this game inbetween my more 'serious' games and I am grateful that I discovered Artifex Mundi, the creater of amazing HOG's.\n\n[u]I like[/u]\n\n+ A story that is not really unique, but still very enjoyable\n+ Ok voice acting\n+ Great, relaxing soundtrack\n+ Really satisfying gameplay\n+ Difficulty is just about right\n+ Attention to detail\n+ Decent length\n+ Extra little chapter!\n+ Overall fun and engaging experience\n\n[u]I don't like[/u]\n\n- /\nThere's nothing I can think of right now. Maybe that's because this is my first HOG, or maybe that's because AM are amazing developers.\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\n\nI recommend this to all HOG lovers for 100% and 99% to other people who never played a HOG before.

I have played a ton of these HOG games. I was a little disapointed in this game. The game map and direction are very confusing and I had to use the hint button just to find out where I was supposed to go next. I played most of this confused and lost as to what I was to do and how to do it. The game does have a map that tells you their is something to do at this spot. However I was so lost I didnt have any idea what to do or how to do it. Very disapointing in a good looking game like this. My other issue is with the Hidden object puzzles themselves the use a lot of trickery in them. Such as only having 10% of the piece showing so its ultra hard to see many puzzle pieces you need to click on. \n\nThe domino game I was confused by it and frankly it just didnt appeal to me. The game does have a collectable section and it offers 2 different ones. The first is little pixie fairies that you click on to collect those are easy to find. The second one is very tedious to find and sometimes requires you to wait for it to cycle its animation to collect and I didnt collect very many of these as they are almost impossible to find without help. I supose some will like to find these almost impossible to see collectables. I enjoyed the pixies, I did not enjoy pixel hunting for the others. \n\nThe puzzles I  hated almost all of them. Boring, confusing, tedious. TEDIOUS. I hate to say it but a lot the puzzles in this game felt phoned in and were just not that much fun to complete or try to complete. Ugh. \n\n I did like some parts of this game. The kitten you rescue is a great idea and the animation for the cat and the sounds are great. I wish they would have used the cat more in the game. The graphics and sound are excellent. So that brings me around to the story. I found it to be another mixed bag and I was again confused by it  almost till the very end. Also this game has a ton of backtracking and again adds to the confusion of where the player is supposed to go and why. Not the greatest this publisher has ever made in my opinion.

In this case, though, the story seems to have more of a \"female\" slant (revolving more around a relationship, dealing with marriage, and even 1) one puzzle with lingerie and bouquets and 2) one involving makeup).  Not a big thing, but noticeable.  Also, the \"Bonus\" chapter is not really optional:  you can't get all the Achievements without going through it on both runs.  Additionally, the puzzles seem just a tad more difficult to do than in the previous AM games I've played.  And, finally, this game is a bit longer than usual.  Overall, to get 100% Achievements, it took me 14.1 hours:  8.5 hours for the first run-through of the main game, 1.3 hours for the Bonus chapter, and an additional 4.3 hours for the second run-through (on Expert and doing the Domino games).

It\u2019s a genre that doesn\u2019t really need to differ dramatically from game to game (most people come to HOGs for a very specific sort of game, after all), but due to this similarity it\u2019s hard to know what is really worth talking about as one review can typically serve as a blanket recommendation for a particular developer.\n\nAnd yet I continue to review Artifex Mundi\u2019s games because time and again I\u2019ve been surprised at how they\u2019ve managed to diversify their portfolio with HOGs which feel distinct from one another. Each of their games has also managed to incrementally build upon the previous one, creating a sense of continual improvement without being required to introduce any radical changes to a formula that is clearly working (if my count is correct this makes my fifth review of an Artifex Mundi game).\n\nWith this in mind, Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride is a bit of an odd one out. It\u2019s perhaps the most forgettable Artifex Mundi game I\u2019ve yet played (being barely edged out by the first Nightmares of the Deep), but also one of the most ambitious. The narrative for instance is the most layered and complex of any of Artifex Mundi\u2019s games, taking place over a large timeline and even managing to catch me off guard with a few of its twists. That doesn\u2019t make the plot any good, in fact it has largely fallen apart by the end in through a last-ditch effort to justify some of the symbolism seen throughout the game, but I can still appreciate Artifex Mundi attempting to provide a greater substance to their clich\u00e9 ridden narratives and perhaps with a few more attempts will get closer to something legitimately compelling.\n\nGrim Legends other notable contribution is your kitten companion you meet early on. Aside from being absolutely adorable she acts as a helper for certain puzzles in the game, which is a nice change from having to jury-rig random items together all the time. I was disappointed however with how rarely my feline friend actually got to do anything, typically being required to sit and be cute in the corner of the screen even when it would make sense for her to help out. I legitimately forgot numerous times she was even usable for puzzle solving because it was so infrequent a solution utilizing her actually worked. Hopefully animal companions (or whatever fits for a specific game) is a returning feature for Artifex Mundi games going forward and will be given a larger part that actually justifies their inclusion.\n\nOne of the weirdest things about Grim Legends is how it can look incredible during normal gameplay, but every cutscene is a horrendously compressed mess of muddy textures. Perhaps the difference was just closer before, but I can\u2019t recall any of Artifex Mundi\u2019s previous games having such jarring transitions and they became a continual blight on an otherwise extremely pretty game. On the plus side character models have almost made it out of the uncanny valley, though voice acting is still all over the place, unaided by a few grammatical errors which made it into both the spoken and written script.\n\nI say it every time it seems as if I\u2019m heavily criticizing an Artifex Mundi game, but it\u2019s worth noting again that whatever my disappointment with a specific game may be, I\u2019ve still yet to actually dislike anything they\u2019ve put out. I can certainly point to my favorites, but unless you\u2019re predisposed to dislike HOGs you really can\u2019t go wrong with any of their games, Grim Legends included. I suppose then my reviews or their work is less general buying advice and more a quick rundown of where a particular game fits on the arbitrary leaderboard inside my head. In that sense this isn\u2019t very high on the list, but what it tries and fails to do is encouraging enough to make it a worthwhile stepping stone to better things to come.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2015/07/06/grim-legends-the-forsaken-bride-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1436233943, "timestamp_updated": 1436233943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.771862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16912501": {"recommendationid": "16912501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066382847", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449678699}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0433\u043b\u0443 \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430. \u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430...\u043d\u0443 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435", "timestamp_created": 1436201200, "timestamp_updated": 1436201200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16891968": {"recommendationid": "16891968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199226739", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501829726}, "language": "french", "review": "Bon jeu!", "timestamp_created": 1436093428, "timestamp_updated": 1436093428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16872001": {"recommendationid": "16872001", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998635442", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435979952}, "language": "english", "review": "fantastic game.

Brother Bear, Brave, the classic folk tail White-Bear-King-Valemon. Why did it have to be a bear, whyyy. I choose to believe they are paying homage to the classic folk tails. Also the whole twin thing. Instantly upon learning the character is the sister's twin \"welp, for sure they will switch places at some point or other.\" Yessir[/spoiler] The character is a decent 'strong independant young woman' with a few exceptions, like 'my sister's life may be in danger but NO WAY I'm touching this item that I absolutely need to get to her because it has some ants next to it and that's totes ewww.'\n\nBonus points for extremely cute kitten helper.\n\nThe animation in cutscenes in this game seemed better than the last AM games I've played, though the characters still make some creepy faces once in a while.

The staging is nice, good music, not in any way challenging puzzles (but that's expected) and a reasonable story.\n\nThis time there is a twist on the hidden object parts - if you don't fancy them you can play with dominoes instead (and you can actually flip between modes - for example using dominoes to pick up a few items you can't find or switching back to hidden object mode to find items you aren't going to be able to reach with your dominoes.\n\nIt's worth noting that the achievements include the bonus chapter in things like completing all hidden object puzzles without hints so don't expect them to pop at the end of the story. You'll also need at least two playthroughs to get the dominoes and HO achievements (as that's an either or choice). If you mix between them while you play and keep track, the game also does so you can fill in the blanks on your next playthrough. Or if you're me, completely forget and end up playing through three times.\n\nThe game did start to run decidedly slowly with big pauses by the time I hit the third run through.\n\nAs for the girly elements. Well you gain a ridiculously cute kitten as a sidekick. I mean really just insanely adorable. Would like to have seen it used more. *shifty look*  It's also definitely a romance. You will also have to solve such puzzles as  reassembling jewelry, applying makeup, flower arranging, ironing - not to mention the obligatory moments where during your life or death adventure your heroine suddenly refuses to do something because ...eww cobwebs/bugs/vermin. Such moments always make me want to kick the heroine. Luckily for the most part she remains reasonably resourceful and not overly whiny.\n\nAll in all a great example of this genre.

Denn die Gesichter wirken doch sehr k\u00fchl fast schon gruselig, wie in einem schlechten Horrorfilm.\nF\u00fcr ein Hidden-Object-Spiel dass in einer mystischen, vergangenen Zeit stattfindet ist die Comicgrafik absolut passend und stimmig.\nArbeit und Liebe stecken hier nicht nur einfach drin, sondern machen das Spiel aus. Sowohl in Sachen Grafik, als auch in Sachen Handlungsgeschichte.\nZwischen den R\u00e4tselszenen finden sich ab und zu Videosequenzen wieder, die die Geschichte weitererz\u00e4hlen und somit das n\u00e4chste R\u00e4tsel einl\u00e4uten, ohne jedoch aus der zuvor liebevoll gestalteten Atmosph\u00e4re rauszurei\u00dfen.\n\n\n[b][h1]~~~ Bewertung ~~~[/h1][/b]\n\n+ Spannende Geschichte die langzeitmotiviert\n+ Authentische Charaktere sowie Spielwelt\n+ R\u00e4tsel sind teilweise durchaus anspruchsvoll und passen zusammen\n+ Minispiele sind hier passend gew\u00e4hlt\n+ Spielfluss verl\u00e4uft wunderbar ineinander\n+- Kein Openworld (Subjektiv ob positiv oder negativ)\n+- Musik w\u00e4re noch etwas ausbauf\u00e4higer\n- Sprachanimation der Gesichter wirken kalt und wie in einem Gruselkabinett auf dem Jahrmarkt.\n\n\n[b]Wer nicht zu viel Action erwartet und die kleinen Sch\u00f6nheitsfehler verzeihen kann, wird hier seinen Spa\u00df haben.

Initially what drew me to this game was the beautiful art-style, which did not disappoint. The voice acting was pretty lacklustre however, which was disappointing because it almost completely ruined the mysterious and intriguing atmosphere that the beautifully composed soundtrack combined with the art-style had created. \n\nThe story itself was interesting but cliche, making it somewhat predictable. Puzzles weren't too challenging, and I did get a bit tired of playing dominos to unlock necessary objects (dominos being the easier option than some other puzzle). \"It's ok. I'm just in a hurry to save my sister. I've got time for more dominos.\" The final chapter had a LOT of puzzles, which I thought was a little over the top but was probably also serving to build suspense.\n\nThe link between some of the objects and objectives took a bit to figure out - who knew that you could use a diamond earring to cut an opening into a glass window? I didn't!  The amount of times I could have used my jewelry to break into my own house when I'd forgotten my keys will haunt me forever more...Thankfully the hint button refreshes quickly (on casual mode).\n\nArtifex Mundi have created a beautiful-looking game, and it was the combination of the art, music, story and puzzles that was enough to keep me playing until the end of the dark abyss.", "timestamp_created": 1430094556, "timestamp_updated": 1430096652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15550793": {"recommendationid": "15550793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044030124", "num_games_owned": 1745, "num_reviews": 469, "playtime_forever": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429742546}, "language": "english", "review": "I have watched my wife play this game to the end and the story is excellent and the puzzles are good and challenging, even the bonus chapter/content was excellent as well.

Also, I'm not English.

I'm not very bad at English, but these words could be very specific. I'm not sure this game has it, because I played more Artifex Mundi games, but I'm almost sure it has this game.

This game avoids that nicely.\n\nSound and graphics both were excellent.  I felt like a lot of effort went into this game and I'm looking forward to playing the sequel.  It also wasn't a brutally short game like some HO/adventure types.  I got it on sale for about four dollars but I enjoyed it so much, I would say that full price is still worth it.\n\nTL;DR: best game yet from Artifex Mundi, give it a play.", "timestamp_created": 1428295810, "timestamp_updated": 1428295810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500683", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15228563": {"recommendationid": "15228563", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967388128", "num_games_owned": 3482, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428223507}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't normally bother reviewing every HOG I play, as they are pretty similar and existing reviews tend to hit the points people tend to want to know.\n\nBut I realized that I hadn't reviewed an Artifex Mundi title before, so now is as good a time as any to correct that.\n\nArtifex Mundi is, at least on Steam, basically the state of the art of the HOG.\n\nWhat's a HOG? Basically a \"light\" \"point and click\" adventure game characterized by hidden object scenes where you must find objects from a list.\n\nGrim Legends: The Forsaken Bride, the newest title of theirs I've played so far, represents striking production values.\n\nForsaken Bride hits upon all the key points that HOG players look for - pleasing art, a reasonably engaging story, astutely  placed items in hidden item scenes, a mix of not too difficult puzzles, ample handholding for those that need it - and takes it even further:\n\n[h1]Animation[/h1]\n\nThis title is highly animated compared to typical HOGs. Most scenes have moving/wiggling elements - people, vegetation, weather, etc. This makes the game feel much more \"alive\", rather than just a slideshow.\n\nThe numerous cutscenes are also quite well made.\n\n[h1]Little Helper[/h1]\n\nIn addition to using items from your inventory to solve puzzles and progress, sometimes you need assistance from... a kitten.\n\nYep, that's right. A kitten.\n\nReally, it's quite a cheap trick to put a cute kitten into the game, but, of course, it works. Who can argue with a kitten?\n\nMost of the time, the kitten sits quietly in the corner of your interface, but, sometimes, you can \"use\" the kitten like an inventory object to solve a particular situation. Sometimes the kitten starts meowing as a hint that he can be of assistance.\n\nEvery time this happens, you are treated to an animation of the kitten interacting with the scene.\n\n[h1]Elusive Objects[/h1]\n\nThis title has a feature I hadn't seen before. In addition to the more common trope of looking for a type of object (in this case, faeries) across all scenes (in this case, \"regular\", not HO scenes), you can also optionally find \"elusive objects\".\n\nElusive objects are basically objects that... do not quite belong. They also are not constantly present, instead appearing and disappearing at intervals.\n\nThis makes for a welcome change from the typical kind of object hunting. The visual challenge here is distinct - look for something that does not belong/was not there before.\n\nThis proves a quite difficult challenge, but the game helps you by indicating when a scene contains an elusive object.\n\nThese elusive objects, when found, fit into the illustrations of pages of an optional storybook. When you find all 3 objects on a page, you are treated with a small cutscene.\n\nThese pages also serve as another hint for what you are looking for - you can see the outline of the object in the illustration.\n\n[h1]Wrinkles[/h1]\n\nIn an effort to be balanced, I'll mention a few things that were perhaps not as good as they could be:\n\n* The character art is at times a bit awkward (but the voice acting is quite good). Faces especially sometimes come off as unintentionally \"creepy\".\n* A few puzzles are unintuitive and not as well indicated as they could be (e.g. having to construct a water sprayer to put out a lantern), but this is not unusual for games of this type and is a very minor complaint.\n\n[h1]Artifex Mundi[/h1]\n\nArtifex Mundi develops and publishes high quality HOGs. I've yet to be disappointed by one of their titles, so this recommendation can basically be taken to extend to the rest of their titles - I won't bother writing a review for each one.\n\nFor achievement hunters, these titles tend to take about 10-15 hours to 100% without a walkthrough, usually(?) requiring two playthroughs.", "timestamp_created": 1428283574, "timestamp_updated": 1428289314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875862", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15227293": {"recommendationid": "15227293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187394154", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430073691}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked this game a lot!

It involves different environments (scenes) where you look for items to help you to the next step of the story. There is a lot of mini games to, like puzzle solving, hidden objects and domino.

The game is a mystery plot where the story is driven forwards by object puzzles. Most of the objects are found on the various screens of the worlds, but for others you will need to solve a puzzle or find hidden objects.\nThe art is high quality and it is accompanied by a relaxing soundtrack. All dialogue is voice acted, and I have no complaints about any of the voice actors.\n\nWhat makes Grim Legends stand out from other HO games are two things: first, the developer has made it so that every puzzle can be bypassed: either by using the hint/skip button, or by solving a domino slide puzzle instead of the object searching.\nSecondly, during the main story you get a cat companion that helps you solve the puzzles. The cat is nearly always present on the toolbar and actually climbs out to enter the game world, which is a fun and pretty unique concept.\n\nHighly recommended to all hidden object game fans.", "timestamp_created": 1428258705, "timestamp_updated": 1428258705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520726", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15209501": {"recommendationid": "15209501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142934082", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434420262}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr:  Buy it - if only for the adorable kitty helper!  Especially at the current sale price it's well worth it, and I would recommend it even at full price if you have the funds to spare.  If you're still on the fence, go to artifexmundi.com and try the demo - then come back here and buy the game!\n\n---\n\nYour sister is getting married today, and you're hurrying to get home in time for the ceremony.  Suddenly, a bear spooks your horse and almost sends your carriage over a cliff!  You must save the carriage, repair your wedding gift, rescue a cute helper, and get to the village before it's too late.  But this is just the start of your bad luck... it's not long before things take a turn for the worse, and thus begins your quest to rescue the victims, expose the villain, and learn more about your own history in the process.\n\nAlthough I was a fan of point-and-click adventure games back in the day, I'd never played a Hidden Object game and wasn't sure if I'd enjoy one.  However, although there don't seem to be any demos on Steam, Artifex Mundi's own website allows you to try a demo of any of their games.  I spent a few hours on those, and now I'm hooked and want all of them!  :)  All their games of this style employ the same type of interface, which is very easy to use, so once you've tried one you'll be fine for just about any other title.\n\nI found this game to have an engaging story and enjoyable gameplay.  The puzzles and hidden object scenes vary in difficulty and a few had me scratching my head for a while, but I only got frustrated once.  My husband helped me with that one by pointing out something I hadn't thought of, and saved me from having to consult a walkthrough!  Usually there will be some kind of hint in the dialogue or descriptions of a scene, and whenever I felt I couldn't progress it was generally because I'd missed something in a previous location.  There is a map available in this game which allows you to go directly to any previous scene if you wish, eliminating backtracking frustration, and sometimes going back to a recent location will present you with a new hidden object game to allow you to progress further.\n\nIn my opinion the graphics are well done, and although the character animations in the cutscenes can seem a little bit stiff (and the lip-synching is usually off) I didn't feel that this detracted from the overall enjoyment.  The hidden object scenes are highly detailed and beautifully drawn, and some objects in the scenes blend into the background so well that it takes quite a bit of hunting!  (Hint for newcomers to these games: if an item in the list is in a different text colour, you'll need to interact with something(s) in the scene to find or create what you're looking for.  Your cursor will provide clues!)\n\nThere is a hint option if you get stuck, and some (if not all) puzzles and hidden object scenes may be skipped if you wish.  Puzzles can also be replaced with a game of dominoes if you find one too challenging.  There are achievements related to completing puzzles and domino games, so if you like to collect them all you might wish to do one playthrough with puzzles and another with dominoes.\n\nThe music and sound effects fit the game well, with the music adding to the tension of the story at appropriate points.  I generally turn background music way down or completely off in games as I find it distracting, but at a slightly lower volume I found the music in this game added to my enjoyment of the whole experience.\n\nThere are many additional things to find while playing, such as woodland spirits and 'elusive objects'.  I missed one spirit somewhere, and only managed to spot three of the elusive objects.  These are items in scenes which change or are hard to spot, such as a face in the moon.  These objects work to translate text in a book in your Achievements screen, and once you find all the objects for a particular page there is an option to 'hear the story'.  As I haven't completed any pages yet I can't really comment on this, but it's something for me to work towards on my next playthrough!\n\nThis being the Collector's Edition there is an additional episode, taking place after the main story, which is unlocked once you complete the main game.  Although this is much shorter, it still added a couple more hours of fun!  \n\nIn conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and will definitely replay it at some point to try for more achievements and elusive objects.  I would recommend it even at full price, and I look forward to playing many more Artifex Mundi games in the future!\n\n10/10 - would impersonate my twin again.", "timestamp_created": 1428184568, "timestamp_updated": 1428203131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15207623": {"recommendationid": "15207623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091041047", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428521780}, "language": "german", "review": "Hin und wieder spiele ich gerne mit meiner Freundin Wimmelbildspiele, es gibt da viel Schund aber auch einige Perlen. \"The forsaken Bride\" ist auf jeden Fall eine Perle!\nObwohl die Story (wie so oft in diesem Genre) fast schon naiv einfach und vorhersehbar ist, so ist es gerade die Technik und die R\u00e4tsel, die das Spiel zu einem der besten Hidden Object-Spiele machen, die meine Freundin und ich je gespielt haben.

The music is beautifully atmospheric and I found myself surprised that a point and click hidden object game had better music than some AAA titles.\n    [*][b]Graphics[/b]: This game looks stunning for what it is. Everything is vividly coloured and the scenes are a pleasure to take in. Yeah, the graphics aren't fantastic, but it's a point and click game, and it makes an extra effort to look pretty.\n    [*][b]Storyline[/b]: The storyline picks up fast and features a short interactive sequence after the first cutscene to get to grips with how everything works, there's no faffing around getting in to the plot. I will also shamelessly admit that a couple of scenes had me getting a bit teary-eyed, so I can't complain a jot about the story-telling (however I'm a hormonal mess at the best of times, so just bare that in mind :D).\n    [*][b]Difficulty settings[/b]: The game features three different difficulty modes with varying downsides, a bonus if you like a bit of punishment in the brain department.\n    [*][b]Map travel[/b]: Like other Artifex Mundi games, you can quick travel using the map, which saves you a hell of a lot of time. On easier difficulty modes you can also see which areas have actions available which is a good help when you've been scouring every inch of every screen for a while!\n    [*][b]Achievements[/b]: The game features a good amount of achievements which are relatively easy to accomplish (most coming from the natural progression of the storyline), making this game a good buy for people who like to 100% things.\n    [*][b]Extra game[/b]: You get access to an extra, short game called The Abyss following the completion of the main story. What it lacks in duration it more than makes up for in content and boasts a couple extra achievements for those interested.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n    [*][b]Game interface[/b]: The UI can get a bit irritating at times, namely the massive bar that pops up at the top of the screen when you interact with things. When on the hidden object parts, clicking an interactive object before you have the corresponding piece will block off a chunk of the top of the screen. It can also feel a bit cluttered at times because of this. Not a massive issue, though when going for the timed achievements (such as getting x number of hidden objects within x seconds) it can be a bit of a hinderance.\n    [*][b]Footsteps[/b]: This was the single most annoying thing in the entire game for me, which is silly in hindsight because it's such a small issue. Basically, whenever you move from scene to scene, you hear your character's footsteps. When you consider moving from room to room fairly quickly it grates - though this could just be me.\n    [*][b]Buttons[/b]: This is again to do with the UI, but a different issue. There's a few buttons at the bottom of the screen that let you click to see how many bonus hidden objects you've found (in this game it's fairies and out of place items, in a few Artifex Mundi games it's been seahorses and the like), however it's right next to the map button, which means you can accidentally hit the wrong button. Again, this is more of a pet peeve for me, especially when I did it four times in a row (lel).\n    [*][b]Voice and text[/b]: Unfortunately there are a few typos in the game, mainly missed words as opposed to spelling errors. There are some discrepancies between what is written and what the characters say. While it's a small error it's one I feel diminishes just how well made this game is.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Minor issues/mentions[/b]\nThe [b]voice acting[/b] can be a bit wonky at times, I remember a couple of scenes where it sounded like the voice actor had never heard a particular word they were saying. However the majority of the game features great voice acting.\nSome [b]interactive areas[/b] were a little too big, meaning you'd end up clicking the same place again thinking it was somewhere different due to the distance from the object on the screen.\nThe [b]little kitty follower[/b] you get early on is definitely a major highlight of the game, I never tired of seeing it drag it's cute little butt over the UI to help me out.\nI also swore blind one of the voice actors was the guy who played Randy in Trailer Park Boys, certainly made those scenes more enjoyable.\n\nOverall I loved this game, it's of a length that you can replay it without taking too much time out of your day.

Durante i preparativi, qualcosa per\u00f2 va storto, un orso che sembra avere una vera e propria personalit\u00e0 cerca a tutti i costi di rapire vostra sorella per impedire il lieto evento. Come mai? Che intenzioni avr\u00e0? Il corso degli eventi sar\u00e0 sempre pi\u00f9 ricco di colpi di scena fino ad arrivare ad un finale che sveler\u00e0 tutto riportando anche alla luce una maledizione e una storia di ben 25 anni prima.

Tra i vari giochi che vertono sul genere dei punta e clicca, devo dire che questo assieme agli altri episodi degli stessi creatori, sono gli unici che mi hanno preso e mi sono piaciuti davvero tanto in quanto per risolvere enigmi non dovrete fare un quadro alla volta ma, il gioco vi costringer\u00e0 a pensare con la vostra testa sull'utilit\u00e0 di un determinato oggetto che avrete nell'inventario o in mano stessa, ma sopratutto dove dovrete usarlo, se avete lasciato indietro qualcosa di incompiuto o quel qualcosa sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9 avanti. Sono presenti tre difficolt\u00e0 di gioco, le quali realmente renderanno, a seconda di quale scegliete, i rompicapi sempre pi\u00f9 difficili. Se completate la storia, sar\u00e0 disponibile un episodio extra collegato alle vicende principali, potete scegliere di giocarlo o meno, ma sappiate che alcuni Achievements non sono sbloccabili se non proseguirete. Oltre a quest'ultimi sono presenti anche carte da collezione.

Per fortuna scende molto durante i saldi di Steam rispetto al suo prezzo corrente oppure \u00e8 possibile trovarlo assieme agli altri episodi della saga nei siti di Bundle o Key.

Personalmente mi \u00e8 piaciuto molto dunque termino con un pollice in su e lo consiglio.

Second the puzzles are very creative and fun though some are a little to vague on what they expect you to do and it can get a little frustrating as you have to figure the whole process out before you can even start working out the puzzle itself. Its nice that you have some choices in the game should you get stuck, not in the mood for a hidden puzzle? Play dominos instead. That puzzle got you stumped? Just skip it.  \n\nI found the story a bit shallow but nicely delivered and it was a fun challenge trying to find all the elusive objects and sprites. Its surprising there's no achievement for that as they can be\u2026 well elusive but all I can say is keep your eyes pealed cause you could be looking right at one and still miss it. Naturally some might find this kind of game boring because it works on a more relaxed pace that forces you to slow down and use your brain to work out the problem but I liked being able to take my time and enjoy the atmosphere rather then speed though it guns blazing. It\u2019s a nice change from shooting monsters and beating up bad guys. \n\nIts not for everyone though so if your impatient or prefer more action in your games I'd avoid this one, it will ether drive you insane or put you to sleep.

This particular game is the first, and one of the [i]best[/i] Artifex games that I've played to date.\n\n [b]If you're new to the Artifex universe, I highly recommend that this be the first AM game you play.[/b]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Grim Legends holds AM's best artwork. The locations you will visit are enchanting.\n- Fantastic storyline that drives the player to play more\n- Great for kids and adults alike\n- Various difficulties (as in all AM games)\n- Various styles of hint systems with adjusting difficulty\n- Just an all around solid, great game\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- A Short game, even combined with the Bonus content. If you like Artifex Mundi games, you already know that many of them are short games. AM is changing this with their newer releases such as [i]Grim Legends 2[/i] or [i]Nightmares of the Deep 3[/i].\n- Some of the voice work, while nice and clear, are a bit overplayed or cheesy, but it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the game or the story line. This is also a feature that is currently being vastly improved with newer Artifex games.\n\n[b] Verdict?[/b] - [b]8/10[/b] \nGrim Legends is probably one of Artifex's best titles. It is family friendly and is fun for all ages. This is just a fantastic game for anyone who enjoys hidden object games, puzzles, or just great adventure/fairy tale stories. I can very confidently say that I am ecstatic that I found this game, otherwise I would not have found Artifex Mundi. A high recommendation.\n\nIf you're curious about any other Artifex Mundi games, I have and will continue to do many reviews on their great titles. If you liked the Grim Legends title, [i]Grim Legends 2[/i] is currently available on Steam as well.

Some of the solutions don't make a lot of sense (nor do some of the hidden objects you have to find), but if you ever get stuck, you can fall back on the hint system to make regular progress. \n\nWhile it can be absorbing to seek solutions hidden within the beautiful images, it bothers me that there is only one solution to every puzzle. Sometimes the \u201ccorrect\u201d solution makes less sense than something I came up with on my own. Also bothersome is the protagonist's tendency to leave behind useful items like a knife or a rope, only to search for new ones in the next puzzle. I'd like Artifex Mundi games more if they had flexibile puzzle solutions (like the Deus Ex games), encouraging creativity and improving replay value.\n\nAs long as Artifex Mundi sticks to their formula, they are unlikely to make a game better than Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride. I can't complain too much, though; simple, bite-sized games like this can be very satisfying to play once in a while, especially in an environment populated by so many long games. \n\n(Rating: 7.5/10 \u201cGood\u201d)", "timestamp_created": 1420573221, "timestamp_updated": 1420604433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13796995": {"recommendationid": "13796995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067208458", "num_games_owned": 5952, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420243972}, "language": "english", "review": "Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride is my third hidden objects game (I bought a bundle with lots of them).\nThe graphics are fine as well as the background music, and, to me, this game looks like a thriller movie : you have to go through a story with almost no difficulty and enjoy the scenario, even though there is nothing surprising, but that is still fine.\nCompared to the first two games I have completed, I think this one is a little bit better : the story is well written, the atmosphere of this game fits perfectly with everything (music, graphics, characters, story, games, ...)  and the dominos games are pretty entertaining !\nJust play the game twice to unlock all the achievements (you have to play some mini-games with dominos or hidden objects which requires two runs), it is easy, ~7-8 hours should be enough for a \"100% achievement\" !", "timestamp_created": 1420243855, "timestamp_updated": 1420243855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.405813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13727848": {"recommendationid": "13727848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092065417", "num_games_owned": 1170, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419991644}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, I have to admit....out of all the Artifex Mundi games on Steam, this is one of the few that feels most like an adventure game, even though it is a casual game.

The quality of the visuals, music and voice acting are both superb for the genre (I was especially amazed by the smooth, but still painted-looking animations.) The game brings all the features of modern HO games, map, hints, selectable difficulty level, easy puzzles, lots of achievements and collectables and an alternative for HO scenes (in this game it's domino).\n\nThe plot is good too for the genre, not too blatantly obvious, though not that surprising either. I liked how it's not about a guy saving a love interest, but a woman trying to save her sister. And I loved the ending a lot! The focus was different than most HO games I've played.\n\nIn the first half of the game instead of word-list HO scenes, the player has to combine items based on images. I haven't met with this type of HO scene before, it was refreshing after the endless word-lists of other games.\n\nThe only thing I kinda missed is the feature they had in 'SEASON OF MYSTERY: The Cherry Blossom Murders' where if you click on an object in a HO scene, it shows the item's silhouette.\n\nThere were some genre-typical ridiculous elements, like having to light up a torch with a ray of focused light in a multi-step puzzle, next to a field of dozens of candles.

Most of the Artifex Mundi games on Steam are hidden object games, and all of the ones I've played have been of very high quality. But when I started playing The Forsaken Bride, I knew it was something special.\n\nFirst, lets talk about the gameplay. The hidden object scenes and puzzles are basically the same as any other Artifex Mundi game. Items are collected or created through hidden object scenes, and are also collected through exploration of the world. You explore and interact with the world using items you collect, and some of these items are used in various puzzle games. Many puzzle games are similar to those found in other Artifex Mundi games, but I found the ones in The Forsaken Bride to be more refined, varied and challenging.\n\nI've always found the atmosphere and music to be phenomenal when it comes to Artifex Mundi games, and The Forsaken Bride is no exception. In addition, I found the artwork to be hauntingly beautiful.\n\nWhat stood out to me most was the story. The execution was nearly flawless, and there was a depth and subtle intricacy that I had not found in previous Artifex Mundi games. That's not to say that the stories in other Artifex Mundi games are bad (they're actually quite good), but the story in The Forsaken Bride is truly a step above the rest.\n\nThe Forsaken Bride is the best hidden object game I've yet played, and may very well be the best Artifex Mundi game to date.", "timestamp_created": 1419046286, "timestamp_updated": 1420006320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13431770": {"recommendationid": "13431770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102539759", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419293490}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not a fan of the Point & Click genre but after reading the good reviews for this game, I decided to buy it and I wasn't disappointed...\n\nGrim Legends: The Forsaken Bride has a great story with a good level of difficulty (not too easy, not too hard either) and nice graphics!

Compared to other Artifex Mundi titles, I would rate it on par with \"Nightmares of the Deep: The Cursed Heart.\"\n\nThe artwork for both the backgrounds and the puzzles is beautiful, as is expected for an AM game, but some of the character designs and cutscenes were a bit of a letdown.  (\"I'm going to go change into my wedding dress, that looks just like my normal dress, that looks exactly the same as a third dress hanging in my room...\")  \n\nThe gameplay combines several types of puzzles including:\n1. Traditional hidden object screens (clearly denoted by shiny sparkles in casual mode).\n2. \"I Spy\"-style fairy finding.  These special sprites appear on almost every close-up location detail screen.\n3.  Elusive disappearing-reappearing images.  These objects blend into the larger location backgrounds and slowly fade in and out of view.  Collecting them gives you additional plot background, but they can be tricksome to locate.  \n4. Classic adventure gaming puzzles.  (i.e. Find objects, use/combine with other objects, backtrack everywhere)\n5. Recipes.  AM loves their crafting worktables.\n6. Mini-games.  Incredibly easy time-wasters and brainteasers such as interlocking puzzles, tile-swapping, rotating pieces, matching symbols, and general pattern recognition.\n\nThey also threw in a cat companion who counts as a special use item, which I found to be a fun little gimmick.\n\nI started on Expert mode, and only got stuck twice (figuring out what to do with the ladder, and figuring out how to light the torch.)  Everything else was pretty straightforward.  If you are a veteran of the genre, you will most likely be playing on auto-pilot.  \n\nMy biggest complaint was actually the pacing.  They tried to build in a learning curve for new players, but it just makes the start of the game feel very slow and tedious, and the end of the game feel like a flash-round, mini-game gauntlet.  This becomes an added issue when some of the achievements are not only time-challenges (like 1-minute dominoes), but can only be earned in story mode.  If you miss those achievements on the first playthrough, have fun slogging through tutorial mode all over again, or replaying the bonus level ad nauseum, just to get to an applicable puzzle.  (It doesn't help that you are already required to fully play through the game twice over if you want to earn all of the achievements.)\n\nI will say that for once with an AM game, I found the bonus level gameplay more enjoyable than the main story.

Spannende Story, wundersch\u00f6ne Hintergr\u00fcnde und abwechslungsreiche Gestaltung der Spielorte. Es handelt sich hierbei nicht nur um ein reines Wimmelbildspiel, sondern es ist eher ein adventureartiges Spiel mit Wimmelbild- und R\u00e4tselelementen. Gegen Ende wird es mit den R\u00e4tseln etwas einseitig und im Spielmodus \"leicht\" ist jede Aufgabe schnell schaffbar. Man kann aber auch auf normal oder schwer spielen und hat dann l\u00e4nger was vom Spiel. Die Dialoge sind zugegebenerma\u00dfen sehr einfach gestrickt und von einem \"echten\" Adventure meilenweit entfernt. Da ich das Spiel im \"Halloween-Sale\" erstanden habe (es hat da ca. 1.50-2,50\u20ac gekostet), finde ich es seinen Preis f\u00fcr die kurze Spielzeit auch wert. Mehr als 5\u20ac w\u00fcrde ich daf\u00fcr allerdings nicht bezahlen wollen und warte daher immer auf die Sale-Angebote. : ) Gruselig ist das Spiel im \u00fcbrigen \u00fcberhaupt nicht. Nur das Bonus-Level, welches nach dem Durchspielen freigeschaltet wird, hat gruselige Bildelemente (psychedelische Umgebung, Totenk\u00f6pfe, Altare usw.) An einer Stelle merkt man auch sehr stark, dass die bevorzugte Zielgruppe der Spielemacher wohl Frauen sein sollen, da im Spiel sehr oft Klischees zu weiblichen Idealen und Tr\u00e4umen bedient werden (Kosmetik, Romantik, Heirat usw.)

Jump map, little backtracking, adjustable difficulty.  On casual difficulty, hints recharge very quickly.  \n\nHidden object scenes are very seldom straightforward. Usually there's a fun twist or two to them, but if you find them tiresome or frustrating, you can choose to play dominos instead.  \n\nPuzzles are varied and as far as I can remember never repeated.  (If any WERE repeated, this was so inoffensive that it didn't stick in my memory.)\n\nArt, cut scenes and animations are of high quality for this genre and release year.  Voice acting is appropriate and never sounds amateurish (a common pitfall in these games).

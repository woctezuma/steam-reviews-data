It does a wonderful job of building tension as you're wandering through the woods with the beautiful soundtrack. The puzzles are all satisfyingly challenging (though that does not extend to the achievements; a couple are strangely obtuse for no reason but are at least easy to obtain with a guide). \nMost of all, I appreciate the in-game encyclopedia of the folklore inspiring the game. Read through it as soon as I started up the game, and I felt like it really added to the experience, knowing a bit about the creatures I would run into. Also did a good job of really setting the tone for the game.\nThe two endings do leave something to be desired, but (for what feels like the first time ever) I wasn't too put off by this. For me, Year Walk was very much about the journey rather than the destination. The story, when we get down to it, is frustratingly heartbreaking.

In theory, if the participant survived or passed certain tests during the Walk, he would be able to see into the future.\n  \nDone on nights that were believed to be more magically and spiritually charged than others, such as new years eve, Christmas eve, and solstices, the participant was required to deprive himself of food, rest, and light for a day before making his way through the woods to the nearest churchyard. It was there, if he was deemed worthy enough, he could learn his fate and the fates of others in the year to come.\n\nIn the game, you are one such individual, and making your way to the churchyard is your task.\n\nBut you are not alone in the woods.\n\nThe demons, sprites, and figments of folklore surround you and test you on your journey. They do not wish you well, and they will make you prove your worth in the woods. There are light puzzles you must solve, usually revolving around backtracking and fetching...things...which can get very dull. Fortunately they are short, save one, which I highly recommend using headphones for, otherwise you will more than likely have difficulty. You\u2019ll know it when you get to it. I almost wish this one wasn\u2019t in the game, though the conclusion of it will stick with you for quite some time.\n\nIn fact, most of the game will likely stick with you. The spirits of the woods are subtle yet terrifying to the core. The sounds of the woods are quiet and haunting. The color palate is soft, yet foreboding. The in game encyclopedia is a wonderful, and for one of the puzzles, required, read. Or at least a quick scroll through. I won\u2019t spoil for what here, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s one of the best uses of an in game encyclopedia I have ever seen. Though nobody may say so directly, Year Walk is an often subtle, a few times not so subtle, short, horror adventure.\n\nIf you can get past the odd, mobile-friendly navigation of practically strafing through the world instead of walking through it, as well as the aforementioned backtracking, you should definitely play this, especially if it\u2019s on sale. It\u2019s not long at all, a couple hours at most, but very meaty and entertaining for those couple hours. There are incentives to replay, too, through some mysterious achievements. Year Walk will frighten you, scare you at times, and chill you almost constantly. Maybe even frustrate you, or stump you. But yes, you should definitely give it a go.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, I think we all, at one point or another in our lives, have wished we could know some of what our futures hold for us. Though debates could rage at what the idea of seeing the future means to us. Some would want to know it all; some would not want to know anything about what is to come. Some could say the future can be changed; some would say everything is written in stone. Some would say if they knew their future they would try to change it; others would say they would leave it alone, come what may. Year Walk offers a glimpse into a world where such discussions would have merit beyond character studies and musings. Where such a privilege would have to be earned in a dangerous world, in a snowy evening, in a churchyard.\n", "timestamp_created": 1514730776, "timestamp_updated": 1514730776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38898207": {"recommendationid": "38898207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025263883", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514720024}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Year Walk[/i] is small, beautiful, and haunting.

Scary! Rich in lore! Beautiful to look at! I enjoyed almost 100% of Year Walk.\n\nPositives:\n\nThere is something extremely delicious about a game that encourages you to have a notebook handy to keep track of clues and write down hints. And it's doubly good in a snowy icy world, for the same reasons I love mysteries set in a snowed-in cabin or the remote northern woods in winter. You become the cold but determined detective and the sheer joy of solving clues is enough to pull you forward. Year Walk really delivers on the atmosphere, you can tell it is lovingly crafted with a deep interest in Swedish lore in mind. Maybe because I typically get through games slower than most people, my natural tendency to take my time and enjoy the view helped me become quite immersed in the game. \n\nThe horror of Year Walk is very beautiful, some jump scares but also subtle reveals, eerie atmosphere, and the game likes to mess around with the fourth wall a tiny bit. There are parts that are scary, parts that are sad, and some parts are just lovely to see play out. The sound design helps add to the scariness and is very, very well done. It is all very memorable and you will surely have a favorite moment or two by the end that will stick in your head for a while. The eerie atmosphere never gets old, and I loved that it never relied on gore or violence to frighten me, but well crafted visual cues, dark implications, and building tension. You truly feel you are on the precipice between the real world and some strange spirit world, and there is an increasing sense of dread as you progress that maybe the spirit world really isn't a place for humans, much less one lonely human in the middle of the night on new years eve.\n\nNegatives: \n\n The gosh darn singing puzzle really got my knickers in a twist.I would recommend trying this puzzle for a little while to be properly immersed in the game, because being hopelessly lost in the woods with bizarre singing and your life on the line is part of the story, and hell if this puzzle doesn't perfectly put you in that mindset. But just have a guide ready, scribble the solution out on your notebook ahead of time so you have it, because it relies ENTIRELY on your quality of hearing and you will be one step closer to madness with each failed attempt. You might still have to try it a couple times with the guide, even. It's one of the most frustrating puzzles I've run up against in a game.\n\nOther things I didn't like where very minor. For the most part this was a very smooth experience. Every once in a while I got stumped because the next action you take is to click and drag something, and you can tell in these moments this game was made for an iPad. There is one area near the end of the game I was excited to uncover but there was surprisingly little to discover there and we never had a reason to go back to it, at least in the first playthrough (I only played through once), so that was a smidge disappointing. \n\nIn closing:\n\nYear Walk is memorable, well made, and throughly spooky. There are some replayability incentives, though I can imagine it getting a little tedious playing through the game back to back. It will be a game I pick up again once I've forgotten enough of the scares and I'm ready to be frightened alone in the snowy woods again. For anyone who loves horror games it's a must, and even those who typically aren't fond of the genre will find a genuinely interesting narrative and enjoyable game.\n\nTldr/; Great game. Some minor bumps with one really frustrating puzzle (get a guide for the singing puzzle ahead of time). Take your time, it's beautiful and scary and worth it.

You play as Daniel Svensson, a young man who on the New Year's Eve 1893 decides to undergo the ancient rite of \u00e5rsg\u00e5ng (i.e. year walk). During your \u00e5rsg\u00e5ng you encounter various mythical beasts and creatures as you wander around the small village and solve puzzles.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe 2D visuals are fairly basic but they are also quite stylish and atmospheric. The mythical creatures are well realized too. Overall the visuals are well done and fit the grim theme extremely well.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe game has a great moody soundtrack and the sound effecs are well done too. There's no voice acting.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nMost of your time in Year Walk will be spent wandering around the map and looking for puzzles to solve to progress the story. The game doesn't give you too many directions and often the puzzles are rather obtuse. On a more positive note the PC version has an extensive hint system, so getting completely stuck is rare.\n\nThere's very little dialogue in the game and almost no items to use. The puzzles have some variety at least, although personally I thought they were bit of a hit and miss.\n\nYear Walk also uses a rather curious movement system. While exploring a location you are always facing the same way and can only move sideways. At specific spots you can follow a path up or down and move to a different area. This system is slightly confusing at first, but on a positive note the game does feature a solid map system.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nWhile the puzzles are not terribly complex, many of them are rather obtuse and it's fairly easy to get stuck for a while. \n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nYear Walk was originally made for iOS and it certainly shows to some extent. The controls are passable enough with mouse and keyboard too, but some actions are slightly tricky to perform.\n\n[h1]Story and Writing[/h1]\nMuch of the game is based on research by Swedish folklore expert Theodor Almsten and it certainly shows. The setting and the characters feel authentic and overall the writing is very solid.\n\nThe narrative itself is quite interesting too, although I would have liked to see more of the story told in the game itself instead of the encyclopedia and the journal.\n\nWithout spoiling too much the game also has two separate endings. Finishing the game the first time around will give you some hints that will help you reach a second alternate ending. It's by no means a happy ending, but in many ways it's a more satisfying one.\n\n[h1]Bugs and Glitches[/h1]\nI didn't encounter any major bugs and overall the game was quite polished.\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nOverall I found Year Walk a pretty solid adventure game. It is extremely atmospheric and the story is quite interesting too. Unfortunately the gameplay isn't particularly interesting and the puzzles can be bit too obtuse. Still, I would recommend the game, especially if you are interested in ancient folklore.\n\nIt took me 1.5 hours to reach both the endings.", "timestamp_created": 1501232036, "timestamp_updated": 1501232036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33836130": {"recommendationid": "33836130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094177172", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501170576}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is a masterpiece, every single aspect of it is stunning", "timestamp_created": 1501172483, "timestamp_updated": 1501172483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33773432": {"recommendationid": "33773432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044569814", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500928036}, "language": "german", "review": "Artstyle und Sound in welche man sich hineinlegen, darin aufgehen will.

Just ask me. I've watched Moomins when I was young, you can't scare me that easy. I know what to expect and I expect a lot of snow, some weird creatures hidden in the darkness and the flickering lights in the distance. So, a year walk? Sign me in.\n\nFirst of all, you go into a forest, a creepy one, expecting to find an answer you were seeking for so long. A Year Walk is nothing more or less but a complex, eerie adventure which uses no cheap horror elements to scare you. You will feel insecure anyway because of the overall atmosphere and music emerging from all the characters and the places you will encounter. And then, when you start solving the puzzles you will uncover the truth, meeting more and more strange beings taken directly from the folklore. Thanks to the encyclopedia provided you can learn more about them.\nSo, you expect a big reveal, a true horror at the end, going there tirelessly, only to be left with more answers and a chill down your spine. \n\nYou will travel a lot, but the map is a great asset, marking all the important spots, allowing to find more information. Traveling from a place to place you solve simple puzzles and receive just some basic hints (and you can get more of them on demand if you are stuck). At some point, you will also get an opportunity to unblock some additional features, a journal, and a hidden ending. So, yes, there's a replay value, but as you know the solution to most of the riddles you can complete the plot faster every time (and there's an achievement for that). Your dedication is always rewarded.\n\nThe visuals are the strongest part of the Year Walk, creating a great atmosphere, which allows you to experience the game fully. It's a short, yet nice game for a long winter evening. After all, when else would it be relevant...\n\nMy final rating? - 8/10\n\n+ The overall atmosphere of the game.\n+ The well captured beauty of a Scandinavian folklore.\n+ All the lore provided by the developers.\n+ A mix of both horror and an adventure game.\n\n- Some puzzles might be too complex (but there are hints provided by the game!), requiring taking some additional personal notes.\n- The controls might be annoying at first.", "timestamp_created": 1499089775, "timestamp_updated": 1499089775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33167203": {"recommendationid": "33167203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314696762", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498536858}, "language": "english", "review": "First played this game on mobile back when it initially came out.

The jumpscare as of recent in horror has become what autotune is in the modern music industry. A tool for an artist to improve their art, not a means to cover up a lack of talent by littering one's creation with it, and Year Walk does a great job of using this tool alongside it's many others to craft a uniquely unsettling experience.\n\nHorror as a genre in gaming is something that can be hard to keep consistently impartial. When a player only ever sees other characters as something to be scared of, the fear becomes one-dimensional very quickly as almost everything that moves is an obvious threat to the player. I've dropped horror games before because i'm sick of being pulled along while the game rapid fire tries to scare me with loud noises and flashing imagery. However the eerie creepiness of Year Walk just comes naturally as it's often unclear when and if the player should be scared. Between the light safety and the dark horror lies a gray area that Year Walk hides itself amoung: fear of the unknown.\n\nThe in game encyclopedia, should the player chose to read it, gives information about the act of Year Walking as well as the five supernatural creatures asociated with it who are all said to pose a threat psyically, mentally, and spiritually. This, alongside all beasts being associated with death or murder in some way immediately sets the expectation for them to be the enemies, or the \"scary\" part, of this horror game. However there is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it, and the entire buildup for said bang is done inside the player's head. This also creates a sharp contrast with the rest of the game, as the player is put on edge, yet the snowy landscape and ambiance is eerily peaceful.\n\nYear Walk is a puzzle game that is a compelling narrative first, and also just so happens to be scary because of the expectation that the game influenced me to create for myself by making me come face to face with the unknown and entrusting it to continue. This game is horror done so so right, and it's a shame it almost went under my radar, don't let the same happen to you. It's an experience I wish more could experience so that we could stop giving attention to the shit that Youtubers play for reactions.\n\n10/10 Redefined my standards for horror games.", "timestamp_created": 1498838160, "timestamp_updated": 1498838238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773700", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33018290": {"recommendationid": "33018290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116234442", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514793161}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no words to describe how incredible this game was.

As everyone agrees with, including negative reviews, the art style of this game is astounding as well as the inclusion of Nordic folklore.\n    \n    Not only is this game based off of folklore, but it even includes an in-game encyclopedia. Another thing I admire about the ue of these subjects, is the creatures and practices in this game are not really well known. The Year Walk itself has been lost through the decades and the developers resurrected the experience using this game. Not only does the encyclopedia bring real world aspects into the game, but the hidden journal at the end as well. I was stunned at the way the game almost turned into an ARG (Alternate Reality Game). \n    [spoiler] At the end of the game, you must walk again. If you remeber the \"puzzle box\" in the forest, then you'll rewally appreciate the journals. The creator of the game implemented himself into the game, almost as if your own experience is a rendition of his own. I won't spoil anymore for those who want to check it out, but I really think it's worth doing so. [/spoiler]\n    Many of the negative comments talk about the puzzles themselves and the need for a walkthrough or the short length of the game, but I think that's what makes this game even more alluring. During year walks, the walker has little to no idea what to expect. We're just thrown into the game and are left to firgure things out for ourselves. This could end up being quite frustrating, but it also adds to realism. At first glance, the game does seem rather short, but if you are up for some exploring and reading some lore, this game could take hours.\n    Over all I think this game was definetly worth playing more than once. The art style was amazing, there were some scary aspects, and intriguing backstories. The combination of a game and ARG was something I've never seen before and the journals gave off an uneasy feeling which was very enjoyable. The storyline wasn't uprfront which forces you to immerse yourself into the game. I'll give it a 9/10 only because of the length.", "timestamp_created": 1496935331, "timestamp_updated": 1496935868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32259046": {"recommendationid": "32259046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169786018", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496959029}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1] JUEGAZO [/h1]\n\nComo siempre, p\u00edllalo en rebajas y g\u00f3zalo.

The player will learn about the various Swedish folklore as they traverse through the winter landscapes and try to glance into what would become of the future. \n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\n[b]Visuals:[/b] Let's begin with the graphics. The art style is designed around geometric shapes and straight lines, being quite well polished and creating a unique artstyle and brings the atmosphere of this game to life. The colors used in the game consists mainly of black and white, which is greatly compliments the aesthetic tone of the setting. At the end of the game, the artist includes a section where the artstyle is very geometric and focuses on the simplicity of shapes, of which I thought was very interesting choice for the finale. Overall, the graphics are very pleasing to look at and crafted thoroughly. \n\nRating: A\n\n[b]Music/Sound:[/b] As a horror game, Year Walk provides its fair share of suspensful sound effects that fits well into the player's experience. The jingles that play after completing certain puzzles are also quite rewarding and a nice touch added into the game. The soundtrack is composed by Daniel Ols\u00e9n, in which he sets in an amazingly atmospheric mood with each of his tracks, based upon the instruments found in Swedish folk music. Definitely one of my favorites in video games and one I find myself returning to. \n\nRating: A\n\n[b]Story:[/b] The story of Year Walk is quite simple and easy to follow, although there is definitely a twist in the end that I choose not to spoil for those who still have not played the game yet. A young man wants to gaze into the future, in which he decides to perform an ancient ritual in upon Nordic history, known as the yearwalking. The game goes in depth upon yearwalking as you progress with the game, but I find it rather fascinating along with the rest of the Swedish mythologies that the developers have implemented into the game, each with their own overviews. There's really not much to complain, as the story keeps you emmersed into the very end.\n\nRating: A\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] As a puzzle game, Year Walk provides a display of interesting puzzles that utilies many varieties of techniques. The player will have to be both observant and think outside the box for each one, and they definitely provide a new challenge each one you stumble upon. It flows quite well and weaves into the story, both complimenting each other through, holding up the atmosphere of mystery along with horror. The creativity that are used within the puzzles are probably my favorite aspect of this entire game, and is a wonder to play through.\n\nRating: A\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nYear Walk shines through all of the aspects of an enjoyable game and brings it to a new level. Its uniqueness and lore-filled gameplay will have the player interested in finding out more about its Nordic origins. The twist ending provides the player with an even stronger sense of determination to truely find out about what the yearwalking is all about. I suppose the only complaint would be that this game is definitely on the short side, which is both a positive and a negative attribute, depending on how you look at it. \n\nFinal Rating: A", "timestamp_created": 1492126012, "timestamp_updated": 1492548542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31033639": {"recommendationid": "31033639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249590762", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491718974}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[h1] \u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684\u6050\u6016\u89e3\u5bc6\u6e38\u620f[/h1] \n\n[list]\n    [*][b]\u5267\u60c5[/b] \u6709\u70b9\u77ed\uff0c\u89e3\u5bc6\u4e0d\u96be\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\u3002[spoiler] \u6574\u4e2a\u6545\u4e8b\u53ea\u6709\u51e0\u4e2a\u7a81\u7136\u7684\u6050\u6016\u955c\u5934\uff0c\u5927\u5bb6\u4e0d\u8981\u6015   \u03a3(\u3063 \u00b0\u0414 \u00b0;)\u3063[/spoiler] \n    [*][b]\u97f3\u4e50[/b]  \u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u6c14\u6c1b\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u5f88\u6709\u611f\u89c9\n    [*][b]\u753b\u9762[/b]  \u5f88\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u79cd\u753b\u9762\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u6050\u6016\u6545\u4e8b\u5f88\u6709\u611f\u89c9 ( \u2022\u0300 \u03c9 \u2022\u0301 )y\n[/list]\n\n [*][b]\u7f3a\u70b9[/b]  \u5267\u60c5\u77ed\uff0c\u6b63\u5982\u5176\u4ed6\u73a9\u5bb6\u6240\u8bf4\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u878d\u5165\u5230\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u60c5\u8282\u8fd8\u8981\u770b\u5197\u957f\u7684\u82f1\u6587\uff0c\u5f88\u96be\u53d7\n\n\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u8fd8\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u4e0a\u624b  \u55ef~ o(*\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3*)o", "timestamp_created": 1491719732, "timestamp_updated": 1491719732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31020551": {"recommendationid": "31020551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208953631", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491667236}, "language": "english", "review": "very intresting. a game that makes you stop and think.", "timestamp_created": 1491667266, "timestamp_updated": 1491667266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30962327": {"recommendationid": "30962327", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979922053", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483171565}, "language": "english", "review": "A spooky and thoroughly enjoyable exploration/puzzle game.

My advice would be enjoy the game first, then mop up the ones left over with a guide in hand.\n\n[b]Rating: 8/10\nIce Walk With Me[b]", "timestamp_created": 1491403832, "timestamp_updated": 1491404389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596406", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30881526": {"recommendationid": "30881526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009613545", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471185110}, "language": "english", "review": "Very interesting and atmospheric crepy game.", "timestamp_created": 1491067105, "timestamp_updated": 1491067105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30869774": {"recommendationid": "30869774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112647899", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501136541}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc5e0\uc30d \uc624\uc84b\ub2e4 \uc9dd\uc9dd\uc9dd\uc9dd\uc9dd\uc9dd", "timestamp_created": 1491030439, "timestamp_updated": 1491030439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30850204": {"recommendationid": "30850204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183072361", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490962258}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6700\u65e9\u73a9\u7684\u662fios\u7248\n\u4ee4\u4eba\u611f\u52a8\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u753b\u98ce\u6e05\u65b0\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u5317\u6b27\u98ce\u3002\u4e2a\u4eba\u8bc4\u520610/10\uff0c\u591a\u5c11\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u70b9\u79c1\u5fc3\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4e5f\u7684\u786e\u503c\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002\n\u5267\u60c5\u548c\u89e3\u8c1c\u90fd\u662f\u4f9d\u636e\u745e\u5178\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u6c11\u95f4\u4f20\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e00\u53e3\u6c14\u73a9\u4e0b\u6765\u53ef\u4ee5\u79f0\u5f97\u4e0a\u662f\u9707\u64bc\u3002[spoiler] \u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u73a9\u5c31\u88ab\u9707\u64bc\u5f97\u9e1f\u808c\u6765\u7740[/spoiler]\n\u624b\u673a\u7248\u548c\u7535\u8111\u7248\u5dee\u522b\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u7684\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u624b\u673a\u9700\u8981\u4e0b\u8f7d\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u624d\u80fd\u77e5\u9053\u6574\u4e2a\u5267\u60c5\uff0c[spoiler] \u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8bf4\u5168\u82f1\u5267\u60c5\u770b\u5f97\u5f88\u8d39\u773c\u775b\uff0c [/spoiler]\u7535\u8111\u5c31\u76f4\u63a5\u6210\u4e3a\u5de6\u4e0a\u89d2\u7684journal\u6309\u94ae\u4e86\u3002[spoiler] \u5176\u5b9e\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519\u5566\u8fd9\u79cd\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adfjournal\u7684\u7834\u89e3\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u8c1c\uff0c\u624b\u673a\u7248\u5c31\u5728\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u672b\u5c3e\u76f4\u63a5\u7ed9\u51fa\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5bc6\u7801\u4e86 [/spoiler]\n\u6574\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u900f\u7740\u4e00\u80a1\u6d53\u6d53\u7684\u4f24\u611f\uff0c[spoiler] \u8fd9\u4e2a\u5927\u6982\u662f\u77e5\u9053\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5267\u60c5\u4e4b\u540en\u5468\u76ee\u73a9\u611f\u89e6\u624d\u6bd4\u8f83\u6df1 [/spoiler]\n\u81f3\u4e8e\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u80fd\u4f53\u4f1a\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u6ca1\u6709\u7684\u65b0\u5947\uff0c[strike]\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u6beb\u65e0\u6210\u5c31\u5f88\u6b63\u5e38[/strike]\n\u8fd8\u6709\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u6e38\u620fbgm\u7684\u5410\u69fd\uff0c\u5f88\u60f3\u5410\u69fd\u56de\u53bb[strike]\u6728\u5934\u5a03\u5a03\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u76d2\u98cebgm\u8d85\u8d5e\u554a\u6709\u6728\u6709[/strike]", "timestamp_created": 1490954906, "timestamp_updated": 1490954906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30751718": {"recommendationid": "30751718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056067759", "num_games_owned": 1666, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490527264}, "language": "english", "review": "Very atmospheric and moody.

The art style and the strange atmosphere draws you in and keeps you curious all the way to the end. It also has an interesting way to bring you information of mythology, which is one of my favorite topics in the world. \n\nIf you want the true entire experience, read everything! And I mean, everything! The best part of this game is definitely the story. Thanks to that story this game, no matter how short it is, will stay with me for a long time to come.

So, if you're avoiding this because you're concerned about the horror tag, please don't let it deter you. I find myself paralyzed in most horror games, but I never felt that way with Year Walk. \n\nI love point-and-click adventures, but I particularly enjoyed this game because the mythology behind the plot and mechanics wasn't just dressing. If you want to solve puzzles, you read the encyclopedia. And not in the Witcher-sense of the idea: you don't read it to automatically unlock something else. You have to find things, and the encyclopedia entries help with that.\n\nI also loved the art. As I said, I'm not big on horror games, but I love it nearly every where else. The surreal style mixes with muted colors to create an eerie atmosphere for the game. (Man, I adored that damn horse.) The puzzles serve the atmosphere, as well. They're each their own representation of the creature you're working with (or challenging, depending on your interpretation, I guess). They don't require intense brain power, firing off all of your neurons or anything, but I found them sufficiently challenging and appropriate for what the game is. \n\nMy biggest issue was with the movement. You can't turn around or look to the side, but you move as if you should be able to do those things. But the map is so small it didn't end up as frustrating as I thought it would be.\n\nI'm not sure Year Walk is for everyone, but I'd say it's a must if you enjoy atmospheric and/or point-and-click adventure games.", "timestamp_created": 1489951090, "timestamp_updated": 1489951090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30616422": {"recommendationid": "30616422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070736088", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489932728}, "language": "english", "review": "I really did enjoy this game.

Follow a young mans journey through the Swedish wilderness to see his future, and maybe even change it. Solve puzzles, learn about the dark past of this land, and discover the fables which still wander these woods. Year Walk is a very short experience with little to no replayability but a beautiful soundtrack, compelling art direction and a very very unique story. Originally for the phone/tablet, this game is clearly meant to be played with a touch screen, but is still enjoyable on home computer. \n\nPros: Without a doubt this games art is stunning and is what drew this reviewer in at first glance. As well, the music is quite enjoyable, and both music and art in tandem serve to make this game all the more creepy and mysterious. The puzzles in this game are fairly simple, but tough enough to give most pause. Nothing too difficult to be found here, probably a good game for those interested in puzzle based games but new to the style. As well, Year Walk has a very dark theme and deep story for those willing to dig a little bit. To get the full experience from this game you will need to be a gamer who enjoys the story just as much, if not more than, the gameplay. Year Walk is a point and click game, and that should tell you how much real action is to be found in this title. Luckily, Year Walk provides more than enough lore in its story to make it worth a run through or two. The addition of a lore book on the many creatures you\u2019ll meet in this game is a wonderful addition. Gamers with a passion for folk lore will find this game a fantastic lesson in Swedish lore and a wonderful experience.\n\nCons: As others have stated, this phone game is very short. For many this may cause pause and you may want to wait for a sale before picking this particular title up. It took this reviewer around four hours to completely 100% this title, including all achievements. As well, because Year Walk was originally a phone game it does play a little strangely with a mouse and keyboard. Finally, as a point and click puzzle game there is very little \u201caction\u201d. For those looking for a long lasting, difficult, action fueled experience you are going to be deeply disappointed. \n\nOverall, Year Walk falls flat in action, and length. However, it does pack a lot into the short hour long experience. The music and art unsettle as this very adult themed tale unravels before you. The lore and backstory are deeply interesting to those who like this sort of tale. The puzzles are soft but deep enough to cause pause and provide a satisfaction once completed. This game is definitely a niche title and will not be enjoyed by most. If you are someone looking for a short experience, enjoy puzzles, and like learning about lore and fantastical creatures, then Year Walk is the game for you. For what it is, I have to recommend it, but please keep in mind the short length and lack of real gameplay in this title. This is more of an experience than a game in most ways.\n", "timestamp_created": 1485291479, "timestamp_updated": 1485291479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29401418": {"recommendationid": "29401418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026486730", "num_games_owned": 1443, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429134576}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a fun experience.

I hope you are joking!\"[/h1]\n[b]Stina Nilsson[/b]\n__________________________________________ \n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\n\nPersonally I have no clue about swedish folklore or mythology and grabbed the title simply because it looked kind of unique: setting and visuals seemed to be fresh and interesting and I expected a nice little title that I can play on my tablet and relax along the way.  (Okay, did I seriously miss the \"Horror\u201c tag on the storepage?)\n\nOh man was I wrong.\n\nHowever, I have to say that I regret nothing - the game\u2019s fantastic but for scary people probably not the best thing to play at 1 a.m..\n__________________________________________ \n\n[h1]Year walking\u2026[/h1]\n\nThe story of the game is mysterious, kind of creepy and mature. At the beginning you are greeted with a short introduction and some small dialogue before starting your 'Year Walk' in attempt to unravel the mysteries of the future. \n\nOn your journey you will encounter several beings of swedish folklore, creepy places and many puzzles and secrets.\nThe game is a mixture of 2D- and 3D-Textures, you play in first person view, travelling from left to right through different parts of the forest, but at some spots you are able to go up or down to change the location. \n\nThe forest consists of different areas and you will need to backtrack a lot (or you make notes along the way) to find the solution to some riddles and gadgets. These puzzles are quite interesting but nothing new or unique in the genre, especially for people that already played lots of adventures.\n\nLuckily there is a map and some hints to make your journey easier from time to time and there\u2019s also some kind of information section that will tell you something about the history behind Year Walking, the folklore and the mysterious appearances. It was surprisingly interesting to read all the available information, especially due to the fresh setting that was not already used a hundred times in different games and stories. There\u2019s also a very mysterious journal that requires a username and a password for access and stays a complete secret until you have finished the game at least once.\n\nThe visuals and the interesting design of 'Year Walk' are definitely the strongest part of the game, but in combination with an interesting story and the great soundtrack (albeit there\u2019s not that much music, mostly in intense situations) the game's able to create a fantastic amosphere. Out there in a dark forest inhabitated by strange beings that are neither entirely good nor bad there\u2019s a lot of potential for sending chills down your spine.\n__________________________________________ \n\n[h1]Contra[/h1]\n\nUnfortunately the games\u2018 lenght is from my point of view also the games' biggest downside: your first run will take approximately between two or three hours and as soon as you understand the puzzles and know how to solve them without searching for clues you will be able finish the game quite fast. There\u2019s an achievement that wants you to finish the game in less than 20 minutes and in the end it\u2019s not that particularly hard to get.\n\nAnother thing that I would like to mention here are the jumpscares \u2013 I simply don\u2019t like them as an element to 'inflict' horror, they feel a bit... cheap. From my point of view the game has a strong atmosphere by itself and does not really need these \u201eSURPRISE: spooky face riiiiiiight in front of the screen\u2018-moments to scare you. Luckily there are only a few of them.\n\nThe last negative point would be the implementation of touchscreen controls. At first I thought that the touchscreen of my Surface Tablet would be enough to play the game (because the game itself was ported from iOS to PC) but unfortunately you need a keyboard to move (and to solve one puzzle). \n__________________________________________ \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIn the end I can say that the game surprised me a lot and the positive qualities of 'Year Walk\u2018 outweigh the short length by far. Sure, the games\u2018 charm is mostly created by the interesting visuals and the fresh setting but it succeeds nonetheless in building up a dense and mysterious atmosphere. There are some sparse horror elements \u2013 e.g. unexpected jump scares - but overall it\u2019s the fear of what may happen and what lies at the end of your walk that will give you some chills, the story within the story. \n\nIt's definitely an interesting little horror-adventure that may entertain you for two up to three hours. Luckily there's some replayability due to a secret ending. In the end I would rate the game 8 out of 10 points and especially during sales it\u2019s a great little title to grab.\n__________________________________________ \n\nThis endorsement approved by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/trureviews]The Reviewers' Union[/url],\nproviding better standards for reviews and reviewers.", "timestamp_created": 1484511981, "timestamp_updated": 1485417571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814920", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29272211": {"recommendationid": "29272211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044694773", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484484393}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]pros:[/b]\n+ Interesting and original story (  based on Swedish folklore )\n+ Beautiful graphics and soundtrack\n+ Amazing atmosphere\n+ Cool puzzles ( some are kinda not obvious )\n\n[b]cons:[/b]\n- short story ( 2-3 hours )\n-/+ If u like games based on jumpscares , this is not for you\n\n\n[b]If you are looking for game that can set you scare , its cannot be enought for you .

The art style is endearingly creepy and original, and creates a very engrossing atmosphere for the story that is deceptively simple but has a lot of depth for those who pay attention. Those who do not, will almost certainly not like this game. Year Walk does no hand holding and requires pen and paper to keep track of clues and puzzle pieces. It is a practice that is all but lost in modern gaming, and will undoubtedly turn off some gamers. For those who pay attention however, the puzzles should not cause any trouble to solve; they \"make sense\" and are straightforward throughout. Like most children's books, Year Walk is very short and can easily be completed in under 2-3 hours for a first comprehensive walkthrough, with each consecutive run taking no more than 20 minutes (take a look at the achievements if you do not believe me).

As you can see in the achievements section, one of the achievables is a \"Year Run,\" or getting through a full year walk in 20 minutes. Granted, there's almost no way to do that the first time round unless you're using a walkthrough, but it's useful to illustrate how quick the story can be. Without giving too much of the plot away, a full experience of the game requires a minimum of two year walks.\n\nIn terms of genre, I'd sooner call this game \"dark fantasy\" than \"horror,\" as there are only three total jumpscares, even using the most expansive definition: moments that succeed in startling chihuahua-like individuals such as myself. As far as actual scary moments, there's really only one. Still, the game is stylistically horror-tinged throughout. It's not so much a bloodbath as it is blood slowly soaking through cloth. Both have their benefits.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly simplistic, but without the use of a walkthrough, the game is still surprisingly difficult, if only because it drops you in the middle of snowy nowhere without holding your hand and pushing you in the right direction. Luckily, there's a happy medium between muddling through it alone and full-on cheating: in-game hints. They're actually really helpful if you get stuck. \n\nIt's sort of like falling asleep partway through a documentary on Swedish folktales and having a sick nightmare about it.

The scenery starts off pleasant enough, a picturesque snowy woodland. As you walk further and further, more secrets unfold and the eerie surroundings become more and more intense (and in some cases, outright disturbing). A lot of navigating and exploration is required to work out the puzzles; there is a map to help with this however, and also hints should you find yourself stuck. The story unravels as you unlock more puzzles, often adding to the mystery rather than solving it. I rather like both puzzle and horror games, and enjoyed the creepy combination of the two in this very well-made folklore rendition. There\u2019s plenty of reading material (especially at the \u2018end\u2019, don\u2019t skip the end credits!) which I enjoyed going through.\nThough the puzzles were really well formulated in my opinion, my favourite part was piecing everything together in the end and discovering the story myself; seeing all the initially puzzling scenes come together to tell the whole story. I like how subtle the clues were, encouraging me to unlock all the secrets and dig deeper into the background of the story.\n\n[h1]Graphics & Art[/h1]\nThe game is beautiful, that much can be observed by looking at the store page; it\u2019s set in a dreary yet alluring snowy woodland. Even the disturbing aspects are somewhat beautiful in a twisted way. The art is bright yet dark, pretty yet depraved; a perfect amalgamation of two opposite forces creating something so very captivating.\n\n[h1]Replay Value[/h1]\nBeing a puzzle game, once you\u2019ve worked out all the clues there is little point playing it again. The entire purpose of Year Walk, or at least in my opinion, is slowly allowing the clues to unfold as you play. \n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe instrumental soundtrack is pleasant to listen to, with unsettling tracks and effects throughout to accentuate certain scenes. \n\n[h1]Achievements[/h1]\nNot all achievements are obtainable by playing the game through (one being \u2018Year Run\u2019 which is essentially a speedrun, and fairly impossible to do on the first playthrough). There are guides available to help with the trickier achievements if you are stuck. \n\n[h1]Difficulty & Challenge[/h1]\nThe mechanics are very simple, but don\u2019t let that fool you; some puzzles and their corresponding clues can be terribly vague. At times, the clues can be found before you even realise what puzzle they are for. For this reason, I suggest you take note of your surroundings (potentially even writing them down). A lot of the puzzles do seem simplistic, but because of the ambiguity of the clues (and the fact that you often find them before even knowing what to do with them), they seem a lot harder and did leave me somewhat perplexed on a few occasions. \n\n[h1]Overall Verdict[/h1]\nI find that horror games are often lacking in the narrative department, being more about a few jump scares here and there and a few bloodied creatures lurking around the place, rather than venturing into the domain of [i]why[/i] (e.g. sure having a random creature jump out at you as you explore is frightening, but it\u2019s irrelevant to the story). This is where Year Walk stands out from the rest; not only does it have unsettling visuals and audio, it proves that a well-written story is enough to send chills down your spine. Year Walk doesn\u2019t rely on the standard scare-tactics of your average horror game, because it doesn\u2019t have to. \n\n[h1]Overall Score: 9/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1475813639, "timestamp_updated": 1475813639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597454", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25882907": {"recommendationid": "25882907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118728559", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475750650}, "language": "italian", "review": "Uno dei giochi pi\u00f9 onirici e strani a cui abbia mai giocato in vita mia, e in 25 anni ne ho giocati fidatevi.", "timestamp_created": 1475750772, "timestamp_updated": 1475750772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25876007": {"recommendationid": "25876007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078582252", "num_games_owned": 876, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475703985}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, looks fantastic!

I usually like investing in things I know I'll get a good amount of time out of, and I felt that I could just as easily wait for a sale to get something that I'd spend more time on for around the same price. I know this is incredibly moronic tact to take with games, but I've been burned more often than not on shorter \"experiences\" to come to have that reservation.  \n\nHaving bought and completed Year Walk, I can honestly say I wish I pulled the trigger on the game sooner.\n\nThe folklore the game is based on is interesting and a bit unsettling, leading to simple, yet effective scares that managed to stick with me.  Wrapped around this is a pretty well done story, that even with accidentally getting spoiled on some of the details, I came away impressed with.  While I wouldn't say the puzzles are anything too special, combined with an atmospheric soundtrack and the game's 2.5D first person presentation, they were enough to get me to want to to keep going.\n\nAdmittedly, Year Walk might not be everyone's cup of tea.

Sono cascato nella trappola mediatica. Year Walk ha valutazioni altissime in giro sul web e le recensioni non risparmiano lodi; in particolare sottolineano gli aspetti artistici del titolo. Beh, in quanto amministratore di un sito dedicato all'arte videoludica, non potevo esimermi dal provarlo, vista anche la cifra ridicola necessaria.\n\nIl primo impatto \u00e8 positivo. L'estetica \u00e8 curata e l'immagine leggermente disturbata, l'effetto neve e i colori tenui creano una certa atmosfera. Il comparto sonoro fatto di venti, sospiri e piccoli ma suggestivi temi di carillon risulta appropriato. Si apprezza anche la documentazione scritta della storia e delle varie entit\u00e0 soprannaturali.\nIntriganti anche alcuni momenti di puro horror, con rare punte di tensione e un paio di jump scare. L'iconografia degli esseri sovrannaturali \u00e8 suggestiva ed \u00e8 tratta dal folklore svedese, la nazionalit\u00e0 degli sviluppatori.\n\nPer\u00f2 contemporaneamente si manifestano molti limiti, che alla lunga diluiscono e vanificano questi aspetti positivi. \nE' possibile muoversi solo a destra e sinistra con i tasti freccia, anche se guardiamo sempre verso il fondo dello schermo, una meccanica fatta ad hoc per il touch screen. Si passa da una scena all'altra andando in avanti o indietro in corrispondenza di taluni passaggi segnati sulla mappa di gioco. In sostanza \u00e8 come se non ci muovessimo, ma sfogliassimo delle pagine, proprio come faremmo con un touch screen. Il mondo di gioco \u00e8 piccolissimo, un numero ridottissimo di isolotti che ci ritroveremo ad esplorare pi\u00f9 e pi\u00f9 volte, con pochissime occasioni di interazione; impossibile non farsi prendere dalla noia dopo un po'. \n\nA parte le premesse iniziali contenute nei documenti in nostro possesso e nel filmato iniziale in cui parliamo con la nostra amata, per il resto lo sviluppo della storia \u00e8 inesistente! Il finale, cos\u00ec tanto decantato dalle riviste e dagli entusiati, \u00e8 di una banalit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 unica che rara. Se cercate emozioni,  a parte un paio di jump scare, avete scelto il titolo sbagliato!\n\nIl gioco \u00e8 centrato unicamente sulla risoluzione di enigmi e puzzle! Sostanzialmente, al di l\u00e0 del maquillage costruitogli attorno con qualche cenno superficiale di trama, con un'estetica di facciata e una patinata atmosfera horror, il gioco si riduce ad un passatempo enigmistico!\nI puzzle e gli enigmi sono abbastanza astrusi, ma con pazienza possono essere risolti, a patto di non annoiarsi come il sottoscritto, che nei videogiochi cerca tutt'altro, per il resto preferisce la Settimana Enigmistica! Motivo per cui dopo la prima ora di gioco, preso dalla noia e dal disinteresse pi\u00f9 totale, ho fatto uso di un walkthrough per arrivare diritto fino alla fine e valutare per intero il titolo. \n\nIl vero problema \u00e8 che l'interattivit\u00e0 \u00e8 praticamente nulla, caratteristica tipica dei giochi casual per dispositivi mobili. Gli oggetti con cui \u00e8 possibile interagire sono pochissimi. E il modo in cui si interagisce \u00e8 primitivo. Cosa aspettarsi d'altronde da un gioco per cellulari in cui tutto si riduce a far scivolare il dito sul touch screen? Inoltre non esistono scelte, bivi, dialoghi a scelta multipla, niente di niente. Solo noiosissimi enigmi!\nIn pi\u00f9 le idee sono trite e ritrite, viste mille volte in tanti giochi o film o fumetti; il che dimostra come le recensioni in giro per il web siano falsate ed edulcorate, poich\u00e8 pretendono che il gioco sia fortemente originale, innovativo, addirittura epocale, regalandogli votazioni dal 9 in su!\nQualcuno dir\u00e0 che bisogna giudicare in base alle ridotte capacit\u00e0 tecniche dei dispositivi mobili! Ma anche in questo caso Year Walk fa una figura canina, si salva solo per l'estetica. Infatti come \u00e8 noto sui dispositivi mobili \u00e8 possibile giocare a tante storiche avventure grafiche degli anni '70, '80 e '90 e molte di esse risultano ben pi\u00f9 interattive, intriganti, emozionanti e divertenti!\n\nHo scritto la recensione di Year Walk perch\u00e9 volevo mettere a nudo la sua vera natura da puzzle game per telefonino e l'assoluta inaffidabilit\u00e0 delle recensioni in giro sul web. E' un titolo adatto a giocatori casual non pi\u00f9 giovanissimi, che non hanno molta esperienza e dimestichezza con il mondo videoludico, in cui per fortuna non mancano ben altri titoli di pregevole fattura densi di arte, emozioni e contenuti. \n\nEffettivamente questo tipo di pubblico pu\u00f2 trovare interessante gli enigmi di Year Walk, contornati da un plot minimale, confezionati con un'estetica accattivante e un minimo di atmosfera e con il bonus di qualche punta orrorifica e di tensione. In effeti svetta rispetto ad altri prodotti casual, ma nulla di pi\u00f9. Spacciarlo come gioco per PC o per console, esiste anche la versione per WII, mi sembra inappropriato.\n\nVOTO: 68/100\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/vgart", "timestamp_created": 1473032503, "timestamp_updated": 1495749245, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438020", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25330041": {"recommendationid": "25330041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025729099", "num_games_owned": 506, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444329538}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Para mi, un juego bueno tiene que tener muchos trucos.

Often I had only a vague idea about what was actually going on but somehow that was all part of its charm. Highly recommended.\n\n[h1]Long Review[/h1]\n\nThis is certainly one of the most unusual games I've played in a long time. Essential it's a 2.5D adventure game with puzzles & an interesting if abstract storyline. The game is played in relatively limited area of forested Scandinavia but don't let the limited area put you off. The scenery is full of detail with, often abstract, clues.\n\nThe 2.5D gameplay is unique in my experience. You move smoothly to the left and right but depth movement is a sudden rush that moves you between 2D sections. There are prompts on the top and bottom of the screen in the form of arrows that indicate when forwards or backwards movement is possible. There is a map that can be brought up at any time which shows the links between the 2D sections as well as prominent features in the landscape.\n\nThere is no hand holding. You are told to use WASD keys and the mouse button to interact and then you're on your own. In fact you're on your own to the point that after the initial intro I really hadn't a clue what I was supposed to do so it was a case of wandering around exploring intially until slowly but surely after visiting places several times the penny dropped on what the puzzles actualyl were.\n\nOne of the things I liked about the game is that I often found it more difficult figuring out what the puzzles were than actually solving them.\n\nWhilst I didn't actually find the game outright scarey (with a couple of exceptions when things flashed unexpectedly on the screen) I always had a feel of unease playing it. The fear of the unknown, the strange encounters and the eerie music fed into this.\n\nI certainly recommend reading the integrated Encyclopedia before/whilst playing as it explains what the game is about. It is a good, interesting read.\n\nThe game progress saves each time you quit.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Beautiful, stylised graphics\n[*]Well thought out puzzles\n[*]Hint system\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I found it pretty difficult\n[*]The control to interact with objects is pretty tricky\n[*]Sometimes the hint system just told me stuff I already knew but not what I needed to know\n[/list]\n[h1]Marks Out Of 5[/h1]\n\n5) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this\n[h1]4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase[/h1]\n3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted\n2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted\n1) Not worth getting even if given away free\n\n[h1]Where I got the game from[/h1]\n\nBought at [url=https://www.bundlestars.com/en/] Bundle Stars [/url] as part of the All Stars 6 Bundle\n\n[h1]Platform Played On[/h1]\n\nIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, EasyAcc Mouse & Steelseries MERC keyboard. \n\n[h1]My best guess for a  PEGI Rating [/h1]\n\n12: There are some pretty dark parts to the storyline.

I mainly just wanted a quick horror fix, and what I got was a lot more. This game focuses on the very obscure ancient Swedish tradition of \u00c5rsg\u00e5ng, or Year Walking. After playing this game, I was awestruck by not only the way the story was presented, but also by the amazing visuals, and how even though there was certainly horror elements in the game, I felt completely comfortable. \n\nUpon completing this game, I felt like I needed to know more about this tradition that was \u00c5rsg\u00e5ng. This feeling sent me on a two year journey through Swedish sources and 20 year old dead internet forums that helped me conclude a whole blog and thesis on this subject. Never has a game compelled me so strongly to find out more, and to know all I can possibly know, and in April of this year, I had done it. I had found out all there was to know about this once obscure tradition that now found itself as common knowledge.\n\nThis is why I am asking everybody who could be reading this to BUY THIS GAME. You will be intrigued, terrified, curious, excited, mystified, and much more over this 2 or so hour journey, maybe three if you read the excellent encyclopedia. I've played this game 5 times now at different speeds and settings, just to make sure I found every little thing in this game. Now that I have, I must say it was completely worth it, and I'm sure I'll be going back to it again soon. Some people may find this game boring, and I understand that, it's not necessarily for everybody out there, but please just try it. This game is $6.00 (\u00a34.10), when it should easily go for twice that price. if I had to give this game some sort of overall rating, it must be a 10/10. I feel ridiculous giving a rating out to a game that has changed the way I see things so much but I feel it's justified.

So much so that I am unsure whether I consider it to be a traditional adventure game, a walking sim, or its own tiny subgenre. If it is a walking sim, it is one of the best I've played.\nThe plot is simple, or at least straightforward. You want to see the future, so you perform an ancient Swedish folklore ritual that lets you see the future, called the Year Walk. During this time you will walk around the forest surrounding your cabin, helping the various spirits that live there. Once you have helped them all, they let you see the Church Grimm, who shows you the future. The climax of the game is abstract, maybe unfittingly so, but at the end it shows you that your friend will get injured and might also die. Incidentally, this friend is the one that told you not to perform the Year Walk. I suppose that we are supposed to learn a lesson about not messing with powers beyond your understanding, but I had so much fun that I would be tempted to year walk anyway. \nThe most immediately apparent aspect of Year Walk is its art direction, particularly its color palette. This game contains many horror elements, and it can easily be classified as a horror game. Despite that, the color palette is quite bright, with a strong emphasis on cyan and white. It's also very desaturated, creating an atmosphere that is usually serene and peaceful, but can instantly change to be scary and desolate. The characters have similarly stylized designs. They are awe-inspiring and spooky, but also approachable, even cute (except the Huldra). The Brook Horse and Church Grimm are the standout designs, and I think the designer knew this, as the Church Grimm's icons are used frequently throughout the game. In fact, the game is icon-heavy in general, with each creature having a distinct symbol, almost like a hieroglyph.\nI only have three complaints, so I will just list them. First, the navigation of Year Walk is unusual; it's from a first person perspective, but movement is restricted to 2d planes. The player scuttles from side to side like a crab, and can only walk forward and backward onto new planes in certain spaces. This is fine, even fun, but on certain screens I could get a headache if I walked too fast from side to side. I don't consider this to be the game's fault necessarily, but if a game causes me physical distress I want to note it. My other two complaints have to do with two specific puzzles. Most of the puzzles are actually very good, and the hint system is one of the best I've ever seen, but there are only two notable exceptions. The first puzzle is when the player is trying to open a furnace. The furnace door is locked, and the only way to open it is to press the corresponding keys on the keyboard to what is engraved on the locks. This might sound obvious in retrospect, but since those keys are not used before or since, it bothers me that the solution is so strange.

I'll get more into my thoughts on the game itself below.\n\nHowever.\n\nI can't believe I'm saying this, but if you own an iPhone or iPad, get that version instead.\nThere are a lot of puzzles that make a lot more sense and that are a lot more clever with touch controls. There's no reason not to at least pick that version up first. The visuals are identical, it's a few bucks cheaper, and the controls are arguably better when actually using your fingers to swipe across the environment.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's a stellar game. For such a short runtime, Year Walk shows an interesting world and builds a genuinely fascinating and creepy atmosphere. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous and really compliment that atmosphere. The story is also really clever and doesn't overstay it's welcome. Much like the original Portal, it's short, sweet, and gets it's point across with no distractions. All killer, no filler.\n\nAbsolutely pick this game up if it looks up your alley. Again, I'd urge you to try the iOS version first if you have that option available to you. If not, the PC release is absolutely fine, with only sometimes fiddly controls and a few surprises neutered in the process.

The gameplay was very simple, it is point and click with the only movement being left, right, forward and back.  The UI is very simple and stays out of the way of what I thought to be very nice visuals. The puzzles are all well-thought with one in particular that made me look up the hints you can find in-game.

As such, the setting and story are fantastic and really draw you into the game. The great soundtrack, creepy sound effects, and unique visual style that looks like a mix between a pop-up book and a silent film help to enhance the setting even further and make this game a very emotional experience. While playing Year Walk, I truly felt the sensation of being all alone in a dark forest. In this way, the game was simultaneously comforting and terrifying in a way that I can't quite explain. Another enjoyable aspect of the game is that it essentially drops you into an open world and leaves you to explore and solve puzzles on your own, much like Myst or The Witness.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Year Walk.

You will experience something.\nHave you ever encountered an Owl in the middle of a forest, at night?

While this is considered a horror game, its primary draw is its clever puzzles and deceptively quaint and calming atmosphere that seem to take some inspiration from Tim Burton films. The sound design is excellent; both the music and sound effects are extremely crisp and know exactly when to go all out and when to draw back. There are even some music-based puzzles that will rely on your sense of pitch to be able to solve. However, most of the game is very quiet, with little to no music in many sections (though what music is there is quite well done), and only the eerily realistic sound of footsteps crruching in the thick snow will accompany you.\n\nOne of the key selling points of the game is its focus on Swedish folklore, which is told through a companion app (included in the Steam version) and, while it is not necessary to read, I highly recommend going through it so you will know about the different creatures you will encounter on your journey. I found myself fascinated with the folklore itself, and some of the legends are truly frightening. However, the horror elements are mostly intermittent and not exceptionally scary (most of the \"scary\" parts I would classify more as unnerving than outright terrifying), I think this game is perfect for anyone who is new to horror games and will do a good job easing you into the genre.\n\nHowever, despite my glowing recommendation, I would not recommend playing it on PC if you can get it for another device. This game was originally developed to be played on mobile devices, and while the cursor is perfectly functional, it feels a bit clunky and does not have the same seamless feel of dragging across the screen as using your finger. I would say the ideal version of the game would be the Wii U version, as it has the touch controls of the mobile version, the convenince of having the companion act on the GamePad, and is presented on a large TV to let you truly soak in the visuals. However, if you don't want to play on mobile and/or don't have a Wii U, you experience will not be significantly hampered if you choose to play it on PC.

It's a lot more fun than many other games of similar ilk and it's clearly down to a lot of care and attention during development as well as a knowledge and emphasis of the lore. I found it short, quite different and refreshing and interesting to play through.\n\n[h1]Highlights[/h1]\n\nThe things that carry Year Walk are most definitely the simple ambient design and the weaving of the story and lore into the world while staying true to the subject matter. It's carefully and smartly done and often feels as though you're part of a fairy tale or dark bedtime story as much as a video game.\n\n[h1]Mistakes and Annoyances[/h1]\n\nBeing a port of a mobile game, it suffers from a lack of depth from the gameplay, and while the hands off approach definitely works well with the narrative and story, it's still an issue when compared against other longer, deeper titles at the same price. Having said that though, I feel like had the game been any longer it may've run the risk of adding less enjoyable puzzles for the sake of length rather than story and ultimately, while short and simple, everything is fun to experience and discover.\n\n[h1]Recommendations[/h1]\n\nPriced at $5.99/\u00a34.79/4.99\u20ac on the Steam Store at the time of review, Year Walk isn't expensive and probably isn't overpriced, but there may be better alternatives around the same price range on Steam and mobile. Due to the interesting world, atmosphere and content though, and the simple enjoyable play-through, there's no reason to avoid Year Walk and it's worth a play for anyone looking to waste an hour or so.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/269050\n\n* [i]Note: Purely by coincidence I seem to have played Year Walk at the perfect time and picked up a free achievement for my luck.

The gameplay is extremely minimal, while the true soul of the game lies in its ambiance, art direction, and core concept.  This is the type of game which won\u2019t appeal to everyone.  For those who appreciate the occasional artsy game with minimal gameplay, then you will probably find [b]Year Walk[/b] interesting, relaxing, and enjoyable.  If you are looking to play a traditional video game, you shouldn\u2019t be looking here.\n\nThe gameplay is roughly 3 parts \u201cwalking-simulator\u201d and 1 part puzzle game.  Navigating the area is your primary \u201cchallenge,\u201d with the addition of a few puzzles you will have to solve.  The answers to these puzzles can be a bit obscure, but there is a competent hint system if you want to avoid being stuck for too long and just want to enjoy the [i]zen[/i] of the game.\n\nThe core concept of the game is also quite interesting.  [b]Year Walk[/b] is based on the Swedish folklore of [i]\u00c5rsg\u00e5ng[/i], which I had never heard of before playing this, and which I found to be interesting.  After learning a bit about it, I was able to see that the developers did an outstanding job bringing the idea to life in video game form, even despite its inherently simplistic design.\n\nThe art direction, soundscape, and overall ambiance of the game make for a mysterious atmosphere which is very well aligned with the core concept.  Admittedly, the graphics are quite simple; but the simple graphics fit the simple game.\n\nShort, interesting, and atmospheric: [b]Year Walk[/b] makes for a fun little experience that is well-produced and should be easily enjoyed by anyone who truly appreciates the genre.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1450163450, "timestamp_updated": 1450163945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864546", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19704362": {"recommendationid": "19704362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158731793", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450057798}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is like Myst in it's game play.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed it. This game is an Exploration Puzzle game with odd navigation controls. You soon get used to it and the game becomes a blast. You navigate across 2D planes in first person and hop between layers of the world. First of all, the sound design is peng. The crispyty crunch of the noise of snow under your feet is a very nice and subtle choice and puts you right in the Snowy Swedish Wilderness. The art style was reminiscent of \"Fosters Home for Imaginary Kids\" and really suited the shifting tone of Wonder and Dread (Not the Judge). The story is difficult to explain and should be experienced first-hand with all the pieces of the puzzle aligning to make a beautiful mosaic of Swedish folklore.

You embark on a long walk in the woods, looking for signs and meanings, and you come across some very strange stuff. There's a very dreamlike quality to the game where the odd glyph or ghost you run into feels almost expected, but it also serves to take you out of the real world and immerse you with very simple, beautiful graphics. This makes the horrifying bits all the more effective, because they come in rough contrast to the feel of the rest of the game. I won't lie, there have been a few jump scares, but the feel earned instead of cheap. It's like a nightmare intruding on the edges of a pastoral dream.\n\nGameplay is simple, moving left or right through pretty landscapes, moving forward or backward to different areas, and clicking on things to interact. You have a useful map and an encyclopedia that helps flesh out the legends and signs you encounter. The game also has a very clever way of getting you to use the encyclopedia later on, which I found very effective. The puzzles are pretty simple as well, so don't go in expecting a lot of gameplay.

You use the keyboard to move around and the mouse to click on stuff and the goals vary on the cycle you're on.

It really makes you immersed in the world. \n\nThe game isn't difficult. Some of the puzzles are difficult but nothing too head scratching. The game gives you clues  and even then you have hints which are helpful. \n\nThe map layout is the only bad thing about this game. It get's confusing really fast and it doesn't help when all environments look the same. I wish they could have given more indication where you need to go.\n\nGame is really short. It took me 1 hour to finish it. There is an alternative ending which can be unlocked, but overall don't expect much replay value. \n\nThe game didn't have bugs what so ever. Any rig could handle this game. Don't expect to run into bugs while playing this game.\n\nYear walk is a really tough game to review and to explain why you need to play it is even tougher, but you must play it no matter what. Year Walk was an amazing experience and the whole lore behind it is really interesting. Adventure game fans must own this little title as soon as possible. It's worth it at full price without a doubt. I give Year Walk a 8.5/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1440279659, "timestamp_updated": 1454102732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.672858", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17627872": {"recommendationid": "17627872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063529161", "num_games_owned": 980, "num_reviews": 165, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451516868}, "language": "italian", "review": "interessante! il termine calza a pennello per descrivere Year Walk. un gioco di esplorazione dai tratti horror e una grafica particolare e minimale basato sul folklore svedese (\u00e8 stato veramente intrigante tuffarsi in questa antica tradizione).\nil gioco \u00e8 realizzato per schermi touch quindi col mouse a volte potreste trovarvi un p\u00f2 impacciati ..piccolezze.\nla storia \u00e8 molto interessante e nonostante sia effettivamente corta, passerete molto pi\u00f9 tempo a leggere che a giocare; anzi questo gioco va vissuto solamente accompagnato dalla lettura dell'enciclopedia e del giornale in-game altrimenti perderete quasi tutto ci\u00f2 che l'autore ha da raccontarvi e inoltre vi aiuter\u00e0 nello svolgimento delle poche ma piacevoli quest. per completarlo ruba 3-4 ore di gioco (ma soprattutto lettura), \u00e8 piacevole, consigliato!", "timestamp_created": 1440070140, "timestamp_updated": 1440070140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17590583": {"recommendationid": "17590583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064015310", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439852144}, "language": "english", "review": "6/10 in my opinion.

En som jag \u00e4nda tills nyligen var helt ovetande om \u00e4r den s\u00e5 kallade \u00e5rsg\u00e5ngen. En \u00e5rsg\u00e5ng var en nattlig vandring d\u00e5 man fick reda p\u00e5 h\u00e4ndelser som skulle komma att intr\u00e4ffa det kommande \u00e5ret. \u00c5rsg\u00e5ngen kunde bara ske vissa speciella n\u00e4tter, s\u00e5som framf\u00f6r allt ny\u00e5rsnatten, och den avslutades alltid vid socknens kyrka.\n\nI spelet Year Walk genomf\u00f6r man en \u00e5rsg\u00e5ng. Till att b\u00f6rja med avr\u00e5ds man fr\u00e5n att genomf\u00f6ra vandringen \u2013 det kan ju vara farligt att veta f\u00f6r mycket om framtiden \u2013 men naturligtvis ger man sig ut \u00e4nd\u00e5. Under vandringens g\u00e5ng f\u00e5r man m\u00f6ta flera skr\u00e4mmande skogsv\u00e4sen, tvingas klura ut en del problem och pulsa i en hel del sn\u00f6.\n\nJag tycker det \u00e4r sk\u00f6nt att man i Year Walk slipper m\u00f6ta de vanliga sm\u00e5trista fantasivarelserna (alver, gobliner, satyrer, osv) som finns med i alltf\u00f6r m\u00e5nga spel. I st\u00e4llet m\u00f6ter man de verkliga inv\u00e5narna i skogen, som exempelvis Skogsr\u00e5et och B\u00e4ckah\u00e4sten. Det \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 sk\u00f6nt att spela i en milj\u00f6 som k\u00e4nns n\u00e4stan som skogen hemmavid, fast f\u00f6r s\u00e5d\u00e4r en hundrafemtio \u00e5r sedan. Spelets atmosf\u00e4r \u00e4r krypande obehaglig, med riktigt lyckad blandning av st\u00e4mningsmusik och smygande ljudeffekter. Vid flera tillf\u00e4llen under spelets g\u00e5ng hann jag faktiskt bli ordentligt r\u00e4dd, b\u00e5de av st\u00e4mningen och av en del f\u00f6r mig ov\u00e4ntade v\u00e4ndningar.\n\nRent tekniskt s\u00e5 \u00e4r spelet lite tr\u00e4igt. Man vandrar mest i sidled genom landskapet och det kan vara lite sv\u00e5rt att hitta r\u00e4tt. Det finns en karta att tillg\u00e5 men den m\u00f6jligheten missade jag eftersom jag p\u00e5 n\u00e5got s\u00e4tt inte sett spelmenyn. Det gjorde att jag ocks\u00e5 missade att man kan f\u00e5 ledtr\u00e5dar till de till viss del ganska sv\u00e5ra problemen man m\u00e5ste l\u00f6sa f\u00f6r att komma vidare. Det gjorde att jag fastnade fr\u00e5n och till, men tack vare r\u00e4tt stor erfarenhet av probleml\u00f6sning kunde jag hela tiden lista ut vad jag skulle g\u00f6ra, \u00e4ven om jag tog riktigt l\u00e5ng tid p\u00e5 mig f\u00f6r att g\u00f6ra det ibland.\n\nSpelet lever mycket p\u00e5 den n\u00e4rmast perfekta st\u00e4mningen i b\u00e5de ljud och bild, men \u00e4ven historien \u00e4r v\u00e4rd uppm\u00e4rksamhet.

Lo produjo y desarroll\u00f3 SIMOGO el 2013 y pueden comprarlo en STEAM para PC o MAC o pueden comprarlo para iOS. Supongo que est\u00e1 disponible tanto para iPhone como para iPad. La versi\u00f3n de PC incluye algunos acertijos y logros adicionales. Cuesta 66 varitos mexicanos.\n\nEl juego trata de un viejo ritual sueco que se hace en la noche vieja. Se supone que si sigues los pasos, puedes hacer una pregunta a extra\u00f1os seres sobrenaturales y ellos te dir\u00e1n el futuro. No puedo decir mucho m\u00e1s de la historia porque depende much\u00edsimo de ella. Cualquier cosita es un spoiler y el juego depende tanto de la sorpresa, para sus dos finales, que si no tengo cuidado y doy uno que otro detalle, la experiencia del juego est\u00e1 peligrosamente cerca de romperse.\n\nPuedo contar un poco del inicio: t\u00fa juegas el papel de Daniel Svensson quien visita a su amada para preguntarle qu\u00e9 onda, si van a andar o van a seguir escondi\u00e9ndose, pero la amada le dice que todav\u00eda no sabe si irse con Daniel o con su novio, el que s\u00ed tiene dinero.\n\nDaniel decide hacer el Year Walk para saber con qui\u00e9n se queda su amada en el futuro.\n\nYa que no podemos decir m\u00e1s de la historia, hablemos del juego en s\u00ed: para completar el Year Walk tienes que enfrentarte a los acertijos de esp\u00edritus muy extra\u00f1os. El dise\u00f1o de dichos esp\u00edritus es buen\u00edsimo y aunque puede verse demasiado sencillo, logra involucrarte dentro de la historia y del folclor que existe dentro del juego. Los fondos y los escenarios est\u00e1n bellamente detallados. Las transiciones y los movimientos de animaci\u00f3n, entre las pantallas, tienen su chiste y tambi\u00e9n ayudan a la experiencia general del juego.\n\nLa m\u00fasica y el sonido tambi\u00e9n son muy buenos. El juego como un todo: ilustraci\u00f3n, sonido, m\u00fasica es un trabajo lleno de amor y de much\u00edsimo detalle. Basta con jugarlo un poco para entender la entrega de los desarrolladores. Desde el inicio que, de alguna manera, despierta sensaciones adolescentes, cuando todo era perfecto; no s\u00f3lo se revive la ilusi\u00f3n del primer amor, o de los primeros deseos, sino como estos pueden pervertirse o degenerarse. Parece que siempre estamos al acecho de criaturas oscuras, de animales sobrenaturales, que est\u00e1n dispuestos a robarse nuestra alma por una duda, por conocer el futuro, por saber si nuestro destino es lo que siempre estuvimos esperando. Y no lo duden, porque el juego presenta estas peque\u00f1as sorpresas: fantasmas, ni\u00f1os muertos, abominaciones terribles.\n\nAlgunos dicen que el juego es de terror aunque no lo creo. Tiene sus desagradables sorpresas pero, m\u00e1s bien, sigue siendo una historia especulativa, de fantas\u00eda, que juega entre muchos g\u00e9neros: no s\u00f3lo el terror, sino con la ciencia ficci\u00f3n, los viajes en el tiempo y la importancia de conservar la historia y las tradiciones. A veces, incluso, el juego se pone un poquito modernista.\n\nPero hablemos m\u00e1s de la narrativa del juego: a pesar de que est\u00e1 bien trabajado, y que muchas cosas las controla minuciosamente, deja mucho que desear por el lado narrativo. La calidad es variable por esa parte, ya que en algunos escenarios debemos leer y leer cantidades rid\u00edculas de informaci\u00f3n para entender y pasar algunos acertijos.\n\nNo digo que la lectura est\u00e9 mal, al fin y al cabo Year Walk se trata de una novela visual, pero al final pusieron menos empe\u00f1o en esta parte y se nota porque a veces el tono se rompe con uno que otro clich\u00e9, lugar com\u00fan o una sobresimplificaci\u00f3n de la historia. Lo cual es un poco triste porque el juego est\u00e1 ampliamente trabajado en las dem\u00e1s aristas y pienso que pudo ser mejor. Quiz\u00e1s sea una cuesti\u00f3n de traducci\u00f3n del sueco al ingl\u00e9s, quiz\u00e1s. No lo s\u00e9.\n\nSi juegan con gu\u00eda, la experiencia del juego se reduce a unas dos o tres horas, m\u00e1ximo. Si lo juegan sin gu\u00eda, y se atreven a pasar los acertijos sin ayuda, quiz\u00e1s aumente a unas 8 \u00f3 10 horas. Los acertijos est\u00e1n dif\u00edciles. El juego consta de dos finales. El segundo final es un acertijo que no puede resolverse hasta que terminas el juego la primera vez y es el final real, por decirlo as\u00ed.\n\n\u00bfRecomiendo Year Walking? S\u00ed, en conjunto es una gran experiencia. Lo recomiendo, especialmente, para gamers que disfrutan los acertijos, las novelas visuales, los point and click y los sustos ocasionales. Para los amantes del terror y de la fantas\u00eda, esta puede ser una buena alternativa. No recomiendo el juego si te gustan los disparos, si desprecias la lectura o si te chocan las adivinanzas dif\u00edciles. Muchos de los acertijos salen de lo convencional y exigen del jugador un poco de\u2026 creatividad. Eso es todo lo que tengo que decir de Year Walk, recuerden que lo pueden conseguir en STEAM por 65 pesitos o bien, pueden conseguirlo en el app store, aunque la versi\u00f3n de STEAM tiene algunas cosas a\u00f1adidas que mejoraron un poco la experiencia.", "timestamp_created": 1434579283, "timestamp_updated": 1434579283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16405256": {"recommendationid": "16405256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200594350", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477778314}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

They were usually super ambiguous, and many people needed to use walkthroughs and help such as myself because you were supposed to write down all these different symbols in random places, and if you missed one you couldn't solve it. You didn't know when to use what, and one even made you use a keyboard to solve which hadnt been implemented before the entire game. Also I didn't like navigating, as it felt kind of sloppy with all of the linear paths you had to find. The game had no direction either, and you never knew which one of the 15 spots to go to next. If I hadn't used a walkthrough I would have wandered around a lot, as the game wants you to, but I find that dumb and artificially inflating the game. Some people love how \"existential\" the game is and how smart that makes them feel, but I just thought there could have been more direction.

Es gibt nur Mausklick,W,A,S,D und nur an einer Stelle muss man einen bestimmtes Objekt wirklich anklicken. Die R\u00e4tsel sind relativ einfach gehalten, nur muss man erst einmal herausfinden, wo man hin muss. Hier spielt das Spiel viel mit Musik und Soundtracks. \u00dcbrigens sehr gelungen. Leider ist das Spiel recht kurz geraten, aber es l\u00e4sst sich auch nochmal ein weiteres Mal spielen und etwas Neues entdecken. Das Spiel setzt auf die Musik und die Atmossph\u00e4re um zu beeindrucken. Nur ganz wenige Male gibt es so etwas wie einen \"Schockmoment\". Ansonsten fand ich es auch positiv, dass man gezwungen ist, sich ein wenig \u00fcber schwedische Mysterien weiterzubilden.\n\nGrafik: Naja nicht viel zu erg\u00e4nzen, die Grafik ist sehr schlicht gehalten. Das ist aber mit Absicht geschehen und gliedert sich super in das Spiel ein. Dieser gezeichnete Spielstil war meiner Meinung nach sehr treffend gew\u00e4hlt.\n\nFazit:\nEine sehr kurze Spielzeit, aber sehr gef\u00fchlvoll und mit einer guten Story dahinter. Man blickt nen bisschen in ne andere Kultur hinein und die Musik ist wirklich sehr sch\u00f6n, wenn man es mal etwas ruhiger mag. Daher ist Year Walk ein sehr sch\u00f6nes Spiel und ich kann es wirklich empfehlen :)\n\n\nWie in allen meinen Reviews poste ich auch hier meinen Let`s Play Kanal, wo ich derzeit auch \u00fcberlege mal schnell Year Walk (ist ja kurz) aufzunehmen :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/lightfire777\nAlternativ kannst du auch, wenn dir das Review gefallen hat,auch meiner Kuratorgruppe auf Steam folgen, um auch meine Reviews zu anderen Spielen zu bekommen: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Drakeschool", "timestamp_created": 1432067322, "timestamp_updated": 1477495797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565350", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15880393": {"recommendationid": "15880393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219221548", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434794943}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc911\uac04\uc5d0 \ub098\ubb34 \ub098\uc624\ub294\ub370\uc11c \uae38 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc783\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9ac\ub294\uac70 \ube7c\uace0\ub294 \uafc0\uc7bc \u314b\n", "timestamp_created": 1431912275, "timestamp_updated": 1431912275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15865623": {"recommendationid": "15865623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064792529", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431839190}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely felt it was worth the few bucks I spent.

In old Swedish culture, one who wanted to know their fortune in the future, be it in love, money, luck or longevity, stuck themselves in a pitch black room for 12 hours on an important calendar day (such as May Day, New Years Eve, Star Wars Day, or Talk Like a Pirate Day, that sort of thing) and emerged at midnight, they went on a walk around their local area, whereupon ghosts and spirits would appear upon their travels, with various meanings and motives. Their final destination would be a local church, where upon they would face their demons and have their fate told.\n\n\"Year Walk\" explores these travels in regards to a character's love life, and shares snippets of encyclopaedic knowledge of the Year Walk ritual. Have a maze of scenes that have the construct and aesthetic of illustrated lateral dioramas made of flattened layers. You move between, as you stumble around looking for spirits who will progress your journey.\nYear Walk is roughly only an hour long, though the puzzles are a little tricky, there are very few of them, and the map is not overly large. However, the game warrants two play-throughs to experience the whole story.\n\nIt's a curiosity of a game. Its creepy and unnerving. Informative and narratively interesting.

No game Ive ever played has been this short. Should the puzzles prove intuitive to you (hint: they wont) you could theoretically beat this game in about ten minutes. 'But wait!' you say ' the same could be said of Myst, and that game is amazing'.  The difference in this case is that Year Walk just isnt that good. It is, in essence, a primer on the concept of a Year Walk (the scandanavian tradition of, as far as I can tell, fasting yourself delusional then wandering around until you can see the future) and the sorts of critters and monster's you're likely to encounter on such a journey.  In basic point of fact, Year Walk is a bad puzzle game, with most of its puzzles revolving around draging things around the environment in ways you wouldnt normally assume possible. That, combined with the jump-scare horror and the fairly short runtime, makes this game fall short of a recommendation.\n\nHOWEVER. If you have a massive boner for any sort of mythology, and want to spend 20 minutes reading the game's codex, then a walkthough for the game, its not half bad.

Yes, engage in minor self-deprivation, fast, avoid festivals, and set out into the night to find the future, if you can only face everything within these woods.\n\nI am not always the greatest player of games like this, due to impatience and a tendency to try to solve even straightforwardish puzzles by overthinking, but the strength of Year Walk is its dark folklore tone, its eerily blocky art, the loneliness of the forest until you\u2019re suddenly not alone. This is 90% atmosphere, but it\u2019s great atmosphere. And you do have to read the encyclopedia, which contains my favorite style of game lore, all mildly oblique supernatural rumor contextualized with cultural rooting.\n\nThe story framing the Year Walk itself relies on some tropes that I won\u2019t spoil, but don\u2019t do much for me. However, it\u2019s also beside the point.

Here is a time where I wish Steam would have an \"OK\" recommendation instead of Yes or No.\n\nLength-wise, Year Walk is rather disappointing. I do not understand that some people can take hours with it. Just by wandering around helplessly, and using only 2 hints, I ended up finishing in around 30 minutes, and that's with seeing everything that you can see except for the alternate ending. Immediately afterwards, I got into the journal, and I racked up my game time from sitting there at different pages--because I saw how many entries there were, I started cooking myself dinner while going back and forth to the journal. In reality, you can probably read and fully engross yourself in the journal within about 20 minutes, and I picked up on what I was supposed to do and got the alternate ending immediately. After that, there is no replayability to the game at all.\n\nNow, when I first started the game, I sat down and read the Encyclopedia without going anywhere, and I was greatly interested in the folklore as it was described there. Afterwards, I ran through the whole game in one sitting. To be honest, nothing special seemed to be happening the whole game other than \"Hey, look, you're encountering everything you just read about!\" But besides solving a puzzle or two for each being, nothing really happened. Then you get to the end of the game and you're like \"What just happened?\"\n\nBy going through the alternate ending, you understand what happened. And as some people seem to argue that the ending means that the story can change, I argue on the other end. The alternate ending implies that everything is completely fixed and has no leeway.\n\nWhat I liked about the game, essentially, boils down to the Encyclopedia, the Journal, and the alternate ending. I was rather okay with the first ending being this weird ambiguous mess, but to be honest, I didn't really like much of your first playthrough. You're given all of the beings you just read about... but it just felt somewhat cheesy and slopped together. The atmosphere overall was alright though, but I never once got a scared feeling from the game (even with my headphones and the dark).\n\nI didn't pay full price for the game, and I am rather glad. Altogether, it is an interesting idea, but it is not much of your time. I understand everything in the game, but it's not going to engulf me and fill my mind forever like some people are posting on the forums. Rather, it's just a one-shot story that, while I did enjoy the story, could have used more development in the actual experience of the Year Walk itself.", "timestamp_created": 1425659976,

Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nI \u2013 Story [10/10]\n\nYear Walk is an indie adventure game from Simogo. The game begins with a young man (the player) visiting his lover. She hints that she has received a proposal from another suitor which she intends to accept. The player then informs her that he plans to go year walking (a vision journey rumored to give the walker a glimpse into the future), which causes the girl to warn the player against the dangers of the activity; stating that her cousin died doing that very thing. The player returns home and wakes at midnight to begin their year walk. Throughout the night, the player encounters several supernatural entities and puzzles that must be solved in order to complete the year walk.\n\nI\u2019m stopping the story retelling there because I absolutely refuse to spoil it. It is. hands down, incredible.\n\nII \u2013 UI [10/10]\n\nThe user interface was extremely minimal, which did wonders for the immersion in Year Walk. You have a small, circular reticle which is present on the screen for the majority of the game, but, beyond that, there\u2019s not much. Your HUD consists of directional arrows that fade in and out on the bottom and top of the screen when you can move in that direction. An unobtrusive, collapsible bar in the top right corner of the screen holds everything else you\u2019ll need to get through the game.\n\nIII \u2013 Gameplay [10/10]\n\nYear Walk was very much like an interactive storybook. It played like an intricate pop-up book and was incredibly unique. Actual gameplay in Year Walk is as simple as can be. Manipulating the W, A, S, and D keys (or the arrow keys, alternatively) allows you to navigate around the game world. Any interactions are performed via the reticle. Any control scheme that was more complex probably would have ruined the whole feel of the game. It all worked perfectly.\n\nIn addition to this, you\u2019re predominantly left to figure things out all on your own. There are hints that can be accessed for each chapter of the story, but if you use your head, you can puzzle everything out for yourself in a few minutes.\n\nAlso, be prepared to do a fair bit of reading. You\u2019ll see what I mean when you play the game.\n\nIV \u2013 Content [10/10]\n\nYear Walk I initially thought would be hard to pin a score down for it\u2019s level of content. However, after some careful consideration, I\u2019ve decided that it had the perfect amount of content for it\u2019s story. In fact, it had a lot more than I originally anticipated.\n\nV \u2013 Visual [10/10]\n\nBy now, you all should know that I\u2019m a complete sucker for morbidity and hand-drawn art. Year Walk was absolutely no exception to this rule. The artwork was gorgeous. Everything was very dark and somber. If you\u2019re exploring the world and you don\u2019t find yourself pausing to admire the landscape and the landmarks every once in a while, you\u2019re playing it the completely wrong way.\n\nVI \u2013 Audio [10/10]\n\nThe soundtrack of Year Walk routinely sent shivers down my spine. The song at the end credits is chilling, especially in the context of the ending of the game. Or should I say, one of the endings. The sounds of Year Walk were sheer brilliance too. You\u2019re guaranteed to feel creeped out at least once during a playthrough, but probably more than once. Aurally, Year Walk is a beautiful smorgasbord of music and sound.\n\nVII \u2013 Overall [10/10]\n\nOverall, Year Walk is a fantastic game.", "timestamp_created": 1424164970, "timestamp_updated": 1424164970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14510581": {"recommendationid": "14510581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123736076", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424158339}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc5b4\uc5cc\n\ud3ec\uadfc\ud574\ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc5d0 \uae34\uc7a5 \ud480\uace0 \ud558\ub2e4\uac00 \uae30\uc808\ud560\ubed4\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\n", "timestamp_created": 1424155027, "timestamp_updated": 1424155027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14509836": {"recommendationid": "14509836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015164214", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424147921}, "language": "english", "review": "Year Walk is a short story driven puzzle adventure with horror elements.

I would call this a visual story (not to be confused with a visual novel) and while most games are obviously 'visual stories', I'll try to give a reason as to why I call it that. I'll start with the gameplay as that will help me get my point across. \n\nYour character (never given a name) is put into this beautiful snowy landscape. The only movements you can make are to walk left and right, or forwards and backwards on paths. You have a cursor so you can click on objects here and there, but there aren't a ton of things to interact with. Hence, why I say this is more of a visual story. While you do have control, I feel more like you're just watching through their eyes.\n\nOnto the gameplay/setting. The term \"Year Walk\" (\u00c5rsg\u00e5ng) refers to a Swedish ritual that was believed to be done by people from the medieval times to the 19th century. The Year Walk was done on either Christmas Eve, or New Years. The idea is that you lock yourself in your house, void of light, no eating, drinking, or interacting with others. After which of 24 hours, the year walker is tasked with heading to their church in order to have a vision of the coming years future. There, they will have to pass the tests of supernatural creatures in order to be granted that vision.\n\nThe premise alone is very intriguing, and I knew nothing of it while diving into this game. Let me say this, I played through Year Walk in one sitting. Now, it only took me about 2.5 hours, but that time alone was very gripping and I couldn't wait to progress further along. The atmoshpere of the game is mind blowing. Play this with headphones on and in a dark room for full immersion. The game is also genuinely terrifying through it's use of the lore. Added that the soundtrack beautiful and the art is amazingly well put together, you've crafted a very serene yet eerie world that can totally draw you in and make you lose sight of things.\n\nWhile I would love to tell you much more about this game, I really need to leave it up to you to discover what it holds. It's not terribly hard, puzzle wise, but there are some here and there. Also, in game, if you'd like to read up more, they provide an encyclopedia that provides some descriptions of what you'll encounter. I've also heard you need to play it more than once to really get the full picture. So, I hope you will play this as I highly recommend it. It's something that will stay with you long after it's over.\n\nP.S. Don't worry about the box.

Above all else, you have to know what you're getting into, to properly enjoy it. This is [b]not[/b] a game, in the traditional sense, but it certainly requires player input! Even more than many games, somehow.\nIt's a very unique experience, certainly worth trying! Plus, you might learn a bit more about swedish folklore.\n\n[b][u]Context[/u][/b]\nI find it very similar to Fez, in a way. Year Walk is a riddle in and of itself. Its challenges rely on concepts more than anything the game directly teaches you, but all the clues are present for you to succeed. Also, it was clearly designed for multiple playthroughs (at least 2.5 - 3), and it was brilliantly made, with that in mind.\n\nI'm a sucker for mythology and folklore in general, so I had been interested in this game for a while. If you're trying it just \"because\", you might be lost for a while, and find it frustrating.\n\nGoing back to the Fez point: Fez was much harder and more cryptic, because its clues were very spread apart. There were lots of different areas, and it also relied on many skills completely unrelated to the game.\nYear Walk is not like that. While the game is mostly a riddle, you can get everything you need inside the game. I'd advise either taking notes, or screenshots and being very aware of your in-game surroundings, otherwise you'll probably be walking in circles.\n\n\n[b][u]Presentation[/u][/b]\nThe game is certainly fairly minimalist in its design, but I think it knew exactly what it needed to be. The [b]visuals[/b] are digital, but made to simulate paper cut-outs, which goes hand in hand with old folklore. Its use of color is also noteworthy, and while very subtle, it very much contributes to the overall atmosphere.\n\n[b][i]Interface issues[/i][/b]\nThe interface looks, perhaps, a bit too modern, but it's not too bad. The port is mostly okay, although there's a bit of disconnection to the pc, clearly. While there aren't big, intrusive buttons, they haven't really mapped any hot-keys that would have been [i]really[/i] useful (using M for map, or E for encyclopedia, for example), and you have to click everything. Then, in a puzzle, they have you use \"u\" and \"n\"! It was the hardest puzzle for me, haha! It clearly said \"u\" and \"n\" on the screen, but it felt so out of place that it took me a while to try it. Oh well.\n\nThe [b]sound-effects[/b] are a bit space-y, which feels a bit weird, but it sort of fits. They're well done, but I would have liked something more traditional.\n\nThe [b]music[/b], thought, is definitely one of the aspects where it shines! (Of course, this is biased.)\nIt's mostly quiet and atmospheric, but it gives you an eerie feeling at times, through two main aspects: slight dissonance, and using what seems to be aged instruments, that don't sound [i]quite right[/i]. These two aspects have been in my mind for a while, on how to make creepy music... So there you go. Of course, I found it great! But honestly, I think it works, and gives it a very natural feeling. Good job!\nThere's a problem, though:\n\n[b][i]No sound on the menus[/i][/b]\nWhenever you open the map, or the encyclopedia, the music stops. That... is a problem, and a big one, in my opinion.\nIn a game that relies so much on atmosphere, a continuous flow of sound is critical. If you need to open the map (which should often happen, especially during your first playthrough -- a the one that relies the most on atmosphere!), the music stops, and it completely breaks immersion. I seem to mention this in a lot of games, recently, but it's really important! \nHaving the music cut-out when you have to do something as simple as opening a map... that's bad. Furthermore, it makes those menus seem completely out of the experience that the game was going for. \nI'd like to see this changed, at least in future games, but hey... it's not [i]game-breaking[/i], I guess.\n\n\n[b][u]Game Mechanics[/u][/b]\nTo start off, this is an adventure game. Instead of being a point n' click, however, you can walk in 2D, in several lanes set in 3D. You can go back and forth to change lane, at specific points. It can be a bit confusing, at first, but there's a map, and while your first playthrough feels a bit alien, it all makes sense after that. And it's still very compelling.\n\n[b][i]Puzzles vs. Riddles[/i][/b]\nI'll make this clear right away. A puzzle, in my eyes, is based on mechanics that a game teaches you. Most games work like this.\nA riddle, on the other hand, relies on something beyond the game. These skills are mostly learned outside of the game, and makes what could be \"puzzles\", mostly unrelated to one another. \n\nThis is why I say Year Walk is more of a riddle. \nThere are clues inside the game, of course, but it never teaches you anything. It never starts easy and gets progressively harder. Not at all. Every riddle is like a self-contained puzzle, reliant on combining the clues, and skills you have acquired outside the game. \n\nSome of the puzzles are based on listening cues, some are based on [i]soft[/i]cryptography, etc. But I think it's balanced. I managed to go through my first playthrough without getting stuck  at any point, and without using Hints. But again, you need to be in the right mindset to enjoy it! \n\nThese riddles are based on the mythological creatures you'll find in the game. You won't, of course, know what these creatures are, or why they're there. And that's normal. To complement the game, there's an [b]Encyclopedia[/b]. This is merely a collection of texts, one about each creature or event you're playing. It's not a direct guide for the game, as it doesn't really help with the [i]solving a puzzle[/i], but it gives context to what you're doing! And may also give you some clues on where the solution may lie.\nI've found it very interesting, but it's still about reading [i]outside the game[/i]! It's the same problem that Type:Rider had, the way it never taught you through gameplay, but through wikipedia-esque articles.\n\nYear Walk doesn't function this way! But it has some similar problems. Still, the creatures are [i]still[/i]in the game, but it would have felt much better to have some more integration of the Encyclopedia in the game. Maybe some more clues to the puzzles... I believe the Encyclopedia was a companion app for the iOS game, so that's it doesn't quite feel a part of the game, unfortunately.\n\n[b][i]Symbolism in the game[/i][/b]\nI think this is the best part of the game, by far! Every encounter has some meaning. It will not be apparent at all, the first time. However, the game always gives you slight clues on what to do next. On your second playthrough, it's quite different. I don't want to spoil it, but it's about reading an Historian's \"diary\" while he was investigating the tradition of Year Walk. It's [i]all[/i] reading (and there's a lot of it), and also taking notes to solve the last puzzle in the game. Again, it's completely detached from [i]playing[/i] the game, but it's as interesting as it makes you feel like a detective!\n\nThis diary tells the actual story of the, as if it happened a few centuries ago. While you're reading this, everything you encountered in the game starts making sense. \nThis is the first part of the journal. \nThe second is far more conspiracy-like and esoteric, but due to the very believable first part, you start questioning everything that's happened in the game, up to that point! It was one of the most compelling experiences I've recently had in a game! \n\nEvery symbol is explained in the game! Not initially, but it is. And that's the way to do it! You won't leave it feeling like it was just pretentious gibberish. It's genuinely interesting, and the questions extend the game itself!\n\nAlready out of words... Seriously, this is one of the most interesting experiences on Steam, and is one that's based on [i]real[/i] folklore, which is always a plus!\n", "timestamp_created": 1422275099, "timestamp_updated": 1422275099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505840", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14173382": {"recommendationid": "14173382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070542340", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423275236}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy interesante juego de suspenso sobrenatural con un arte visual muy agradable a la vista, soundtrack que complementa la experiencia a la perfecci\u00f3n y acertijos con un buen nivel de dificultad que har\u00e1n que lleves a la mano l\u00e1piz y papel, pero lo que realmente vende el juego es su historia, la cual para disfrutarla en su totalidad es indispensable leerse la enciclopedia inclu\u00edda, y una vez finalizado  el juego tomarse su tiempo para descubir por cuenta propia los secretos para as\u00ed desbloquear el final verdadero, mi \u00fanica \"queja\" ser\u00eda que el juego es corto lo cual realmente no es un gran problema, short and sweet, como una buena pel\u00edcula.", "timestamp_created": 1422246442, "timestamp_updated": 1422246442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14173100": {"recommendationid": "14173100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101257560", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422385528}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing art, interesting puzzles, amazing music, and a really beautiful story. \nProbably my favorite indie game i've played since journey on the ps3", "timestamp_created": 1422244397, "timestamp_updated": 1422256444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14164424": {"recommendationid": "14164424", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978820749", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422396746}, "language": "english", "review": "Like the Jaws of video games, dare you go into the winter woodland after playing this ?

fiumi, e trarrebbe in inganno i passanti per poi trascinarli nei meandri degli abissi, ancora i [b]\"Myling\"[/b], e molte altre figure, che saranno protagoniste di questa mainstory interessante.\n\nNel corso della nostra permanenza, si avr\u00e0 la possibilit\u00e0 di consultare un enciclopedia, per approfondire se lo si vuole, il significato di alcune presenze e di alcune credenze.\nLa mappa non \u00e8 molto ampia, ma questo non risulta rilevante, \u00e8 abbastanza semplice ed intuitiva, segnata dai vari percorsi percorribili, da utilizzare in diverse situazioni per rendere pi\u00f9 fluida l'esplorazione.\n\nNella risoluzione di alcuni puzzle potrebbero emergere delle fasi di Backtracking, tutt'altro che insistenti, e non faranno poi storcere il naso, soprattutto ai giocatori che finiranno per essere inghiottiti dall'ambientazione e cullati da un comparto audio tranquillo e a tratti inquietante.\nLo stile grafico \u00e8 particolare, minimale, e fa da collante perfetto con le vicende mistiche che si svolgono in questa piccola cittadina, partorita dalla creativit\u00e0 degli sviluppatori.\n\nIl gioco risulta in definitiva un prodotto che merita, e che si \u00e8 fatto apprezzare molto, consiglio pienamente l'acquisto a tutti!", "timestamp_created": 1421275654, "timestamp_updated": 1449938800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

it seems more like a detective short story than a surreal video game. the historian is haunted by the creatures you interact with from the game as they show him how to help the main character. his research into the year walk tradition explains a lot about the plot. i will say that this whole aspect of the game seems a bit out of place: like the developers just threw it in because they felt like people would be confused by the twist ending or wonder how the game ties into the real world. ultimately it created a bit more confusion than was already present, but since you get a chance to save a very likeable character it makes a good addition to the game. the alternate ending created by the journal does involve the very overused (especially in games) cliche of heroic sacrifice.\n\nnone of this would really matter if the game didn't have nice aesthetics though. it doesn't try to make up for anything with them, but the simplistic gameplay and virtual lack of dialogue would make for a very boring game if it weren't for the way this game looks. the graphics go along very well with the gameplay and other stylistic choices for the game, like the use of runes, the setting, the light horror aspect, and the depiction of the folk figures. allegedly the developer of the game researched horror movies to get the timing right on the spooky scenes, and it really shows. right when the music gets peaceful and the graphics become fluid and lure you into a false sense of security, some spooky pagan [spoiler] shit [/spoiler] will come flying at you out of the blue. people are very averse to the jump scare, and most fans of horror and critics will say that it's a cheap or uncreative tactic, but just like everything it has its place, and there are some times where it's appropriate to use it. unlike most of the horror genre, where the jump scare is used so much it becomes a joke amongst the audience, this game knows when to trigger a fight or flight response.\n\nbesides minor flaws i talked about, this is one of my favorite games right now. i know most folklore fans don't give a [spoiler] shit [/spoiler] about games, and most gamers don't give a [spoiler] shit [/spoiler] about folklore, but this game has something to offer to both groups.", "timestamp_created": 1421200338, "timestamp_updated": 1421200338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13974146": {"recommendationid": "13974146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056669850", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410664833}, "language": "english", "review": "i am ashamed to say that this game is 2spooky for me. scurry atmosphere/10, worth the $2 or so I got it for on sale.

Der Artstyle ist sparsam, karg, aber verdammt gut. Er kommt auf den Punkt, ohne dabei unkonkret, oder zu unkonkret zu wirken. Er ist symbolhaft, wie die Metaphern im Spiel.\nDas Spiel sieht gut aus, weil es so h\u00e4sslich ist. Der Sound tr\u00e4gt exzellent zur Stimmung bei. Die Musik tr\u00e4gt die gleiche Schwere, wie das Spiel selbst.\n\nDIE STEUERUNG:\nDie Steuerung ist gelinde gesagt simpel, aber sie funktioniert in diesem Fall ganz gut. Man bewegt sich mit den Richtungstasten bzw. WASD zwischen den Bildern auf der Karte umher. Man merkt schon, dass das Spiel eigentlich f\u00fcr das wischen auf dem Tablett gemacht wurde.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nDas Spiel will vom Spieler, dass er liest, zwingt Ihn aber nicht dazu.\nMan ist nicht in Eile, kann sich Zeit nehmen, wie man will.\nDie R\u00e4tsel sind recht einfach. Mit Kopfh\u00f6rern zu spielen, empfiehlt sich aber auf jeden Fall.\nMan bewegt sich mit den Pfeiltasten oder WASD. Die Maus dient zum interagieren an bestimmten Stellen.\n\nHORROR oder nicht?\nJa, doch. Im klassischen Sinne. Im Sinne von ETA Hoffmann, Marry Shally, vielleicht noch Alfred Hitchkock? Eher unterhaltsam gruselig, als schockierend und explizit.\nKein Saw, kein Texas Chainsaw Massacre, eher eine Priese Sleepy Hollow, dabei lange nicht so actionreich. Oft dabei durchaus direkt, ohne aufgesetzt zu wirken. Ein bisschen gruseln vielleicht. Das Spiel l\u00f6st dabei aber keine Angstzust\u00e4nde aus.\n\nFazit:\n\nDas Spiel ist gut durchdacht, wird unterst\u00fctz durch einen guten Artstyle und exzellente akustische Untermalung.\nEs ist ein bisschen kurz und wird dem PC-Spieler mit seiner f\u00fcr Tabletts ausgelegten Steuerung nicht ganz gerecht.\nDie Limitierung der Bewegung unterst\u00fctzt dabei aber gut das Storytelling.\nDie mitgelieferten Wohlf\u00fchlfeatures, Ingamehints, Karte und nicht zuletzt der Enzyklop\u00e4die, die einem das Drumherum doch etwas n\u00e4her bringt machen aus dem Spieler aber ein modernes Spiel, dass nicht durch unn\u00f6tig komplizierte R\u00e4tsel den Spielfluss bremsen. Sicherlich k\u00f6nnte die Komplexit\u00e4t stellenweise etwas h\u00f6her sein, aber so wie es ist, funktioniert es gut.\n\nDie Storry und der Kern dieses Spiels ist fesselnd und bewegend, man muss sich jedoch darauf einlassen.\nDie melancholische Stimmung ist sicherlich nichts f\u00fcr absolute Hedonisten, wer aber auch nur manchmal eine gewisse melancholische Stimmung versp\u00fcrt, wird dieses Spiel lieben.\nDas Spiel ist grausam, ja, aber nicht auf die Art, wie man es vielleicht erwartet. Nicht die Schockmomente, die hier und da platziert sind, sind die, die einen Aufw\u00fchlen, es ist die Storry selbst.\n\nEine Kurzgeschichte in Form eines Spiels, die einem das Tempo des Erlebens nicht vorgibt. Sie erwartet allerdings, dass man sich auf sie einl\u00e4sst. Weder ist dieses Spiel ein reines Adventure, noch ein R\u00e4tselspiel, am ehesten vielleicht eine Visual Novel mit R\u00e4tselelementen. Erwartet nicht zu viele R\u00e4tsel, oder dass ihr mit 1000 Objekten interagieren m\u00fcsst, aber glaubt auch nicht, dass ihr wie in einer reinen Visual Novel einfach durch den Text klickt, bis ihr eine Entscheidung treffen m\u00fcsst.\n\nEin Hinweis, der hier schon auf englisch gefallen ist, dass es zwei Enden gibt.\nJa, die gibt es und das zweite Ende rundet die Sache ab. Vielleicht nicht so, wie man es erwartet, aber macht euch die M\u00fche und folgt den Anweisungen am Ende des ersten Durchgangs, um dem zweiren Weg zu folgen.\n\nViel Spa\u00df beim Year Walken.\n\nP.S: Ein guter Zeitpunkt daf\u00fcr ist Silvester\n\nNominiert f\u00fcr die Steam Awards", "timestamp_created": 1420052445, "timestamp_updated": 1479934682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835169", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13742147": {"recommendationid": "13742147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140295131", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451621194}, "language": "english", "review": "as it is new year's eve, now is a most appropriate time to write a review on [i]year walk[/i]...\n\n[i]year walk[/i] is a strange tale, set in northern scandinavia on new year's eve.  it blends fragments off folk-lore with a little bit of horror, some surrealism and detective work.  your role in the story is not clear at first, but you soon find yourself unravelling a curious mystery.  the basic interface is point-and-click, with puzzles to be solved.  although this sounds simple enough, the reason why this game is a gem is because of the atmosphere.  the art-style, movement and sounds all combine to give this game an amazing feel.  although only drawn, and with only a few scares, the style and items you uncover will give you the most creepy feeling.  it is cleverly done and from me it is highly recommended.\n\nbut the time is getting on and i must go.  at the stroke off midnight i will venture out into the night through the dark woods where strange creatures roam.  i will make my [i]year walk[/i] to see if i will be wealthy, to see if i will be happy, to see if i will live, to see if i will be loved...", "timestamp_created": 1420048190, "timestamp_updated": 1420048190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547073", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13740797": {"recommendationid": "13740797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072052495", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513274600}, "language": "english", "review": "It's by far the best game I've ever played!

The game mostly consists of clue collecting and puzzle solving, which reveals the story of our hero's \"Year Walk\" and the folklore behind it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1419624892, "timestamp_updated": 1419624892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13605207": {"recommendationid": "13605207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152740472", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426971963}, "language": "french", "review": "Je n'ai absolument pas compris la fin mais ce jeu est g\u00e9nial!

A warning, though:  If you are at all squeamish about blood or death, you will have a hard time playing this.  \n\nThe artwork is reminiscent of hand-cut paper collages, further enhancing the traditional folk feeling of the game.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it mainly involves circling through a layered snowy landscape in search of puzzles and clues.  As you advance the plot, new paths open up and new interactables appear.  The key is figuring out which puzzles you can solve right away, and which you will need to come back to later after you have more information.  Backtracking is a key component of the game, but the map is small enough that it never feels like a slog.\n\nThe built-in hint system is useful in guiding you through the main plot if you are stuck.  It contains a progressive series of hints for each chapter, with the first hint being an extremely vague nudge in the right direction, and the last hint being a blatant spoiler.  Players can control which hints are revealed and which remain hidden, so you only ever get as much information as you need.\n\nSomething I didn't realize on my first playthrough: Some puzzles require keyboard interaction, some puzzles require the mouse, some require a combination of keyboard and mouse.  If you are stuck, it might be because you didn't realize you could click and drag an object to move it, or click and hold an item to carry it.\n\nSome of the achievements are tricky to get, but between the game itself and the achievement descriptions, you should eventually be able to figure them all out.  \n\nWhile this game will likely leave you feeling depressed due to its tragic thematic elements, it is still an amazing little gem, and I would give it an overall rating of 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1416500831, "timestamp_updated": 1416500831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13002708": {"recommendationid": "13002708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122114812", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451670090}, "language": "english", "review": "Errie, gorgeous, sad and cheap on the wallet.

With gameplay and other technicalities pushed aside, there's nothing to distract you from immersing yourself in the game. And when you think you're finished, in a very self-referential twist the game reveals another layer of itself to complete the story. Striking and distinct audiovisual side perfectly complements the setting and folklore elements, making the game just as beautiful as it is grim and unnerving. Some criticize it for being quite short.

There is a tension that accompanies the cold sounds and bleak environs. I was very impressed by the artistic style of Year Walk. It was minimalist, bleak but also beautiful. The colours aren't vibrant but they needn't be - hell they *shouldn't be*. This is the snowy wilderness of Scandinavia. I expect white, greys, blacks. Purples and reds are also used sparingly and effectively. The puzzles can be difficult, which I find helps the game a lot. It's a bit of a throwback to when games just sort of left you to it, with few or no hints. You're pretty much on your own in Year Walk, and I had to consult a walkthrough a couple of times. Some puzzles require some thought, and I found myself utilising the whole map to complete the puzzles, so no wasted space there at all. \n\n\nThe story is a difficult aspect to critique because I feel the gameplay tells the story itself. So to critique the way I play the game is to critique the story. That being said, there is some backstory, which is told through some basic dialogue at the beginning of the game, and there is an encyclopaedia which accompanies you in the game, which is pretty critical to completing the game - but the information in the (very small) encyclopaedia helps give background also. I find this method of story telling to be quite innovative and also found it really help immerse me in the game. The controls are basic - arrow keys for navigation, mouse for point/click. Can't really go wrong there.\n\nIn conclusion, Year Walk is a quirky, beautiful little game.

off.. AMAZING GAME!! This is now one my favorite horror point&click puzzle games.  SO, basically you are doing a Year Walk which is a spiritual journey to discover the future, either bad or good.  It shows both 3d and 2d graphics and blends them together perfectly IMO. If you are like me and get into the storyline and the mood the creators try to portray, well you are in for a treat.  I was at the edge of my seat the entire time I played.  Its horror is really cool but not the typical horror of todays hollywood movies, but that just straight up creepy horror that sends chills down your spine.  If you are looking for a game that is fun and tests you, well here it is. You can use hints that they let you click but really, only use if you are extremely stuck and have no idea what to do next.  At the end of the game it never says \"THE END\" but there is an end. So pay attention, cause unlike most games that you just get up an walk away during the credits...THIS YOU WANT TO STAY! it gives you vital info that you will need for your next playthrough and to access parts of the game that can not be accesses without that info. SO ENJOY YOUR YEAR WALK...it just might be your last..MWUAHAHAH XD", "timestamp_created": 1409134920, "timestamp_updated": 1409134920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

The controls are very simple and you just click items to interact with them.  The horror part of this game is mostly environmental.  It has an eerie feel to it and there's occasional jump scares.  I admit it's easy to get confused about the task at hand but you can always use the hints and map to get you in the right direction.  The artwork to this game is unique and adds to the feel of the game.  To me, between the music and artwork it feels like you're in a dream/nightmare.

I just finished a puzzle that ended in a really freaky jumpscare, and overall the atmosphere is really creepy and intense. If that's going to really freak you out or if you really can't stand games like that, this isn't the game for you.\nOverall my reaction has been wholly positive so far, even if I did just get the pants scared off me. The art is gorgeous, the music is eerie but nice, and the controls are very simple, making for easy-to-learn gameplay. I don't think I'm close to finished quite yet, but between the art and the overall atmosphere of the game, I'm really enjoying playing.\n\nAnd it's not just a horror game; it's a puzzle game. Puzzles that are original and unique from what I've seen in other games for the most part, and they aren't just random little things; everything seems to be fitting together, puzzles take you through many different areas of the game (thankfully there's a map), and there's an easy-to-use hint system that keeps me from getting frustrated by an 'unsolvable' puzzle. There does seem to be quite a bit of backtracking involved, as where you can move is limited (only side to side, and forwards/backwards only when there is a path), but I feel that that's a minor flaw in an otherwise entirely enjoyable game.

It's chilling and unnerving in a way that messes with your head, transcending its own existence into something that feels tangible; too close for comfort and so well crafted it causes you to second guess your own instincts that this is nothing but fantasy. As I sat staring at \"The End\" plastered across my screen, I could still feel my quickened pulse as I tried to shake the feeling of being on edge, something no piece of entertainment in any medium has managed in what feels like a very long time.\n\nYear walking is a practice (largely found in Sweden) in which a ritual is performed by the walker through which they are given a glimpse through time at what the future holds. However, it comes at a grave cost, and there is no guarantee the walker will  even make it through alive.\n\nWalking through a forest at midnight, snow blanketing the ground around you, you come face to face with the horrors that befall those that dare to year walk: The Watchers, twisted and greedy spirits, who demand their sacrifice for showing you what is to come. The deeper you get, the more vile and disturbing these encounters become, before you finally enter the church and see your fate.\n\nThis is when the game first ends, but it also marks the point at which the game truly begins. Up to this point you've been bustled along through this story with little in the way of explanation or reason. It's artistically brilliant and frightening to be sure, but all the same largely disconnected and without any real purpose, meant to alarm but ultimately lacking any substance. It's not then until you begin to walk again and the curtain is pulled away that the pieces fall into place and the true meaning behind your circumstances become clear. Terrifyingly so.\n\nYear Walk is a master at what it tries to be. It lets nothing on and leaves you wandering in the dark for a good while, which only makes it more unnerving when it finally lays its cards on the table. The expert use of Swedish folklore ties its world and ours together as it attempts to break the forth wall as it weaves together fantasy and psychological horror into a brief but immensely compelling narrative. If you've gotten this far you've likely realized I've said a lot of nothing in all these words, and that's entirely intentional, as to say what makes Year Walk so brilliant would be to completely ruin it the experience. No, this is one walk that you have to take for yourself, though I promise you won't regret it.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2014/08/02/year-walk-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1406958404, "timestamp_updated": 1425500134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 103, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.887587", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11509321": {"recommendationid": "11509321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095076403", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406865994}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[b][h1]MAGIA PURA[/h1][/b]\nYear Walk es uno de tantos ejemplos en donde los videojuegos se convierten en obras de arte.

This entails staying alone in the dark without food/water during new year's eve, and when the clock strikes midnight, you take a walk in the forest surrounding your cabin. As you explore, you meet strange creatures, that taunt you with puzzles which you have to solve in order to be allowed for a glimpse of what the future holds. Little do you know that this knowledge comes with consequences.\n\nYear walk's art looks beautiful and in combination with the soundtrack, it creates a haunting and creepy atmosphere. You essentialy walk around in a 2d first person view environment, trying to make sense of the strange things you encounter. Many of them have a meaning towards solving the creature's riddles, so make sure to note down important stuff. Depending on your puzzle skills, you can find them easy or difficult, but there are hint and guide options for the latter, and I believe your overall experience will not be ruined either way. Also, the game's duration is rather small, probably under 3 hours, however I strongly recommend it, especially to avid puzzle gamers and anyone who enjoys a particularly well set backstory.\n\n+ Great art style\n+ Creepy atmosphere\n+ Great story\n+ Simple, but cryptic puzzles\n\n- A few jumpscares (might be a + depending on your taste)\n- Short duration\n- Puzzles can be frustrating without hint use for some people", "timestamp_created": 1405180992, "timestamp_updated": 1405180992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701244", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11190751": {"recommendationid": "11190751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077422916", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405079292}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game when I first got and didn't understand how it worked.

Nach dem erste Jump werdet ihr sehr vorsichtig, was das L\u00f6sen und rumrennen betrifft. \nDie Story selbst findet sich in einem verschneitem Wald wieder, in dem ihr durchirrt (so wie ich). \nDie Grafik und das Designe ist sehr schlicht, trotzdem in 1080p. Sehr wenige Farben. Alles in Schwarz-, Wei\u00df- und Graut\u00f6nen gehalten. Dies ist aber beabsichtigt um eine schaurige Kulisse zu schaffen. Die Musik passt wie die Faust aufs Aug zur Kulisse. Sehr sehr gut abgestimmt. Dadurch erscheint alles ein kleinen Ticken gruseliger. Mit dem Hang, dass es einem eiskalt den R\u00fccken runterl\u00e4uft. \nZur Story selbst kann ich so nicht viel sagen (ja obwohl ich das Game durchgezockt habe).

If you're a fan of folklore/history, engrossing atmospheres, or bite-sized games well worth their money, buy Year Walk now!\n\nThe game has you adventuring through a solemn forest on New Year's Eve to attempt an archaic Swedish ritual known as year walking, which allows a person to see into the future of the next year. Year Walk astounded me by how much care it gave to the Swedish folklore. An in-game Encyclopedia allows you to read the details about each creature you'll encounter in the forest. The games developer, Simogo, does a brilliant job of translating these stories into memorable gameplay and artwork. The soundtrack is equally chilling yet captivating, and provides the perfect backdrop to many of the game's distinct moments.\n\nI only have two, measly warnings about Year Walk. First, of all, it\u2019s very short. My first playthrough on iOS took less than 3 hours; this is the longest it should take anyone. I still found the experience incredibly satisfying, enough so that I bought the version here on Steam as well. Secondly, I enjoyed how the Encyclopedia and Journal were in a separate app on the iOS version (I won't say why for spoilers), so I wish the Steam version forced players to view them in a similar form as well.\n\nOverall, Year Walk is worthy game for any horror or puzzle fan, and one of my favorite games from 2013.

Were I to sum up my feelings on my time with Year Walk, I could think of no other term or phrase that better exemplifies my experience. In the brief time that it takes to complete this surreal journey, I could barely pull myself away from my computer.\n\nYear Walk is a story of a Love that cannot be, and a man who seeks to know if his love may ever be returned in kind. What follows is a bizarre foray into Scandinavian folklore, of moving through time itself to see one\u2019s future, and facing the terrifying creatures that block your path.\n\nYou\u2019re limited to a two dimensional plane, from which you can move left and right, and to and from connected planes . The entirety of the map is relatively small, with around a dozen or so total planes from which you can move about freely. Given the game\u2019s previous touch screen interface, it\u2019s important to remember as such while trying to figure out puzzles. The game expects you to move your cursor like you would your finger, often quickly and in succession. Mind you, this never becomes a problem, as there are no reflexive puzzles to speak. I just feel it\u2019s worth keeping in mind, as first starting out, it felt a bit odd solving puzzles in that manner using a standard mouse. \n\nGiven this title\u2019s origins on mobile platforms, it is important to know that any limitations this may bring to its mechanics do not extend to its presentation. The world you explore is gorgeous, and the orchestral score and sound design is superbly unsettling, to the point where I could visibly see goose bumps forming on my arms. The visual design itself is equally divine, and combined, make even the occasional jump scare give me a notable fright. While I would recommend this for the score alone, several of the puzzles require you to recognize subtleties in sounds, and so headphones are a must.\n\nThe experience is short; it took me two hours to finish everything, and that was with plenty of incompetency on my part in regards to what I should be doing. Luckily, new to the PC port, there is a map system that always pinpoints your exact location. And there\u2019s a hint system should you ever become lost on what you should be doing next. There\u2019s also a series of journal entries that better explains the horrors you experience. While I would personally recommend waiting on these reads until [i]after[/i] finishing the game, at the very least, you should refrain from looking at individual entries until you\u2019ve successfully passed their respective portions of the game.\n\nIn fact, the journal provides something I often find lacking in other similarly surrealistic titles: explanation. The journal provides a background on the Scandinavian mythos that you will encounter in the game, and the entire experience is better for it. \n\nEven given the very short length of the journey, I wholeheartedly recommend it as one that any interested in the bizarre and the macabre should pick up. It is spectacular, and I was glued to my computer screen for the entire duration.

Why not. While it has its issues, I found Year Walk worth its price tag and an interesting game. \n\n[b]Movement[/b]\nWalking side to side and moving forward and backwards through panes, the movement system is interesting at first and compliments the art style well, but eventually it becomes slightly tedious. \n\n[b]Puzzles[/b]\nOverall, the puzzles were enjoyable, the majority being based off memory, fetching, and reference. While the puzzles themselves are fairly easy, the most difficult part is realizing what gives you the answer. An example of this being one puzzle where you need to look at the pattern that one object moves in to know which order to click two other objects, meanwhile these objects appear totally unrelated and are halfway across the map from one another. Some may appreciate the adventuring it takes to find this out, others may just become frusrated.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nI found the story to be of little importance besides setting up a beginning and end for the game. During the meat of the gameplay I gave the story very little thought. With that being said, I did enjoy the little amount of story that did occur, I only wish there was more of it. \n\n[b]Dat Spookiness[/b]\nWhile mostly just eerie, there are one or two jump scare moments that catch you off-guard. I enjoyed the music, it is definitely used well in the game and adds to the tension, even if that tension never really comes to a boil but simply simmers on the back burner. \n\n[b]Interface[/b]\nConstant checking of the map, while not excruciating, does become a slight burden. The inclusion of a journal, which I did not use, could make for more a immersive experience if someone were to. A Hints section is well done, offering at first very general advice as to how to go forward, however if you continue with the hints they do become fairly direct as to what to do. \n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nI found Year Walk to be a unique experience.

Very interesting Scandanavian Folklore, great presentation, eerie and sometimes frightening.

Finally it arrives on Mac, and I was not dissapointed. This is an absolutely one-of-a-kind game. I can't even think of a game that is close to it (although of course there many games I've never heard of so take that with a grain of salt). \n\nYou are a 19th century Swedish Man who has just been told by the woman he loves that she is going to marry someone else. Desiring a glimpse into the future, you set out on the ancient but dying tradition of a Year Walk: at the stroke of midnight you set out from your house to reach the church, but along the way you encounter numerous mystical creatures and artifacts.\n\nThe gameplay consists of puzzle and exploration elements. It is 2D, but you can move forwards or backwards at preset places on your path. The world is not very large but it's still quite easy to get lost, so thankfully the game includes a map. Every puzzle in this game is unique and enjoyable, so the game stays fresh for its three hour or so length. There was only one puzzle I disliked and couldn't beat, because it used sound and I'm completely tone deaf, but thankfully there's a built-in hint system that will guide you through any puzzles you can't solve.\n\nThe art style is quite stark - flat and angular and washed out. Yet it is beautiful all the same. The creatures are grotesque or beautiful or both. The snow-covered Swedish woods are haunting and lonely, evoking a sense of foreboding and wonder at the same time. This juxtaposition is not easy to achive and I applaud the developers.\n\nThe story is surprisingly deep and moving, which I did not expect. The game deals with the theme of overreaching and trying to change things that are not within our power. Once the game is over, there is in fact a larger story to discover and a true ending to the game that will stick with you for quite some time.\n\nThe best part of the game is discovering and interacting with all the spirits you meet along teh way. The encyclopedia that accompanies the game gives background lore on these fantastical spirits that most have never heard of. They are all wonderfully bizzare and fascinating, although I may be a little biased as I am quite into lore and the mystical.\n\nIf you want a game that completely sucks you into its unique world, then this is it.

Pero si nos alejamos de los Dioses y h\u00e9roes mas habituales, aparecen ante nosotros extra\u00f1os personajes y costumbres anta\u00f1o desaparecidas, capaces de cautivarnos con su belleza y su simbolismo. Year Walk nos da unas peque\u00f1as pinceladas de ese desconocido mundo y de lo que nos espera tras el.\n\n\n[b]Un paseo por el bosque en busca de respuestas.[/b]\n\nYear Walk comienza habl\u00e1ndonos brevemente sobre el rito n\u00f3rdico del mismo nombre, que podr\u00edamos traducir toscamente como \u201ccambiar de a\u00f1o a pie\u201d, y que consist\u00eda en encerrarse a solas en una habitaci\u00f3n, sin comida ni bebida hasta estar hambrientos y agotados, para posteriormente, la noche de fin de a\u00f1o, salir al bosque en busca de visiones y respuestas sobre el futuro. \n\nEntonces nos sit\u00faa en mitad de un bosque nevado de la Suecia de finales del siglo XIX. Nuestro movimiento se limita a desplazarnos lateralmente por el bosque, para avanzar o retroceder en los puntos indicados hacia nuevas zonas. Lo primero que nos encontramos nada mas salir de nuestra caba\u00f1a, es una Caja. Esta Caja, que sin duda intentaremos abrir sin \u00e9xito, es clave para la historia del juego, pero ya os hablare de ella al final del texto. Podremos ayudarnos de un mapa que nos localiza dentro del bosque para que movernos por el no nos suponga un problema, ya que el paraje, arboles y mas arboles rodeados por nieve, puede hacer que nos perdamos mas de una vez. Siguiendo el mapa llegamos hasta un molino, donde nos encontramos con una chiquilla que esta esper\u00e1ndonos, y con la que sin duda tenemos alguna especie de romance. Ella parece estar preocupada acerca de dar una respuesta a alguien sobre algo, pero no se nos especifica que, si bien es f\u00e1cil de imaginar que esta envuelta en un triangulo amoroso con nuestro personaje y un tercero, y que su relaci\u00f3n con nosotros no esta bien vista. Ante su preocupaci\u00f3n, nuestro personaje sugiere la opci\u00f3n de llevar a cabo un \u201cyear walk\u201d, y as\u00ed saber que le depara el futuro a nuestra relaci\u00f3n. Ella se muestra asustada y nos recomienda no hacerlo, para despu\u00e9s despedirse de nosotros, oblig\u00e1ndonos a volver a nuestra caba\u00f1a en mitad del bosque.\n\nSi hubi\u00e9semos hecho lo que nuestra amada suger\u00eda, el juego no existir\u00eda, por lo que hacemos caso omiso de su recomendaci\u00f3n, y esa misma media noche empieza nuestro Year Walk.\n\nNuestro objetivo ser\u00e1 llegar a la Iglesia, y para ello el juego basa su mec\u00e1nica en resolver puzles y en hacernos vagar por el solitario bosque en busca de la manera de superar cada uno de ellos. Las soluciones a todos ellos est\u00e1n ah\u00ed casi desde el principio, y solo hay que saber verlas y cuando aplicar cada una. Cabe recordar en este punto que Year Walk es un juego adaptado desde dispositivos t\u00e1ctiles, donde ya se publico hace un a\u00f1o, por lo que en este caso sera el rat\u00f3n el que haga las veces de \u201cdedo\u201d, y nos ayude a tocar, coger, girar o desplazar los objetos con los que interactuaremos para la resoluci\u00f3n de los puzles que nos lleven hasta el interior de la Iglesia. Tambi\u00e9n hay alg\u00fan acertijo basado en el sonido, por lo que es recomendable jugar bien con auriculares, o con el volumen bien subido.\n\nLa noche de fin de a\u00f1o sueca nos depara algunas sorpresas. Personajes de aspecto macabro, ligeros toques de terror incluyendo alg\u00fan susto, y una inesperada parte final de juego, donde obtendremos nuestra ansiada visi\u00f3n del futuro y llegaremos a la resoluci\u00f3n de nuestro camino. Una resoluci\u00f3n abrupta, inesperada, y que nos dejara con cara de que aqu\u00ed falta algo. Y efectivamente, as\u00ed es. \n\nYear Walk no acaba con el final que veremos tras nuestra visi\u00f3n. Tras ello, tendremos la opci\u00f3n de \u201clogearnos\u201d en un diario escrito, supuestamente, por Theodor Almsten, historiador y mit\u00f3logo, que narra su investigaci\u00f3n sobre el rito del \u201cyear walk\u201d. En esa narraci\u00f3n, se nos dar\u00e1n a conocer nombres y ubicaciones que nos resultar\u00e1n tremendamente familiares. Tan familiares, como que son las que nosotros mismos hemos visto en el juego que acabamos de terminar. As\u00ed conoceremos los nombres de los protagonistas de esa historia, el lugar donde pas\u00f3, y la \u00e9poca y las circunstancias en las que ocurri\u00f3 todo. Pero no solo eso. El propio Almsten se convertir\u00e1, a trav\u00e9s de su diario, en un personaje del juego, ya que en dicho diario, se nos dar\u00e1n las pistas para abrir la Caja. Os acord\u00e1is de la Caja que os mencione al principio? Pues como ya dije, es la clave para ver, gracias a Almsten y su diario, el verdadero final de Year Walk.\n\n\n[b]Apartado T\u00e9cnico[/b]\n\nSi en algo destaca Year Walk, es sin duda en su apartado art\u00edstico. Unas cuantas capturas de pantalla son suficientes para darse cuenta de que los dise\u00f1os del juego tienen una fuerte personalidad y una gran belleza. Si bien los escenarios principales son muy simples, es b\u00e1sicamente un gran bosque nevado, caminar por el mientras escuchamos nuestras pisadas sobre la nieve es una sensaci\u00f3n tremendamente agradable. El resto de localizaciones del mapa no desentonan en absoluto, y nos tienen preparadas algunas sorpresas como el \u00c1rbol Muerto, o la Iglesia, que se desmarcan ligeramente del estilo art\u00edstico general.\n\nA nivel sonoro, Year Walk tambi\u00e9n destaca posit\u00edvamente. Melod\u00edas sencillas y agradables rompen el sonido de nuestros pasos cuando alcanzamos puntos clave para la historia. \n\n\n[b]Edici\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola[/b]\n\nYear Walk esta completamente en ingl\u00e9s. No hay voces, pero sus textos no son sencillos, ya que incluye terminolog\u00eda muy especifica referente a los personajes y los entornos en los que esta ambientado. Aunque el juego es sencillo de superar sin necesidad de leer textos adicionales, si que es necesaria la lectura de la Enciclopedia que incluye el juego, y sobre todo, del diario, si queremos disfrutar de Year Walk al m\u00e1ximo. Si el idioma anglosaj\u00f3n no es vuestro fuerte, quiz\u00e1s os vendr\u00eda bien un diccionario.\n\n\n[b]Conclusi\u00f3n[/b]\n\nNo lo he mencionado hasta ahora, pero Year Walk es un juego corto. Muy corto de hecho. En una primera partida, sin saber muy bien hacia donde ir y teniendo que rompernos la cabeza con alg\u00fan puzle, el juego nos durar\u00e1 un par de horas. Tras ello a\u00fan nos quedar\u00e1 la lectura del diario y la resoluci\u00f3n final, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed es una experiencia breve. Breve, pero muy recomendable. El juego tiene una buena historia, un excelente dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico, una cuidada ambientaci\u00f3n, y una mezcla entre lo supuestamente real y lo jugablemente narrado que nos cautivar\u00e1 y nos har\u00e1 disfrutar del rato que nos dure.\n\n\n[b]Lo mejor:[/b] La ambientaci\u00f3n y el dise\u00f1o.

It captures the folly of man and the horrible thing he does to try and give himself comfort. It captures the evil lurking within us all, and the secrets of life, and lays them down in woven layers to be slowly unravelled, but along with it, your life. This captures the dark nature of pagan rituals and the dire consequences of trifling with spirits.\n\nThe game provides several hours of play, and is deeply captivating for it's subliminal use of imagery to remind the Year Walker what is really happening. All this imagery is deeply rooted in folklore, philosophy, and ancient religions. The soundscape is eerie, and grows more haunting as the Year Walk progresses.

There is a bit of blood, but it serves a greater purpose. And there are a few well-done jumpscares. (I counted three that really made me jump, but I haven't seen the whole game.) The game is based off of old Swedish folklore, so there's a handy encylopedia in game if you have any questions about what you see. (It's better than going in blind!) \n\nThe puzzles are very insightful, and they require some thought. There are hints, so use them if you get stuck. Some of them require unusual means to solve. (One uses \"keys\" and even the game's interface to solve.) I really have to applaud the dev's creative thinking for these puzzles! Oh, and pay attention to your surroundings. Those hold the key to some of the puzzles. Especially in places you don't want to tarry too long.\n\nThe art is amazing, no lie. It's beautifully done, and the monochrome pallete sets you in a very somber mood. (There are splashes of color here and there, though)\n\nThe music is wonderful, and the song they play during the credits especially is both eerie and soothing, which ups the creepy factor by about ten. However, there is a part (In an old tree) where the music gets kind of loud, but don't mute your sound because you need it on to solve that puzzle.)\n\nAnd don't forget there's a new game plus feature! That box you can't open right near your cabin at the beginning of the game? Ignore it. You can only get to it after you've already done one walk.\n\nThis is hands down one of the best indie horror games I've ever played.

It's not really a hidden object game, but more focused on atmosphere and puzzles. The story of Year Walk is that you play as a man named Daniel, who lives deep in the woods. You are about to perform something known as a Year Walk, which is an old Scandinavian legend to starve before the midnight of New Years and wander into the forest and night to seek a glimpse of the future. However, there are trials, and strange beings that are said will try to apprehend you, as the very act of Year Walking breaks the two truths of our world, time and space. As you play you have to overcome these trials, explore the deep and progressively strange and unsettling woods, and over it all maybe piece together why Daniel is so concerned about the future to risk his life.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is great. It's more unsettling, surreal, and strange than scary, but I had a constant uneasy feeling and yet fascination to events as they transpired around me. Everything dips into legends and myths from Swedish and Finnish tales, with a helpful encyclopedia if you're interested in knowing more of the origin of things around you. The whole atmosphere is backed by a fantastic soundtrack that, like the game, is appropriately off-kilter.\n\nYear Walk strikes me as one of those games that sticks with you long after you beat it. The story isn't entirely surprising in how it plays out, but it's executed very well, and the details are a lot stranger and help make the whole situation far stranger than what actually happens. It's sort of like a classic folk-story in that what happens is somewhat predictable if you have any experience with stories of a similar kin, but that's not what makes the story interesting, it's how it's told and how everything comes to that natural conclusion. And Year Walk has a lot of depth, things to look into, and intriguing mysteries that stay in the mind long after you find out what ultimately happens.\n\nGameplay is pretty simplistic. You move left and right along a first-person 2D plane, and occasionally can walk forward or backward to another 2D plane. You interact with objects, and solve puzzles. The game isn't stylized like many other adventure games, with hidden item to find, as what you can and cannot do and interact with is very visible and clear, but some of the puzzles are a bit tricky. My tip is to sometimes think outside of the box. Most of the answers are often more obvious than they may seem at first, none are too challenging, but some aren't pushovers either. I also heavily suggest you keep a notebook and pen handy, it helped me a lot.\n\nIt's a game with great atmosphere, an interesting experience that'll last you about two hours, and for many I'd imagine an interesting introduction to Scandinavian myths and folklore. If you have an interest in atmospheric horror experiences, folk stories, or games with a surrealistic edge, I'd definitely give it a recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1397473065, "timestamp_updated": 1400168922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9812681": {"recommendationid": "9812681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118803054", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397440429}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautifully done from start to finish.

You move around the forest as you go on your 'Year Walk' and slowly piece together the puzzles and obscure story. It won the iOS GOTY award last year from many publications and I can easily see why it deserves the accolades.\n\nYear Walk is heavily based on [strike]Finnish[/strike] Swedish folklore and has an amazing art style. You will run into all kinds of creepy demons throughout your adventure. The game does have a few jump scares, but, overall, is more unsettling than scary.\nI would mention that I found the atmosphere quite breathtaking. The mood is set by the oppressive musical backdrop that never distracts as you crunch your way through the snow of the forest.\n\nThe puzzles are where I really dove into the game. I assembled a full piece of paper covered with drawings, notes, and clues over the course of my travels. There is an in-game map, encyclopedia, and hint system to help you through the game and learn about the Swedish background.\n\nThe game is quite short, your first play through should take you about forty five minutes to an hour and a half depending on how quickly things click for you. Multiple play through are encouraged and, in fact, half of the story and the true ending are hidden away in subsequent play. The method of unlocking that ending and reading through the story is quite the ride.\n\nIt is unfortunate as the game has been looked over on Steam entirely. Possibly due to the stream of trash that has been coming down as part of Valve's policies lately. I hope that it gets some more attention going forward as it is a great title.\n\nhttp://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/595907053911022538/97EE52E11467DB99B64375A0F67863F9FF2CD941/\n\nhttp://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/595907053911021776/E37C57A854D089254D0BBE943EE2493554DA4930/", "timestamp_created": 1397101489, "timestamp_updated": 1397101489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9760120": {"recommendationid": "9760120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130000278", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455329548}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the art and story line.

I certainly will.

The few \"characters\" you encounter are developed well even without word and the game offers an encyclopedia for those who wish to look further into the games scandinavian background. The suspense is built in the most unexpected places making the suprises more suprising and possibly making you look twice when walking alone in the dark.

The replay value for me is high at least for one or two play throughs to see if the story can be altered or things can be done differently.

I played the game initially on the iOS release and found myself still jumping - and at one point quitting the game to take a walk - at some of the better moments.\n\nThe art and sound design are both great, wandering the woods feels appropriately lonely and tense. The adaptations to the iOS controls for PC are fine and even feature some adjustments to some of the puzzles. \n\nHighly, highly recommended. It's not a long game, probably only 90 minutes to 2 hours but the price is right and it's an experience that has stuck with me since I first played it on my phone last year. It's smart, creative horror and it might teach you a thing or two about Scandanavian folklore.", "timestamp_created": 1394292719, "timestamp_updated": 1394292719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499943", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9384300": {"recommendationid": "9384300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125913006", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397917094}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f. \u0417\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0433\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438. \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0435 \"\u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c\". \u041a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e.\n\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439. \n\u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c.", "timestamp_created": 1394283252, "timestamp_updated": 1394283252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9383366": {"recommendationid": "9383366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056492118", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1394236492}, "language": "german", "review": "Spannendes und oft sehr verst\u00f6rendes Horror Adventure, das lange im Ged\u00e4chtnis bleibt.

Year Walk is a fantastic sleeper adventure/puzzle game.  The expressive, rough edged art style and oppressive soundtrack fills your journey with a forboding that you'll find consuming.  I'm no slouch when it comes to the horror genre but I found myself stepping away from the game for a short break at one point simply to rest my jangling nerves.\n\n It begins rather abruptly with little sense of direction but, after the title card, once you've familiarized yourself with the navigation and have begun relating the entries in the in-game encyclopedia to the events around you the game gathers a full head of steam.  Presentation is unique and the control is sometimes unorthodox but becomes intuitive once you determine what the game is asking of you.  This version of the game also includes a map to assist in navigating the compact world and a tiered hint sytem to give you a nudge if you find yourself hopelessly lost without having to resort to FAQs, walkthroughs or spoilers that might lessen the sense of reward when you push yourself through to the next leg of your walk.\n\nAt first, with the main story arc itself taking only about 45 minutes to an hour to complete, the small asking price might still give one pause.  But I assure you that there's more than meets the eye and I've spent a solid two hours with the game at this point and just now feel like I've cracked it.  However, I did notice that I'd not earned a single Steam achievement, and several look to be entertaining enough to extend the game further.\n\nFor horror/suspense fans looking for a mood created with more than simply liberal brushstrokes of gore, Year Walk has it in spades.  Minimal jump scares and beautifully creepy art and audio are the weapons of choice here.  This is a game that screams for you to play it alone in a dark room.\n\nFor amateur slueths who enjoy a good mystery, the game will reward those both receptive and patient.  These are the folks that will squeeze the most bang for their buck out of Year Walk.  \n\nTraditional adventure gamers might be put off by the lack of structured storytelling, extensive inventory puzzles and feature length run time.  However, the quality and originality of what is offered in Year Walk more than makes up for any perceived shortcomings.\n\nMy recommendation:  Buy it to reward invention and originality.

And what would you do if you knew what it held?[/b]\n\nEnter [I]Year Walk[/I]. YW is a short game, but a very haunting experience. It's unique, it thinks outside the box, it's something you ponder over well after the game ends. Let's dive into what people are looking for in a review, shall we?\n\n[u]Story[/u]: Pay attention. That's all I can say without spoiling too much. The post-game content contributes a lot in this aspect!\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]: Original. This game does require you to do thinking, so don't expect to walk in (hah) and romp through all the puzzles- you won't. Puzzles can involve anything: memorization, sound recognition, unexpected controls, you name it. Solutions are never convoluted- you might be surprised!\n\n[u]Graphics[/u]: Beautiful. Simply gorgeous, even when you're looking at a bloodied doll. Love it!\n\n[u]Sound Effects[/u]: Headphones on, volume up; the sound is superbly done. Everything sounds perfect- the snow crunching under your shoes, the creaking wood of a windmill, the water running in the creek. Is that a woman singing in the distance? Is that a baby wailing... wait. Is that the plippity plop of blood I hear as well?\n\n[u]Soundtrack[/u]: The soundtrack is beautiful and immersive. It can range anywhere from \"Wow, I could meditate to this!\" to \"Holy fudge I'm going to die!\" Like I said: headphones on, volume up! Lose yourself in [I]Year Walk[/I].\n\n[u]Replayability/Post-Game Content[/u]: Only finished one walk so far, but definitely looking forward to jumping back in! After you beat the game, you get access to a nice fat journal in which clues are scattered for you to find. The clues unlock the true ending- it's unsettling.\n\n[u]So is it scary?[/u]: To be honest, YW is not necessarily scary, but it's downright creepy. The atmosphere is done very well! There are a few jumpscares, so players with heart conditions beware!\n\n[u]The Bad[/u]: Just a tad too short (~2-3 hours). A wee more content would be nice!\n\n[I]Year Walk[/I] is a solid puzzle/pseudo-horror game. If you could see the future, then you'd know it's in your best interests to buy it!\n\n[b][8/10][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1394245841, "timestamp_updated": 1394249482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524439", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9377415": {"recommendationid": "9377415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005210757", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481837400}, "language": "english", "review": "Atmospheric point n' click game with some really tasteful horror thrown in.

experience with the iOS version of Year Walk; this review is based 100% on the PC version currently available on Steam. Two, I almost exclusively dislike \"puzzle games.\" I find them annoying and tedious. That being said, I found Year Walk to be a mesmerizing and enjoyable little game.\n\nIn terms of its gameplay, Year Walk doesn't break the mold - there's nothing revolutionary to be found here. The puzzles are relatively simple and only required me to doodle a few things down on a scratch pad to help me solve the majority of them. They're not overly difficult. And if you do find yourself stuck, there's a Hint system in-game that's actually useful.\nThe controls for the PC work well overall, and I had no problems or confusion in how to do anything. So, as a port from a touch based device, this aspect is done fine.\n\nSo, then what makes this an excellent game? As I said, the puzzles presented in the game are not challenging. In fact, as I finished this game I came to the realization I had been tricked. This game wasn't about the puzzles at all. It was about the experience; the visuals, the music, the story, and the atmosphere it all creates. The puzzles are just a way to move you along.\nYear Walk is ultimately all about the experience. And it's definitely quite the experience. It's visually striking - the art style is unique and hauntingly beautiful, and the music fits perfectly in with it. Together they enhance a weird, dark, and rather sad story.\n\nIn the end, Year Walk feels fleshed out and solid. It creates a unique atmosphere that's hard to compare and even harder to forget. Despite not liking puzzles games, I really found myself engrossed in the world that Year Walk so successfully creates.\n\n[i] Addendum (3/19/2014) - After playing through the game completely, twice, and also messing around with extras and some achievements, I feel that I have to make note that this is a short game, and more importantly one that lacks replayability. I'd still recommend the game, it's just something to bear in mind when making a purchase.

Year Walk grabs you and drags you down into the dark and curious lore of early Sweden, where mythical creatures roam the night, questionable if they will help or harm on your journey to get a glimpse of the future. This game has a couple screamers, only two I believe, so be warned. A mix of mind grinding puzzles and a lonesome atmosphere make for an excellent envirment to get yourself immersed in. With every solution to a puzzle, you wonder where the game will lead you next, as it doesn't like to 'hold your hand'.\n  \n    Year Walk has two ending, the second requiring lots of attention to detail, as it's that other ending that really pieces together this whole journey and the risks of knowing what is to come before it's happened. The visuals are like art, mostly 2D, but able to blow you away when it switches to 3D. I completed the game, achievements and all, in three hours, so you can easily beat Year Walk in an hour or less, assuming you haven't gotten stuck on a puzzle.

Lo odias o lo amas, as\u00ed de simple. Es una aventura cargada de personalidad cuyos rasgos caracter\u00edsticos la alejan de cierto tipo de publico. Es un viaje a un mundo desconocido; grotesco pero atractivo. Claro que, si estas leyendo este art\u00edculo, asumimos que sientes un gusto especial por lo oscuro \u00bfVerdad? En ese caso, quiz\u00e1s quieras seguir leyendo para descubrir cual es el atractivo que esconde esta peculiar aventura sueca. \n\nSi eres amante del poin&click, Year Walk posiblemente te atrape al instante. Su jugabilidad es bastante tradicionalista, aunque algunos detalles de sus controles, sobre todo en cuanto a desplazamiento del personaje, claramente vienen heredados de su plataforma madre; se sienten poco pr\u00e1cticos. Pero su propuesta jugable si es la t\u00edpica de aventura gr\u00e1fica, basada en la exploraci\u00f3n, la b\u00fasqueda de pistas y la resoluci\u00f3n de puzzles. Y ya que los menciono, estos rompecabezas no son especialmente dif\u00edciles de resolver, pero si nos pondr\u00e1n en aprietos puntuales. Claro que si la cosa se pone jodida, existe un sistema de pistas no tan explicitas que se puede activar desde el men\u00fa. \n\n\u00bfLa historia? Es simple, pero se va revelando a cuenta gotas por lo que logra generar cierta intriga en el jugador. Nos meten en la piel de un personaje extra\u00f1o que, siguiendo una tradici\u00f3n local, se embarcar\u00e1 en un viaje en busca de respuestas. Lo que no sabe es que le esperan multitudes de visiones paranoides y extra\u00f1as criaturas que no har\u00e1n m\u00e1s que alejarlo del camino. Su desarrollo narrativo acompa\u00f1a al gameplay puesto que siempre ser\u00e1 necesario resolver un puzzle para avanzar en la trama. Esto puede resultar algo tedioso en momentos muy puntuales donde el enigma a resolver carece de chispa o emoci\u00f3n; pero Year Walk se las arregla para volver a engatusarnos y as\u00ed terminaremos por continuar con nuestra aventura. \n\nPor otro lado, su apartado gr\u00e1fico destaca much\u00edsimo por su lado art\u00edstico. La paleta de colores elegida se combina perfectamente con la brillante direcci\u00f3n de sonido para crear una atm\u00f3sfera macabra, y por sobre todo, \u00fanica; un ambiente que trasmite una sensaci\u00f3n singular de extra\u00f1eza e inquietud, pero a su vez, de comodidad y encanto. Es dif\u00edcil describir lo que se siente al jugarlo, pero creo que es mas dif\u00edcil lograr que un videojuego 2D sea tan atmosf\u00e9rico como lo es este. Si sumamos su dise\u00f1o de personajes y escenarios, excentricos por donde se los mire, podemos concluir que, para bien o para mal, su apartado visual no dejar\u00e1 indiferente a nadie.\n\nAntes de cerrar, quiero comentar que esta versi\u00f3n para PC cuenta con agregados especiales, entre los que se encuentran nuevos puzzles, el sistema de pistas y un mapa de las localizaciones. Adem\u00e1s, trae consigo la enciclopedia / bestiario, optativa en la versi\u00f3n de iOS, que explica los mitos que originan a las distintas criaturas que nos topamos a lo largo del juego. A\u00fan as\u00ed, la duraci\u00f3n no se ha extendido mucho. Explorar al m\u00e1ximo el juego, con todos sus secretos, no te llevar\u00e1 m\u00e1s de tres horas. \n\nPalabras finales\nSu llegada a PC puede significar tambi\u00e9n el encuentro con un p\u00fablico m\u00e1s apto para valorar este tipo de juego. Todo aquel deseoso de probar una buena experiencia centrada en puzzles, pero que, a su vez, est\u00e9 acostumbrado a lidiar con videojuegos m\u00e1s atrevidos y salidos de la linea, deber\u00e1 darle una oportunidad a Year Walk. Quienes se dejen enamorar, no se olvidar\u00e1n de \u00e9l por un buen tiempo.\n\n\nLo bueno:\n-Su atm\u00f3sfera y todo lo relativo a lo visual\n-El trasfondo hist\u00f3rico y mitol\u00f3gico de su trama es muy atractivo y el juego lo sabe aprovechar\n-Algunos de sus puzzles son muy interesantes y entretenidos pero...\n\n\nLo malo:\n-...otros no tanto\n-Se siente un poco corto\n\n\nNota Final:\n8", "timestamp_created": 1394136231, "timestamp_updated": 1394136231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705536", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9265332": {"recommendationid": "9265332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058093092", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393394204}, "language": "english", "review": "Year Walk is a great atmospheric horror puzzle-adventure game. It is not a very long game, for I finished this in under 2 hours (was expecting 3 hours based on the iOS users comments), but then again I think I missed out on some secrets and feel like there's more to it. (Update: Yes, there indeed is more to it. But I'll just leave it at that!). \n\nThe puzzles here are fine. They're not very difficult, but just requires you to pay attention to the environment. Some of them I sorta \"accidentally\" solved by just clicking here and there, but otherwise the rest of them can be solved by looking at the environments and taking notes (yes, I actually mean taking notes as in using a pen and paper). Fear not as those that I accidentally solved were early into the game....the latter ones are complex enough that they're no fluke. \n\nOne puzzle was particularly not obvious for me because it uses an input method that is not used in the entire game otherwise (don't wanna spoil too much). Should you be stuck, you can use the in-game hint system, which is kinda like a guide but not always 100% direct. Try not to over-use it, which is exactly what I did initially sadly. In hindsight, I regret succumbing so quickly when I got stuck. But at least this ensures you don't find yourself stuck for prolonged periods of time and needing to Google the solutions becomes moot.\n\nThe atmosphere is well done. It is spooky and there are lots of unexpected things you can expect to see. I played the game in two sittings, the first of which was at around 1am. And my, did it raise my goosebumps! There was one particularly unexpected jump scare which made me say to myself \"Ok I'm gonna continue this in the morning in daylight\". Having played the second half in the morning, I feel the game's best played at night (past 12mn). Just so much more atmosphere then that cannot be replicated in daylight. \n\nSound is great as well. Kinda what you expect from top-notch atmospheric indie games. It ranges from calm to downright eerie, and complements the game at every turn respectably.\n\nControls are good too, though I would frankly have loved a keyboard shortcut for the map at least. Lost count of the number of times I needed to use the mouse pointer to get to the map screen. The area covered by the game isn't that big though, and there's a fair amount of backtracking required.  \n\nAll in all, this is a nice little horror-puzzle-adventure game. The sound design that perfectly complements the haunting visuals sets a great atmosphere for the game. Year Walk received many accolades on iOS so it's good to see it make it to Steam. The $6 price seems reasonable for a two to three hour game that does not overstay its welcome.", "timestamp_created": 1393391293, "timestamp_updated": 1393394564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 125, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570984", "comment_count": "16", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39503725": {"recommendationid": "39503725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024311750", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 383, "last_played": 1516428268}, "language": "english", "review": "Year Walk is an unusual game with a dark and mysterious story based on obscure Swedish folklore. I enjoyed reading through the encyclopaedia and learning about these strange traditions, but the story goes beyond this into some deep and mystical areas. The simple gameplay is mainly based on solving puzzles, which are quite difficult but there are hints available. The game does not hold your hand at all other than these hints, however, and it can be hard to figure out what to do next. Generally the puzzles make sense but there were a couple that cost me time due to some very frustrating game design. By this, of course, I mean the decision to use the menu as part of the game. This aside, Year Walk is an interesting and original game at a reasonable price. I think it will leave an impression on you one way or another.", "timestamp_created": 1516520476, "timestamp_updated": 1516521200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1374, "total_negative": 125, "total_reviews": 1499}}

While it may look like a low budget arcade game, it's actually somewhat deep into fighting mechanics of both the past and present (and maybe the future! Jk idk lol)\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nWhen you first start the game, you'll be shown to the menu of course. However, you realise that there isn't any type of tutorial for the game! You also realise that you don't know what the controls are for the game! It's like old times where you had to read the manual to understand the controls. For starters, this may be confusing and/or frustrating as games nowadays include tutorials of some sort. Also you can't bind controls to what keys you wish for, which can also be a pain. The second player controls are even worse (imo), as the binds are in awkward positions. Fortunately, the game can be played with controllers (Xbox's so far, not too sure; dont own a controller) which is presumably (imo) the best experience to play with. \n\nThere are 9 characters, each with their own control schemes for their unique attacks. They're pretty balanced (imo), but there are occasions later on in arcade mode where the A.I will just literally kick your a$$. Not to say that's a bad or a necessary thing to add, however there isn't a difficulty setting nor a training mode, which can turn some people off. The game is in English. But before every fight, there's this weird message thing in Spanish(?). Also the narrator(?) and the fighters all speak Japanese. Furthermore, there's no subtitle option in the game, which can leave newcomers with an \"eh?\" Overall, controls are effy on keyboard (especially for player 2), a minor language barrier despite being in English, and the characters are decent.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nImagine if you had the older Mortal Kombat games and Hong Kong 97 had a child together. This is what it would like. Anyways, the visuals of the game are very reminiscent of the older Mortal Kombat games but at the same time, this looks like it was developed in a low budget (not to say low budget games are terrible tbh). The graphics look arcadey and nostalgic to those who play old arcade fighters. The background stages are just pictures just slapped behind the HUD and characters. It doesn't bother that much but to others, it may or not may be expected for a game that was created from a low budget. Overall, the visuals can be a mixed bag depending on how you look at it.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack+SFX[/h1]\nThe music and SFX is very reminiscent of music from arcade fighting games and some consoles (such as SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive, 32X etc; imo). The hits you do are somewhat satisfying to hear. Other than that, there's much really much to say other than the music is nostalgic to those who play arcade music. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nBrief Karate Foolish is a stupidly, WTF arcade-styled fighting game that surprsingly does a good presentation of fighting game mechanics in general, however the lack of tutorial can turn people off as well as the graphics.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+Hilarious characters\n+Good gameplay mechanics\n+Nice visuals (to some)\n+Nice music\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n-No tutorial\n-Controls are somewhat eh.. for keyboards. (Keyboard controls really suck if you're player 2) \n-Can't rebind controls to different keys.\n-Visuals are eh... (to some)\n-No difficulty setting (which isn't too much of a bother for me)\n-Can't continue after game over in arcade mode (which might piss people off)\n\n[h1]Rating[/h1]\n5.99/10\n\nSigned by\n\ud835\udcd0\ud835\udcc8\ud835\udcbd \ud835\udce5\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcc7\ud835\udcc2\ud835\udcbf\ud835\udcc1\ud835\udcc1\ud835\udcbe\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udcc3\nof the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/HiddenAnimeGroup]\u1d00\u0274\u03b9\u1d0d\u1d07 Steam Community Group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1514721596, "timestamp_updated": 1514721596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38888549": {"recommendationid": "38888549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318906588", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514944764}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Solo e jugado 6 minutos.

Masturbates. But the sad fact is, Masturbation is rampant among today's youth. The first step towards dealing with a problem is to recognize that the problem exists. Here are some of the most common warning signs that your child may be Masturbating.\nDoes your teenager have acne? Masturbation often leads to excessive hormone production, which is the cause of acne. Very few teenagers who don't Masturbate have acne.\nIs your teenager depressed? If a teenager acts sullen, withdrawn or unhappy the most likely cause is Chronic Masturbation.\nDoes your child lock his or her bedroom door? It is not healthy for a teen to want privacy. Chances are he or she is in there Masturbating!\nDoes your child listen to \"Rock And Roll\" music? If a teenager has rebelled against God far enough to listen to the Devil's music, then he or she has almost certainly rebelled enough to try Masturbation.\nAre there semen stains on your son's bed sheets or underwear? There's only one way they could have gotten there! Line up all of your sons at least twice a day for a family Prayer Meeting and Underwear Check!\nDoes your teenager have Liberal political opinions? The weakness of mind brought on by Self-Abuse often leads to left-wing sympathies.\nDoes your child wear fashionable clothing or hairstyles? If your child can't resist the peer pressure to look a certain way, he or she probably can't resist the peer pressure to Masturbate, either.\nDoes your child look guilty or deny Masturbating? Very few teenagers will openly admit to Masturbating!\nHave you caught your child Masturbating? If you walk into your son's bedroom without knocking and he's in there with his pants down holding his erect penis, he's probably Masturbating.\nPreventing and Treating Teen Masturbation\nIf your child Masturbates, there are steps you can take to stop the problem. If your child doesn't Masturbate, there are things you can do to prevent it. 1. Remove your child's bedroom door. Privacy is one of the leading causes of Masturbation. 2. Monitor your family's use of the restroom. Not only will this prevent Masturbation, it will prepare your teens for today's workplace, where corporations are stepping up their surveillance of employees' bathroom usage. 3. Kill your television. There is absolutely nothing of value on television. Everyone should be reading their Bibles or working, not watching filth like Baywatch or Star Trek. 4. Control your child's reading material. Screen everything your child brings into the house. Do not allow anything even remotely stimulating. Get up early in the morning and go through the newspaper cutting out all of the pictures in the Underwear ads. Burn them before your teenager wakes up. 5. Be sensible about the music your child listens to. There is hardly any music in existence that is really suitable, because anything with a \"Rock,\" \"Country\" or \"Gospel\" beat to it (even if it is labeled \"Christian!\") is designed to incite sexual desire and summon demons from the Pit of Hell straight into your nice little Suburban home! (We have documentation on file for those of you who don't believe this.) Practically all music CDs, tapes or MP3 files in your child's possession must be destroyed, especially if they are by pornographic \"Rap\" artists such as Garth Brooks, Britney Spears or 'NSync. If you collaborate with your fellow Church-goers on this, the event can turn into a huge, festive Bonfire and prayer meeting! 6. Use corporal punishment. Spare the rod and spoil the child! Although outlawed by Socialists in many places, a good, sound thrashing has always been the best cure for the unruly child. 7. Buy and use commercially available Anti-Masturbation devices. You can get one for your Boys by clicking here. President Bush has made it one of the goals of his Faith-Based Initiative to fund private Christian companies to develop an effective anti-Masturbation device for Girls. 8. Understand your child's language. There are dozens of slang terms for Masturbation in use by today's teenagers. You should be familiar with them. Click here for a list. There are many other lists available on the Web. Don't use these slang terms around your children! If you must refer to Masturbation, use the term \"Self-Abuse.\" 9. Scientifically test your children for signs of Masturbation. The same Liberal naysayers who insist we can't build a Missile Shield scoffed until they were bleeding when I revealed that Scientists were hard at work on an aerosol spray that would reveal signs of Masturbation in your children, but it's here! CheckMate scientifically detects a protein Enzyme produced by the male Prostate Gland to reveal traces of semen on clothing, sheets, ceilings, keyboards, etc. It apparently won't detect Masturbation in girls (my Scientific consultants assure me that females have no prostate glands, although the Bible suggests otherwise), but will uncover sexual activity in your daughters by detecting traces of semen in Panties, hair, etc. For additional security, you may easily buy a $10.00 microscope from Toys R Us and a $500.00 centrifuge from Fisher Scientific that will enable you (MALE CHRISTIAN PARENTS ONLY!!!!) to examine your sons' urine for signs of the Sin of Onan. The slightest decline in a boy's Urinary Spermatozoa Count should be met with instant and total humiliation (and hospitalization if possible). 10. Make your daughters grow their fingernails as long as possible. Many Christian parents will measure their daughters' fingernails every week and pay them an allowance based on the combined length. The reason for this is that long fingernails interfere not only with female masturbation, but with Lesbian sexual activity. They will also facilitate the \"sniff test\" for those of you who use it to monitor your daughter's sexual activities. 11. Put boxing gloves on your children's hands at bedtime. Boxing gloves are pretty hard to take off without someone's help. If you do this you can sleep soundly, knowing that your children aren't touching themselves in an impure way.", "timestamp_created": 1510713945, "timestamp_updated": 1510713945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520209", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36513591": {"recommendationid": "36513591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297677328", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510673313}, "language": "turkish", "review": "AAA M\u00dcKEMMEL OYNAYIN OYNATTIRIN M\u00dcKEMMEL GRAF\u0130KLER HAR\u0130KA OYMAYANI KESER\u0130M OYNAYIN LAN", "timestamp_created": 1510673452, "timestamp_updated": 1510673452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36504601": {"recommendationid": "36504601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367708878", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510631960}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly good.

The player is met with a catchy song upon starting the game, which really shows the amount of thought and hard work the developers put into every detail of this game. At first, I was distraught when trying to figure out the controls. However, after taking the time to smash my hands on every key on the keyboard to fathom these controls, I am proud to say I have ascended to a god-tier status in raw skill and talent. I can see this game entering the esports scene due to the skill required to play, and becoming a multi-billion dollar franchise in the process. To see if any computer can even begin to display the full potential of the lifelike graphics in this game, I took advantage of IBM's Sequoia supercomputer. When attempting to display the graphics at the highest settings, the computer went up in flames. This game encourages one to express themselves through their extravagent, yet simple attire.

All of the fighters are in their underwear.\nThe game functions better than it actually should.\nThe languages are confusing: Voice lines are in japanese along with most in-game text.\nMenu/post-battle text is in english.\nThe warning before the game begins is in spanish.\n\nPlot: Everyone entered a tournament to obtain the black briefs and rule the world.\nMy favorite character is Nininga Shimaru, who weilds a cooking knife. He's obviously a stab at naruto, always screaming \"no jutsu\" after performing \"special attacks\".\n\nSpeaking of special attacks, the game is making fun of those. One attack translates to \"strike with pan.\" The character pulls out a pan and strikes with pan.\nIt's a very good game.

I am Dead. Fucking. Serious.\n\nAt the risk of lauding faint praise on a game that was clearly made as a joke, Brief Karate Foolish is actually really friggin' fun and quite honestly it's almost TOO good. I'm not going to say this game is a 10/10 job because it isn't. But for a title that clearly was deliberatly trying to be a novelty rather than an actual game, BKF is actually a pretty solid fighter. I've played worse tournament fighters that were actually commercially released and you can get this thing for FREE. The controls are simple and smooth, the characters are balanced, and the gameplay has that \"easy to learn, tough to master\" thing going on that I love so very very much.\n\nThat's not to say it's perfect. Depending on the controller you're using, there might be issues. For example, I played with an X-Box 360 USB controller and kept accidentally hitting L3 (the control stick's built in button) which automatically opens the options menu. And there's no way to configure the controller, so if that irks you, you may be better off mapping out a JoyToKey setup. On top of that, the Arcade mode does have a bit of a sharp difficulty spike midway through, especially against certain characters (I'm looking at you, Stretch). Overall though, for a free fighting game, it's worth a play.\n\nAnd yeah, it's a game about a bunch of nerds fighting each other in their underwear. THAT'S THE JOKE. The developers knew damn well what kind of game they were making and it works as a humorous, if a bit lowbrow parody of other fighting games. If that squicks you out, well, I'm sorry. You're missing out. But if you can look past that or hell, even EMBRACE it, there's a lot of fun to be had.

Really awesome game! Finally going through those queues paid off! Shame the developers don't seem to have enough confidence in this product to actually be selling it. With a bit of viral marketing, this game should be able to enjoy some sales because of today's meme-oriented nerd market.\n\nBeyond that, however,  we truly have a gem in gameplay and design easily compared to and even outshining what a lot of other developers offer. It's a 3 button fighter (which, by the way, automatically detected my gamepad). The cast might seem limited however, they each play very differently with unique specials moves. Those specials can each be activated with the light, medium or heavy attack with varying range, damage, and hitstun (and recovery) thus, making it quite an intellectual exercise. This game is easily as competitive as games like King or Fighters or Tekken. You really have to time some attacks to be able to juggle enemies and specials can be cancelled into supers. Supers can also be interupted with well-placed or timed attacks. I don't know if it was a regular throw or a command throw but, C. Gomodare kept grabbing me out of my supers with his I-don't-know-if-he's-sucking-my-blood-or-my-nipples throw. However, I don't think the characters are actually balanced enough. \n\nAs I progressed in the arcade mode, I thought I encountered the boss but it was just T. Hikari who has a very punishing moveset comprising specials that act as good mid-range zoning moves. Even though I really liked him, I had to drop my husbando Garigari-kun because he seemed to lack some options. And boy, oh boy, S. Tamade seems so much better with his long ranging pokes and his ability to seemingly combo any moves together. My other favourite is Stretch with his very creative design and animations. Also, his squats specials are op af. His thrusting hips seem to hit everywhere! In front of him, behind and even act as good anti-air. I'm also a big fan of his low-hitting push-ups super. I'm not beyond activating it after winning a match on my fallen opponent as a derogatory and savage display of power as it simulates the act of thrusting oneself wildly in an act of dominating coitus.\n\nLike classic fighting games, BKF doesn't include a babby practice mode or dress-down-your-hoe costumes. BKF seemingly goes back in time in fighting game history since it doesn't even provide different colours for the fighters in mirror matches. Those are actually very fun in this game (as your trying to spot which fighter is yours) compared to watching 2 Karins or Rashids fight in SFV. Also, this game takes inspiration from the award-selling souls series since players don't have the ability to pause gameplay nor is it possible to continue after losing a match in the arcade mode (you have to start over).\n\nYou might be resistant to the graphics of the game but all-in-all this is very compelling package with great sound design and music that might stay in your head with its catchiness. I especially like the retro-sounding, smooth but epic character select theme. Also, all the characters seem to have specific post-fight commentary for each other which helps provide context and background for this game's universe and cast's history while deepening their own characterization.\n\nVery recomended plus, it shouldn't affect your sexual orientation (if you care about that (it has already changed (or never was what you thought it were))).\n\nI completely forgot one problem: alt-tab freezes the screen so I have to alt-F4 and always refrain from alt-tabbing which IS an annoyance but, no game is perfect.", "timestamp_created": 1498966270, "timestamp_updated": 1498967174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515409", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33105186": {"recommendationid": "33105186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086328040", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503090213}, "language": "english", "review": "The most enjoyable time ever, i cant describe the beaty of this game the character limit on steam will not allow me to do this.", "timestamp_created": 1498949416, "timestamp_updated": 1498949416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33103639": {"recommendationid": "33103639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056015218", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498986125}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Macska f\u00fcl\u0171 jap\u00e1n f\u00e9rfiak als\u00f3 gaty\u00e1ban borzaszt\u00f3 ir\u00e1ny\u00edt\u00e1ssal kell enn\u00e9l t\u00f6bb? 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1498946533, "timestamp_updated": 1498946533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33103143": {"recommendationid": "33103143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016438265", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 168, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499382141}, "language": "english", "review": "Believe it or not, it's actually a solid fighting game.

The game is a 4  button fighter from what I can gather, with a Light, Medium, Heavy, and dash button.\n\nThe game feels surprisingly good despite how rough most of the art and game appear. It's extremely easy to chain combos into one another (Though don't ask me how grabbing works, I couldn't figure it out). The game has some interesting ways it goes about attacks. Light attacks are near instant, but push enemies and yourself away so they can't be infinitely chained into one another. Medium down attacks are slower and sometimes act as an anti air, but as a result the attack registers as a mid attack rather than a low, and the low heavy typically acts as a launcher and attacks low unlike Medium, but is much slower so it needs to be led with something else.\n\nOverall, the controls are fun, the characters and art are goofy, and the music is actually pretty good in some places. The game instantly knew I had a fight stick, something most other games don't think about, which was good as you can't change control schemes in this.\n\nSome negative things, the AI can be extremely cheesy sometimes, especially the final boss. The enemies can chain you or repeat the same attack over and over again, stun locking you to death. Losing in arcade mode means you go to the menu rather than being able to continue, and the lack of settings for controls makes the game hard to understand at first. Another negative thing is that while playing this, my monitor kept assuming that I was idle rather than in an actual program, so my screen would go black and I'd have to move my mouse to see.\n\nSome bonus things:\nThe addition of the game speed was hilarious and actually changed how you play that game based on the speed. I loved how the joke speed \"Unlimited\" makes the ai so quick that it defeats you in seconds without being able to see it.\n\nSummary: It's a fun game worth a play.", "timestamp_created": 1519641389, "timestamp_updated": 1519641389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40403157": {"recommendationid": "40403157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122232246", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519603888}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0451\u043d!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1519603917, "timestamp_updated": 1519603917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40401137": {"recommendationid": "40401137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076015522", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519766994}, "language": "italian", "review": "Non avrei mai pensato vista la presentazione, ma questo gioco, anche se free, spacca sul serio.", "timestamp_created": 1519596254, "timestamp_updated": 1519596254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40401070": {"recommendationid": "40401070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137852491", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520170541}, "language": "english", "review": "better than DB FighterZ", "timestamp_created": 1519596041, "timestamp_updated": 1519596041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40398205": {"recommendationid": "40398205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140391055", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519664508}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo sensacional!

Most of the confidences were unsought\u2014frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon\u2014for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.

There's no storyline/plot to the game, and there's really no lore to the characters featured in-game. This game is definitely (hopefully) made for jokes and giggles, but for the people that legitimately find this game fun, you're pretty unintelligent. There are definitely greater titles to be played than this garbage.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nOn a more serious note, this game really doesn't have anything to do other than two modes, one being 'Quickplay', essentially, where you fight against a CPU enemy, and the VS mode that probably lets you fight others online. The game was too cringe-inducing to even bother stepping into another mode. Like mentioned before, this game is just for jokes, and is not meant to be played with a serious face. Unless you're one of those people.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nThe moment you've all been waiting for-- this game looks really bad, whether or not you're playing on a high-end PC, or not. This game also runs on basically any PC out in the world at the moment, unless you're playing games on a dinosaur, which, is one of the worst things to do in 2018. The graphics of this game can easily be compared to those of let's say Mortal Kombat. In the 90's. But worse. Way worse. \n\n[h1] Replayability [/h1]\n\nThe game is definitely not replayable. In reality, once you step foot in this particular game once, you don't really go back into it. It's one of those games that's meant to be played if you're in need of a good laugh or two, that's basically about it. If you're looking for more replayability, I'd suggest finding a much-better online fighting game, or any genre of game for that matter.\n\n[h1] Should you play? [/h1]\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a laugh, then you should definitely play this game. If not, then skip this one if you can help it. There are more games in the database that are better than this hunk of junk.\n\n[b] Overall Score [/b] - [i] 2 / 10 [/i]\n\n[b] Hungry for more reviews?

It is available free, or if, like me, you enjoy it, you can buy the 'Collector's Edition', a DLC which gives you the soundtrack, art book and deleted scenes along with the ability to keep the game in your library for \u00a30.79!\n\nIt has a minimal, black and white, hand-drawn art style, which suits the concept well and proved to be quite striking. The UI, in general, was quite basic, but more than sufficient. The in-game text was also less visually appealing and was difficult to read at times, especially being white with a black outline on a white background! The soundtrack is quite pretty, sticking to the minimalist feel, but with distinct tracks for different areas.\n\n I imagine there were many time and/or budget constraints, among others, and the developers have worked well with these limitations, even using them to an advantage, creating a game that is consistent in both concept and tone.\n\nAs the protagonist, you find yourself in an unknown place which you traverse in an attempt to find reason and purpose and eventually escape. You'll need to complete the small (and simple) puzzles that are dotted between vaguely philosophical musings questioning fate, autonomy, meaning and existence in general. \n\nI completed Sisyphus Reborn, with all achievements in just under 1 hour, including time spent making a cup of coffee. Overall, I enjoyed the game and would recommend it to anyone wanting a short, contemplative experience.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this and would like to see my game reviews (and a bunch of other ramblings) in their natural habitat please visit my [url=www.rachaelbreartonwrites.com]blog[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1511169453, "timestamp_updated": 1511251529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36625690": {"recommendationid": "36625690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202911714", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511104536}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0442\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432.", "timestamp_created": 1511104639, "timestamp_updated": 1511104639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36542145": {"recommendationid": "36542145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054047636", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510793800}, "language": "english", "review": "A short and simple philosophical game.

For a fair review, I'll start with the few things that charmed me as both a philosophy and a horror nerd: \n\n[list]\n[*] The Score - Outstanding job Edwin Montgomery. If it wasn't the texture of your sound when the protagonist fumbled to pick up a rock, or the crunch that followed a broken tree branch, it was the beautifully haunting melody that crept behind me the whole game. \n\n[*] The Art Style - Really creative and hand drawn animations. I enjoyed the sketch style it had to them, and it gave the title a good degree of authenticity and originality to go along with it.\n\n[*] The Atmosphere - Actually a combination of both the score, and the art style: [b]Sisyphus Reborn[/b] is big on atmosphere. The setting, among everything else, really encapsulates the absurd, lonely and hopeless theme of it all.\n\n[*] Game mechanics - simple, easy and straightforward point-and-click mechanics. Left-click to examine, Right-click to interact/move.\n\n[*] The fact that it's a reference to Albert Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus, with [spoiler]Sisyphus being the \"One that was there before the others[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\nRegardless, I have to say I found the writing to choppy, pretentious and contradictory to its own purpose. It starts of well -- with the protagonist being quite literally a deductive soul, analyzing their environment, and logically applying one observation to another to progress through the level. However, as soon as they get out of [b]The Cave[/b], that's where it noticeably begins to drop in quality. The protagonist escapes the cave, and with them comes an unsatiated thirst for answers. You leave The Cave and enter [b]The Desert[/b], a dry, lifeless place with a few [b]Diggers[/b], going about their business. You interrupt the first [b]Digger[/b] you meet in what is most likely the hottest day of all the year, and bombard them with all these hard-hitting philosophical queries. In return, the Digger, answers in purposefully vague and unhelpfull answers that force you to dispatch them and forge onward. You approach the second Digger, or maybe the third, and you initiate a conversation by claiming: \"You wouldn't happen to tell me something of actual value, as oppossed to those dimwits before us, right?\" Or, you know, something to that effect. That Digger, probably annoyed at your egregious display of arrogance, answers: \"Fuck off mate, I can't help you.\" Or, you know, something to that effect.\n\nAnd now, listen, before you other philosophy nerds out there smash their keyboards typing up a reply to my last paragraph, let me save you the time and say: [b]I know[/b]. I know one of the fundamental tenets from Albert Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus, layed out in Chapter 1, is that the answer to \"Does the realization of the meaninglessness and absurdity of life necessarily require suicide?\" is [b]NO![/b], and instead one should [b]revolt![/b]. But that does not award you a get-out-of-being a pretentious, judgemental, and just overall jerk. These other souls made their choice, and that was [b]to dig[/b]. Why are you judging them? Why are you judging the souls that chose [b]not to dig[/b]? Why are you harassing them while their literally fulfilling their purpose of existence? Not to mention digging is hard work. \n\nAnyways, at some point one Digger tells you to go to [b]The Pyramid[/b] and ask it questions. So you go, ring some bells (OK so they also sound beautiful because this game has an incredible sound designer, whatever), and you meet \"The One who was there before The Others\". This is essentially Sisyphus -- an arrogant and deceitfull soul that is forced to watch every civilization they create crumble before it rebirths, and crumbles again and so forth. He tells you, the reason those \"digging plebs\" before you were of no help was because they were stupid, and instead [b]you[/b] are the smart one that we've all been waiting for. The One who was there before the Others continues to say that you must choose either to dig or not to dig, then you both go judge those who chose not to dig, or \"not to be\". Then you build a shovel, and through sheer rugged individualism dig all your way to China, where you fall and combine with water and \"earth\" to become a tree. A pretentious and judgemental tree. Smh.\n\n[h1]If you enjoy the way I review games, consider joining and following my curator group! It comes with a fun discord channel for horror fans to chill and game.

In more \"recent\" years, Albert Camus wrote The Myth of Sisyphus exploring the notion of the absurdity of life and living; to actively maintain participation in an act known to be futile given its lack of ultimate consequence, but to contently \"revolt\" by continuing to do so whilst also wilfully rejecting concepts of hope or faith. This game touches upon many of those same themes.\n\nIn this particular allegory, our Sisyphus is a stranger who awakens without any memories in a bizarre, unfamiliar land, inhabited by people who perform actions without any justifiable reason, or even clearly defined knowledge for why they really do so. What follows is a character's journey to try and understand what's going on around him, and also find his own justifications for his own actions. In case it wasn't already abundantly clear... this is a very intellectually deep, contemplative game.\n\nGameplay-wise, this all takes the form of a very basic, 2D, point-and-click, side-scrolling game using simplistic art and minimal animation.

He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.\u201d \u2015 Albert Camus, [i]The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays[/i][/b]\n\n[i]Sisyphus Reborn[/i] is a short, absurd reference to the work of author/philosopher Albert Camus - [i]The Myth of Sisyphus[/i] -  rather than being a game. Being the sole project of Myshkin Entertaintment so far, it is a journey worthy of taking note if you do enjoy philosophical displays even the slightest. I, as a long standing lover of philosophy, especially existentialism, must say that this short little adventure manages to grasp the full content of Camus' work, and even challenges his theme of hope/hopelessness.\n\nWell, to be able to understand the proper theme of the game, one has to be familiar with the story of Sisyphus first. According to the Greek myth, Sisyphus was the cunning and deceitful King of Corinth who managed to trick Thanatos - the Death itself - and chain him so no one in the world would die for some time, causing the old and the sick to suffer. As punishment, he was doomed to roll a huge boulder up a steep hill, yet every time that he would be about to accomplish the task, the boulder would roll down and he'd have to start all over again. He is the embodiment of a meaningless labor, doomed to take place for eternity without any conclusion.\n\nIn his essay, Camus describes the existence of man a paradox in this world. The world being devoid of any meaning - scientific or religious - mankind's constant pursuit for meaning would be equally devoid of meaning, even absurd. So, with the realization of this absurdity, would suicide be the only way out? Such is the philosophical issue that Camus thoroughly discusses in his work. According to Camus' conclusion though, the realization of the absurd asks for revolt. Yet, it is not the kind of revolt one would think of. One has to acknowledge the existence of the absurdity, yet keep challenging it by contended acceptance, thus the work itself becomes our own meaning. Such acceptance of futility would be the only freedom the absurd man can hope for.\n\nGrim, huh? It surely is, considering existentialism and absurdity are philosophies born just after the WWII. Let's take a look back at the game though. This short little adventure world portraits the vision of Camus explicitly, yet bears a completely different approach for its conclusion - a bit close to Sartre rather than Camus. The futility dominates all conditions within, yet bearing the minimum of choices, if one manages to choose even a slightly different path dominated by his own rule... - you have to dig, yet no one describes where to dig - there is still hope. The work itself, the experience it presents us becomes our hope and our choice, breaking the seemingly omnipotent paradox.\n\nIt would take 15 minutes or so for you to experience all this short little display can present you, and excluding its additional content - it is free. If you enjoy the experience though, I strongly recommend purchasing additional content, even to only support the developer. It is simplicity done right with a great atmosphere and fitting narrative. It is a bold little experience, created by an educated mind. I think we need more of its examples here around. Its sole existence, being wholly symbolic, provokes you to think.

Waking up in a world where everyone merely digs forever, and no one dies, how do you find meaning in a meaningless world?\n\nIt took me a long time to figure out how to review this game. It gave me a lot to think about, and it made me question a lot of things in my life. For such a short game, it really left me stunned when the credits rolled. At first, I really didn\u2019t think it could ever have such a massive effect on my life, but it really left me floored.\n\nThis is incredibly simple, first and foremost. The artwork isn\u2019t amazing, but the audio tracks are absolutely stunning, and really help create the atmosphere around you as you play through the game. With a few light puzzles that aren\u2019t that hard to crack (and there\u2019s a walk through, if they do seem to be too hard), this is a pretty easy to complete game.\n\nEnjoyable and short, with some achievements that are easy to collect, Sisyphus Reborn is a game I would personally say everyone should play and experience.

Sisyphus Reborn manages to use this core nature to walk players through a complicated thought process. This may sound like a description of edutainment titles in general, but where this game succeeds and so many others fail is in its subtly. I wasn't aware I was learning until I read about Camus' Myth of Sisyphus in the discussion boards after playing. What motivated me to continue wasn't the need to complete an assignment but the need to discover more about the world constructed around his essay.\n\nThe landscapes themselves are left uncluttered, almost blank. Instead of flashy colors or movements, Sisyphus Reborn maintains visual interest with small tricks like distorting lines to mimic heat's effect on the horizon and stick figures that skip animated legs for wraith-like tails. Along with a soundtrack that focuses on note repetition and hints of religious music, the aesthetic builds a climate of sullen dread, one that implies you might be trapped in a sort of purgatory. It was that sense of disquiet that brought me back to learn more in a second playthrough.\n\nThe only complaint I'll level against Sisyphus Reborn is that your choices are laid out a little too neatly, as games are wont to do. There does seem to be a single correct choice in the end. All other alternatives are beset by hints towards that 'correct answer' and prompts to quit.

Is there truly only working, being nothing, and being alone? Are these choices made before we're ever aware of them, and if they are, does it matter? Does [i] anything [/i] matter?\n\nNow to the the game itself: the art is what you see in the images, and the soundtrack is good. The writing is impactful, but short and direct. The controls are very simple but work for what's needed. I personally didn't have that life changing moment that some people did, but I did enjoy playing through it in half an hour, and I could see playing through it again every once in a while as a reminder to myself.\n\nOverall - if you like short games that have a different pace and make you think a little bit, I fully recommend this game.

[/h1]\n\nSisyphus Reborn ist ein kurzes 2D Point&Click Adventure, welches einfach super gestaltet wurde. Die R\u00e4tsel sind sehr einfach und das Hauptmerkmal liegt eindeutig auf der Geschichte. \n\n[b]Story[/b]\nWir wachen in einer kleinen H\u00f6hle auf und finden uns kurz darauf in der W\u00fcste wieder. Wir wissen nicht wieso, aber unsere M\u00f6glichkeiten sind sehr begrenzt und entweder wir entscheiden uns, unser Leben sinnlos zu verbringen oder einfach aufzugeben. Aber Gott sei Dank haben wir als Spieler unser Schicksal selber in der Hand, sodass es auch zu einem guten Ende kommen kann. (Es gibt 4 Enden insgesamt.) \nSisyphus ist dabei sehr philosophisch (Den Namen hat ja schon wer anders hier super erkl\u00e4rt) und Mottos die mir nach dem Spielen eingefallen sind, sind Dinge wie \"Nicht aufgeben!\" oder auch \"Jeder ist seines eigenen Gl\u00fcckes Schmied\".\n\n[b]Grafik/Sound[/b]\nDas Spiel wirkt so, als ob nur jemand der etwas besser als ich zeichnen kann das Spiel gemacht hat. Allerdings finde ich , und wohl auch der Autor, diesen Grafikstil als sehr angemessen, da sich das Spiel aufs Wesentliche konzentriert. Zudem wirkt das gute Ende so nochmal wesentlich optimistischer *zwinker*.\nDie Musik ist einfach Top. Tiefgehendes Klavierspiel mit leichten Einsatz von Schlaginstrumenten, was von mir als sehr beruhigend und nicht st\u00f6rend empfunden wurde.\n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\nSisyphus Reborn bietet eine wirklich sch\u00f6ne Kurzgeschichte, hinter der sich eine noch viel sch\u00f6nere Philosophie bzw. Lebenseinstellung versteckt. Das Spiel ist recht kurz, daf\u00fcr aber gut und kostenlos. Meiner Meinung nach eines der besseren tiefgehenden Spiele, die ich mal gespielt habe.

Situados en un desierto infinito, ellos por siempre cavan grandes hoyos en la arena\u2026 con el \u00fanico fin de volver a llenarlos.\n\n[h1]S\u00edsifo y Camus[/h1]\n[i]\u201cCuenta el mito, que un d\u00eda S\u00edsifo divis\u00f3 como Zeus secuestraba a una mujer. Al delatar al Dios del trueno, este mand\u00f3 a su hermano Hades a que se llevase al mortal al mundo de los muertos. El mortal enga\u00f1o a su perseguidor haciendo uso de su gran intelecto, y continu\u00f3 enga\u00f1ando a todo aqu\u00e9l que intentara llev\u00e1rselo. Finalmente, Hermes  lo acab\u00f3 trasladando a rastras al m\u00e1s all\u00e1, en donde se le conden\u00f3 a S\u00edsifo a subir una roca a lo alto de una monta\u00f1a de inconmensurable altura. Llegado a un punto, el ascenso se volv\u00eda vertical, y la roca ca\u00eda de manera irremediable, por lo que el hombre deb\u00eda volver a subirla, y as\u00ed, por toda la eternidad, dando paso a un trabajo in\u00fatil y sin esperanza\u201d.[/i]\n\n[i]Sisyphus Reborn[/i] se basa en el aclamado libro de Albert Camus, \u201cEl mito de S\u00edsifo\u201d. Este fil\u00f3sofo, en su ensayo publicado en 1942, usa a S\u00edsifo como met\u00e1fora para tratar el valor de la vida seg\u00fan lo que se haga con ella, lo que le lleva a deliberarse sobre la validez del suicidio ante una existencia que pierde su sentido. Camus ve\u00eda a S\u00edsifo como una parodia de la vida moderna; la tarea de subir aquella roca en representaci\u00f3n del obrero que trabaja durante toda su vida, y la ca\u00edda de la roca como un momento de libertad, liberaci\u00f3n del obrero en su receso de trabajo antes de volver a empezar otra vez. Dicha comparaci\u00f3n dio paso a una nueva filosof\u00eda.\n\n[h1]Filosof\u00eda del absurdo[/h1]\nEl absurdismo \u2013no confundir con nihilismo \u2013, mejor conocido como filosof\u00eda del absurdo, naci\u00f3 con la obra de Camus anteriormente mencionada. La misma establece el absurdo de la b\u00fasqueda del ser humano en pos de hallar un significado a su propia existencia, y como esto, irremediablemente conlleva al fracaso debido a la inexistencia de dicho significado. Seg\u00fan el mismo escritor, la vida es insignificante y no posee m\u00e1s prop\u00f3sito que aqu\u00e9l impuesto por cada uno; aun as\u00ed, el humano continuar\u00e1 haciendo uso de su conocimiento para buscar respuestas, incluso aunque deba inventarlas y transmitirlas a sus cong\u00e9neres.\n\nS\u00edsifo es feliz, dice Camus. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Su condena es eterna y su castigo despiadado, su vida fue despojada de todo fin, \u00bfqu\u00e9 le puede generar sensaci\u00f3n de j\u00fabilo? Pues este hombre, contin\u00faa Camus, tiene ahora un prop\u00f3sito, un fin que a pesar de no poder verlo debido a la magnitud de la tragedia en la que se encuentra, podr\u00e1 ver claramente en sus momentos de lucidez. S\u00edsifo empuja cual hombre absurdo, rendido ante la voluntad de dioses, quienes han concedido su capricho de escapar a la muerte, otorg\u00e1ndole una vida eterna y un designio a cumplir. Pero al momento de caer su carga al punto de partida, el hombre es liberado de la tarea, y aunque sea solo un instante, experimenta dicha. Siendo feliz mientras no est\u00e9 empujando la roca, puede crear un significado artificial a su castigo: pues \u00e9l empuja la roca para ser dichoso cuando no la empuje, y eso le permite continuar subi\u00e9ndola, ya que esa roca es lo que le da sentido a su existencia. S\u00edsifo acaba cayendo en el absurdo, aceptando que la vida es un conjunto de repeticiones carentes de sentido que se llevan a cabo m\u00e1s por una cuesti\u00f3n de costumbre tradici\u00f3n o inercia que por coherencia y l\u00f3gica.\n\n[i]Sisyphus Reborn[/i] retrata todo aquello presentando un mundo cuyos habitantes cayeron en el absurdo, todos acaban siendo como S\u00edsifo, cargando su propia roca personal. Ellos, pala en mano, por siempre cavan grandes hoyos en la arena\u2026 con el fin de llenarlos. Todos se crean el mismo designio artificial que justifique y valide su existencia por miedo a perder su sentido de la vida. \n\nQueda en manos del jugador, ser quien gu\u00ede al protagonista en pos de hallar finalmente un prop\u00f3sito verdadero, o rendirse y cavar por toda la eternidad. [spoiler]La pir\u00e1mide situada en mitad del desierto participar\u00e1 en representaci\u00f3n del absurdo, en dejarse encadenar a \u00e9l y no hallar, sino crear, aquella felicidad que S\u00edsifo experimentaba; algo artificial con la que uno justifica su propio absurdo. Y aqu\u00e9l desierto act\u00faa como met\u00e1fora de la vida misma, imposibilitando el escape hacia otro lugar, pues m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de donde alcanza la vista, solo hay m\u00e1s arena. Ser\u00e1 entonces que se presentan al jugador dos opciones: vivir en acciones vanas o suicidarse (acci\u00f3n que es retratada mediante la inacci\u00f3n eterna, resultando en una existencia en estado vegetativo hasta el punto de no retorno).

This \"game\" is, above all, a philosophical reading, you basically need to follow the only way of doing the things.\n\nInspired by the Albert Camus' essay in which he introduces his philosophy of the absurd: that of the man in search of meaning, unity and clarity in the face of an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternity. Does the realization of the absurd demand suicide? Camus replies: \"No. It demands revolt.\" He then describes various approaches to the absurd in life. The last chapter compares the absurdity of man's life with the situation of Sisyphus, a personage of Greek mythology, condemned to always repeat the same task of pushing a rock to the top of a mountain, and every time he was almost at the top, the stone rolled down the mountain again to the point of departure by an irresistible force, completely invalidating the hard effort expended. You can and, sometimes, you have to do your own way, and even your closer beloved ones will be against you, because people are doctrinated to live an absurd life with no purpose other than gather properties. I call it contemporary (and cheap) slavery, the utilitarian and materialist world we live to serve purposes and reach goals that are not the ours.\n\nI recommend the game for people who, like me, are not always in search of a game that fits the most common patterns (or that have the main) purpose of entertaining, Sisyphus Reborn is a good opportunity to reflect and entertain yourself with the very consciousness.", "timestamp_created": 1482496417, "timestamp_updated": 1482496417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652003", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28550165": {"recommendationid": "28550165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275532481", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482473024}, "language": "english", "review": "There are so many choices in life, yet many of them are not unique.

No pretention waffle here (or at least IMHO) If it turns out you don't like it then you won't have lost any money as it's free, and it's short (depending on how you take it in, but not short in a stingey way) so it's not as though you'd lose much time on it.\n     But if you like/love it... well, buckle up! ;)  I love and have played many of its genre over the years, and you know how you sometimes find one that makes you go 'OH, now THAT is going up there in my 'Unrankables of that Type, They're Just Fuckin' UP THERE, Man'?

After that, when he talks to the guy in the pyramid, the guy could give him a 'bag' and now our hero can carry 3 items.

As a punishment for his deceitful ways, in the afterlife he was forced to hoist a massive boulder up a hill, only to watch it come back down; Sisyphus was damned to repeat these actions for all eternity. Sisyphus Reborn takes on a similar concept, although instead of a boulder the punishment is digging holes and refilling them for eternity.\n\nThere are multiple ways that this game can be interpreted. The first, and most obvious, being that the little ghostly fellow that you play as is dead, and is condemned to an afterlife of monotony. The second, which was my interpretation, is that the game is about life, and how a lot of nihilistic people see it; mostly meaningless and devoid of any sort of grand purpose. Why are you digging? To live. Why do you live? To dig. Digging is work, and we must work to live, and we live to work, giving most of our adult life is spent at our jobs.\n\nDespite whatever that you may take away from Sisyphus Reborn, the title is excellent for a free game; despite its very simple nature. There are a few puzzles, all relatively simple. All of the graphics are hand drawn, and appear to be scanned instead of done in Photoshop or any other sort of digital art program. The music is very ambient, and it lends to a ghostly, eerie sort of atmosphere which is very appropriate. The dialogue is thought provoking, and to get the full effect of the game you will really need to do a couple of playthroughs as there are a couple different options to choose from.\n\nThe greatest thing about Sisyphus Reborn, aside from its price, is the opportunity to interpret the game as you wish. It's a very abstract piece, and what I saw in it you may not necessarily see, and what you see in it your friend may see something totally different. It's wonderful how a game so simple can have a different meaning to multiple individuals. Know, however, that there are no in-game settings or save system. However, the game does only take between 15-20 minutes to complete.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]4.0/5.0[/b] - Excellent, highly worth playing.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "timestamp_created": 1475160908, "timestamp_updated": 1515434315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587629", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25764638": {"recommendationid": "25764638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097771735", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473943518}, "language": "english", "review": "makes you think", "timestamp_created": 1475153019, "timestamp_updated": 1515931363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25763388": {"recommendationid": "25763388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064269855", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478338000}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, that was an interesting experience.

It wasn't too challenging with the little puzzles, and I think it could have had more of them. It would have added a nice dimension for me (even though I suck at puzzles). I liked the main character, even if he was grumpy and had a weird name - I think \"Syphus\" sounds better than \"Sisyphus\" but hey, what do I know - and I would have happily chosen to dig with my buddy near the pyramid for all eternity (except curiosity got the better of me). Personally, that's what I'd do. I'd help someone else dig and fill, that would be my eternity. \n\nAll in all, Loved the concept, LOVED the art - side scrolling got to me a bit but otherwise smoothly handled.

Wade through the chest high sea of titles and major trends start to pop out: bad copies of iOS games, badly executed \"free\"-to-play games, and the ever present \"art\" game. With many reviewers adamant that \"this game isn't even a game\" and \"lol French new wave level of pointlessly esoteric dialogue\", one is tempted to relegate Sisyphus Reborn as one of the other walking simulators touted as \"art\" games. That assumption is false. Sisyphus Reborn is an actual art game because it does what vast majority of similar titles fail to do: it makes you think. While a bit on-the-nose at times, make no mistake, Sisyphus Reborn is the most well thought out interactive interpretations of existentialist philosophy there is. Through a barely twenty minute campaign, the game enables the player to experience Albert Camus' concept of the modern Sisyphus, a human who recognizes life's innate meaninglessness, and forges their own path based on their choices in spite of it. I especially reccomend this game due to the way it drastically lowers the barrier to entry of existentialist philosophy. It simplifies Camus' extensive meditations regarding suicide and the true meaning of life (or lack thereof). In the future, I'd like to see this game developer's interpretation of other philosophers (Schopenhauer's perspective on sex, perhaps?).\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\n\nGame is good.

The gameplay is a very simple point and click adventure with simplified puzzles, but those are just the catalyst for a fantastic story. This game would be a more simplified version of say abzu or Journey if i was to make a comparison. It is more about the adventure itself and the meaning of it than anything else.\n\nThe dialogue has its funny moments but once you stop and think about what the words mean than it almost reminds me of my Intro to Philosphy class because you can honestly dig deep in what is being said. \n\n\nPros\n\nFantastic Story\nInteresting hand drawn Art and Music\nMultiple Endings ;-)\nThought Provoking (Hey this is great if a game achieves this!)\nThe Game is FREE there is no reason not to try it!\n\nCons\n\nit is short\nit is mostly reading\nThere is one puzzle that is definately frustrating!\n\n\n\nOverall I TOTALLY recommend that even if you watch my gameplay to try the experience for yourself or even just download it to show the developer support...

Vedo che molte recensioni su questa pagina consigliano di affrontare l'esperienza con occhi \"vergini\" e senza preconcetti, ma mi consento di dissentire. SR \u00e8 un titolo fortemente intellettualistico, di cui si riesce a cogliere la vera natura soltanto avendo perlomeno un'idea vaga della sua fonte ispiratrice, peraltro rivelata nei titoli di coda. SR non \u00e8 altro che una rappresentazione videoludica de Le mythe de Sisyphe. Essai sur l'absurde, opera di Camus del 1942, condita di simboli reinterpretati secondo la sensibilit\u00e0 dello sviluppatore ma comunque sia decisamente fedele al messaggio dell'originale: mi basterebbe rinviarvi alla pagina di Wikipedia dell'opera, che io stesso ho visitato, per avere una panoramica sufficiente al nostro compito di fruitori. Per non essere superfluo, mi limiter\u00f2 qui a fare un minimo di gioco associativo tra quello che ho letto e quello che ho giocato. Sisifo \u00e8 una figura mitologica della tradizione greca, scaltro trickster che in pi\u00f9 occasioni si dimostr\u00f2 capace di strumentalizzare le divinit\u00e0 con cui di volta in volta si trov\u00f2 a che fare. La punizione di Zeus dopo un tentativo di fuga dal Tartaro fu quella di dover spingere un masso verso la cima di un declivio, senza tuttavia mai riuscirci, per il resto dell'eternit\u00e0. Si capisce gi\u00e0 che Sisifo, nel gioco, sono gli abitanti dello spoglio Tartaro tratteggiato a penna, impegnati nell'atelica attivit\u00e0 di scavare e ricoprire le buche fatte. Cosa aggiunge Camus a questo quadro? Per l'autore Sisifo \u00e8 la personificazione dell'\"uomo assurdo\", ovvero la condizione che ontologicamente ci connota come esseri viventi senza alcuna vera motivazione. Tuttavia, per Camus la figura di Sisifo non \u00e8 quella di un uomo intrappolato in una punizione eterna, ma quella di un essere \"da immaginare come felice\", in quanto pienamente consapevole dei suoi limiti concreti, libero dunque dalle preoccupazioni per le cause dell'essere e per il futuro, esempio di \"sopportazione\" dell'esistenza. Qual \u00e8 l'alternativa di Camus a questo modello? Una \u00e8 quella che lo rinnega completamente: \u00e8 la figura del suicida, sulla quale si dovrebbe concentrare tutta la scienza filosofica. Il suicidio \u00e8 lo stato indotto dall'indagine del vuoto esistenziale, e concretizzato dallo spezzarsi delle azioni quotidiane, fino a una soffocazione delle stesse capacit\u00e0 di interazione: sono le figure raggruppate apaticamente in vari punti del deserto. L'altra \u00e8 quella prediletta dall'autore. Non so quanto sia proprio definire quest'ultima un'alternativa: Montgomery stesso lascia la rappresentazione nell'ambiguit\u00e0 inducendo il giocatore al tentativo di fuga tramite lo stesso mezzo usato dai \"Sisifi\" per sopravvivere, ovvero lo scavo. Probabilmente \"variante\" \u00e8 un concetto giusto. Camus sceglie di \"bruciare\" la sua esistenza, in una cosciente rivolta verso la falsa libert\u00e0, con il fuoco dell'assenza di obiettivi, del disinteresse, che si rivelano inaspettatamente l'altra faccia della medaglia della passione e del bene trovato nel Tutto. Camus \u00e8 il giocatore: la via personale di accettazione dell'esistenza \u00e8 s\u00ec solitaria, ma va alle radici della vita (l'acqua che si insinua nei meandri della terra) e conduce infine non tanto a una fuga, ma a una rinascita in un mondo sensoriale, colorato, \"pieno\", in una prospettiva ciclica angosciosa e ottimistica al tempo stesso. Figure non molto chiare (magari soltanto nella mia ignoranza) sono quella dell' \"Esegeta\" dentro la piramide e del tentativo di fuga tramite esplorazione \"superficiale\" del deserto. La prima potrebbe essere Montgomery stesso. Si manifesta come compositore e conoscitore del mondo che presenta al protagonista, e il suo aprire le porte al suo regno soltanto dopo la dimostrazione di una capacit\u00e0 di imitazione potrebbe voler simboleggiare un tentativo di trovare un'affinit\u00e0 con coloro ai quali \u00e8 destinato questo prodotto. Per la seconda, potrebbe essere banalmente un riferimento alla futilit\u00e0 di cercare un punto di riferimento rimanendo al livello \"apparente\" della questione, che risulta cos\u00ec disarmante e vasta da indurre la perdita di sanit\u00e0 mentale. \nIn SR c'\u00e8 molta ambizione, molta pi\u00f9 di quanta un progetto dalla durata di mezz'ora possa probabilmente contenere. Una condensazione cos\u00ec ermetica di un saggio filosofico (anche se l'autore non vorrebbe definirlo cos\u00ec) risulta infatti facilmente oscura o banalizzata dall'assenza di conoscenze pregresse, ma forse fin troppo \"didascalica\" essendone in possesso. Gli elementi di reintrepretazione personale non riescono ad essere abbastanza incisivi da lasciare un'immagine chiara di Montgomery dietro quella di Camus: dello sviluppatore risalta per\u00f2 bene la sensibilit\u00e0 artistica, in un'unione veramente toccante di soluzioni grafiche e sonore. Un'operazione culturale degna di nota dunque, ma che non pu\u00f2 non lasciare in bocca un retrogusto di \"prototipo\": sicuramente SR \u00e8 un degno precedente di chiunque vorr\u00e0 perseguire simili progetti in futuro.", "timestamp_created": 1473192390, "timestamp_updated": 1473192713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.953872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25385300": {"recommendationid": "25385300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030305149", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473173276}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow", "timestamp_created": 1473189456, "timestamp_updated": 1473189456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25384873": {"recommendationid": "25384873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155149073", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473187277}, "language": "english", "review": "You will not regret if u spend about 40 minutes in this game.\nThis game is proof that graphics are not making games better.\nDont play it for achievements, play it for the story.\nTHIS GAME HAVE A SOUL!", "timestamp_created": 1473187657, "timestamp_updated": 1473187657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25384579": {"recommendationid": "25384579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077174031", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473185303}, "language": "english", "review": "A very cerebral experience.

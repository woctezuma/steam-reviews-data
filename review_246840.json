Obviously being as young and as impatient as I was, I never quite made it past dungeon level 10, but upon rediscovering here I've finally beaten the game and can review it.\n\nHonestly...this game was a heck of a lot more fun and content loaded then I remembered. There are so many different weapons, armor, items, classes, spells...tons of combinations to mix and match, with new enemies that seemed to appear just when you'd think you'd seen them all. The best part is that I didn't get that \"Ugh, grindy game\" feel whatsoever while playing it. (Of course, I was playing as a summoner-vampire hero, so I was naturally sweeping with ease for most of the floors). For a game of this time, the graphics are pretty nice, the music definitely fitting and the controls made convenient for quick heals/spellcasts.\n\nDespite all of this...I do have a couple of complaints that take away from the game. The first one being knockback - I love the enchantment mechanic because (obviously) it knocks back the foe you're hitting, sometimes making them miss their attack on you. The problem however is that sometimes the knockback will clip the monsters through the wall, where they can hit you but you can't hit them. It's not too game-breaking considering just moving away from the enemy will let him come out, but it does get annoying when you're trying to save your skin by bashing the toughest monster in the group trying to kill you.\n\nAnother one (and honestly the only one that really bothered me) was the final floor, or the floor in which you face the boss monster you've been destined to since the beginning of the game. Don't get me wrong, I love that the whole thing was made epic with unique boss monsters following said target. But basically, let me re-enact what happened when I (a summoner-vampire) encountered them; *summons dispelled* *you are blinded* *you are slowed* *you are dead*. All of this within a five second period time. Now of course this isn't supposed to be easy, but...considering the fact that I didn't really have any trouble beating any monsters residing in the previous floors, the difficulty ramp is just ridiculous.\n\nMaybe it was just a terrible class choice and I should have been more sided towards magic or raw power, but in the end I couldn't fight this final boss group no matter what. So in the end, I did what 8 year old me did back then; Die over and over, paying EXP and fame to respawn on the same floor until the boss died. And as soon as he did, I was out and with 0 fame and around 50k+ exp lost. Frankly I didn't care for the whole ending whatsoever, as the whole \"retirement / descendant\" thing at the end is a New Game + that hardly changes anything from what I can see. It was an achievement though, so I did it anyways :P\n\nTL;DR - Very fun game, tons of class options for how you want to proceed and an endless amount of items, quests and enemies to find / conquer. While endgame could have been much more fun and fair, this did come out in 2005.

This game litteraly was my childhood, but I could only play the trial version and only while I was at my grandparents house. Now that I am 20, and have my own computer, I have decided to pick up the game for nostalgic reasons. After playing it, I was once again hooked. This is the type of game to get if you are looking for a challenge while also just walking around and cutting someone down or fireballing them to death. Now that I am older and know how to play strategically, I have made myself a Mage that regens more mana than I use. \n\nThe game definitely is geared to make you constantly have trouble clearing a floor, but the harder the enemy, the more xp you get, so it balances itself out. Besides, who would want to play a game that is easy to beat? The game also incorporates a special On-Death question. It gives you the choice to revive on the spot at the cost of XP and Fame (my least favorite option), Revives you at a \"Nearby Level\" for a Cost (It can send you lower in the dungeons), then finally you can choose to drop ALL of your money and be sent 3 levels up in the dungeon (Provides you with a speed run challenge to get your money back), oh and if you aren't fast enough, your money will disappear. Isn't that awesome?\n\nAs for graphics, you shouldn't expect very much. The game was released in 2005 and hasn't had any graphic updates that really CHANGED THINGS. But as for me, I do not care if the graphics aren't that of the newer games coming out these days. You can see what is going on and you dont have any trouble understanding what is what.\n\nStory? There isn't really a story to go by other that: \"After many days of travel, you've reached the forest town of Grove. On the outskirts of town, and once inside the fiery dungeon gates, you'll find fame, adventure and fortune.\" Then the big quest that you have to complete by going very deep into the dungeon to defeat a big boss monster. My game gave me a boss on level 51 of the dungeon.\n\nOverall, I think everyone should play this game, its as fun as the new games but has been around much longer. Its a game that if you haven't played it, then you dont have a childhood. So what are you waiting for? Choose your FATE and get to playing!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1504448428, "timestamp_updated": 1504448428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.789668", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34430595": {"recommendationid": "34430595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143312731", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503558293}, "language": "english", "review": "Just get Fate: Traitor Soul.

A dungeon-crawler RPG where you slay hordes of monsters, help the townsfolk and get items, gold and fame.\n\nPros:\n1. Diablo-like: As my favorite RPGs of all time is Diablo, this game brings a very similar gameplay.\n2.  Dungeon levels: while some seem very short or very long, the layouts, theme and monsters were pretty awesome and never boring(in my opinion)\n3. Items are pretty basic but dual-wielding Wakizashis was super fun\n4. Pet companions: Being able to load up your pet and send it town to sell your abundance of junk items for gold was very resourceful. Not to mention having a 2nd source of damage if you got surrounded\n5. The music in this game was pretty chill and welcoming. Though I would've preferred some rock or some metal \n\n\n\nCons: \n1. While the pet companion was helpful, the lack of selection was pretty sad. Cat or Dog is nice but would've been epic to walk around with a wolf or even a Falcon.\n2. While being to change your pet into whatever monster by fish, I was really sold on the idea. Seemed like a waste of time to just sit at a fishing hole, trying to find those rare fish that give permanent changes or huge stat increases.

Seriously, it took me until floor 8 to realize that I could run away from a strike and have it miss my hitbox.\n\nOVERALL: 82/100, has charm and is endless fun but is relatively simple. Some shortcomings here and there, but most are overshadowed by good excecution by the developers.\n\ndo note that this does hold a nostalgic place in my heart, but not enough to keep me playing if I didn't enjoy it. Even non-fans on RPGs will like it, and 2 hours (steam's max refund playtime) is more than enough to grasp a general feel of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1487134831, "timestamp_updated": 1487134831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580420", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29931477": {"recommendationid": "29931477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104480054", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403234385}, "language": "english", "review": "Childhood version of Diablo I love it to death.", "timestamp_created": 1487118456, "timestamp_updated": 1487118456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29882910": {"recommendationid": "29882910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053048675", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487537650}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game \n", "timestamp_created": 1486933638, "timestamp_updated": 1486933638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29865689": {"recommendationid": "29865689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116866397", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487145676}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty much the inspiration for torchlight.

There are many, many hours of varied gameplay available and the graphics aren't even that bad for today (Just... don't expect much out of it. It's no Diablo III). It plays like a dungeon crawler should - very variably - and is NOT a walk in the park. Overall, here's what I'd say are the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n+Varied monsters\n+Varied weapons\n+Good graphics for the time period\n+Large amount of content\n+Difficulty scales well (Easy is actually easy, while hard is actually very hard)\n+No overpowered items or spells\n+A nice cartoony look\n+Very, very easy to mod with a little knowledge of Javascript and Photoshop or Gimp\n\nCons:\n-Faces look kinda messed up, limited character appearance customization\n-Less than stellar translations (From what I hear... I do not speak French or Spanish fluently enough to try Fate in either)\n-Occasionally annoying sounds (I'm definitely talking about the cat or dog. I'd recommend getting a fish to permanently transform them as quickly as possible)\n-Point and click style can get boring\n-Some... creative names can come up for bosses and for items (Like \"Zulgthar's Holy Bec de Corbin of Spite\" or \"Og the Facesmasher\").\n-Lack of interesting spells (They're the pretty cut and dry \"Fireball\" spells, \"Summon ______\" spells, and \"Raise defense\" spells typical of this genre. The only really interesting ones are the meteor one and the one that turns enemies to your side.)\n-Not for everyone. There are free trials for this game - use them. Decide if you like it or not before buying. It is dated, after all.\n-No online multiplayer of any kind\n-Not many in-game settings options\n-A bit of a confusing fame system. (You get skill points to spend for becoming more famous)\n-Some logical fallacies (Fishing in lava)\n\nOverall, even though numerically there are more negatives, the positives far outweigh the negatives for this game. If you haven't given this classic a try, go ahead and get the demo then buy the full game if you like it. I know I did, and I know that I've sunken hundreds of thousands of hours into this immersive fantasy dungeon-crawler.

It was one of the first, if not the first aRPG I've ever played! I used to love this game... After replaying it, I can tell i'm not impressed, there are many things done wrong, there are many bugs in this version and the translation is utterly terrible!\n\nHere's the list of issues with the game.\n\n\n1. Language locked to your System Language.\n\nSince I don't have Windows 7 Ultimate, it's impossible for me to change my game to english... I'm forced to play in French, which, I dislike to do, first of all. Also if you try to modify the language of the game by playing with files, you will most likely break it at some point and the game will just crash. Then, on top of that, the translation is really rubbish, nothing makes sense!\n\n\n2. The translation to french (and possibly the spanish one too) are bad.\n\nThe names of the monsters or items are hilarious to look at, because they all look like \"Hammer of of fire of the the great Tahl bat\" and the likes...\n\n\n3. The voice acting is poor. (French)\n\nThe english voice acting is fine, but the laughs and the quotes from the narrator in french are really cringe...\n\n\n4. Bugs.\n\nWell, first of all, if you launch the game and click anywhere during it's loading, it crashes your computer! It did that on 3 of my computers, all desktops. Pretty much, the game gets stuck with the in-game cursor + the computer mouse at the same time, everything you click does nothing and CTRL+ALT+DLT doesn't alt-tab you. You have to restart your computer!\n\n\n5. Broken achievement.\n\nYep, the achievements for Large Chests is broken if you're game is not in english. It's impossible to get it, unless you modify game files. Boo!\n\n\n6. Looting issues.\n\nItems names are very hard to click on and they stack on top of each other, You always have your inventory clustered with junk you did not even want to loot because of that.\n\n\n7. Game Balance.\n\nGriffons dies in 2 hit, they're huge! However, rats summoned by a same level Vampire will tank more hits, what?\n\nAlso, Yeti deals insane damage and are relatively tanky. Where some mobs deals less damage and dies in 2-3 hits.\n\nMelee + Shield is somewhat weak. You have to split your skill points in 1 type of weapon (for example swords), points in block and points in critical strike. For example, summoners or rangers, only have to put their points in 1 or 2 of them, so they're alot better in that aspect. And even for stat points! If you're a summoner, all into Vitality (and enough magic to cast your favorite summon), because nothing else is worth it. Ranger and melee though, you need 3 to 4 stats! You hit very rarely with melee or range unless you have lots of Dexterity and Attack(accuracy) on gear. Mages always hit, how fair.\n\nAlso with melee, or range, you're stuck with mostly the same type of damage (slashing, piercing etc), since you have to spec into a certain kind of weapon. So if a monster resists 100% of it, good luck! But if you're a mage, no problem. Summoners have every types of summons and caster mages have Fire, Ice, Poison, Lightning spells with 0 penalty for using every elements, because all you need is \"Attack magic!\".\n\n8. Frame Rate issues.\n\nThe Steam version has horrible frame rate issues! I've played FATE on multiple computers before and it always ran fluently, even on my Pentium III and on my cheap i5. But my gaming PC with an i5 that maxes out almost any games, lags as soon as there are 4-5 mobs on the screen... Were talking about 10-15 fps drops. So, scratch playing a summoner if you're unlucky enough to get this Frame Rate bug i'm having. I tried a few fixes, but nothing seemed to help.\n\n\n9. Gambling.\n\nGambling in this game is... Poor. First of all, you get tons of stuff that you cannot even use, because they have very high requirements or requires alot of fame. Then you get bases that are still very weak later in the game. Also, the price sometimes doesn't seem to matter at all. I've bought items at 10,000 gold that were good and were cyan (the best before unique items) and I've bought items at 800,000 gold tags that were pruple (the worst kind of magic items) with an horrible stat (even negative stats!). It's like it's 100% random when you roll your item. You could pay 1 million gold and end up with an item that gives you -19% life and nothing else.\n\nI understand it's gambling, but this looks like a true random item generator.\n\n\nOverall, I like the game, but compared to Torchlight or pretty much any other aRPG, it's just a bit too unbalanced to be enjoyable. It's got broken achievements and bugs too. Looting is wonky and if you're computer is not in english, you just can't set the game to english, if you try to modify files, you will most likely break the game at some point.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE: I've contacted their support and they refuse to fix it, they say it's Steam's fault when it's not.", "timestamp_created": 1477793010, "timestamp_updated": 1480964245, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463500", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26282925": {"recommendationid": "26282925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043285519", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500052022}, "language": "english", "review": "YES get it its fun and relaxing with your own design in class.", "timestamp_created": 1477717954, "timestamp_updated": 1477717954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26180055": {"recommendationid": "26180055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217595649", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519218104}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Good but can this are a multiplayer game.", "timestamp_created": 1477219467, "timestamp_updated": 1477219467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26121080": {"recommendationid": "26121080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084669710", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518062126}, "language": "english", "review": "gr8", "timestamp_created": 1476911366, "timestamp_updated": 1476911366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26106776": {"recommendationid": "26106776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305384291", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492983950}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh my goodness. I can't believe I didn't see this game was on Steam. I LOVED This game as a kid. We got it with a whole lot of demos on a computer we bought a long time ago. The demo only lets you go to the 3rd floor of the Dungeon. Time for some personal backstory:\n\nIt was some time around 2008. I was in Elementary School still. (4th grade I think). I didn't drink enough water on a daily basis, so my bladder got infected. I started to pee blood, so I motioned for my teacher to come out in the hallway while I tell her the embarrasing news. My Mom came and picked me up. We went to my doctor's office (It was sort of like a clinic. It's hard to explain).\n\nThe doctor took me in, and told me I was going to have to get blood drawn which sent me into a panic. I had never had my blood drawn before, and I HATED needles (What kid doesn't?). So, the Doctor came in with this huge needle and stuck it into my arm. It hurt like crap. Afterwards I was really shaken up, and we ususally got toys or video games after we go to the doctors/dentists (I was into Legos at the time, so I got Lego sets for the dentist). That day, we drove to Walmart, and went to the PC games section.\n\nIt felt good to pick up that game, and put it into the cart. My mom even let me get some candy on the way out. (Some sour candy. I LOVE sour candy). Of course, I couldn't play it right as I got home. Mom had to do the checking account. So, my brother and I went outside and we sat down on a matress that was sitting outside. (It was out in my Grandma's backyard. My grandma lives right next to us. I live on a farm, btw.)\n\nI rushed home soon, and heard that sweet sound the bank software makes when you log out; A really crunchy CHA-CHING!!! So, I sat down and put the disk into the computer. Like I said earleir, it was a long time ago and computers were super slow back in the day. So, I had to wait until the game finished installing.\n\nFinally! It finished! Oh, that sweet song that plays at the beginning. Captain O'Kane. That song captures the epicness of this game.\n\nThe game is called Fate, you know that. You're a young adventurer with your Animal Companion (Dog or cat. You can change it later...). You arrive in the town of Grove, where the entrence to a large dungeon stand, beckoning the daring adventurers in.\n\nYou start off basic. You don't have any armor, but you do have a hachet. (Axe). I'm going to do a walkthrough on my YouTube channel, so you can get the jist of the starting.\n\nYou  can fish, too! So I recommend that you buy a fishing rod and fish to your heart's content. You can sell those fish or feed them to your pet. Each fish has different effects. Let's say you feed your pet a fish, and it turns them into a spider!! All the fish you get can turn your animal companion into a Dungeon Creature, but it will stay loyal to you and fight for you.\n\nYou can chose what kind of skill you want to use. Personally I use the sword and shield the most, but I've used magic and bows too.\n\nIt's good because you can use Magic and be a swordsman, or use magic and be an archer.  Magic, magic, magic.\n\nYou can get quests from certain people around town. I strongly suggest you take the quests, because they pay off well.\n\nThe main goal of the game is to find the boss of the Dungeon (It tells you at the beginning. It's always randomized too), and get rich!\n\nI haven't actually gotten that far, but I've been to floor 100 and beyond. Which is almost as good I guess.\n\nI STRONGLY recommend this game. It's a steal for $7.99 . I hope you liked this review of it, and be sure to find my channel on YouTube so you can watch gameplay of it, if you're not sure about it.

Same routine, battle through different floors of this \"mysterious dungeon\" that happens to be the main heart for everything that lives and breathes. Everyone knows about this one dungeon, and everyone depends on it for a living. Everyone lives the dungeon, everyone breathes the dungeon, and your the hero who will fight through all 50 floors and blah blah blah... you get the routine.\n\nHowever, even though it may be mediocre, you can NEVER find a crawler like this these days. It's all about \"Pay 2 Win\" and \"Fighting angry robot sharks with chainsaws for hands\" and \"Swords that are bigger than the protagonist themselves.\" Sadly, FATE may be one of the last of it's kind. For this, I can look over the mediocre-ness, because this is a classic, and I highly recommend it.

Kill this, retrieve item, return to town, repeat. There's no originality here.\n- The skill tree isn't very interesting, and isn't really a tree at all.\n- Dungeons are often needlessly filled with many dead ends, requiring a looottt of time to backtrack overall.\n- It's needlessly difficult to heal at the beginning for some reason; you generate not even one single hit point when out of combat and health potions aren't always easy to come by or buy early on.\n- The voice acting for when traps are sprung, etc. is a bit annoying, as well as low quality.\n- This game requires a lot of grinding to be able to defeat monsters; the yeti on levels 10 and 11 is way overpowered compared to the rest of the monsters leading up to that point, and the ogres starting on level 12 are sudden, too.\n- Magic casting is ridiculously slow at the beginning, almost comically so.\n- Incredibly repetitive content; the quests are for randomly generated items or to kill random beasts, and always just for a formulaic reward in experience, fame, and gold.\n- The sound effects are also very redundant; every single attack by an enemy has only their one designated sound effect, so enemies that attack quickly sound super annoying. The game is also too loud and ear-piercing even on a low sound effects volume.\n- There are many miscellaneous bugs with the game, such as my dog sometimes appearing over gaps where he cannot walk such as ascending and descending stairs, and the hitboxes for picking up items are some of the worst I've ever seen.\n\nBasically, I recommend this game only as a mindless bit of entertainment to play through.

Works dandy on a Windows 8 tablet if nothing newer will and you want a limitless dungeon to plumb for treasure. 4/5", "timestamp_created": 1463784578, "timestamp_updated": 1463784578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23008933": {"recommendationid": "23008933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074250734", "num_games_owned": 486, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464474039}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0442 - \u0438 \u0434\u043e \u0441\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044e \u0441 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435\u043c)\n\u0420\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0447\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0445. \u0416\u0430\u043b\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e, \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0442\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u043c", "timestamp_created": 1463347189, "timestamp_updated": 1463347189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22988388": {"recommendationid": "22988388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079332317", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461776638}, "language": "english", "review": "Me:\nSees FATE on steam\nFigures since I can't find the disc I got for buying it on WildTangent that I could buy it here\nSupport good game devs :)\nFinds out cheats were removed :(\nGame lags a little but is expected even on Win 10\n\n*A few days later\n\nFinds disc copy\nUnistalls steam-bought version and installs the one I bought years ago\nWorks\nGraphics are better\nRuns smoother\nHas cheats\n\n$9.99 on WT or play it occasionally with coins earned from subscribing to WT *not recommended\n\nEven aside from that the game is a good play.

Il m\u00e9riterait facilement une \u00e9valuation positive et 2 ou 3 points de plus si les dev avaient un peu r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi a certaines m\u00e9caniques... des d\u00e9tails parfois, mais ces d\u00e9tails font la diff\u00e9rence\n\n\nPoints neutres\n- jeu pas prise de t\u00eate : un donjon qui se descend \u00e9tage par \u00e9tage, et on ne fait que taper des monstres (le seul truc qui brise la monotonie ce sont les qu\u00eates qui obligent a revenir au village de temps en temps). Pas d'histoire, rien. On tape, on tape, on ramasse des objets, on tape, on meurt.\n- gestion de la mort punitive : mourir coute cher, soit en temps pour remonter dans le donjon, soit en argent, ou exp\u00e9rience... pour moi c'est un bon point (mais ca s'ajoute d'un autre cot\u00e9 aux points n\u00e9gatifs, ci dessous)\n- une gestion du personnage suffisamment customis\u00e9e pour pouvoir avoir plusieurs styles diff\u00e9rents (arme / bouclier, deux mains, magie, mixte...) D'un autre cot\u00e9 le jeu ne proposant qu'un seul personnage et pas de classe diff\u00e9rente c'est un minimum, mais au moins ce minimum est pr\u00e9sent\nSeulement la aussi ce point est en fait negatif car on se rend compte a la fin du jeu que certains styles sont impossibles a jouer (corps a corps notamment on se fait one shot par des monstres surpuissants, alors que la magie est tr\u00e8s puissante)\n\nPoints negatifs\n- ennemis qui fuient. Pour moi la mecanique est bonne et logique, mais elle pose probleme : le jeu ne g\u00e9rant pas les collisions, on ne peut pas courir apr\u00e8s un monstre pour le taper, sans subir des ralentissements du personnage empechant de taper. il faut contourner l'ennemi, utiliser un sort pour courir plus vite, ou la plupart du temps le laisser s'enfuir\nLa m\u00e9canique n'\u00e9tant pas pouss\u00e9e jusqu'au bout, ca ne gene en fait absolument pas de le laisser s'enfuir : il ne regagne pas de point de vie, ne pr\u00e9vient pas d'autres monstres...\nAu final aucun int\u00e9ret a part ennuyer le joueur\n\n- la gestion de l'inventaire a la diablo 2, copi\u00e9e / coll\u00e9e. Ca peut ajouter un \u00e9l\u00e9ment r\u00e9aliste que certains aimeront mais la aussi, au final ca n'a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat a part ennuyer le joueur. Comme dans Torchlight on peut envoyer le pet en ville pour vendre, r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, donc a quoi bon limiter autant l'inventaire ?\n\n- a propos de pet, celui ci est a peu pr\u00e8s inutile. Les miaulement incessants (j'ai choisi un chat...) et les phrases spamm\u00e9es \"votre animal s'enfuit\" \u00e9nervent tr\u00e8s vite. pour une raison inconnue le pet a toujours l'aggro, les monstres le taperont en premier. Il sera donc pratiquement en permanence bas en vie... Pourtant il effectue des dommages cons\u00e9quents mais avec la gestion de l'inventaire et le fait qu'on ne peut le gu\u00e9rir qu'avec des potions, c'est une m\u00e9canique encore ici anti jeu\n\n- la gestion totalement WTF de l'argent en jeu et de la qualit\u00e9 des objets. Le prix de vente / achat des objets est en effet totalement mal (voire pas du tout) g\u00e9r\u00e9 \nA la D2 la encore, vous aurez au niveau 1 chez des marchands du stuff de niveau 50. Si on veut acheter de l'\u00e9quipement il faut relancer plusieurs fois le jeu jusqu'a trouver quelque chose de son niveau / finances\nPire : a propos de finance. En p\u00eachant (accessible pour 200po d\u00e8s le niveau 1) j'ai rapidement eu un baton l\u00e9gendaire vendu 800 000 pi\u00e8ces d'or - on d\u00e9marre avec 500. J'ai loot\u00e9 ce m\u00eame baton, vendu 100 fois le prix des autres \u00e9quipements, deux autres fois : hop, or infini avant le niveau 10, sans raison. Ca gache totalement la raison m\u00eame de ramasser l'\u00e9quipement et de le vendre quand on a sur soi 1000 fois l'or n\u00e9cessaire ? \n\n- gestion des affrontements al\u00e9atoire : souvent on a des monstres pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s un par un, qu'on \u00e9clate facilement, puis on se fait surprendre par 20 truc qui vous sautent dessus et vous tuent\nL'inventaire faisant qu'on ne peut pas vraiment transporter ni g\u00e9rer beaucoup de potions, c'est assez ennuyeux. \nA l'inverse on devient assez vite immortel pour peu qu'on mette la main sur le bon \u00e9quipement ... \n\n- qu\u00eates al\u00e9atoires aussi : en general les qu\u00eates rapportent \u00e9norm\u00e9ment en argent, exp\u00e9rience, r\u00e9putation... ca vaut vraiment le coup de les faire c'est un bon point. Mais contrairement a torchlight, les PNJ donnent des qu\u00eates choisies al\u00e9atoirement dans les prochains niveau du donjon - si vous \u00eates au lv 10 on vous donnera du lv 10, 11 ou 12 ... Or \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ce que rapportent ces qu\u00eates on se retrouve a devoir recharger le jeu jusqu'a avoir les qu\u00eates (3 maximum, c'est trop peu ! ) correspondant au niveau actuel qu'on est en train de faire. Encore une m\u00e9canique \u00e0 la base bonne qui est gach\u00e9e par un \u00e9lement inutile\n\n- pour un des achievement, en jouant en francais, on doit carr\u00e9ment aller modifier des fichiers du jeu : l'achievement est \"en dur\" dans le code et ne tient pas compte de la localisation dans une langue autre que l'anglais ! Ce type de probleme se retrouve dans d'autres choses dans le jeu, par exemple j'ai eu une qu\u00eate gach\u00e9e parceque mon inventaire \u00e9tait plein \nDevoir trouver un objet dans le donjon - le faire ramasser par le pet parceque inventaire plein... Quete non valid\u00e9e. Impossible a revalider, meme en reposant l'objet par terre et en le reprenant. j'ai fini par y arriver en juste la prenant dans le curseur et la reposant dans l'inventaire. Conclusion ? le jeu n'est pas foutu de prendre en compte une validation de base par l'animal au lieu du personnage principal, la plupart des \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont cod\u00e9s en dur, et si on sort un petit peu de ce que le d\u00e9veloppeur a pr\u00e9vu, ca ne fonctionne plus ! \n\n- enchantements, sur le meme principe que torchlight. mais coutant chacun le prix de l'objet, donc inutilisables : pourquoi risquer de supprimer toutes les capacit\u00e9s de son objet, en payant un prix en plus prohibitif, pour gagner un mini bonus au mieux ? \n\n- a la fin du jeu la difficult\u00e9 explose d'un coup sans prevenir comme si le jeu voulait gonfler artificiellement la dur\u00e9e de vie\n\nEnfin techniquement il arrive que le jeu soit une pourriture : j'ai rencontr\u00e9 des cas ou, une qu\u00eate faisant apparaitre un boss et un groupe de monstres tres polygon\u00e9s, le jeu n'arrivait plus a suivre et passait a moins de 10 FPS lorsqu'on rentrait en contact avec ces monstres. S'enfuit mort rapide a laquelle on ne peut rien faire et une qu\u00eate impossible a r\u00e9aliser. \nEn 2016, avec un PC de joueur, le jeu ralenti et bug, qu'est ce que ca devait \u00eatre en 2005 ...\n\n\nJe fais r\u00e9f\u00e9rence a torchlight car il y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de similarit\u00e9s, mais en tout point torchlight est meilleur / mieux \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Alors \u00e9videmment, ce jeu est sorti avant, donc c'est tout a fait normal. En 2005 c'\u00e9tait probablement un super jeu. Mais en 2016 pourquoi se forcer \u00e0 acheter un jeu ancien si beaucoup d'autres, meilleurs, sont disponible ?", "timestamp_created": 1456959674, "timestamp_updated": 1457383169, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21592162": {"recommendationid": "21592162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283489482", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1520738533}, "language": "english", "review": "It's an old fashioned rpg style game, but it's still one of my favorites ^^", "timestamp_created": 1456956910, "timestamp_updated": 1456956910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21379769": {"recommendationid": "21379769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137997644", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508405296}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing game from my childhood.

But if you\u2019re a fan of classic dungeon crawlers or are interested in exploring the history of Diablo-clones, it\u2019s well-worth checking out.  \n\nAmong other things, it used to be a popular Diablo-clone in its day, attracted a dedicated modding community around it for a number of years.  Plus it might especially interest fans of the Torchlight series, because the different developers behind Diablo II and FATE are also the same people who eventually got together to co-found Runic Games and made Torchlight.  \n\nNot only was Torchlight directly influenced by Diablo II in that sense.  But it likewise inherited a lot of features from FATE.  Sure, you could point out that even long before FATE and Torchlight, dungeon crawlers such as Nethack had pets, too.  But FATE was really the first one to introduce pets into the gameplay in a Diablo-type game, and to give them features such as their own inventory interface, so they could carry some of your loot, and at the click of a button be sent to town to cash-it-in for you.  Plus it introduced some other new things to that gameplay too, such as being able to fish for loot at fishing holes scattered throughout the game.  That\u2019s not to mention it also came up with how the user-interfaces look and work for all of those things.  Other than maybe give them a lick of paint and a tweak or two, Torchlight barely changed many of those things at all when it inherited them from FATE.  \n\nFor better or worse, FATE also influenced Torchlight\u2019s toon-like style.  That conspicuously didn\u2019t come from Diablo II.  And it\u2019s a design-choice which might put off some players at first.  But it can also make FATE a perfect game with which to introduce younger players to Diablo-clones if you have kids.  That certainly proved to be the case in my household when my kid was growing up.\n\nDespite how child-friendly and lighthearted FATE might look on its surface, once you get into it, it\u2019s also still quite an expertly made and solid Action-RPG deep-down.  In that respect it\u2019s still a blast to play today, because that well-tuned gameplay it had beneath its surface as a Diablo-clone is still there in an ageless sort of way.   \n\nYou also needn't worry about having to get the whole FATE series.  The sequels mostly just add some additional content and include previous content in them.  Otherwise they essentially play and feel the same.  I happen to prefer the first FATE game a bit for my own nostalgic reasons.  But you\u2019re good to jump into the series wherever you want.\n\nAnyway, the bottom-line is the FATE series might not be for everybody.  But I\u2019d still heartily recommend it to any fans of classic dungeon crawlers and Diablo-clones, young or old. \n\n(Note:  This review also replaces a previous review I did for the FATE series.  It was a mixed review just to alert buyers to an issue it used to have being unable to run under Windows 10 for some users, despite trying many popular workarounds to fix that.  But as near as I can tell, it no longer has that issue.  So that means I can finally give FATE its real due with my new review here.  Not only that, but on Steam it also has more resolution-options now than it used to.  So it\u2019s not only fixed, but it\u2019s also improved.  That\u2019s another real plus.)", "timestamp_created": 1442900202, "timestamp_updated": 1492527584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18138121": {"recommendationid": "18138121", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972483399", "num_games_owned": 674, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 1511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442873395}, "language": "english", "review": "A cute and adequate diablo clone but without the capacity for multiplayer -- which frankly is a standard of games like this ever since... well, Diablo. I got sucked in initially by it's subtle charm and my affinity for the genre, but frankly stayed with it to beat the game on a grudge. The loot system is flawed in that the majority of gear is unusable without certain stat requirements -- for example, to wear plate mail you'd literally have to win the game more than once, perhaps several times. That frankly is ludicrous, considering my character was literally defined as a hero of great reknown who was DRIPPING in strength-giving gear and focused on developing strength... what, is plate mail made of depleted uranium in this world? This is just one example... the vast majority of equipment you find or see in stores is reserved for people who (somehow) have the time and facination to remain on the hamster wheel. I hate-played this game just to see what was waiting for me when I finally beat the creature designated to be the target of my adventure... and it was the \"opportunity\" to start all over from the beginning. Bottom line - if you want to play a game like this play Diablo, or Titan Quest, or Path of Exile (which happens to be FREE!) -- those are ALL better games and finer examples of the genre. Barf. Oh, one last thing -- the difficulty scale on this game is literally offensive... it just multiplies (or divides, it would seem) monster hitpoints, and in the case of \"Hero\" difficulty (which I chose expecting a challenge, not a boring punishment) just makes monsters rapidly scale out of reach of being able to keep up with them. It won't make the monsters more challenging, but it WILL turn the entire game into button mashing the potion key while holding the attack button down. Also, most anti-climactic final battle ever -- it basically filled the screen with summons to the point the player cannot remain engaged to one target for more than an instant, making it literally impossible to swing more than three times at the same creature before dying. Luckily there is a (stupid) mechanic in the game that allows you to respawn exactly where you died at the loss of some xp and (mostly pointless) fame, so to beat the boss, (or anything for that matter) you merely need to swing twice before you die where you stand and keep coming back UNTIL you kill enough of the annoying summoners to face off with the boss, and if needed die numerous times to get him as well.

A bridge between Diablo and Torchlight. Everything we have in the Torchlight we have because of this smooth project... And Fate itself is based mostly on the Diablo Hellfire best patterns.\n\nIf you're familiar with the Torchlight (and I guess you are), then you'll know everything the Fate got from the first sight.\nCartoon-styled graphics. Mild music, yet reminiscent to Matt Uelmen tracks. Very basic RPG elements but rich grinding system, making you constantly looking for more power-ups and new guns, which will be bigger and brighter... And many-many randomly generated levels (over 2 millions, and that's not a joke). Basically, you can keep playing in the Fate year by year and still be far from its depth (that's what Diablo 3 is only dreaming to be).\n\nComparing FATE to all other \"Diablo killers\" and especially Diablo 3 itself may not be the best idea, though. While generally all those games, would that be the Diablo itself, Titan quest, Sacred (etc.) - have some story on the plate, you can't say same thing about FATE. It is so random in every point, that even the main quest is not stable, and will be procedurally generated and different for any player. You'll not get any background there but only the very basic: you have a town with some folks, half of them will be traders or item randomizers, while other half will be sending you on some irrelevant quests. And all the quests in the game will be like \"reach the level X and kill the monster Z\" or \"Bring me an item Y from level X\".\n\nNow, the main question: should you buy it? Yes.\n\nPoint one: it is good for any dungeon crawler fan. Hardly FATE can take your heart now, with all new titles like Van Helsing or Bastion (or dozens of others), but still it provides a very solid gameplay. A lot of challenge awaits!\nPoint two: even if you are not so deep in dungeon crawlers, but making numbers on Steam (would that be score of games in possession or achievement statistics, or both) - it is a good buy (especially with discount, of course).

The bad part about it is that once you've reach a dungeon level you can't get the quest in the dungeon you are in or any dungeon below your current dungeon you've explored, some quest have normal rewards but others have item rewards, but in this case you can manage the quest that you wanted to do even though it is limited.\n\nThe monsters in every level is different and they have different types of attacks, if you're making a summoner build you are going to die... a lot... so its best to cover up your character weaknesses.\n\nOne of the best part in this game is that you are able to turn your pet into a monster( not like slime, goblin or anything that has 2 hands and 2 legs) by feeding him fish, the fish you fed to your pet have a duration of how long your pet can be turned into a monster, you can turn your pet into a monster permanently if you want. And yes you can go fishing in the game in town or in the dungeon if you're lucky you can get rare items just by fishing.\n\nFinally the skills in the game, there is no skill perk trees just old fashion Str, Dex, Vit and Int. But instead of a skill tree you can spend points on Weapon skills, Critical strike, Spell cast time, Attack spell level, Defence spell level and Charm spell level.

This is the precursor to Torchlight and Torchlight II. It's a very simple loot-fest with a never-ending and randomly-generated dungeon. It's an awesome game, it's easy to pick up and put down, doesn't require a lot of commitment or effort and it's very enjoyable. It now even has 1920x1080 resolution, which I'm pretty sure was a thing of the future when it was originally released. Some people are complaining about bugs with the Steam version, I've never had a problem with that one or the WildTangent download. This game is a classic, and it deserves no less than what I'm giving it. Amazingly fun and simple game, and very nostalgic to me and I'm sure a lot of other people that grew up with this game. It has tons of weapons, multiple skills to learn, and a great system to build your character towards a desired style. If you want to be a wizard, upgrade magic and the multiple magic skill perks. If you want to be a warrior, you can upgrade the type of weapon you want to use as well as your strength and dexterity. Tons of different ways to play it that will keep it interesting despite the very simplistic gameplay.\n\nIt has insane replay value as everything is randomized and there are hundreds of different ways to play through it. The main goal of the game is to traverse the dungeon doing tons of quests until you reach a certain level deep down which contains the main boss (it will take a long time to reach this level). Then you kill it and you're then allowed to retire (or continue down the dungeon for eternity if you so wish), which locks your current character, but passes down (and empowers) an heirloom of your choice. For example, if you get the best bow currently in the game, defeat the main boss with it and pass it down as you retire, you will be able to start a new character with this, now even MORE powerful bow. And so on...\n\nNothing not to love about this game, despite it's simplicity and lack of variety when looking at it materialistically, the game is just so damn fun to play I still play it to this day, along with it's other three successors: The Undiscovered Realm, The Traitor Soul, and The Cursed King, which by the way are all just as good!

Sounded awesome.\n\nOf course, much time passed and I ended up playing Torchlight and its sequel before this game.  And on that note, I can go ahead and give you the meat of the review:\n\n[b]Torchlight is, simply put, a better version of this game.[/b]\n\nAnd yes, I know it's by the same guys and came before Torchlight -- but there's really no reason to play this instead; there's absolutely nothing that this game does better, or even as well, and they're quite succinctly the exact same game only with Torchlight being newer and more improved.  It's not like how they're both direct clones of Diablo 1 but that game has a unique atmosphere and gamefeel that makes it still very much worth playing separately; no, these games are *the exact same thing*, except Torchlight is better.\n\nTorchlight has classes; Fate does not.  Fate makes you play a generic character whose un-alterable starting stats are those of a warrior class, even though, for example, playing as a mage is very powerful.  Likewise, Torchlight has an actual skill tree system a la Diablo 2 whereas Fate has a flat page of skills of which no playstyle will ever need to put points into more than 3 or 4 max.\n\nTorchlight has a variety of visually luscious dungeon areas, a unique backdrop to each set of floors, whereas Fate hits you with a generic and unappealing handful of locales randomly chosen floor-by-floor.  Torchlight also offers enemies cohesive to the area at which you fight them to some degree whereas Fate throws a random mishmash of almost every enemy in the game in your direction each floor, with lower floors having you see a bit more larger stuff along with 'elite' and 'legendary' versions of the smaller stuff to make their HP pools monsterous; there is no rhyme or reason.\n\nTorchlight has a massive amount of powerful equipment to find and collect, offering you many build options and ways to increase your power, while Fate quickly makes you realize a simple and painful truth; farm the shops until you have the maximum gem slots possible in every piece of equipment, then farm the mage shop until you have the required amount of superior gems, asap.  There's your endgame equipment; if you're lucky enough to find higher-tier stuff later with the required sockets then good for you, but don't hold your breath.  And this goes for all playstyles.\n\nTorchlight has a defined endgame, final floor and final boss, and then a separate 'infinite' dungeon to test your skills if you want to keep playing.  Fate gives you a randomized boss monster on a random floor and then gives you the option to go deeper in the same dungeon for no real reason.  I will say that the 'descendant' system is interesting, but is it really worth it?  Oh sure, you can become insanely powerful and tear up the dungeons for hundreds of levels if you really want, but you've seen all the game has to offer by floor 20 or so max, and by the time you get to your final boss situated 2 or 3 times deeper than that you'll be well and truly done with the game.  Even the powerful endgame unique equipment that serves as the carrot-on-a-stick for many action-RPG players is a joke, here -- as far as I can tell, you can get *all* uniques even extremely early in the game via fishing holes, and though some seems tantalizing at first you quickly realize their benefits are still not comparable to a socketed, plain version of the same item; and while a socketed unique may be the ideal, good luck with that.  You'll never find them socketed already, and if you dare spend millions of gold at the enchanter in the tiny off-chance you'll get one added (when ideally you'd want 2 or more), you're liable to revert the item to a powerless piece of scrap.\n\nSo all in all?  Yeah, no.  Skip it.  Play Diablo, Diablo 2, Diablo 3 (yes, Diablo 3), Titan Quest, Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, the Van Helsing games, and any other action-RPG before you think about this one.  And especially Torchlight.  Because it's literally the exact same game but better in every conceivable way.\n\nThat being said, I am still going to check out the other Fate games and see if they're... fated... for better reviews.

The graphics are simple, but cute and colorful. The music's cheerful. And the gameplay is a simple concept that really keeps you engaged. In my case, this definitely isn't nostalgia speaking, and I'm not looking at it through the rose-colored lenses of my childhood. I never played it, or any others in the series, until recently. And it's kind of impressive just how well this game has held up over time.\n\nThe game's premise, borrowed liberally from the original Diablo, is a basic dungeon-crawler RPG. Each level of the dungeon is randomly generated and filled with items and monsters. Villagers in town will give you quests tied to specific levels, and you journey in and out of the dungeon as you complete your tasks. You can only take three quests at a time, and it's up to you whether you take the maximum on every level and explore every corridor, or rush through on your way to the final boss. \n\nAs you complete quests and hack and slash your way through the dungeon's monsters, you gain experience, and leveling up allows you to increase your skills and stats in specific areas.  Looting dungeons gives you gold and items, and there are also several vendors in town who can sell you items, or perform various services. You can also earn money (and find rare items) by catching fish in the fishing holes found throughout the game.\n\nGot too much stuff to carry around in the dungeon? No problem. You'll have a pet, an un-killable companion that can also ferry your junk to town in exchange for gold. Your pet can also help fight enemies, but it will flee if its health gets too low and be no use in the fight. If the basic cat or dog isn't powerful enough, you can feed your pet fish in order to transform them into different monsters found in the game. If this sounds an awful lot like Torchlight, it's pretty evident that FATE was a huge influence on that game.\n\nThere is a main story quest that is basically just a harder boss on some random level close to lvl 50. Since the levels are generated randomly, you could just keep playing by continuing down for thousands of levels. Even without the practically unending dungeon, randomly generated levels and a pretty big combination of skills and gear gives FATE almost infinite replayability. This is actually featured in the game well, since finishing the main quest allows you to create a \"descendant\" character. This new character can keep one \"heirloom\" item but begin his or her own adventure. It's especially cool that you can also import characters from FATE into the sequels as well, heirlooms and all.\n\nAs an RPG, FATE is not terribly deep. But it is a lot of fun, and it's a great \u2013 if somewhat casual \u2013 way to blow off steam while crawling through maze-like dungeons and blasting or slashing your way through colorful mobs of creatures.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1432523181, "timestamp_updated": 1432523181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 96, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.877790", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15958072": {"recommendationid": "15958072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077624633", "num_games_owned": 5245, "num_reviews": 186, "playtime_forever": 3016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437449230}, "language": "french", "review": "Une bonne bouille que ce Fate qui propose ce que Diablo proposait en son temps : un village et son donjon.

Then Fate might be for you. I've clocked in over 50 hours on this game this past year and I really had no idea what the end game goal was. I got it into my head at some point that it would all be over at Level 100. There'd be this grand baddie that I'd face off with my minions in an epic battle and I'd prove victorious. When that never happened and I was at Level 103 I became suspicious. Turns out I just had to go to floor 51. I over shot my goal by 52 floors. \n\nThat proves 2 things. One, I clearly wasn't informed of where I had to go and two, the game doesn't do a good job of informing you of your goal except at the very beginning. I would have never guessed that the old wizard at the entrance was who you needed to talk to to get your end goal. Unlike all the other town folk who have a big exclamation mark above their heads when they have quests for you the guy with the end quest was just chilling at the entrance so I never spoke to him every time I went to town. That's just poor informing on the game's part. Not to say that I didn't thoroughly enjoy this game and if I wasn't trying to complete the achievements, one of which I didn't get until I was somewhere around Level 100 I probably wouldn't have played for so long. \n\nThis game is a grind but there's lots of loot and villagers supply you with endless quests for you to keep going and going and going. Weapons and armor are plentiful but I found item enhancements to help more than picking the weapon with the highest attack power. My favorite armor was one with a defense rating of 42 but it had a bunch of buffs that increased my damage by 40% and my dexterity by 70%. It also helped that it absorbed 9% of damage dealt. You'll also find out pretty quick that your starting animal is useless. Find fish to transform it as much as you can until you get one that you can live with. I particularly liked the Ebony Stalker. Summon spells are also your friend. I can't count how many times I was killed in seconds by mobs of enemies. So get yourself a Venomous Wyvern summon and always have 6 around you. They don't do much damage but they sure do come in handy when you want enemies to target something that isn't you.\n\nThis is Duracell bunny of dungeon crawlers.

Torchlight itself is not a perfect game, it does improve upon this one in nearly every aspect.\n\nEven ignoring the fact that a superior version of this game exists, this game is just not that fun.  It's very slow, particularly for an aRPG.  It relies on an old, clunky interface and mechanics (such as limits town portal and identify scrolls, etc.)  Yea, they were staples of the time, but we've moved beyond them.  And this review is taking place now, with the games and mechanics that exist today.\n\nI love old games.  Even ones that didn't age well.

The graphic are great for 2005 and can hold their own in a modern gaming market given recent events. (I am looking at you, AC Unity.)\n\nA very basic gist of the story is this: big bad monster in big bad dungeon. Adventurous hero of unknown origin and unremarkable (non-existant?) achievement must go and slay this baddie as s/he is clearly our last and greatest hope. So off you go with little more than a pointy stick and your trusty pet compainion to try and stomp a monster's teeth in.\n\nEvery floor of the dungeon is random, in the sense that is a series of rooms with sporadic and often unyeildy connecting paths. As a whole, the entire dungeon has a nice and bumpy difficulty curve that, if you are strategic and don't mind some grinding, you can completely kick the piss out of.\n\nI think one of the drawbacks of this game is one key game mechanic in particular. I won't be disclosing which mechanic this is, as once you figure out why it is useful, you are going to abuse this machanic like you just found out the button combination to get free soda in the soda machine at the office. Once that happens, the game loses quite a bit of difficulty. One of many things that really makes up for this is another mechanic, Enchanting, which is really more of a gamble than the actual \"gambling\" mechanic. \n\nAnother thing I really like about this game are the items obtainable and the playstyles available, FATE wholeheartedly supports the idea of having your cake and eating it too, though various stat selections on leveling up, you can do just about anything, or do everything if you really want to. This is great for me, because I am the type of person that if I get a massive 'fuck you' sword, I want a second 'fuck you' sword or a superpowered sheild of 'I don't give a fuck'. And the game lets you do that! And I love that about it.\n\nAll in all, it is a great game if you are looking for something to introduce you to Dungeon Crawling, or if you are looking for something to eat up free time cheaply.", "timestamp_created": 1427240923, "timestamp_updated": 1427240923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538720", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14977845": {"recommendationid": "14977845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066070890", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 3446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466186848}, "language": "english", "review": "Like Skyrim with guns\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1426885364, "timestamp_updated": 1426885364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14965471": {"recommendationid": "14965471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069333447", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517097941}, "language": "english", "review": "You can transform your pet dog into a unicorn by feeding it fish.\nYou can also find weapons 8 times larger than a fish in a fish.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1426803696, "timestamp_updated": 1457152655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14928577": {"recommendationid": "14928577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075104770", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476073861}, "language": "english", "review": "Fucking Awesome\n", "timestamp_created": 1426561228, "timestamp_updated": 1426561228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14787079": {"recommendationid": "14787079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090462379", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430503825}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego lo recomiendo para aquellos que desean perder horas y horas leveando en mazmorras.

It's an RPG that could be considered the father of Torchlight.

It has randomly generated dungeons, which is always nice, and has been produced well.  \n\nThat said, I am finding it a bit boring.  As a fighter specialising in swords, I've found most of the drops to be magic-geared, or aimed at axe-wielders.  I'd say about 95% of the drops are of no interest to me at all, and this tends to make hacking your way through the levels a bit monotonous.\n\nI'm also finding it annoying that it is all too easy to die in the game, especially if you're focusing on what's happening on-screen.  The warning that health is low seems to come too late, so you end up having to divide your attention between the fighting and supervising the health bar.  The pet also seems to spend about 50% of its time fleeing.\n\nMy last moan is that the resolution doesn't seem adjustable, and I'm finding that I'd like to be able to zoom out a little more and with more detail - many of the characters seem rather large and chunky, as though this game was aimed at kids.\n\nAll said though, the game is cheap enough, and I bought my copy during a sale.

I quickly felt a breeze of nostalgia when the game finish installing and loaded up the menu screen.  Almost instantly the rudimentary character creation screen flashed upon the screen and reminded me of all my great characters, which were deleted when Winda died in a horrible HDD failure.  Slowly wiping away a small tear, I chose my pet and my head type.  It took a while to decide which difficulty level to start at.  Eventually, I chose the second hardest, Hero.  Eventually I made my mouse cursor over to the start button and the game loaded in quite well.  After the intro screen which spoke of a horrible monster on level 39.  \"So far so good,\" I thought, \"Better than Winda.\"  Almost instinctively, My pet and I ran over to the dungeon entrance, in which I remembered to speak to the townsfolk for some quests and also to remember to buy a fishing rod eventually.  I finally descended into the dungeon and I was greeted by a familiar voice. After clearing the first floor with my axe, I decided it was time to go shopping.  I had already found a spear and some armor, so the only thing I did was stock up on potions and spell books.

The first causes you to lose experience and they will drop you right back where you died. Unfortunately the enemies are still waiting for you and will proceed to gang up on you and beat you to dust where you will become angry and choose choice number two which takes some exp but spawns you on a nearby level. This nearby level could be either levels up, or down, from where you died. The problem with this is that as you make your way back to where you were, the levels are now loaded with powerful enemies, even if you already cleared them,  who will stomp you into mud in no time flat. You will get VERY ANGRY indeed at this game and I predict, unless you are the unusually stubborn type, that you will just leave and never come back again, OR, you will cheat and ruin the experience.

This game is A classic. Only thing that would make me love this game anymore is if it had multiplayer. The game centers around YOU be you Dicky Gobblkoque or John Doe. And unlike some games, this game only has ONE dungeon. With an infineite amount of levels of which new monsters come and they also increase in levels. These monsters change in variety from a basic slime to yetis. This game, although stable can have bugs every once in a while. One of which i had where my normal cursor stayed on the screen when i started the game. Not allowing me to click any options and FATE took over my computer. Forcing me to cold reboot. But once you are in the actual game, I doubt you will find any glitches. Like i said eariler the monsters level up the deeper into the dungeon you go. So playing on the harder difficulty like I do you can sometimes rush into A level you just can't handle. The spells in this game are extremely varied, sometime even pretty unique. From making monster your friends to attack other enemies, to poisonous clouds that drain the life from your (Not undead) Enemies. There is also a stamina system in the game. Because even heros get tired. This really is only to slow you down. Making it so you can't run forever so thats pretty bad. And one of the best parts... FISHING. Yes, the developers decided fishing would make a great part of their game. Fish can be used to turn your pet into magical ceatures. And fishing can also get some of the rarer items in the game. The quest system is your standard. \"Go kill this for me/get this for me and ill give you gold EXP and sometimes an item\" its not much to talk about but its worth a mention. And mage is the only extremly remarkable class, albiet the hardest one to really lift off on. \n\nSo all in all, fate is a pretty good game. If you like dungeon crawlers then you will love this game without a doubt, if your not a fan of dungeon crawlers i still recommend it.

Lost the CD, found it again on Steam, and had a blast.\nWhat you've got here is a decent Diablo clone with a ridiculous amount of depth. There's lots of customization in the way of attributes, skills, equipment, a pet, and magic, and the game constantly rewards your efforts by allowing you to improve more and more in each of these departments. It can get quite difficult and hectic at times (seriously, why must I fight more than 10 enemies at once), so if you don't like the idea of teleporting back to the town every five minutes, micromanaging your armor based on stat bonuses, or bringing up your inventory a million times in one battle, this probably isn't for you. If you can deal with all that, then get it, install it, and ready yourself for one awesome, yet often overlooked, game.\n\n-----\n\nNow then, be warned, this game has its share of problems. I ran into a few in-game bugs, but none of them really broke the game or made it easier or harder. More important than that, there is a serious issue of some Steam users not being able to run the game, and while WildTangent (the devs) have made an effort to address this problem, there is still a relevant portion of people who have bought the game and just had it sitting in their library since. It isn't always necessarily the same thing giving everyone this problem as well, so what works as a solution for one person may not work for you. I got it working after a few months, but if you want to play it and have any doubts about whether you can run it, you probably want to read the forums and see what people, for their specific cases, have done in the way of trying to fix the problem.", "timestamp_created": 1411455664, "timestamp_updated": 1411455697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12164756": {"recommendationid": "12164756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121927012", "num_games_owned": 1129, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 3318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488728215}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing this on the TangentGames website back then!

However, I'm a huge fan of some RPGs, so I figured I would try out FATE. After all, I was obsessed with WildTangent back in the day. (Still hoping for a Steam version of Blackhawk Striker 2!)\n\nSadly, FATE turned into a game that I do not wish to play. However, I would still recommend it, which is why I'm giving it a positive review.\n\nThe best way for me to describe FATE is that it's a never-ending dungeon. Whereas other RPGs will have you encounter multiple dungeons alongside the main story or as side quests, FATE is simply one gigantic dungeon. There is little story here; it's all about becoming the most famous adventurer to conquer what lies beyond the Gate next to the town of Grove. There are quests that the villagers of Grove will give you, but they're simply \"Get back in that dungeon, to a specific level, and beat up this specific monster there. Get the item he drops and come back.\" This furthers your progress with experience, gold, and fame. Way more focus on gameplay (see below) than story.\n\nThe aesthetics are not Battlefield 4, but they completely match with the time period the game was developed in as well as in the style of RPG the game was going for. It's very much old-timey. However, don't let the graphics mislead you into thinking that this is one of the really difficult RPGs of old; it's actually quite easy to pick up and play when you get through the opening loading screens. I would have liked a tutorial or quick \"here's what you're doing and how you do it\" conversation with a tutorial NPC or something, but it's fine as it is. Level 1 of the dungeon is straightforward and pretty much sets the bar for what players should expect.\n\nOf note, however, is that there's a difficulty setting. I set it to Page, the easiest. So it might just be me. The hardest difficulty, Legend, might be what the veterans from old RPGs would like to start out at to really get a challenge. :P\n\nGameplay is interesting, to say the least. Battles and encounters are real-time, so you have to stay on your toes and watch where you're going. Thankfully, it's easy to discern an enemy approaching you, so you have time to react. But enemies do have various speeds, both for \"walking\" and for attacking. I highly appreciate that an enemy's important statistics are mentioned just by hovering over it; it's very easy to tell what it's weak or strong to.\n\nThe music and other sound effects are top-notch, and I'm definitely going to research into the FATE soundtrack after posting this review. Very enjoyable, even to just sit in town or the main menu and listen for a while.\n\ntl;dr FATE is simply one giant dungeon, but it does it pretty well. This is not my kind of game, and I didn't enjoy it as much as other people would, but I would definitely recommend it because, for the kind of RPG it is, I think it's worth a look for all RPG fans.", "timestamp_created": 1410916869, "timestamp_updated": 1410916869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547038", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12116369": {"recommendationid": "12116369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042301527", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449396258}, "language": "english", "review": "If Diablo 3 had been this good Blizzard wouldnt have gone out of business.", "timestamp_created": 1410857266, "timestamp_updated": 1410857266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12108228": {"recommendationid": "12108228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061660699", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457723471}, "language": "english", "review": "Fate is a 200 era RPG before the likes of Minecraft Portal, Or even Skyrim.

That said, the story is essentially non-existent and the gameplay is pretty shallow - you basically just run through randomly-generated dungeons killing hordes of monsters while completing meaningless quests. Gameplay follows a pretty simple formula:\n- Go to town. Buy gear. Get quests.\n- Go to dungeon. Kill monsters. Find loot. Complete quests.\n- Go back to town. Sell loot. Get quest rewards.\nAnd then you more or less just repeat until you get bored. It's pretty standard dungeon-crawler faire.\nNow, if you really like generic dungeon crawlers and are a big fan of the action/RPG genre, you'll probably have fun with this game, though you might be better off going with something like Titan Quest if you want a bit more depth.\nIn sum, FATE is a good game to pick up if you're just looking for a simple dungeon-crawler to play.

It should because this was the game that preceeded Torchlight and Torchlight 2.\n\nDeveloped by Travis Baldree, who recently left Runic Games to start his own project, FATE seems simple enough to play, especially for action RPG fans who have Torchlight in their library.  Delve deeper and you soon find you will need to think about your choices.  Strength isn't just the catch-all for warriors, you'll need to add points to dexterity or you'll miss all of your swings.  Dexterity isn't the catch-all for rogues because the quests put you up against tough boss monsters who will likely kill you if you don't beef up your other stats.\n\nAn interesting twist not present in the Torchlight games is the concept of fate.  When you get quests, you are told what piece of gear you will need to retrieve from the dungeon and what you'll receive in return.  Once you get the gear, you can choose to keep it or turn in the quest for your reward.  The problem is you know the stats of the gear in your hand but you won't know whether the reward has better stats unless you turn the quest in.  It's a little bit of a Monty Hall problem.  In addition, turning in quests give you fame and as you gain recognition, you will receive 'fate points' that allow you to specialize in specific skills.  These are very specific right down to the type of weapon (hammer, axe, sword, etc...) or the type of magic (attack, defense, charm) you are using.  So do you keep the gear and miss out on your fame or do you go for door number two?\n\nYou may have had the chance to experience a trial version the game many years ago if you happened to get a HP computer.  It works just fine on my Windows 7 x64 system, and you no longer have to deal with Wildtangent's scammy client that tried to make you pay by the hour.  I also like the variation and weapons and armor.  Like Torchlight, you get so see your new gear close up as you leave.  \n\nIt's as fun to play now as it was back then.

I absolutely love it! \n\nFirst discovered Fate when I got my laptop a couple pf years ago and was looking for some fun games that were built-in with it. Fate was one of them and I fell in love with it. It reminded me of my beloved Diablo game I had a long time ago. Unfortunately, the demo ended soon and I was so upset that I couldn't play it anymore. \n\nWhen I saw it on Steam, I don't think I had ever been so excited. Especially because of the fact it was about 75% cheaper than buying it from the Tangent provider. \n\n\nThis game is absolutely fun and the fun will last for a very long time. The dungeons are endless and the enemies get more and more challenging.

Mechanics like \"pets carrying loot to town\" were developed right here.  The graphical style is similar, the play style is familiar, and the entire game revolves around procedurally generated quests and dungeons.  If these are the elements of an Action RPG that you enjoy, then do pick up this game and play a little slice of history.  If, however,  you want a thoroughly modern and highly polished experience, then stick with Torchlight 2 or Path of Exile instead.\n\nThat all said, it has been my experience that most fans of ARPGs have a little bit of retro-gamer in them.  If this describes you, then stop reading this right now and start playing FATE.  It will give that pin-prick of retro style in a package that is just as fun as other ARPGs.\n\nThe only detractors for me are the lack of any sort of skill tree system, or anything else that truly differentiates one play style from another.  While it is true that FATE's character progression is intendedly more organic than a class-based game like Diablo 2 (and succeeds, as far as it goes), it comes off as retrograde as compared to character progression in a more modern game like Torchlight 2 or even Diablo 3.\n\nBottom line: If you enjoy Action RPGs, then pick this up on sale.

The fun in this game comes from the complete randomness and endless play killing waves of monsters while progressing deeper and trying to get the best set of gear you can. \n \nIt does have its flaws. Item skill point requirements are not well balanced and can make gearing up early in the game quite difficult. Fishing is almost required to get well geared, and the fishing mechanic is a bit buggy causing you to fail the catch even if you clicked in time to catch it. Perhaps the worst feature however is the chance to completely loose all enchantment on your gear when enchanting, I would not advise enchanting anything that you wouldn't want to lose... because you very well might.  \n \nI would recommend the game to anyone, it is good for at least 2 playthroughs.

I used to play this game when I was a wee boy... so I guess you could say that I have a lot of Memories and Nolstagia.

It has a very interesting Inventory UI (Which can be a bother at times but is still very inventive.)  It also has a range of different items and monsters (way to many to count!)  For the most part it seems that dungeon levels are infinte however I havent got very far yet!  This game also has a quest system which is used to gain Fame, Gold, Expierence which can be used to level up your character, and even in some cases Items, .  You also have a faithful compainion which can be a Cat or Dog depending on your preference.  They will aid in your efforts to kill Monsters and also cannot die!  You can also feed your pets fish, which will turn them into something fierce for a time.  You can also transform your pet into something permanelty (I dont know how to do this yet... but I will find out eventually.)  I quite like the idea of transforming your pet for if you are having a tough time and your normal trusty steed aint cuttin it, then you can turn him to a Unicorn or something!  The music is very pleasant and the narrators voice is pretty cool aswell.  The last thing I should mention is that... when you die there are some negative effects.  You will have to choose your fate!  And each choice you choose has a reprocussion like losing XP or Gold.  The one thing that bugs me about this game is that once you clear a Dungeon Level... there aren't any monsters that spawn in afterwards.  (What I mean is that, it would be nice that there would be a minimal amount of monsters that could still spawn so that you could level up over time without having to advance right away without having the recommended skills or power.)

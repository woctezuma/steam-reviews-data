A sentry tree, so first theres artillery, T2 gun turret and flame, but each upgrade should then have 2 seprate upgrades, and then one more upgrade, to finish the tree off. i would also recomend a T2 eperimental factory, and also a medic troop.

For now it is like always GDI vs. GDI or Allies vs. Allies. Is it possible to add one more faction with buildings and units different in functions and outlines (I guess I care more about the different shape)?

I love RTS games, and this fits into the catagory of what I love IN a RTS game. It has amazing diversity, the AI keeps you on your toes, custom maps, mods, and the multiplayer is very easy to set up. This is a gem of a game, im excited to see what it will hold in the future.\n\nPros: \n+Cheap\n+Many maps + custom maps makes good replay value\n+Multiplayer is very easy to use, and setting up a game with friends is quick\n+Unit diversity is ever expanding, from many types of aircraft to mech\n+Amazing modding potential due to the more simplistic style\n+Very small file size compared to most games now\n+No pay to play, or dlc, or any payed bullshit in general\n+Extremely optimized, I have NEVER gotten any lag spikes or lag in general. Even with\n100s upon 100s of units moving and firing at once.\n\nCons:\n-Honestly none. I can't find anything I do not like about this game. I guess the only thing\nthat could fit into this category is that there could be steam workshop support, but thats likely \nto come anyways.\n\nThings I'd like to see: \n-Some sort of vehicle that can traverse lava. It would be a great strategic advantage on a lava map to \nhave some sort of vehicle in the lava, and hovervehicles cannot travel over it.\n-A way to give money to allies\n-Helicoptor buffs. I was able to beat two helicopters with one scout. They are VERY weak.\n-Maybe a vehicle able to deliver nukes while mobile? It would likely be very expensive and not able to hold \nmany nukes, but it'd be a nice touch.\n-Strange, but maybe an underground unit? Maybe you can drill underground and make room to build underground of some sort idk, but it'd be cool to sneak under enemy lines and then drill a hole one their side and flood them with troops. Although this would need a balance like a ground radar to see under the ground, and maybe bombs and fights above ground can destroy the underground areas.\n-A type of bomb similar to a nuke but instead it makes like a temporary repair zone that can help and heal your troops. This would be good for large assault groups, and It would provide for some interesting tactics.\n-A wall system. If you could acually build walls of some sort maybe in different tiers to defend against oncoming attacks that would be awesome. And maybe some sort of mortar tower that can fire around artillary range, but it can go over walls an terrain.\n-An In-game map editor.\n-Weather. This would provide for really cool ambience, and if there was alot of wind it could make troops travel slower in the direction of the wind. Could provide a minor advantage.\n\nOverall, 9.3/10. Its hard to find issues with this. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an RTS game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515225053, "timestamp_updated": 1515225053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39086371": {"recommendationid": "39086371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798447775", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 193, "last_played": 1515686795}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9\uff0c", "timestamp_created": 1515164728, "timestamp_updated": 1515164728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39020424": {"recommendationid": "39020424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243124332", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515004072}, "language": "finnish", "review": "piece of shit with friends pisses me off dont buy its a shitty game and ffs im gonna commit suicide cause this has some shitty fucking soundtrack somebody please copyrght strike this shit so nobody has to take the pain and suffering from this game and that would be one good thing done!\"!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1515004207, "timestamp_updated": 1515004207, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1515025664, "developer_response": "Hey not sure if you are just trolling and what's up with the heart symbols there.\n\nAll the soundtracks have been licensed, under something like creative commons attribution, or are public domain.\n\nIf you have any other issues let me know or email me.

I've been gaming for 30 years now and this is one of my favorite RTS games.  I wasn't paid to write this review, and I didn't get the game for free.  I played this game on a tablet for several months and when I saw it available on Steam I bought it and added it to my library.  You will be hard pressed to spend $5 any better than you could by purchasing this game.  It's straightforward: build extractors to mine money and then build units and mechs as fast as you can.  Defend your bases and go after the enemy.  There are air, land, and sea units, as well as some units that are amphibious.  The graphics are not cutting edge but the game-play mechanics are rock solid and it has high replay value.  When I get that ol' RTS itch, this is my go to fix right now.  I would recommend this game to every single person on Steam.  I purchased a copy of this for my son and we just got done with a multiplayer game where we teamed up against a computer opponent.  It was fun coordinating our attacks and then upgrading to build better units to counter the computer's newer units.     \n     Rusted Warfare absolutely has that classic RTS feel.  The production buildings and economy are simple enough that you focus mostly on the battles and your strategy - not micromanaging a ton of other things that keep you from fighting.  The battles can get pretty intense and involve over a 100 units at a time - even more if you're doing multiplayer.  You do need to keep your armies balanced though so that you can deal with a multitude of enemy units with different capabilities.  Overall it is a totally refreshing game that provides a challenge in a classic RTS format.  This game ought to be trending right now - it just needs a little more exposure and word-of-mouth recommendations.  I'm doing my part with his review.

In addition, maps can be edited in the game, and cross-platform multiplayer is available allowing players on Windows, Linux, and Android systems to play together. The interface is very basic and lacks some features, like infinite queues (or even queueing up things in advance without paying for them) and auto-explore. Rusted Warfare only features one resource (cash), extracted from specific locations on the map (or produced at a lesser rate anywhere). Cash is used to build factories (land, air, sea, and mech), defensive turrets, repair structures, and shields. Cash is also used to upgrade structures to higher tiers so they can produce more advanced units. The AI is a decent competitor. Rusted Warfare doesn\u2019t offer anything innovative to the genre, instead producing some combination of Red Alert and Supreme Commander; shallow economics and simple unit countering (along with extremely tedious end-game clean-up) limit potential strategies. That said, the price is very reasonable and cross-platform multiplayer is a nice feature. But overall, the limitations of Rusted Warfare hold it back just enough from being a satisfying take on the classic real-time strategy game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RS9JpRJSzc", "timestamp_created": 1506938075, "timestamp_updated": 1506938075, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35382108": {"recommendationid": "35382108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035677400", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514242246}, "language": "english", "review": "For $5 I would say this game is definitely worth it.

I was quite enjoyed playing with such large battle so smoothly after the failure of Supreme Commander 2 and the scam of Planetary Annihilation.\n\nHowever it has some serious balance issues(ie. submarine vs missile ship) while lack in some fundamental UI structure that any RTS should have, for example when selecting units the game selects everything including engineers and even all buildings, also there's no indication on what types and how many units are selected neither. \nFor a game with such scale, there's no user-friendly unit marker visible on screen when zoom out to show what kind of unit is there, so I have to either select them all or zoom in again to see what is there, combine with the lack of selection indication, it really creates frustration during my brief playtime.\nThere's no build queue for factories when fund is low, so I have to go back to factories(I know there are shortcuts, but hey, just trying to make a point:) ) and click to build again whenever I have enough funds to pump out more units. This might be nitpicky to others, but we are talking about TA/SPC/PA level of combat scale with hundreds of units being pumped out every minute, a queue system can greatly improve the combat flow and ease up the micro-managing part so players can focus more on the combat side and greatness of this game.\n\nLastly the localization, it's good to have more languages for broader appeals, it's extremely business hurting to have languages translated poorly using google or some sort. I can't speak for other languages, but Chinese in game is full of BS and not much of it make any sense.\n\nUnfortunately despite how much I enjoyed this game I need to request a refund due to the reasons above, but I will thumb the game up in the review as it really achieved many that many other games failed to delivered.

This is in the vein of traditional RTS games that I played in my youth in fact I would say this feels very much like Total Annihilation at the moment. \n\nAs it stands right now there is one 'resource' to farm which gives you funds to build ships/tanks/aircraft.  This means that the resource squares make for obvious pinch points which require defending and also are obvious areas to attack.  The game concentrates on the fun element of building the armies and have big all out battles which is great.  The AI seems pretty decent as well which is very important part of a single player game and personally I have only so far played the single player game which has been fun.  Its well balanced with the AI and thats an important part of a game like this as it makes for a fun mechanic.  This review therefore covers only the single player element and not the multiplayer game which I have not yet tried.  \n\nOverall this is a very reasonable price for a fun old school RTS game and I can certainly recommend it. \n\nFor those people who play on Linux I can state that this played as smooth as butter on my Debian based gaming machine.

Once you get down an extractor or 2 to give you an initial jump start, you can hammer out money fabricators to your hearts content without any penalty other than a high initial cost outlay. There's no power requirements to any building, because there is no power or resource management whatsoever.. so long as you can churn out enough cash generation, it's just a matter of hammering out as many units as you can.\n\nCost is the main issue you have to manage and that's it. So long as you can protect, upgrade and go nuts building your fabricators, you're laughing all the way to victory. As I mentioned it's just about making sure you can afford high cost, higher tier units up-front. In my eyes this is one of the game's biggest flaws.\n\nAnother flaw is map design.. other than water ways to go around, maps are extremely featureless. There are no rocks, trees, hills etc... everything is flat with different colours. There are a few maps here and there with additional terrain height. But there's not nearly enough, and their design is still woefully basic.\n\nThe tech tree is a very limited as well. you build the prerequisite factory, and if you want more powerful units, you click the structure then press \"Upgrade\" for a small fee, after a short time period you have access to all tier 2 units. If you want experimental, you build the factory for that. You don't need higher tier builders to build higher tier buildings. The basic builder will also build your superweapon.. It once again falls down to high cash requirements.\n\nThe only real choice really you get in upgrading are the turrets. Levelling those up allows you to choose a turret type.\n\nThat said I don't wish to take away from the game any more than that. As an RTS, the combat is incredibly solid, and the usual Rock Paper Scissors mechanics are on point with any other RTS on the market. As you would expect from AAA when it comes to Air , Land, Sea warfare, you'll get the combination layers required to make the breakthroughs you need.\n\nAs a single player game, there's plenty of content here. But milage will vary on that because of the shallowness of the building mechanics. To get the most out of the game with the AI, you do have to crank it up to higher difficulties, this will make the game interesting enough to give it legs as the AI will be smarter than your typical RTS. It'll still do it's cheaty thing by having additional bonuses. But it does have elements of actual intelligence here and there, that when you see them, you'll be quite surprised at it.. It doesn't just build to a certain quota of units and then chuck them at you, This is actually a big pro.\n\nThe game does shine in the Multiplayer though as the shallow mechanics make more sense here. Facing off against human opposition is as good as any other game. It's your usual yet very solid arms race in creating the best Military Industrial Complex. I would say that if you want this game, this is what you play it for, with fighting higher difficulty AI 2nd...\n\nYou get what you pay for really. So you can't expect much at this price point. But you will get your money's worth for a basic RTS that does the core elements of RTS right, has a decent AI at higher levels and provides a decent multiplayer experience. Fot those reasons I will give the game a thumbs up. \n\nBut If you're looking for an RTS with depth, plenty of upgrade options and a deep tech tree with nuances to work around, you won't find it here, and you'll be better off sticking with the games that inspired it. Alternatively if you must go for an indie TA/Sup-Com Clone with the depth you desire there's Machines At War 3, which is also on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1500678910, "timestamp_updated": 1500679740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649706", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33702113": {"recommendationid": "33702113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373000182", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500659802}, "language": "english", "review": "A Classic RTS game it kinda remind me like Supreme Commander but in a simpler way.

There's a single \"race\" but you have a fairly varied selection of units (air/sea/land units plus upgrades for each type, experimental mega-units that excel in different aspects, plus of course, nukes). The varied selection of units I feel brings some good strategy to the game - e.g. you might build a big land force, but your opponent might see it coming and counters you with air units etc.\n\nWhile single player works I didn't spend too much time there, and feel the game shines in Multiplayer. You have varied start options (e.g. start with experimental units, or start with just a builder, start with additional resources etc and plenty of maps to choose from. \n\nPlaying with teams is great as you can have teammates playing the early game and pumping out cheap units to keep your opponents on the defence while you build up a mega army for the late game (which can be a hell of a lot of fun :)).\n\nIn terms of updates: I played this on android a long while ago and it seems to have come a long way, with more units, more maps, more start options etc. It's early days but looking at the developer responses in greenlight and how far the game has come makes me think the updates will keep coming :)\n\nAlso note for linux gamers: game functions perfectly for me on ArchLinux (using steam with runtime).\n\nDisclaimer: I received the game for free, before steam release and did some beta testing for the dev.", "timestamp_created": 1500111895, "timestamp_updated": 1500111895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33553892": {"recommendationid": "33553892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213393744", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500554988}, "language": "english", "review": "why ever time i go to open the game it quits me out and i cnt play", "timestamp_created": 1500105657, "timestamp_updated": 1500105657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419048", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33551711": {"recommendationid": "33551711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017949191", "num_games_owned": 1325, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500131114}, "language": "english", "review": "Great and simple RTS.

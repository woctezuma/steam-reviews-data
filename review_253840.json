This is the first game that I know when I get the dlc, I will officially 100% achievement it. \n\nSo what makes it so good to me? Besides showing improvement in the graphics from the previous games, I feel that this installment in the series really hits the formula that the team in Wayforward were going for. \n\nI won't go into details as how gameplay goes, but I do feel it is for people who really like a platformer with some discovery involved. I really set out to get my stuff, and after completion, I say it is worth it.\n\nEither way, I say check out a better comment that describes the accurate reviews of this game, and ignore people who talk about backtracking being painful. It isn't that bad, but if it is not something you like, you should know right away this game does have alot, but its fun to me!\n\nMomentie!", "timestamp_created": 1515907583, "timestamp_updated": 1515907583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39327994": {"recommendationid": "39327994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063955609", "num_games_owned": 1358, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 884, "last_played": 1515851907}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u4e09\u4ee3\uff08\u300a\u6d77\u76d7\u7684\u8bc5\u5492\u300b\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u5427\u3002\n\u9999\u7f07\u8fd9\u4e00\u4ee3\u91cd\u62fe\u9b54\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u5404\u79cd\u9053\u5177\u53d8\u5230\u4e86DLC\u91cc\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u4e5f\u7ec8\u4e8e\u4e0d\u662f\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u4e86\u3002\n\u7f3a\u70b9\u60f3\u4e86\u60f3\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\uff1a\n\u4e00\u4e2a\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u6709\u6536\u85cf\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5173\u5361\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u5185\u5bb9\u6ca1\u6536\u96c6\u9f50\u90fd\u80fd\u770b\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u770b\u4f3c\u975e\u5f3a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5fc5\u987b\u8981\u6536\u85cf\u9f50\u624d\u80fd\u7ee7\u7eed\u5267\u60c5\uff1b\n\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u662f\u6253\u6700\u7ec8BOSS\u6218\u7684\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u573a\uff0c\u6253\u5230\u4e00\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u4f1a\u51fa\u6765\u4e94\u4e2a\u7535\u6e90\uff0c\u628a\u5b83\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u6253\u574f\u624d\u80fd\u8fc7\u3002\u7136\u800c\u6211\u5728\u90a3\u513f\u8f6c\u4e86\u534a\u4e2a\u591a\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u7535\u6e90\u5c31\u662f\u4e0d\u51fa\u6765\u2026\u2026\u540e\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u539f\u6765\u8981\u8fdc\u79bb\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u7535\u6e90\u4f4d\u7f6e\u624d\u884c\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u77e5\u9053\u7b97\u4e0d\u7b97BUG\u3002\n\u9664\u53bb\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8fd9\u4e9b\uff0c\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd9\u6b21\u4e0d\u592a\u7528\u5fc3\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u4ecd\u65e7\u7b97\u662f\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1515902784, "timestamp_updated": 1515902784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533679", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39268942": {"recommendationid": "39268942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069899043", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482464080}, "language": "english", "review": "the parallax scrolling in the background made me nauseous, so i couldn't play for long without felling sick.", "timestamp_created": 1515716403, "timestamp_updated": 1515716403, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.403139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39267560": {"recommendationid": "39267560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056624027", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 71, "last_played": 1515799343}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Excelente platformer 2D :) hist\u00f3ria engra\u00e7ada, protagonista ador\u00e1vel, gr\u00e1ficos lindos, trilha sonora matadora, jogabilidade super refinada.", "timestamp_created": 1515711175, "timestamp_updated": 1515711175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39246178": {"recommendationid": "39246178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368394586", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 446, "last_played": 1515634022}, "language": "english", "review": "Firstly, as a disclaimer, I haven't yet played the DLC. Now to get on with the actual game. I adore the Shantae series and if I had to pick, this would be my favourite one. I will start with the soundtrack as, like in the past, this game has a beautiful soundtrack. I have never been more pumped by a first level song like Dancing Through the Danger. Now in comparison, this game for sure embraces a more techno aspect to the music, however it does not lose the thematic aspects of the songs. On top of the fact that it feels really fitting. The all new shining graphics with clean cut character appearance just benefits the new type of music and I felt just made it all the better. The game looks gorgeous, the sprites are more animated than ever and still look clean cut. This game was definitely the easiest of them, but I wouldn't call that a bad thing, especially when they offer a more difficult way to play the game. It takes pieces of the previous games, weeding out the more disappointing factors and keeping the good. I prefered the level based gameplay from Pirate's Curse, which makes a return in this game, however there wasn't any level that I necessarily disliked. There were portions of levels I could care less for, one which I hated, but besides that they were all amazing, and I only disliked returning to them after like the fifth time I had to hunting for all the items. The story is as cute as ever, except it does feel a bit disconnected from the events of Pirate's Curse, I think mostly because it wanted to bring back transformations over the items in that game. With the bosses, it was a give or take. The final boss was mostly split into three back to back portions, I liked the first, but the second two were incredibly disappointing. I wish there was more to this game than there was really. 9.2/10", "timestamp_created": 1515638643, "timestamp_updated": 1515638643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39242185": {"recommendationid": "39242185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136262991", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512574313}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No quisiera decir que este juego es malo , pero no me termina de convencer.\nLo primero a tomar en cuenta es la duraci\u00f3n , aproximadamente unas 2 a 3 horas y un poco m\u00e1s de tiempo si quieres completar al 100%.

Shantae fan, or any platformer fan will enjoy.\n\n***NOTE: I HAVE ONLY PLAYED THE BASE GAME AND NOT DLC***\n\nThe series is known for its Metroidvania gameplay, however this game in particular feels more MegaMan-like than its previous titles. After getting a power-up you'll find yourself re-treading old ground and exploring new pathways and passages in search of goodies multiple times, but stages are selected via a menu this time around and it feels a lot less like exploring a world in comparison to the other worlds. Backtracking is common here and some people may find it tedious, but that just comes with the territory of playing a Metroidvania/MegaMan-style game, it's enjoyable to those who play these games and it is definitely fun in this game as well. Even if it lost a bit of its Metroidvania touch, it is still very rewarding and satisfying to play.\n\nThe controls are extremely responsive and fluid, the characters are cute and wholesome and the OST is absolutely stellar and is a blast to listen to. The whole game is a bundle of joy and it's impossible not to smile when you play this game.\n\nThe story in this game is nothing to write home about, however if you haven't played the previous titles you'll miss out on some of the emotional attachment and love from the recurring cast as their stories have already been explained previously, but it's not enough to detract from the experience. If this is your first Shantae game then you'll be fine. Although, I do wish that the story was more in-depth and involved. Previous titles had a surprising level of ambience and mystery revolving around Shantae and her world and there was far more involvement the Shantae cast had to do with the main storyline. There is a DLC that revolves around her friends, but I haven't played that yet so I can't comment on it.\n\nRegardless, I enjoyed every second of this game and I believe anyone will if they give this a shot. For fans of the previous entries, this game is a must-buy.

No. Is it an enjoyable game? Certainly. Would I recommend it? I don't know, but steam doesn't have a neutral option, so whenever I'm neural I don't recommend a game since I feel like there are other games which I would rather play and recommend. The fundamental issue is that this game has a lot of back tracking. This is not a problem, I'm a metroidvenia fanboy, but contrary to a metroidvenia, this game has multiple individual levels which are linear. This makes it feel like it has a bit of an identity crises. This doesn't kill the game by itself, but in combination with the lacklustre length when compared to its price, 10 hours to 100% the normal campaign, it feels quite short. Other games, such as momodora, had the same price and length relatively speaking, yet I felt inclined to replay it because it was a lot more fun. The one thing that really definitively killed this game for me is that they released a 10 euro dlc with roughly 3 hours of playtime. It just feels like a ripoff. If you wanted to buy this game, buy shantae pirate curse instead.

I'm not familiar with other titles in the series and it did feel like there was a decent amount of back tracking, especially if you wished to get the 100% completion, but part of my problem with that was I totally forgot about the whistle to summon Wrench.  The first item you get in game...  After that, using Warp and Wrench, made the collecting far easier.\n\nWhat I did like:\n+Art is absolutely beautiful\n+Music was engaging, didn't feel out of place or repetative\n+Fluid feeling controls and intuitive behavior\n+Bosses felt challenging\n+The hand holding (IE, the bath house lady) was helpful from time to time\n+The different forms (monkey, elephant, harpy, etc) each felt useful\n+It filled my pot breaking fetish nicely\n+Art gallery featured both developer and fan art (kudos!)\n+Enemies at later stages weren't just pallet swaps\n\nWhat bugged me a little:\n-Towards the end some of the final stage felt like Flappy Bird\n-Even in the 'Flappy Bird' stage, I could dodge 50% of the puzzle by just flying very high\n-It wasn't longer\n-No way to get soundtrack (am I wrong here?)\n-Enemy pool wasn't as large as I was hoping for (but at least they felt unique)\n\nOverall, it was a bit shorter than I had hoped, but what I did get was super fun and engaging.  The characters were enjoyable, the stages fun (for the most part, see the Flappy Bird comment) and I was sad when it was over.  I haven't tried any of the DLC yet, but I hope to.  For the price at which I got this game, I highly recommend adding it to your library.  I played it with both the XBox Windows controller and the Steam controller, and didn't have any issues and didn't have to map anything out.  It worked 'out the box' so to speak.  Just sit down and enjoy slapping a variety of enemies about with your hair as you turn into a spider and later set fire to gators to turn them into delicious steaks.", "timestamp_created": 1514763501, "timestamp_updated": 1514763501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569191", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38911396": {"recommendationid": "38911396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080499646", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494123025}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud55c\ud328\ub3c4 \ub098\uc654\uc73c\ub2c8 \uc5b4\ub4dc\ubc34\uccd0 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uba74 \ud55c\ubc88 \ud574\ubcfc\ub9cc\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\n\uce90\ub9ad\ud130\ub4e4 \uae14\uc5ec\uc6cc\n", "timestamp_created": 1514746768, "timestamp_updated": 1514746768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38892007": {"recommendationid": "38892007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255472216", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514878499}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac8c\uc784\ub3c4 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uace0 \uc74c\uc545\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ub098\uace0 \uc88b\uc544\uc694~ \ub2e4\ub9cc \ud55c\ud328\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \ucda4\uc904\ub54c \ud305\uae30\ub294\ub370 \uc9c4\ud589\uc0c1 \ucda4\uc740 \ud544\uc218\uc774\ub2c8 \uadf8\ub0e5 \uc601\uc5b4\ub85c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud558\ub294\uac78 \uad8c\ud574\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1514705428, "timestamp_updated": 1514705428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38872068": {"recommendationid": "38872068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024554172", "num_games_owned": 664, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "last_played": 1515206996}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic platformer with a good story and cute characters.

The mermaid factory and its boss grabbed everyone's attention, but following it, things become far slower and more repetitive.  It's not a bad game, but I'm really hoping its assets become a springboard something better later on.  I'd be regretting it if I hadn't grabbed it on sale.\n\nThe backtracking in this installment feels excessive.  There are now 8 different forms that each have their own upgrade ability, which sounds great on paper.  But in practice, since none are great against the game's damage sponge enemies and many move slow, all but the monkey form see seldom use beyond getting through their obligatory required spots.  Re-entering the same 6 areas to slowly sift for the one new ability that lets you repeat the process somewhere else.  It becomes soul-crushingly dull when you have to comb the underwater depths as the crab, slowly entering each new body of water to find out there's nothing there, even more slowly jumping your way out, and repeating with the next of 4 neighboring lakes, trying to remember which pool needed which of three upgrades to get past.  I'm thankful they list all the items you haven't grabbed for each level to prevent it from being too confusing, but there are other issues with flow here.\n\nShantae is one of those side-scrollers that did away with one-hit death pits and spikes, instead just taking some of your health and moving you back.  I think they got carried away with that penalty in Half-Genie Hero, because some of the one-shot lasers and spikes are excessive, moving you all the way back to the entrance of an area.  This can mean walking through long, empty stretches that you depopulated of your enemies to try the one spot again.  While the penalty is technically lenient, the long walk still wrecks whatever sense of flow you had and retrying feels like a chore.   For areas that call for the harpy form, it's mainly difficult because you probably have no experience navigating obstacles with that form, so it's just a very annoying learning process.  Once you beat those spots, you're not going to use that form again, so it's not like you mastered anything.  I feel like these spots miss the point of what makes platforming rewarding.  It's neither snappy, nor makes you feel triumph for overcoming stuff.\n\nWriting-wise, it's... actually kind of weird this would come off as a disappointment, given it's a comedic series that brushes off all sense of consequence.\n\n===================================================\n SPOILERS FOR STUFF THE GAME NEVER REALLY CARES ABOUT, I GUESS\n===================================================\n\n\nNo matter what Risky does, she gets thwarted, curses Shantae, and goes back to plotting something evil.  She usually takes and destroys something of Shantae or her uncle's in the process, but whatever, it's not permanent.  In Half-Genie Hero, she corrupts an entire world, and to prevent further damage (depending on the ending), Shantae has to blow it all up including her own mother.  Which is a little dark, but nobody really reacts to Risky herself over it.  The last time the series had an especially evil megalomaniac, it ended with satisfyingly pulling no punches, working in the previous installmetns' plot thread, and blwoing him up.  I'm not saying Shantae has to murder Risky in cold blood for my amusement, but it's a little hard to write off what just happened with \"Oh, that darn Risky, up to no good with her slavery and genocide!\"  After the last game implied there was more to the villain than one-dimensional evil, it's such an awkward regression.\n\nIf anything, I just think the game is tackling dramatic subjects it doesn't know what to do with.  Partway through, Shantae gets corrupted herself, but shakes it off thanks to all her friends cheering her on and thanking her for all she's done.  Even if you've played the previous games, it feels unearned and out of nowhere, since the surrounding story doesn't build up to it.  That and the titular heroine's already fought and beaten her own corrupted genie side before, so it's redundant and has no bite.  She still drones about feeling inadequate as only half gnie when she's had her best written and playable adventure as 0% genie, and something something proof she was all hero all along.  You're left with a long, drawn out dialogue sequence that ultimately adds nothing.  If the game is going to force drama and raise stakes, it really should have let its characters develop and try something new.  Otherwise, I think all the side villains work better as antagonists and rivals, since their plots end in far more satisfying punchlines, schadenfreude, and fourth wall breaking that fit the games' tone.\n\nI'm still giving the game a thumbs up because all the work that went into the animation and music shows, and monkey Shantae is adorable.

It is no longer a metroidvania. Instead, levels are super linear and most understandably require you to backtrack to them once you gain new transformations. The problem with this is the transformations take a lot from the pacing of the game, like in Risky's Revenge or the original. In Pirate's Curse, the items you found were designed to keep the flow of the game going. They could be combined to get to new areas or to gain speed. This made getting those items rewarding.\nIn Half Genie Hero, you cannot combine transformations very easily, as you could only transform on the ground and not in mid air or underwater, making super-quick transformations or ability combinations an impossibility. And even if you COULD transform in mid air, selecting a transformation takes ages in 1/2 Genie Hero, playing a little animation every time you transform instead of just transforming right away, which negatively impacts the pacing of the game. There's also something else to note: not every transformation has an ability anyway. These abilities need to be found in the game world, and they require a lot of backtracking, which is not very fun here. Not to say that it's HARD, it's just very unrewarding in my opinion.\nThat being said, I still think there is a lot to like about the base game. The bosses are all pretty fun to fight, the artstyle is great (though i personally prefer Pirate's Curse's artstyle a lot more), and the music is fucking banging. Unfortunately, however, the game is very short and can be beaten in just one sitting. Thankfully there IS a hero mode just like in Pirate's Curse, which ramps up the difficulty a bit. \nI don't know, man. Overall this game left a slightly sour taste in my mouth. This is one of those instances where a \"Mixed\" option would be useful, but I know Valve will probably never add it. So I'll give it a positive review just because I like the series.\n\nI recommend getting Shantae: Half-Genie Hero while it's on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1514482873, "timestamp_updated": 1514482873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38774294": {"recommendationid": "38774294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045637460", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514454969}, "language": "english", "review": "Most recent entry into shantae series with 2d graphics ditching the pixelized artwork from previous games.

Its a metroidvania style game that has more distinct levels, as opposed to an open world, which is something different. Plus the transformations seemed like a nice twist on the standard powerups you'd find in metroidvania style games. In practice though, both these just ended up being annoying. The more traditional style platformer levels didn't lend themselves to being fun to explore, and the way in which you explored the world was so methodical that it felt more like a chore. Futhermore, the transformations ended up being rather annoying as they really slowed down game play. Getting to the bottom of a water section as a crab, only to realize that you had to go all the way back to transform because you need the mermaid for this section was not fun in the least. \n\nFurthermore, combat is rather clunky. They're a bunch of broken power ups, and you can sort of just smash you way through the game if you choose. However, if you choose to disable the power ups, the enemies don't really feel designed in a way that rewards tight play. \n\nOverall, it was meh.", "timestamp_created": 1514233278, "timestamp_updated": 1514233278, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38663502": {"recommendationid": "38663502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390593599", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514049962}, "language": "german", "review": "Shantae 1/2 Genie Hero.\nEin w\u00fcrdiger Nachfolger, und die Grafik ist ebenfalls gut gelungen mit der Mischung aus 2D und 3D...halt 2,5D :D", "timestamp_created": 1514218418, "timestamp_updated": 1514218418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38649166": {"recommendationid": "38649166", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969030562", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514187645}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most perfect games I can remember playing (and I've played a TON of games over the past 45 years).

Good, not great though. I think a lot of the great things about the game are kinda surface-level. The game looks beautiful, the script is funny and the music is fantastic, but once you get past that, you just have a servicable platformer that doesn't seem to want to be anything besides a cute little game with a couple of metroidvania type elements thrown in. The game isn't long. I think I beat it in about 8 hours, and that was a lot of time spent backtracking through levels. Don't expect a Hollow Knight experience when it comes to exploration. Collectibles are few, and made simple by a very small, linear map. \n\nBosses are pretty standard here. There are some weapons which interact with some of the things bosses do. For example, some of their projectiles can be reflected if you purchase the mirror upgrade. But none of this really matters, since bosses that can be hit by Shantae's hair can easily be face-tanked, thanks to an extremely forgiving health pool, an armor upgrade and an over-abundance of restorative items. \n\nI am just barely recommending it because it's a fun game.

The story was kind of a let down, it felt like Shantae was going to be a hero for hire; going places and doing odd jobs, all while she has this new \"Rival\" (Holly Lingerbean) that constantly jeers at her, I thought she was going to the final boss or be near the climax. NOPE! Not even close, Holly never really appears in the story outside of the  3 cutscenes that she's in. Holly makes no impact at all in the plot just another thrown in villain, you could've just made the Sandworm the cause of everyone their losing memories and it still would have made more sense. \nAnother thing was Risky, I know she's the series, main villain, but I feel she could have taken a back seat for a fresh face to be the new villain, if you wanted to have a Risky [strike] Boobs\t[/strike] Boots final battle it could an endgame optional story (which this game doesn't have.)\n\n\n[h1] Gamplay\t[/h1]\n\nI've Really had no problems here other than that some of the transformations being useless or having boring Mechanics.\nThe Spider is an example, I really wanted this to be my favorite form but it had no use outside of the puzzle rooms and the 2 achievements, (you could have added a poison effect to the Venom attack and added more ceilings to climb.) The elephant was a double edge sword, you deal 10 damage but end up taking damage if you don't finish them off. The Mouse maze mechanic was meh... It had potential but, ends up falling flat.\nOther then that the game is pretty solid it just needs some polishing on some of the enemies and their cheap hits.\n\n[h1] Animation/Graphics\t[/h1]\n\nThe look of this game is great, the beginning of this game and the use of colors makes the tone of the game mysterious and spiritual. the animation is smooth for the most part, it has some hiccups with some choppy animations, bad motion tweens, and reuse of the Wrench level select sprite in the escape cutscene.\n\n\n[h1] Overall\t[/h1]\n\nThe game is Great, it's a lot of small things that hold it back. ( Ex. Transformations being underused, not enough areas to play in), I would recommend this game, but when it's on sale, to save yourself a few dollars.\nif WayForward, you do release another Shantae game, add some more original villians and enemies, place in a few more enemies, and flesh out your Transfomations (more gameplay mechcanics, and interactions with the townsfolk and the transformations.)\n\n\n[strike] No Sereiously Im Dean im being forced to play the tutorial, send help.\t[/strike]", "timestamp_created": 1512634709, "timestamp_updated": 1512634811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38033792": {"recommendationid": "38033792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440523066", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "last_played": 1516374666}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Oynamas\u0131 a\u015f\u0131r\u0131 e\u011flenceli ve muzikleri dinlemesi a\u015f\u0131r\u0131 g\u00eezel bir oyun.Pirate Queen DLC side paras\u0131n\u0131 hak ediyor.", "timestamp_created": 1512309735, "timestamp_updated": 1512309735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37991021": {"recommendationid": "37991021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074229855", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512162219}, "language": "german", "review": "Puh, ich wei\u00df gar nicht wo ich anfangen soll...\nIch hab mir Shantae: Riskys Revenge, Pirates Curse und 1/2 Genie Hero vor kurzem beim Black Friday Sale gekauft und muss sagen das ich richtig begeistert bin!\n\n-Jedes dieser drei Spiele ((Ich nutze einfach mal die Gelegenheit und schreibe eine Review f\u00fcr alle drei Spiele :P )) strotzt nur so vor liebenswerten und niedlichen Charakteren und Humor.\n-Der Soundtrack ist durchgehend super!

It is kind of funny to think about it, but there are similarities here.\n\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero is a cartoon platformer that has a main world map where you run between a handful of levels, and each level has a few stages inside of them; but you can return to any of the levels or stages throughout the entire game (as you unlock them). The reason you return to them is to find new items to progress in the main story, because the items are usually hidden behind new passages that are inaccessible until Shantae (the main character) unlocks new powers.\n\nI think Shantae's powers made me think of Kirby, even though the mechanic is not the same. Essentially, Shantae either gains new powers in the storyline at certain cutscenes, or finds them in chests hidden through stages. These powers allow Shantae to transform into specific types of creatures to navigate things like windy hallways, swimming underwater, flying in the air, and so on. On the other hand, Kirby is a pretty old platformer series where the main character was able to eat enemies and mimic their bodies to gain their abilities, which could also be used to get around. Different mechanics, but Shantae went along with a similar idea. [i](Note: I am sure that there are many other games in the past with transformations and navigation, but Kirby came to mind first!)[/i]\n\nIn any case, I enjoyed the main storyline of Shantae because the characters you encounter are all very funny in a tongue-in-cheek style. There's definitely some low-bar jokes in here, but I still laughed most of the time.\n\nThe visual style is a mix of 2D and 2.5D between the characters/enemies and the level design. The music of the game is quite catchy and I enjoyed listening to the majority of the songs along the journey. I really liked the art overall.\n\nFor the gameplay described above, it actually works for this game, even though you backtrack to certain levels many times. There are a few places where I got stuck and a little confused on what to do. I can understand that some people might get bored if they are unable to progress easily, because the backtracking then becomes painful. Thus, I would highly suggest to pull up a guide if you get stuck for a considerable amount of time.\n\nI would say that a big improvement to the game would have been to add more levels overall and to lessen the number of times you had to revisit certain stages. Similarly, some of the transformation powers only get used a couple of times, and some of them are quite annoying. For instance, [spoiler]I really did not enjoy the Mouse power, as navigating the mazes was not fun nor did it require any thought. It simply wasted a bunch of time.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, though, I had some fun with the game here and would recommend the main storyline.", "timestamp_created": 1511904284, "timestamp_updated": 1512022324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37891170": {"recommendationid": "37891170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161160321", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515091219}, "language": "polish", "review": "+\nOprawa graficzna\nMuzyka\nSterowanie\nFabu\u0142a\n-\nMonotonia\nDrogie DLC", "timestamp_created": 1511882866, "timestamp_updated": 1511882866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37883392": {"recommendationid": "37883392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119243545", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511877700}, "language": "russian", "review": "The top teir metroidvania.

I never got to play the physical copy of the original, but I have played it on my 3DS. Since then I have enjoyed the Shantae games from the original to Pirates Curse.\n\nWhen I heard that Wayforward announced HGH via Kickstarter, I was hyped and managed to contribute to help make the game a reality a few years ago. Now I am aware Kickstarter has a bad rep. Many products there have been mediocre at best and a disaster at worst. However I am safe to say that despite waiting years for this game, I can announce that this game has not dissapointed me.\n\nFirst off, the leap from the pixel style to the cartoon-ish look was a great choice in the art direction. I know that some games tend to stick with the classic look like Sonic Mania. But this is a beautiful game. The animation is smooth and appealing to those who can appreciate 2d animation in games.\n\nThe soundtrack is on-point. Jake Kaufman has once again done a tremendous job with the music for the game. From the upbeat updated version of Scuttle Town to the catchy electro sound of Riskys Hideout, it definately gave me various earworms. Dance through the Danger by Cristina Vee is a great theme for the game and she did a great job at it.\n\nNow for the gameplay. HGH both feels like a Shantae game but at the same time doesn't. It has all the classic mechanics: upgrading hairwhip from the shop, unlocking dances that give you access to other areas, backtracking to get the items needed to progress. At the same time though, it feels a bit more streamlined than the other 3, they had the focus of exploring dungeons to progress the story. Here it goes for a more simpler approach, having a level select screen (taking a page from Pirate Curse) and getting from point A to B to beat the level. I personally don't take issue with this, but I know some who'd prefer the original style and might find it too easy.\n\nFortunately, Wayforward included a free update including Hardcore mode, I'm still having trouble getting through it as it makes you more cautious due to bein able to die much sooner so players wanting a challenge will likely enjoy that.\n\nSpeaking of additional content, with Pirate Queen Quest being the only one available at the moment with Friends till the End coming up, I really like this style of DLC, actually adding to the game rather than just giving a new weapon or a skin. It's an interesting concept, taking place at certain points in the original game and expanding on it.

That's how I feel about Half Genie Hero. Half Genie Hero doesn't stick to the classic formula of traversing through one open world, going through dungeons, and collecting the main mcguffins before the villain can get ahold of them. At first, this really made me skeptical of the game. I bought this game about a month ago, and I did get a lot of enjoyment out of it, for the first couple of playthroughs anyways. It was fun the first time because you don't really know where all the collectibles are, unless you're following a guide of some sort. Then by the time you replay the game, you really start to notice how tedious getting 100% completion is, how the majority of the side plots go absolutely nowhere, and ultimatly how simplistic the gameplay and story is, (providing you're not going after all the achievements of course). I don't think the main campaign is bad pre se, but it does make me miss how the original Shantae, Risky's Revenge, and Pirate's Curse was structured. It was a formula that worked, and with WayForward getting rid of that structure, this just left me wishing there was more to Shantae's campaign. I can only recommend this campaign for those who don't really care about getting all the achievements and beating all the modes because this game really drains you around the third or fourth playthrough.\n\nPirate Queen's Quest, on the other hand, is structured better and really gives you more of a sense of non-linear progression. I love how this mode automatically lets you choose which level you want to play, and I wish Shantae's campaign would've been structured similar to this. True, you can't get any of the pirate equipment in any order, but being able to choose the levels in any order really adds a depth of strategy similar to how the robot masters are handled in classic Mega Man games. Plus the Dark Magic skill tree is genius as well, letting you develop Risky as you see fit. Of course, part of the reason I like this mode is because you get to play as Risky, and Risky Boots is probably one of the most over-the-top villains in any video game franchise, hence why I love being able to play as her and see things through her perspective. \n\nFriends to the End, oh where to begin...\nFor starters, let me say what I think Wayforward did right. First and most importantly, they got rid of the hubworlds and world select. This is how I perfer Shantae; an open world with all the different areas connected together that contain plenty of secrets that can be found once you get the right tools and explore everything. Wayforward also made this mode linear, which works out with Bolo's, Sky's and Rottytop's gameplay. Each character has unique abilities at hand as well, which can make for some interesting puzzles. This is extremely noticable in the last world, where you play as each character seperate, with each character having their own set of challenges. Rottytops is extremely broken as well, since using her decapitation powers gives her brief invulnerability, (which is a Godsend for the Nega-Shantae battle). Now for the negative aspects. This mode is difficult for ALL the wrong reasons. All the characters share a health bar, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, EXCEPT Wayforward wants you to do a 3 heart run of the mode. In other words, your limited to 3 hearts, period. No heart holders to be found, no heart squids, just 3 hearts. Albiet Rottytop's can restore your health to full providing you have enough magic, but even then, if you don't have enough magic, then you have to be even more careful. It doesn't matter who you play as; none of these characters are built for combat.  This is especially noticable in boss fights such as the Giga Mermaid. I do like the Level Up system, but the least Wayforward could've done was made it to where all 3 members max health increases once someone levels up. Combine the poorly executed combat and the 3 heart run dibacle, and this mode will hand your butt to you on a silver platter on many occasions, especially when fighting the Giga Mermaid. As long as we're talking about rehashed assets, did Wayforward REALLY need to bring these bosses back? I don't look forward to Cape Crustacean or Hypno Baron's Castle because I can only imagine how much harder these bosses are going to be in this mode. I know people were complaining that both Shantae's and Risky's campaigns were relatively easy for a Shantae game, but this is how you make a game that's hard for all the wrong reasons. I want to praise this mode for the puzzle-platform aspects, but the combat could've used a lot more work. \n\nOverall, I don't think Half Genie Hero is a bad game. The main campaign and Friends to the End could've used a lot more work, as they are easily the most poorly executed parts of this game. And you know, it's sad that the only mode of this game that I really enjoy is Risky's campaign. I can see potential in Friends to the End, but the issues I've mentioned really makes me loath it more than I like it.

Shantae: Half-Genie Hero ist der vierte Teil der ebends genannten Shantae Reihe und es hat mir wirklich Spa\u00df gemacht.\n\nDas Gameplay setzt zwar keine neuen Ma\u00dfst\u00e4be, ist aber trotzdem verdammt gut. Es geht gut von der Hand und macht Spa\u00df. Das Platforming ist hervorragend. Nur wie sich Shantae an Harken fest h\u00e4lt, ist etwas fummelig.\n\nDie Story ist diesmal etwas anders, als in den vorherigen Teilen. Hier werden eine Reihe an Mini Episoden erz\u00e4hlt, die nur von einem kaum bis garnicht vorhandenen roten Faden zusammengehalten werden. \u00c4hnlich vergleichbar mit dem Storytelling aus dem Anime \"Devil May Cry\". Jede Episode ist eine Stage, die man alle nach und nach freischaltet und nach Abschluss nochmal besuchen kann, um die restlichen Secrets zu finden, sofern man die richtigen F\u00e4higkeiten dazu besitzt.\n\nBeim Look war ich anfangs etwas skeptisch. Ich bin allgemein kein gro\u00dfer Fan von Chibi (kleiner K\u00f6rper, gro\u00dfer Kopf), jedoch sieht es im fertigen Spiel wesentlich besser aus, als erwartet. Ich mags.\n\nDie Musik hat mich leider etwas ent\u00e4uscht. Versteht mich nicht falsch.

"english", "review": "I had tons of fun playing, replaying, beating the game on hard mode again and getting all the achievements.\nIt is pretty much all you want from a metroidvania and more.\nRevisiting areas with newly acquired power ups again while having a decent gameplay challenge, responsive movement and combat with good quick animations that don't freeze up your character for to long.\nThe platforming feels good and is not to much of a challenge but hard enough that it feels nice when you beat it and goes nice with the awesome soundtrack.\nThe music is awesome.\nThe quality of the sprites and the artwork of the game overall is great and better than older shantae games.\nI have to admit that I was a little sceptical from the still standing screenshots but it looks a lot better when its moving.\nThere was a very impressive amount of work put into the game and the humor is great if you like it but not annoying if you don't like it.\nI'm just sad that the crowdfunding goals for the bonus chapters wasn't met because I am really looking forward for another shantae game of this caliber.\nIf you liked other games of the series you can expect to like this one as well.\n\n\nOverall a great game and lots of fun to be had but in my opinion not as good as pirate's curse for a few little reasons in no particular order:\n\n- Many Transformations with mediocre to little purpose.\nFor me constantly transforming into something because the edge of the wall is a little bit to high up or there is a boulder that has to be taken care off or there is a space in the wall that is only 1 tile wide is not that great.\nMany of the transformations were also kinda useless except for that metaphorically x shaped hole it was designed to fit through (I'm talking about the first left and bottom, second left and right transformations here).\nI would have loved better combat with the transformations but the attacks and slow and all in all they suck for normal combat.\nI loved pirate's curse powerups because it would just let me use them in many situations without interrupting the flow or it would at least let me puzzle a little with the boots which in my opinion is a better solution then standing still for a few seconds to climb a wall even if the transformations are super cute.\n\n\n- Wall and ceilingspikes are not as forgiving.\nWhen you barely touch them (at corners not touching them at all) and its back to the beginning for you which is just not as fun as pirate's curse spikes that you have to get more than 1 pixel of your sprite into to actually be resetted to the start of the screen.\nAt least spikes are very rare except in the last level which is hard but in no way as hard as pirate's curse last level but pushed my annoyence level 300 times harder anyways because I DIDN'T TOUCH THESE SPIKES MAN!\nI stood on top of a platform once that had spikes on the wall BELOW and transformed into something wider and I immediately counted as impaled even though there should be no way I was in, on or touching a spike in any way which only happened once but left me questioning the game obviously.\n\n\n- More farming.\nWhen I did the speed archivements I had to farm so god damn much even with smashing all pots in all levels when clearing them for the first time and on all revisits because there are now dances you can buy, the spells got more expensive and the upgrades increased in price too which left me with a boring ass farm session of farming a whooping 2000 rupees.\nThis is not to much of a problem on a normal playthrough.\n\n\n- First and second fire spells are still very situational and got nerfed together with pikeball for some reason (I didn't use cloudpuff because it's to much of a bother for me to use). \nThe only point in the game where I would ever use it for normal combat is in the earlier levels on hard mode which is very hard to solve without using some sort of ranged attack in the first level because enemies are so tanky and deal very high damage and you don't have healing items at that point.\nI just don't get why we can't have a fire ball that deals 5 or even 6 damage with a faster fire rate because I need to invest magic and money after all.\n\n\n- Bosses are meh gameplaywise.\nThey are fun to beat on the first playthrough because they look and feel amazing but they are just repeating their phases so fast.\nSecond boss was the most creative but the chasing attacks are a little annoying to deal with or you just ignore it and chugg healing items.\nI don't want to say to much about the bosses because I don't want spoil them because they are good enough and still enjoyable.\n\n\n- Lacking options.\nCould use seperate sliders for sound and music, windowed options and more.\nMore options are always good.\n\n\n- Pirate's queen's quest feels weird.\nLevels got redesigned to be beatable without the transformations or any of the pirate items because you can choose the order you go through them.\nAt the beginning they are quite difficult but extremely easy once you acquire a certain amount of upgrade points and Items because your movement options increase but the levels stay the same.\nI would have liked a similar achivement for clearing the mode with collecting all upgrade points but not using them like pirate's curse heart squid saver achivement.\nI still recommend getting it if you like to play more of the game but be warned the bosses are the same except for the final boss obviously.\n\n\nOverall this is still a very good game in my book with a strong 9 out of 10 even if I had so many little things to nitpick about it and with so little text about me liking the game.\nThe core gameplay is still great and it's just so obvious why it's good that I don't need to talk to much about it but I am an idiot who keeps comparing games with each other and thats what I did and pirates curse is better in my opinion with a 9,5 out of 10.",

The formula is different this time around, but the same Shantae feel is there more than ever.\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\nAs always, the music is fantastic.  In fact, I would go as far to say that this is the best soundtrack in the series.  Absolutely phenomenal.  And of course, it wouldn't be Shantae without the humor as I've found myself laughing at it's silliness.  Although I'm a sucker for pixel graphics, the change to a semi 3D/2D cel shaded graphic art style was very pleasing to the eye.  Its colorful, and alot of detail was put into character, level design, and animation.  Everything felt smooth.  \n\nThis is where WayForward changes things up a bit with the formula, Half-Genie Hero insteads goes the route of something akin to Mega Man, where this time you play through a level and less of the Metroidvania layout.  Now, I will always prefer the Metroidvania approach for this series, however despite the change to it's structure, it's still very much a solid platformer and I did not mind the change at all. \n\nOne gripe I've always had with the Shantae series was it's difficulty, in that every game was on the Easy side.  The initial reviews for this game all seem to point towards the same issue at release.  I firmly believe the best way to play this game is on Hard mode.  Yes, it was frustrating at first, and yes I died a lot.  But it was incredibly challenging when it came to platforming and bosses.  Magic and the animal transformations where crucial for me to survive.   However, the more upgrades you get/find, it does mitigate the difficulty later on so Hard mode doesn't stay frustrating for long.  \n\n[b]The Not So Good:[/b]\nThe manner you acquired new dances felt rushed.  Whereas the other games you happened on some fountain/genie/whatever that teaches you a dance, it was absent here.  Is it minor?  Yeah, probably, but I very much missed stumbling on some set piece to get a new dance.  \n\nYou will revisit the same areas again and again to progress the storyline.  For me, this wasn't a huge deal, as I loved going back to listen to the music and appreciate level design.  But for others, I can see this as getting tedious.  There where a couple of quests where I had to farm an item from a certain enemy, and again to me, felt rushed and unimaginative.  \n\nThere are no dungeons/labrynths in this one,  and I very much wished they included them.  Yeah, each level is great and well done, but it doesn't beat stumbling on a labyrnth in the open world.\n\nHard mode, although great, sometimes felt cheap.  Very early on in the game, enemies will one shot you and the enemy placement can be incredibly aggravating.  Sometimes, in order for me to survive through a level, I had to farm for items/hearts/magic jars.  Again, to me, not a big deal but a deal breaker for others.\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]\nWhat a fantastic game, truly a great platformer.  Despite it's flaws, I was willing to overlook them because of the carefully crafted game WayForward put together.  If you are a fan of  sidescroller/platformer/Metroidvania/whatever genre, pick this one up.  I think you'll enjoy it.\n\nAfter playing all of Shantae games, this is how I would rate each series:\n\n1) The Pirate's Curse\n2) Shantae (GBC)\n3) Half-Genie Hero\n4) Risky's Revenge", "timestamp_created": 1507235055, "timestamp_updated": 1507235311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35503232": {"recommendationid": "35503232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105681347", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514454624}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u82e6\u624b\u306a\u4eba\u9593\u306b\u3082\u512a\u3057\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1507234470, "timestamp_updated": 1507234470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35500415": {"recommendationid": "35500415", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990032787", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509807127}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc0e8\ud14c\ud574\uc8fc\uc2ed\uc0ac\uc774\uc5b4\uc778", "timestamp_created": 1507225021, "timestamp_updated": 1507225021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692893", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35481318": {"recommendationid": "35481318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158318823", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507153376}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Debo decir que no he jugado los Shantae anteriores, este es mi primer.

From the onset of the Kickstarter campaign, it was evident that the direction would not adhere to past titles. The newly cell-shaded rendition of Shantae by way of Inti Creates, to the level structure mirroring Mario land, to seeing my favorite character Rotty make it as a playable DLC long after the initial campaign had ended, WayForward had planted the seal of innovation into our expectations well before the conception of stage 2. It was a risk Wayforward took, as if in search of a breakout. I do think it will pan wonders, because features like expansion packs, variable art styles and level progression, and fan-selected palettes, can become mainstay ingredients for creating newer, fresher titles set in the diverse land of Sequin. \n\n[b]Plot[/b]\n\nSimplicity is an effective staple of Shantae\u2019s romp through Sequin. Deeply asleep, a voice calls out to Shantae, sending her underground of Scuttle Town where a mysterious apparition further lends to the confusion. Shantae is a confident half-genie, but at times most confusing, family have often been her crutch. Believing that her uncle could elucidate the oddity, she visits him which serves as the tipping point for the entire journey. This begins with witnessing a tinkerbat and Risky herself stealing Uncle\u2019s newest blueprint: the Dynamo.\n\nUncle later tells her that the Dynamo [i]parts[/i] mustn\u2019t fall within evil\u2019s grasp. Fueled by her recent firing for failed safekeeping of Scuttle Town, she embarks on a transformative quest, most introspective, and every bit set on proving the mayor wrong, to regain her uncle\u2019s lifework and in the process, possibly learn of that nighttime apparition. \n\n[b]Gameplay/Performance[/b]\n\nThe game ran smoothly for the entirety of my 100% run which lasted just shy of ten hours. Parallax scrolling in the new cell-shaded, 2.5-D render style forced me to gawk from time-to-time and take a few harpy arrows while screenshotting the scenery. The diversity in monster design was on par with what we\u2019ve come to expect. The team went all out with transformations in terms of capacity and aesthetics. Please don\u2019t tell me the siren isn\u2019t cute. Swoons.\n\nBoss fights were a mixed-bag. Most of them fell in one try from my platforming awareness, but I can see newer Half-Genies and those playing the genre for the first time stumbling across a hitch or two as they try to analyze patterns and gimmicks to defeat these two\u2014three phase giants. As I mentioned earlier, the levels now have a beginning and an end and are selected via a world map. Thank you Sky! This is a huge divergence from the open world style of past titles, but in all honesty, it did not make the game feel any less \u2018Shantae.\u2019\n\nThis game also felt more fetch-quest driven than prior titles, especially when compared to the fast-moving Pirate\u2019s Curse, though most of Pirate\u2019s speed was derivative of the sword dash exploit and hover+cannon runs. Regardless, this game is slower in movement relative to Pirate\u2019s Curse, however, much faster than the first two games. This speed difference thus necessitates the constant use of transformations ie monkey, harpy, etc. A veteran would implement these in a heartbeat for speed runs and be left with the envious quandary of choosing which to use for optimization.\n\nSome screen tears were also present depending on the graphics card used, particularly Nvidia GTX 1050/1080, however, scouring the forums helped me in addressing most level 1 issues I encountered. Integrated graphics worked extremely well at 60 fps, granted needing the newer generation, higher end varieties. Vertical Synching is available and window adjustments are plentiful.\n\nI was also pleased to see fan-selected palettes and the gallery selections. Moments like those is why we back games despite not knowing what awaits us. Good, bad, sometimes trust is necessary to gain something. \n\n[b]Tunes[/b]\n\nThere was not a track I found mundane or jarring. The overall selection was more bass heavy this time around, if not more electric. Christina Vee\u2019s vocals starts the game right and the final boss\u2019 theme was comparable to Pirate\u2019s Curse true-final boss\u2019 theme. Unfortunately, I cannot state my favorites given the nature of how stages are unlocked, but trust me when I say it\u2019s upbeat fun. \n\n[b]Magical[/b]\n\nLooking back, Shantae Half-Genie Hero was as much a game about Shantae seeking answers on her own as it was WayForward discovering a new direction. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much between everything\u2014too symbolically even\u2014but I feel that there is a lesson to be had on aggregate: the Kickstarter campaign, the continued donations post-campaign via PayPal, the initial reception, to everything new about the game, along with the slew of Sequin-bound expansion packs. None of it would have been possible without effort, and adversity had served the catalyst for Shantae\u2014both in-game and the developed product, which resembles most development cycles of fan-funded titles. Needless to say, something beautiful and worthy of a genie\u2019s wish was in fact discovered when WayForward decided to take the risk in making Half-Genie Hero. \n\nThank you WayForward~", "timestamp_created": 1506488119, "timestamp_updated": 1506494835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619341", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35232991": {"recommendationid": "35232991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186421957", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499460242}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Cumple con lo que promete, si te llama la atencion, compralo", "timestamp_created": 1506473654, "timestamp_updated": 1506473654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35193232": {"recommendationid": "35193232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256088680", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506369105}, "language": "english", "review": "why do I have to actually type out a review can't I just give it a thumbs up and say I like it", "timestamp_created": 1506297922, "timestamp_updated": 1506297922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35174965": {"recommendationid": "35174965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282685406", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1515687479}, "language": "schinese", "review": "3dm\u51fa\u7684\u6c49\u53162.0\u7248\uff08\u5305\u542bDLC\u6d77\u76d7\u5973\u738b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\nhttps://pan.baidu.com/s/1bpvs0LT\n----------------------------------------------------\n\u6e38\u620f\u53ea\u73a9\u4e86\u534a\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u624b\u67c4Y\u952ebug\u2014\u2014\u8df3\u821e\u76f4\u63a5\u62a5\u9519\u95ea\u9000\uff0c\u65e0\u5948\u627e\u4e86\u4e2a\u76d7\u7248\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u5168\u6536\u96c6\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1506243222, "timestamp_updated": 1508395117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35124045": {"recommendationid": "35124045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134759431", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506097105}, "language": "english", "review": "Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a fantastic game, very fun and enjoyable. The platforming is great and the gameplay is well designed. The artsyle took some getting used to, but it quickly grew on me.

There's a lot of different dances, but there's no balance whatsoever between how often you use them. Some are overused, and some others are used so rarely it's easy to forget they are there. The Spider Dance, for example, which I think is great in concept, is only required once in the entire game, and that's if you're going for 100%. The levels just aren't designed to fit its gameplay, and that's a real shame.\nAlso, I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to make the last stage a Flappy Bird minigame, but it was frustrating and I hated it.\nAll of that might be nitpicking, but I feel like giving some more thought to the level and puzzle design so they fit better would have made this the best Shantae game by far.\n\nSo, is this game worth it?

The music is brilliant,  the art is amazing, the gameplay remains reminiscent of earlier titles in the series, and it's a great game for all ages to enjoy. Shantae has always been a bit of a Metroidvania with its vast levels and open exploration possibilities that encourage you to come back when you've picked up some powerups in order to unlock more of an area, and this game does not detract from that feature, giving much more to work with on the PC platform. \n\nPersonally, I recommend this game, but the reason I gave this a thumbs-down is because WayForward also stole all the money that I invested into this game through Kickstarter without giving me any rewards other than the lowest tiers of pledge prizes. They were also not interested in fixing their error despite my reaching out to them on the issue, and I have to say that as someone who enjoys this series, I feel violated and betrayed for handing this company cash, and will never play their games or buy any of their products again.\n\nPlay the game.

I'm going to borrow from one of the other reviewers and call this game a \"tech demo\". If you played Shantae and the Pirate's Curse you'll understand what I mean in this review.\n\nMost of the game is too easy and even the tricky parts are not a problem because the game gives you too many items and purchasable upgrades to prevent damage, restore heath/magic, and even if you manage to die there are dozens of save checkpoints everywhere now (and they're annoying full screen save dialogs between areas).\n\nThe lack of an open world that forces you to revisit the levels wouldn't be a problem if some of them weren't uninspired and puzzle-free levels you just run around to collect objects while replaying them several times when you unlock a new power-up that lets you access an area you couldn't before. The fact this will give you more gems to buy the shop upgrades that make the game even easier makes matters worse and later it becomes pointless with a new travel feature.\n\nIt feels weird getting transformation dances and magic powers from chests, it kinda breaks the immersion or sense of belief and for the devs to not think about it is lazy and unexpected because in the first Shantae game a genie would appear and teach you magic stuff with some special effects as far as I can remember.\n\nThe story is an excuse to get you around collecting \"nonsensical\" items for random NPCs instead of things that have a connection of sorts with events. There's a funny item I won't spoil but that's it basically. Compare that with Pirate's Curse events where every thing you collect is related to the story and you have to think which character you need to give the item to and the obvious difference of experience shows.\n\nI was disappointed to not having seen a magic carpet race minigame or something like Run Rottytops Run from the previous game. The mouse mechanics would do a great puzzle element but there's only a simple one thorough the game. Lots of lost opportunity. :(\nI recommend the other games in the series instead.", "timestamp_created": 1504652657, "timestamp_updated": 1507866828, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536065", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34686850": {"recommendationid": "34686850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118682405", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504407636}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u6700\u9ad8", "timestamp_created": 1504363059, "timestamp_updated": 1504363059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34660107": {"recommendationid": "34660107", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981980615", "num_games_owned": 1377, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513167560}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game if you like classic 2d platformers.

upgrade to it's previous sequels.\nThe songs in the game are quite rememberable and so are the characters.\n\nThe boss stages in 1/2 Hero are that they really aren't like the previous Sequels, there's no thinking of how to get the opportunity, no use for the Transformations to take it down, it pretty much doesn't let you take on what you've been using to get through the stage, and use it against a Boss fight, It's more of a \"Bash em till they are done\" stratergy.\n\nThe voice acting and overall quality of the game is outstanding, the Sound is crisp, the Music is amazing and the little bit of detail in characters are honestly amazing. This is one thing which alot of games fail to do and is have a sort of Mood scene music, which 1/2 hero does extremely well.\n\n+Excellent Music which is rememberable\n+Upgrades from the sequels are Impressive\n\n-Stages fall a bit too short\n-Bosses aren't very well thought", "timestamp_created": 1503806026, "timestamp_updated": 1503806026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34483358": {"recommendationid": "34483358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012009969", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513128629}, "language": "english", "review": "The penultimate culmination of the franchise!

Its amazing how they can make controls clunky when they had so many buttons unused.\n\nEverything in this game feels lazy, rushed and half-assed, and while i love WayForward games (especially shantae 2 and duck takes remake) this one feels almost as bad as their Blood Rayne betrayal. I think they are working on way too many projects nowadays and dont put their souls in their games anymore.\n\nThe only thing that devs can do now to please betrayed fans of what Shantae supposed to be - make a Shantae Trilogy ramake with assets from this abomination and yet with gameplay of previous game (however 3rd game was not that good as well, but at least it was way better than this one, it kinda was mixed between 2 and 4).\n\nDamn it, i really want huge maze levels like it used to be in Shantae 2, i want backtracking... i want puzzles, i want a lot of conversations with other charactes and i want adventure\\quest genre elements that was vital part of Shantae 2 and was dumbed down in 3 and almost completely gone in 4 Half Genie Hero :-(", "timestamp_created": 1502186428, "timestamp_updated": 1502186428, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.310759", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34095048": {"recommendationid": "34095048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146322996", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504145274}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is nice.

Tuttavia Shantae Half Genie Hero fallisce ad impressionare i giocatori, specialmente i pi\u00f9 appassionati della serie, consegnando un gioco dall'identit\u00e0 confusa e evidenti carenze nel gameplay e nel rinomato backtracking, componente fondamentale dei giochi di questo tipo, i metroidvania.\n\nIl pi\u00f9 grande cambiamento di questo capitolo \u00e8 senza dubbio la nuova predisposizione stage by stage in opposizione al mondo aperto dei metroidvania che facilita il backtracking e permette un esplorazione pi\u00f9 profonda e soddisfacente. Ovviamente questo non sarebbe un problema se il gioco, essendo strutturato livello per livello, cominciasse e finisse pezzo per pezzo senza dover tornare nei livelli passati. Shantae Half Genie Hero sbaglia nel porsi a met\u00e0 fra uno stage by stage e un metroidvania nel senso che: i livelli iniziano e finiscono ma bisogna tornare pi\u00f9 volte in questi per prendere oggetti e ulteriori abilit\u00e0 necessari per tornare nei livelli passati e scoprire delle sezioni nascoste. Essendo dunque uno stage by stage la mappa \u00e8 sparita e questo \u00e8 decisamente un grosso difetto per un gioco che si dovrebbe basare sul backtracking e l'esplorazione in generale. Per sicurezza, per chi ha intenzione di ispezionare ogni cm del livello (come questo tipo di giochi richiede), i giocatori, a meno che non abbiano una memoria di ferro, sono costretti a ripetere pi\u00f9 e pi\u00f9 volte intere sezioni dei livelli passati con le nuove abilit\u00e0, sempre se queste siano quelle adatte per scoprire le parti nascoste del livello; spesso e volentieri il  backtracking pu\u00f2 risultare inutile e spesso si finisce per lasciare un livello gi\u00e0 esplorato senza aver concluso niente. Parlando di queste sezioni nascoste, queste sono minuscole e non danno alcuna soddisfazione tipica dei metroidvania, appunto lo scoprire un intero \"livello nel livello\", cosa che i precedenti giochi consegnavano perfettamente. Il level design \u00e8 ok ma per la sua non linearit\u00e0, sempre per via dell'assenza della mappa, sar\u00e0 sempre arduo capire dove si \u00e8 stati e dove serve andare sopratutto durante le fasi di backtracking. Sarebbero dei buoni livelli se questi fossero esplorati una sola volta, invece bisogna tornare troppe volte e, spesso e volentieri, anche odiare certe sezioni. Se gli sviluppatori avessero seguito solamente il sistema stage by stage avremmo avuto sicuramente pi\u00f9 livelli con gimmick diverse e probabilmente una longevit\u00e0 generale maggiore, ma invece ci troviamo solamente con pochi stage che siamo costretti a rigocare pi\u00f9 e pi\u00f9 volte e che restringono la durata del gioco. A tal prosito il gioco produce un ritmo veramente poco originale e tedioso: completa il livello, ottieni una nuova trasformazione, recupera un oggetto e/o abilit\u00e0 e/o trasformazione dal livello passato, ottieni una mappa per un nuovo livello  (mappa che serve solo a Sky per volare fin l\u00ec, voi, ovviamente, non potrete consultarla!), completa un nuovo livello, ottieni la nuova trasformazione, torna nei livelli passati a cercare nuovi oggetti/abilit\u00e0/trasformazione, ottieni la mappa, vai in un nuovo livello e cos\u00ec via... Sempre per via di tutti questi backtracking Shantae sar\u00e0 piena di trasformazioni poco diverse fra loro rendendo molte di queste veramente poco originali e superflue; ad esempio la trasformazione in arpia e quella di pipistrello che fondamentalmente fanno la stessa identica cosa ma da pipistrello puoi volare solo a destra e sinistra con precisione, da arpia puoi volare in ogni direzione ma in maniera disordinata e poco adatta nelle situazioni che richiedono precisione. Insomma, tante trasformazioni per gimmick nei livelli poco originali e che ci costano solo tempo e pazienza per rivisitarle.\n\nIl gioco impressiona tantissimo invece sotto la veste grafica, curatissimi gli sprites senza la minima visibilit\u00e0 dei pixels, animati perfettamente senza la minima sbavatura e bellissime le ambientazioni 3D che danno sfondo alle avventura della nostra cara mezzo-genio. La musica non \u00e8 niente male, molto upbeat, ci sono molti vecchi temi tanti quanti nuovi temi anche se a volte questi ultimi contengono molto spesso il tema principale. La storia \u00e8 graziosa ma \u00e8 molto simile ai pi\u00f9 belli Shantae e Shantae: Risky's revenge. Dopo Shantae and the Pirate Curse mi aspettavo un qualcosa tanto quanto originale se non di pi\u00f9 e invece qui, in termini di storia cos\u00ec come in termini di gameplay, si fa un passo indietro e si semplifica il tutto senza riuscirci. Mantenuto invece lo humor tipico della serie, a tratti demenziale e a tratti persino velatamente sconcio ma a questo punto \u00e8 veramente una goccia in un oceano.\n\nUn vero peccato per questa serie che negli ultimi anni ci ha stupito con titoli veramente validi in grado di ottenere ottime recensioni e annoverarsi fra i migliori titoli del genere metroidvania. Shantae Half Genie Hero \u00e8 probabilmente un gioco per i fan della serie e che hanno gi\u00e0 giocato a Risky's Revenge e Pirate Curse, giusto per aggiungerlo alla loro collezione e provarlo. Per chi vuole cominciare a cimentarsi con la serie targata Wayforward, Shantae Half Genie hero non \u00e8 certamente un gioco con la quale iniziare, non ha quelle cose che hanno fatto grandi i titoli precedenti e finirebbero per avere un idea sbagliata di cosa sia questa serie. Magari forse \u00e8 un po' pi\u00f9 adatta ai casual gamers senza aspettative n\u00e9 alte n\u00e9 basse o a un pap\u00e0 che vuole comprare un gioco grazioso per il proprio figlio ma i pi\u00f9 appassionati troverebbero questo gioco poco originale e con parecchi difetti.

The controls are simple but refined, the visuals are gorgeous, the music is catchy as all hell and the game knows what it's aiming for - pure, unadulterated fun!\n\nThe overall look is vibrant and crisp, the aesthetics are fantastic as always and the character design manage to be fun and sexy without crossing the line into sexualised. Shantae herself of course mostly wears her genie's outfit (a.k.a a bunch of ribbons with delusions of grandeur) and the mermaid's wear little more than seashells, but you're not going to find any panty shots or gratuitous boob close-ups here. \n\n\nRR and PC were a little more open-worldy, even metroidvania-esque at times, but while HH has a simpler level structure you're unlikely to ever get lost, with a couple of artifacts available from the get-go that let you duck in an out of levels as needed. The dancing transformations make a return and while they'll never be a seamless as the Pirate's Curse controls they're very well streamlined, especially the dancing.\n\nStory-wise it's an odd mix, being something of a soft reboot. Basically they've kept all the stuff that's useful (Shantae good, Risky bad, Rotty misunderstood and her brothers aren't trying to kill you)  but there's sadly no trace of the surprising depth given to Risky or her relationship with Shantae in Pirate's Curse. Maybe these things will be re-explored in a sequel but for now it's a little more black-and-white.\n\nIn any case, great fun, highly recommended and bonus points for bringing in Christina Vee on the

reassure this.\n1/2 Genie Hero was... a step backwards.\nIt was still fun, but... It wasn't as good as the Pirate's Curse AND it had too much infuriating moments sprinkled throughout the game, ESPECIALLY FINAL LEVEL.\nGOD I HATE FINAL LEVEL.\nI HATE IT AS MUCH AS I HATE RISKY'S REVENGE FINAL LEVEL.\nsigh.\nHalf-Genie Hero is still a great game, i had a lot of fun, i like it very much.\nBut it wasn't as good, as The Pirate's Curse. A little but of a letdown.\nStill, i will recommend it to... well, pretty much everyone. Especially considering the fact that it has not much connections with previous titles, it can be you first or your latest Shantae title and it won't matter at all, unlike \"The Pirate's Curse\", which was heavily connected to Risky's Revenge, and vice versa.\nBuy it, you PROBABLY won't regret it.\nWayForward deserve our money.", "timestamp_created": 1501582334, "timestamp_updated": 1501582334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487651", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33940147": {"recommendationid": "33940147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348771543", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512971025}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encant\u00f3, es muy entretenido.

Unlike the pixxelated art style in the previous Shantae games, this time the game has this more cartoonish art style which isn't half bad. The character movements and the world feels more alive.\n\nThat leads to the 2nd noticable difference, which is the world itself. In the previous games, you had this semi-open world that you could explore once you obtained powers to do so. There's no such thing in the Half-Genie Hero, but instead the world is diveded into stages/worlds. Each stage/world has several areas lined after each other that you can explore and at the end of each world there's a boss waiting for you. Once you defeat that, the world is cleared and you can move on to next one. Its kinda similar to how the islands worked in the Pirate's Curse, but this time they have this \"super mario\" feeling in them. It's just not the same as it was in the previous Shantae games, which is kinda disappointing for me. I would have preferred the semi-open world like the Risky's Revenge had.\n\nUnlike in the previous Shantae games, the Half-Genie Hero doesn't have any dungeons either, which is mostly because of how those stages/worlds wokr that I mentioned earlier.\n\nOther than that, the game is pretty much the same old Shantae games that we're used to.\n\nPros:\n+ Improved art style\n+ Familiar gameplay mechanics with few additions mixed in\n+ Entertaining 2D platformer\n+ Bigger variety of different abilities\n\nCons:\n- Semi-open world replaced with stages/worlds\n- No dungeons\n- Save points way too often, which means that dying is no longer punishing as the game asks you every 2-3 minutes if you want to save your progress  (why couldn't they just implement auto save instead if they didn't want people to feel punished for dying, though personally I hate auto saves if they save your progress like that )\n- The Soundtrack isn't as good as it is in the previous titles - The OST is similar but too...modern.. if you could call it that. Didn't enjoy it personally\n\nDo I recommend?\nYes. Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is entertaining 2D platformer and it continues the story where the Pirate's Curse left on. I have to warn you though, the game is not as good as its predecessors are, because of the stage/world system.\n\nVerdict:  6.5 / 10 - Good game  (though not as good as its predecessors are because of the stage system)", "timestamp_created": 1500140355, "timestamp_updated": 1500371119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33544807": {"recommendationid": "33544807", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961565212", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512959355}, "language": "english", "review": "I love these games.

I believe they used this money well to improve the game both visually and audibly. I have not ever played Pirates Curse, and so this will not be a comparison between the two.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n\n[b]Fantastic Visuals[/b]\nHalf Genie Hero got a serious visual update compared to other Shantae games, and it really pays off. With smooth 60 FPS animation, the game is stunning to behold and has detailed backgrounds often with many things going on in them as well (If you wait long enough in Mermaid Falls Factory, Bolo passes by on a hook with a fish attached to his head). This visual improvement ensures that people who are deterred from older pixelated graphics won't miss out on the classic Shantae character and platforming appeal.\n\n[b]Catchy Music[/b]\nWhile on the topic of visuals and audio, the soundtrack to Half Genie Hero is AMAZING, easily some of the best platforming music I've heard in ages. All of the tracks bring back memories of Sonic the Hedgehog and other 80s - 2000s platforming classics with that catchy beat and backing tunes. They all have their own unique appeal and their greatest strength is a lack of weakness. Even the worst of the music in the game is still good, while the best can get stuck in your head for days.\n\n[b]Lack of Boring Dialogue[/b]\nThe characters may not have much in the way of dialogue variety, but what they do have is very good. Each conversation is full of personality, which may be further amplified if you have played all the previous Shantae games and already know all these characters. My only complaint is that there isn't much dialogue at all, most of the game is obviously focused on the platforming aspect.\n\nNow, down to the real stuff. \n[b]Tight Gameplay[/b]\nThe gameplay is phenomenal. Shantae handles very well, as all Platformers should, and any damage I took was usually my own fault for not avoiding or predicting what I knew was already there. There are only a few jumps and sections where Shantae's handling comes into question, but these are small parts of the overall game and do not take away from the experience.\n\n[b]Revisiting Areas is Actually Fun[/b]\nShantae plays sort of like an old Metroid game, where visiting old areas is highly encouraged. By gaining new transformations and abilities, whenever Shantae goes back to a level there is always something new to explore or unlock. This exploration is always rewarded with useful transformations and items (Except for the two useless crystal items, but I digress). For people who love to discover new secrets, this is definitely a plus. If you are not a big fan of constant back tracking, that's a shame, but the the incredible visuals and music may just make it more tolerable than you would think.\n\n[b]Good Enemy Diversity[/b]\nThe enemies have a good diversity to them in the levels, and while many of them are similar (mechanically) all of them feel well-suited to the areas they belong in. Some enemies have unique traits and abilities that must be figured out first before defeating them, which is a good challenge to have during the rest of the gameplay. It doesn't suffer from \"Mario Enemy Syndrome\", where every enemy is only a threat by walking at you in a slightly different way. No one enemy feels unbalanced, ensuring that every area is enjoyable and unique.\n\n[b]Bosses are an Enjoyable Spectacle[/b]\nAll the bosses in the game are a blast to fight, with their own mechanics and tricks to figure out much like some of the unique enemies. Each one presents its own challenge, and while some are easy others are fairly challenging to juggle around without the help of magic. Each boss was something to look forward to at the end of a level, like the topping on a cake.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\nUnfortunately, as will all games, Shantae is not all flowers and butterflies. It has its own share of problems.\n\n[b]Way Too Easy:[/b]\nThe base game in Half Genie Hero is easy with even moderate platforming skill. Enemies are predictable (As are most platformer enemies) and can be killed easily with practice. This is made so easy to the point of being almost impossible to die with the use of magic and the Magic Tiara, which can turn you invincible, do massive damage, and cheese the final escape section. However, those seeking a challenge can attempt Hard Core Mode, which gives a massive boost to enemy damage, attack speed, adds more mobs, and boosts boss AI. Hard Core Mode is a good challenge, albiet a little TOO challenging at time. But what do you expect? It's called Hard Core Mode, not Slightly Harder Mode.\n\n[b]Massive Difficulty Spike in the Final Level[/b]\nThe final level of Half Genie Hero ramps the difficulty up tenfold, and it cannot be reduced through spells like most other areas can. There is a flying section that requires precise control of the Harpy transformation, which at the best of times handles like a hyperactive dog on roller skates. This is followed by an escape level with very questionable hitboxes on vital handholds, leading to potentially numerous frustrating deaths. This final escape can be easily cheesed by using magic, however. All I can really say is to hang in there and do your best!\n\n[b]Underwhelming Final Boss[/b]\nWhile I won't spoil it for those that care, the final boss is possibly the easiest boss in the game, made even easier if you found the Harpy Talon item while backtracking. It's not a deal breaker, but it makes the ending slightly less satisfying than it could have been. This one is a minor gripe, the boss is still fun to fight.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAll in all, while it has its negatives, Shantae: Half Genie Hero is certainly worth the buy. There is even more DLC on the horizon, with Risky Boots herself being playable with a full campagin in the near future. It's worth the full price, and especially worth it if on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1499849657, "timestamp_updated": 1499849782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576923", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33463037": {"recommendationid": "33463037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132956015", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499799192}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9\u6709\u8da3  \u524d\u4e09\u95dc\u8d85\u7d55\u91cd\u8907\u5229\u7528\n\u96d6\u7136\u6709\u9ede\u77ed\u4f46\u662f\u6bcf\u500b\u5834\u9762\u90fd\u5f88\u7528\u5fc3\n\u6bd4\u9ea5\u63d0\u4e5d\u865f\u597d\u73a9\u53c8\u7cbe\u7f8e\u591a\u4e86\n\u5e79\u4f60\u7a3b\u8239 \u5b78\u5b78\u4eba\u5bb6\u600e\u9ebc\u505a\u6a6b\u5411\u5377\u8ef8\u7684\u597d\u7206", "timestamp_created": 1499799863, "timestamp_updated": 1499799863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33459917": {"recommendationid": "33459917", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977053433", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499790484}, "language": "russian", "review": "Dissapointment.

Shantae series has always been a great platformer / metroidvania. The maps are well designed and fun to explore. And the feature which sets this game apart are the belly dances you aquire throughout the game which allow you to transform into adorable critters which give you unique abilities to navagate and access certain parts of the map. The writing is always fantastic, the dialogue between characters often has you laughing out loud as they always have quirky conversations.\n\nHalf-Genie Hero sees the series enter the HD generation. The 2D character art is gorgeously drawn and the levels are rendered in 3D which blend in seamlessly. The music is absolutely steller with each track fitting its respective level perfectly and are a joy to listen to. The game is also more of a reboot, so if you did not play the other games you will not be missing anything as there isn't a whole lot referencing the previous games.\n\nAll said and done, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a must play game. The series has always been one of my faves, and as somone who likes to attempt 100% completion without any help I got over 20+ hours of gameplay on my first blind playthrough not including any DLC. And if you are someone who wants a game to fly through, the game has the speed run element which awards you an achievement for beating the game in only a few hours, so this game is accomodating to multiple play styles.", "timestamp_created": 1499206189, "timestamp_updated": 1499206189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33249821": {"recommendationid": "33249821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120011147", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498430373}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc790\uccb4\ub294 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\ub9cc \uc77c\ubc18 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc640 \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\uc5b4 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \ub108\ubb34 \uc2ec\ud55c\uac8c \ub2e8\uc810 \uc77c\ubc18 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub294 \ub108\ubb34\uc27d\uace0 \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\uc5b4\ub294 \ub108\ubb34 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc870\uc808\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \ub290\ub08c....  \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0 \ubcc0\uc2e0\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub9c9\uc0c1 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294\uac74 \uba87\uac00\uc9c0\ubc16\uc5d0 \uc548\ub41c\ub2e4 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc801\uc778\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc57d\uac04 \uc560\ub4e4\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uce58\ud55c\uba74\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\uc678\uc5d0 \uc561\uc158\uc131\uacfc \uac8c\uc784\ub0b4 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc758 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub4f1\uc740 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub298\uc5b4 \ub1a8\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud558\ub294 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub85c \ub36e\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uc815\ub3c4 \ucd94\ucc9c\ucd94\ucc9c", "timestamp_created": 1499204457, "timestamp_updated": 1499204457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33245032": {"recommendationid": "33245032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061902266", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500727115}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game,\nit reminds me a lot about Wario Land: The Shake Dimension for some reason", "timestamp_created": 1499196665, "timestamp_updated": 1499196665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33222577": {"recommendationid": "33222577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062043104", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501417126}, "language": "japanese", "review": "cute kawaii\n\u7c21\u5358\u3059\u304e\u308b\u306e\u304c\u96e3\u70b9", "timestamp_created": 1499160234, "timestamp_updated": 1499160234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33215846": {"recommendationid": "33215846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259113817", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513413467}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u662f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5207\u6210\u65e5\u8bed\u5c31\u597d\u4e86\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u770b\u7684\u61c2\uff0c\u6069", "timestamp_created": 1499145645, "timestamp_updated": 1499145645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33209942": {"recommendationid": "33209942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287189455", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499018372}, "language": "english", "review": "Superb platformer with many collectibles and end game content to keep you coming back after the main campaign.

All the familiar characters are back, including a few new ones to keep the story fresh. The gameplay is back to basic; with the transformations being the main focus of travelling through the different levels to find hidden items or NPCs you need to talk to. Need I mention, the soundtrack is as great as ever! I find myself tapping Jake Kaufman's slick beats every time I hear the different themes of the levels and even some of the characters themes. The bosses are huge in scale this time, almost covering the entire screen. Overall, the game is pretty quirky its in character interractions/dialogues and man-- gotta love those vibrant colors!\n\nThe only downsides I can point out are the amount of backtracking you have to do, considering there's only a handful of levels. Normally, I don't backtracking an issue in Metroidvania-styled games, but the levels are way too short to have any sort of backtracking, only to find NPCs you need to talk so that they can give you an item to progress the story further. If the levels were bigger, I would've forgiven it, but I personally find it very tedious to go back to the same levels over and over again just to make sure you haven't missed a single thing. About the transformations; like I said, the level structure relies too much on them. It's much easier to travel once you obtained all of Shantae's transformations, but then again, it feels very tacky having to transform every second just to be able to land on that one platform you normally can't reach.\n\nOn a side note, it's not much of a criticism, but I just find it funny that the game is aware that their audience is very \"niche\". There always been hints of innuendos in the character dialogues or how the girl characters are skimpily dressed. It's easy for feminists to tear appart how the game portrays the women. But I think it's not worth judging a simple yet fun game like this that doesn't really offend anybody. It is what it is and I think it's great to have more female leads in gaming.\n\nAlright, I'm done rambling for now. I definitely recommend giving a try this short and sweet game that I'm sure you'll enjoy, especially if you're craving for more Metroidvania-styled games... and with a kickass soundtrack on top of that!", "timestamp_created": 1499110919, "timestamp_updated": 1499110919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33191064": {"recommendationid": "33191064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078388013", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514525593}, "language": "english", "review": "Shit is fucking adorable 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1499099186, "timestamp_updated": 1499099186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33180459": {"recommendationid": "33180459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277504441", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499082834}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost perfect platform/adventure 2D game.

But that's kinda my thing as I like to explore more of the part in the same level, especially if I liked the level as well. \nThe warp dance and wistle does help a lot to clear up too much unnecesary backtracking. Enough to also keep the exploration part.Which is really a relief for me sometimes.\n\nStory is a bit simple. It kinda reminded me of 'Totally Spies', Where you were doing normal things but were also interrupted by a mission to save the country. (Also with lotsa girls.)  It's not really deep, but good enough to enjoy it.\n\nAs far as fanservice goes, there are a lot of monster girls and a lot of monster girls transformation. All pretty unique, but a bit disappointing that you need the transformation only for one specific task. And sometimes they're only able to do that task and nothing else, not even attack. (although some of these can attack later, as upgrades to progress). It would be nice if there were less transformations but able to do more functions. A bit like Zelda: Majora's Mask. But maybe that a bit too much for a platformer.'\n\nIn comparison to the 'visual novel' appearance the game had in their 'Pirate's curse' installment, the game has gone a more unique way, and they don't cover half of the screen with a girl in a bra anymore. The picture is now smaller and more cornered, but it's still showing the same amount of body. It's in my view fitting for both the Visual Novel fans and for the people that aren't bothered by it. And I find that a good step.\n\nI think the only real issue I had is that the game seems to run slower on my laptop, there are little-to-none quality settings. So if your PC is bad, then I cannot recommend it.\n\nOverall, I'm really enjoying the game. The art, music and characters are amazing. Although the backtracking might have been a little too much in the earliest stages. But I really don't mind it as the game is really appealing. Compared with 'some' of the nightmare fuel the previous game had, I found this one much more bearable to enjoy too.\n\nA bit of the same statement as the previous game: \nIf you're looking for clever level design and difficulity, I think this game is too easy and backtracking.\nIf you're looking for great character design, level art designs and soundtrack (and monster girls).

This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, as new transformations make replaying levels legitimately interesting at first, but as you play more, the pace of the game starts really falling apart.\n\nYou gain new transformations after beating the boss of each level, so you're immediately unable to explore your new abilities unless you replay old levels, which you are forced to do because after every level you are handed a fetch quest to get the macguffin to lead to the next level. This gets old very quickly, especially when you have to go back to levels that you've already replayed once before, the warp dance and the whistle only speed this up so much. This gets more extreme when you find that your transformations aren't enough, and it's only after exploring for a while that you find an upgrade for your transformation to help you finish the fetch quest. Exploring on your own is also not very rewarding, because often you either run into a wall where you need a future transformation you don't have yet, or all you've managed to do is find a future macguffin before you were told to. This makes progression feel slow and awkward and ultimately nowhere near as fulfilling as past shantae games.\n\nOne other nitpick, the pacing in levels is sometimes off too, for example lazers, spikes, and pits won't just damage you, but also teleport you back to the start of a stage, so puzzles full of this obstacles don't just damage you, but also revert so much progress that getting back gets legitimately frustrating. I think if this issue alone was solved, the game overall might be much less frustrating to play through.\n\nOverall, if you want to get this game to experience the music and art, and are willing to bear with the poor pacing in gameplay, then go ahead.

I was so excited. You guys put so much effort into this, so I'm glad so many other people enjoy it. First off, the art is amazing of course, along with the voices. I'm just dissapointed the game went into a Sonic Adventure 2 Battle kinda style. I only went to the mermaid factory thing(I don't remember, I forgot to review this), but what I experienced was level after level, senseless traversal through some place, no sense of exploration. I'm such a big fan of the older games, so I really didn't like this one. \nTL;DR: If you like this stlye of game, get it. Really high quality. If you loved the experience of the older ones, it probably isn't your thing.", "timestamp_created": 1498545870, "timestamp_updated": 1498545870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Though is this a definitive version to play? Let's get Ret-2-Go!\nStory: In a dream, Shantae saw herself go into a cave underneath (or she thinks) Uncle Mimic's house. A voice explains that she's their only hope to the one that'll doom them all. The next morning, after getting a sneak peak of the Dynamo, Risky starts her attack immediately after a Tinkerbat stole the Dynamo Blueprints! As far as story goes, it's pretty simplistic by its accord and there are a lot of movie-quality cliches in this game. 7.5/10\nControls: Very much like Pirate's Curse, this relies on the arrow keys and zxcasd for the main controls. Still plays pretty solidly even on a keyboard, but it still pays to have a controller on hand. Back is the \"dreaded\" dancing and it's incorporated in a way similar to Risky's Revenge, though it was supposed to be like the original game's dancing mechanic in that enemies can interrupt you. Each creature plays relatively unique from one another and they control pretty great. 8.5/10\nGraphics: Out with the pixel-work and in with the chibi Flash style! To be fair, the graphics are still great even if they're relatively old, the characters still are themselves, the levels have their feel and beauty, and it's not hard to understand why they wanted to use this style in contrast to the pixelart style. 9/10\nSound: Music and Audio go here. As per usual, Jake Kaufman has done fantastic work in his music, and really, my only complaint has to be that he had to add in an electric guitar riff in an otherwise mostly techno-inspired music. (9.5/10) As well, there are more voice lines in the game, though those do vary in quality and volume, especially near the beginning. And as usual, the sounds connected to objects are still satisfying enough that it's a pleasure to continue. (8/10) Overall: 8.8/10\nOverall and mentions: This game, while good, is also close to unforgivingbly short, with side-quests placed in to make this otherwise short game feel much longer. However, while I do say that, I argue that it works in its own accord, especially when we have time sinks like Skyrim and Fallout in the area. The bosses are satisfactory enough, and it's challenging, though not impossible to get all the keys to the local Art Gallery. This game will get an 8.5/10, since while this game is not THE best of the Shantae series, it's far from being the worst, hell, every Shantae game is at or above an 8/10 for me and should get a little more attention, just not so much Capcom buys it out and whores it out.

I've played a little bit of Risky's Revenge but otherwise I was going into this blind. It's a very short game, six levels in total with some goodies to find in each one. However, I do remember that two of those levels were Kickstarter stretch goals. DLC. So that would put the main game at four levels discounting those two \"episodes\" that may be part of the main progression but honestly they just come out of nowhere in the storyline without any semblance of transition and once they're wrapped up that's it no one mentions them again. Story was nothing to write home about either. It's your standard Goody Two Shoes vs Supreme Badness black and white plot. Shantae learns of a great threat to the Genie Realm, promptly forgets as she helps her uncle build a machine, does some other hero stuff, then oh no Genie Realm is now in danger because the villain is trying to destroy everything for some unexplained reason.\n\nI found all the collectibles in this game, explored all the hidden areas, found all the dances, spells, items, etc. A big issue though is that the forms are either useless or only needed for one or two areas in the game then shove them in the box. There's 16 total dances (there's a damn BLOBFISH dance that does nothing) and you make use of three or four on a regular basis, mostly Monkey. There's also two that break the game open completely: Bat and Harpy. Bat lets you move horizontally as long as you don't have any obstacle. Harpy is free flight. In a platforming game this pretty much lets you cheese entire levels with some creative positioning.\n\nMy playtime clocked in at a little over 7 hours and I was taking my time. For a $20 game, though I did Kickstart it. This is a very, very, VERY short game and I honestly cannot recommend it at this price point. It doesn't feel cohesive in gameplay, story, or anything really. I'm actually disappointed I backed it. Supposedly it will eventually have a story where you play through as Risky Boots and others but they're not in yet so, what you see is what you get.", "timestamp_created": 1498184224,

classic transformation-based shantae play, and contains an *absurd* amount of them, including some special dances bought from a snake lady and a few promotional ones if you backed the game on kickstarter (hopefully if you didn't you at least also didn't back mighty no. 9...) \n\nthough the story lacks a bit and only serves to *raise more* questions than answer any presented in the past few

Not only did they make great use of the Metroidvania-style gameplay, but they also had very charming and memorable characters, interesting oriental-themed levels and great music. Half-Genie Hero is no exception here, I had a blast from beginning to end.\nOne of the problems of the older games was that the animal-transformations, one of Shantae's signature moves, take way too long and therefore hurt the pacing of the game. That problem has been totally fixed here, so playing through each of the very well designed levels feels totally fluid.\nI was a bit worried about the new graphic-style of the game, but after playing it for a while, it became totally natural to the point where it was actually hard to go back to the older games with their pixel-graphic. The soundtrack is also amazing, there's a lot of catchy tunes that fit the theme of the levels perfectly.\nHowever, there's still a few minor things I didn't enjoy. Firstly, the game got rid of any dungeons, which makes each level feel much more linear. Secondly, the story felt very disconnected. Each level basically had a mini-arc, but they weren't really connected in any way so the overall arc felt way too basic and undeveloped. And thirdly, there's really not a lot of levels here, namely 6 in total. And 2 out of these 6 levels were only included because certain Kickstarter-stretchgoals were met, which means the game was originally planned to only have 4 levels. Granted, all these levels are very big and you visit them multiple times to unlock new areas, but still. I hope the upcoming DLC will expand these levels in some way.\nDespite all these minor gripes, I still had a lot of fun with the game, and I can encourage everyone to try it.

And this newest entry to the series is no exception. \n\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero is a great game in many aspects. The visuals are stunning. The vibrant colors and the cartoony art style really brings the world of Shantae to life, as you explore the variety of areas that Shantae must traverse on her quest, from a waterfall inhabited by mermaids, to the ruins of a desert town and a spooky old castle. \nThe soundtrack also contributes to bringing the world of Shantae to life, with a bunch of funky and catchy tunes (with a hint of Middle-Eastern inspiration here and there) that wouldn't be out of place in old-school Mega Man or Sonic the Hedgehog games. \nSpeaking of retro 2D platformers, the gameplay of the Shantae series as a whole can be described as a sort of hybrid of Mega Man and Metroidvania-style games.  This particular entry however is much more Mega Man than Metroidvania, eschewing the dungeons and largely open 2D world in favor of action stages, where you start at one end and finish on the other.\n\nManuevering through each level while beating up any bad guys along the way is the name of the game here. To help her combat the fiendish foes she'll encounter, Shantae can either do her good old hair whipping (I wonder what kind of shampoo and/or conditioner she uses to get her hair that strong), or use magic abilities like fireballs or summoning flying scimitars or thunder clouds. Transformations have made their comeback, being absent in Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, and are used to help traverse the world. Need to climb a wall? Transform into a monkey and do some acrobatics. Need to break down a wall? Transform into an elephant and smash your way through. Need to go for a swim? Transform into a crab or mermaid and dive in. Some areas of each level can't be accessed until you acquire transformations found later in the game, so you have to re-visist each level at least a couple of times to find all the items and achieve 100% completion (and at few points, also to progress the story). \n\nMy only real complaint about Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is that I wish it were longer. Yeah, you can unlock \"Hero Mode\", in which you have all of Shantae's main transformations available from the start, which is a great boon to speedrunners, and  \nthere's \"Hardcore Mode\", which as the name suggests, increases the difficulty. These two do give the game some replay value. I just wish the main adventure wasn't as short, that there were more areas to explore and such. . \n\nAll in all, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is not a game that revolutionizes the platformer genre, but it doesn't need to.

So much wasted time. So you'll be playing the same five levels over and over, not counting the times you're playing a level you shouldn't be.

Si dans l'ensemble, j'ai appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 ce jeu, il risquera cependant de souffrir d'une in\u00e9vitable comparaison avec ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs.\n\nL'histoire du jeu reste en toute somme classique : la suite \"pas tout \u00e0 fait\" directe de \"The Pirate's Curse\", Shantae devra faire face \u00e0 une nouvelle menace sur son monde, mais aussi sur le royaume des g\u00e9nies, et dont elle seule est capable de sauver. Cela nous am\u00e8nera \u00e0 retrouver quelques personnages phares, mais aussi des nouveaux pr\u00e9sentant un r\u00f4le influen\u00e7ant le d\u00e9roulement du jeu. A noter que ce dernier, en \u00e9vitant de d\u00e9voiler son contenu, poss\u00e8de deux fins : il faudra remplir certaines conditions afin de les obtenir.\nPar ailleurs, si vous disposez de connaissances assez limit\u00e9es dans la langue anglaise, je vous conseille de passer votre chemin : la traduction fran\u00e7aise r\u00e9alis\u00e9e est d'une qualit\u00e9 plus que douteuse. Avec un choix de mots inappropri\u00e9 et une lecture parfois incompr\u00e9hensible des dialogues (\"Back to your old tricks\" chang\u00e9 en \"De retour \u00e0 tes vieilles astuces\" ?), vous passerez certainement plus de temps \u00e0 vous creuser les m\u00e9ninges qu'\u00e0 suivre l'histoire et comprendre son humour pourtant tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9sent, celui-ci \u00e9tant bourr\u00e9 de jeux de mots amusants et de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences plut\u00f4t r\u00e9serv\u00e9es \u00e0 un public \u00e2g\u00e9 (notamment lors de la premi\u00e8re rencontre avec Risky Boots).\n\nLes graphismes restent superbes et dans le style du jeu. L'ajout de textures 3D est ici une nouveaut\u00e9, puisque les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents \u00e9taient int\u00e9gralement sur un plan. S'ils ont en d\u00e9rout\u00e9s plus d'un, ce ne fut pas mon cas : j'ai m\u00eame trouv\u00e9 que \u00e7a permettait de renouveler le style qui \u00e9tait globalement rest\u00e9 le m\u00eame entre \"Risky's Revenge\" et \"The Pirate's Curse\", \u00e0 l'exception de celui des personnages dans les cin\u00e9matiques. J'ai par contre des r\u00e9serves sur ce dernier point, o\u00f9 l'aspect \"oriental\" originel de la s\u00e9rie eut, j'ai l'impression, tendance \u00e0 se rapprocher davantage de celui \"manga\".\n\nLa bande-son est \u00e9galement dans le th\u00e8me du jeu, avec quelques morceaux tir\u00e9s des anciens volets et remix\u00e9s pour l'occasion, et s'accorde parfaitement \u00e0 chaque situation et environnement dans lesquels nous nous situons. Le choix de n'inclure que quelques phrases parl\u00e9es dans les dialogues ne m'a pas g\u00ean\u00e9 en soi : cela permet d'\u00e9viter de trop se concentrer sur la narration, et de laisser au joueur le rythme qu'il souhaite avoir. Si je trouve la chanson phare de ce volet tr\u00e8s sympathique (\"Dance Through The Danger\"), je regrette cependant son int\u00e9gration dans le jeu, qui vient casser l'ambiance qui a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'alors instrumentale.\n\nEn termes de jouabilit\u00e9, le jeu reste proche des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents volets : il s'agira de d\u00e9placer le personnage de Shantae, la faire interagir avec les autres personnages et de se servir de ses cheveux comme \"arme principale\". Vous devrez parcourir des niveaux et affronter des boss, pour pouvoir obtenir de nouvelles transformations et progresser dans votre partie. Le principe de la transformation a d'ailleurs \u00e9volu\u00e9 : au lieu de r\u00e9aliser certains pas de danse, nous devons seulement appuyer sur le bouton ad\u00e9quat, puis par le biais d'un \u00e9cran de s\u00e9lection, choisir celle que nous souhaitons. C'est un changement qui n'est pas forc\u00e9ment g\u00eanant, mais qui r\u00e9duit la quantit\u00e9 d'animations propos\u00e9e auparavant.\n\nSi l'environnement du jeu se construisait autrefois comme une carte g\u00e9ante o\u00f9 l'on pouvait se d\u00e9placer librement pour atteindre ses objectifs, les niveaux pr\u00e9sents dans le jeu sont cette fois-ci con\u00e7us de fa\u00e7on plus courte et de fa\u00e7on lin\u00e9aire : nous avons un point de d\u00e9part, et devons atteindre une arriv\u00e9e. Cela permettra \u00e0 certains joueurs de moins se perdre en les parcourant, mais aussi de les terminer plus rapidement. De plus, le jeu vous proposera des items vous permettant de naviguer dans les zones sans avoir \u00e0 les parcourir, le rendant du coup plus simple, et accessible au public le moins patient. Comme pour les volets pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, une fois que vous avez affront\u00e9 un boss, il vous sera impossible de l'affronter une deuxi\u00e8me fois. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien d'avoir un mode suppl\u00e9mentaire, genre une fois le jeu termin\u00e9, o\u00f9 l'on puisse de nouveau affronter le boss de son choix.\nSi vous avez jou\u00e9 \u00e0 l'un des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents volets, et aviez jug\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rents allers-retours longs et r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs, attendez-vous \u00e0 les voir revenir ici : il vous sera n\u00e9cessaire de revenir dans certains niveaux pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer des items inaccessibles tant que vous n'avez pas acquis certaines transformations. Si jamais vous s\u00e9chez, les personnages dans la ville de \"Scuttle Town\" vous seront d'une grande aide (parfois un peu trop ?) pour avancer dans votre partie.\n\nConcernant la dur\u00e9e de vie, le jeu ne propose, pour son mode principal, qu'une difficult\u00e9 unique et assez peu \u00e9lev\u00e9e, le mode \"Hardcore\" ajout\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment \u00e9tant d'un tout autre niveau (j'ai d\u00e9croch\u00e9 au bout de 8%). L'ayant termin\u00e9 en 8-9 heures \u00e0 100% (avec tous les items \u00e0 trouver et \u00e0 acheter), soit un poil plus court que \"The Pirate's Curse\", le jeu pourra vous proposer ensuite un mode H\u00e9ro reprenant l'histoire du jeu et certaines des transformations acquises durant la partie : la difficult\u00e9 \u00e9tant cependant la m\u00eame, je ne saurais vous le conseiller, sauf si vous appr\u00e9ciez faire des speedruns. D'autres modes de jeu ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9s dans de futurs DLCs, et pourront tr\u00e8s certainement augmenter le potentiel que le jeu dispose d\u00e9j\u00e0 en mati\u00e8re de gameplay.\n\nAu final, je pense que ce jeu m\u00e9rite le coup d'oeil, mais s'adressera d'abord aux fans de la premi\u00e8re heure. Sachant qu'il ne poss\u00e8de pas de liens directs avec \"The Pirate's Curse\", et constitue en soi une nouvelle histoire, il sera tout \u00e0 fait possible pour une personne n'ayant jamais jou\u00e9 \u00e0 l'un des volets pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de commencer avec celui-ci, ce que je d\u00e9conseille fortement puisque la saga \"Shantae\" poss\u00e8de son univers, o\u00f9 chaque jeu la composant apporte son lot d'innovations avec la p\u00e9riode durant laquelle il est sorti.

Absolutely, but you know what else is good? Pirate's curse and compared to that game, half-genie hero Is a pretty big downgrade. Quickly stating the positive, the gameplay is still relatively nice, the writing is still dumb in a good way and the new visuals are beautiful. After that it's just a downhill slide, mostly because after the pirate equipment in pirate's curse this game returns to the animal transformations. (Spoilers: they still suck) not only are the transformations slower and pace breaking compared to the pirate equipment they're also useless for the most part. Apart from the Harpy, mermaid, monkey and maybe the elephant the transformations are either trophy fodder or just plain worthless and it feels so boring and sluggish when you have to constantly alter between different forms. The game also has the usual problem of unnecessary backtracking which is an issue in every game in the series but in here it's worse. The game is also pretty damn easy and you can quickly get pretty OP items, only for the game to give you a large difficulty spike in the final level because that's fun. And the final boss...jeez. the pirate master was an amazing final boss and was very challenging. This games final boss is a joke if anything, just like every other boss in this game. \nNow I'll say this again, half-genie hero is a good game. Nothing special but I enjoyed it a little bit.

A competent platformer full of fun characters, humor, and music along with an absolutely adorable art style, I can definitely recommend Half-Genie Hero, along with the rest of the series... especially Pirate's Curse.\n\nThe gameplay is a level-based platformer with some seemingly token Metroidvania aspects, but continues the Shantae series's trend of moving away from a \"true\" Metroidvania style. Instead of complex levels as seen in previous titles, levels are now standard left-to-right platforming stages where you move through 2-3 areas and end with a boss. Metroidvania aspects come in when you have to repeat levels with new lock-and-key transformations (and unlockable powers for them) to find 'hidden' areas to collect collectibles for various NPCs or new abilities. This leads to the gameplay \"loop\" of doing a few new levels, getting to a plot roadblock, and backtracking to solve it.\n\nThe world of Shantae does, however, make up its merely good-but-not-great gameplay. It's hard to not have fun in the colorful world filled with its genuinely likeable characters, humor, and music. As a entry-point into the series, you meet most, if not all, of the series's cast of characters and the humor isn't too reliant on referential in-jokes.\n\nPerhaps the most disappointing thing I can say about the game was the fact it was a Kickstarter game with more ideas than they hit stretch goals for, and it shows. Some characters are introduced and summarily dealt with in an incredibly unsatisfying manner, especially with a late-game *lack* of boss battle that can only be truly described as a \"blue ballsing most foul\" when it's presented and solved in the span of one cutscene.\n\nIn the end, I can still recommend Half-Genie Hero and would recommend you try Pirate's Curse if you enjoy the world, which is the best part of every game in the series.", "timestamp_created": 1492976307, "timestamp_updated": 1492976307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31280611": {"recommendationid": "31280611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092964214", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495241197}, "language": "english", "review": "tity", "timestamp_created": 1492798737, "timestamp_updated": 1492798737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463777", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31236180": {"recommendationid": "31236180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059069494", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502528199}, "language": "french", "review": "Jeu coup de coeur de l'ann\u00e9e pour moi. \nJeu de plate forme bien rythm\u00e9.

LOL\n\nAt the time of this review, I only finished the Shantae Main Mode on Steam.\n\nABOUT:\nShantae embarks on her first full HD adventure! When a mysterious crime wave sweeps Sequin Land, it\u2019s up to Half-Genie Hero Shantae to save the day! Use Shantae\u2019s devastating Hair-Whip Attack to send monsters flying, or Belly Dance to transform her into more powerful forms! Topple the masterminds behind each criminal caper and prepare for the ultimate showdown against Shantae\u2019s arch nemesis - the bodacious buccaneer Risky Boots!\n\nVISUAL:\nThe visuals are strikingly beautiful and the animations are amazingly smooth! No one can shake their booty as smoothly as Shantae can! EVERYTHING is so beautifully designed, I actually tried to Google Image search to see if there's any other side scroller games that can even match this game visually. There are none. Seriously, the way this game look, it can make Nintendo jealous.\n\nEven though it looks visually nice, I'm surprised by how much they lack fanservices. Shantae games are known to be very fanservice-y.\n\nI really wish the KickStarter reach the Animated Cutscenes stretch goal. It would've been really amazing seeing all these wonderful to see and hear characters act, rather than them standing around and talking in text boxes.\n\nAUDIO:\nAside from Dance Through The Danger (https://youtu.be/71lLnE8gJnU) which is an absolutely amazing song by the awesome Cristina Vee, the other soundtracks range from catchy to just okay. They range from what sounds like an elevator music, to something that sounds like it belongs in the first level of a current gen Donkey Kong game, and service their purpose really well. You'll be able to recognize where those tracks are from, but they not good enough to get stuck in your head for hours.\n\nDue to not reaching the specific stretch goal, the game isn't fully voice acted. Like Shantae And The Pirate's Curse, only a handful of lines are voice acted, and most of them belong to Shantae and Riskyboots. It's actually quite sad, really. All those quietness could've been filled with Cristina Vee's amazing voice-acting.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nA 2D side-scroller game where you use various magic and items to help you solve puzzels and find hiddle treasures.\n\nThere's also a couple of fast-travel features that help the player travel from area to another with relative ease. It was a welcomed innovation for the series because helps so much with the back-tracking, and you get them very early and very easily! Screw collecting warp squids! Give me the Bird Whistle and the Warp Dance!\n\nThere's a couple of magic/items felt like they exist for only like one or two uses, and they won't be used ever again. They're almost pointless.\n\nDIFFICULTY:\nOut of all the Shantae games, this is easily the easiest one of the bunch. Unlike other Shantae games, it very forgiving. I only used like 3 potions through the entire game, and it was because I ran out of Magic, not Health. This caused me to max out the amount of gems I can carry, after purchasing every item in game, at around the half-way point. But it's not to say that this game is completely easy. The last area can really make you rage if you haven't mastered all of Shantae's animal forms.\n\nGAMEPLAY LENGTH:\nIt took me around almost 12 hours to complete the Shantae Main Mode with 100% Completion, and that includes the times I spent revisiting areas and looked all over the places for hidden treasures to achieve 100% Completion. It'd be a lot shorter if it was a speed run.\n\nThere's also Shantae Hero Mode that unlocks after playing Shantae Main Mode, and possibly a Riskyboots Mode that I haven't unlock yet.\n\nThe player can also replay the game as Rottytops, Bolo or Sky in their own storyline!\nSo yeah, lots of gameplay value in this game.\n\nVERDICT\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero is actually a really good and fun game. Yes, it does feel like it is lacking a few things that could've make it perfect, but I honestly can't blame WayForward for that since those missing things are the stretch goals that they never reach. Their KickStarter campaign was up around the same time as Mighty No. 9, and most people either just support MN9 only, and/or being really hateful towards Shantae for some reason, maybe because they're being pro-MN9 at the time. For what Shantae: Half-Genie Hero turned out to be with what WayForward got from crowdfunding, unlike Comcept, WayForward delivered in spades, and for only USD19.99 too! I can say that it's better than Shovel Knight, I highly recommend this game to anyone!", "timestamp_created": 1491178831, "timestamp_updated": 1491178877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30900808": {"recommendationid": "30900808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056798052", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511524342}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n- Beautiful art style.\n- Good humour.\n- Great platforming.\n- Brilliant music.\n\nCons:\n- Uninteresting story.\n- Not challenging enough.\n- Some transformations are redundant.\n\nIf you wanna watch my full review, check out my video review of this game:\nhttps://youtu.be/Q9B7iCXEWz4", "timestamp_created": 1491138604, "timestamp_updated": 1491138604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481366", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30900475": {"recommendationid": "30900475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076661282", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492843593}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed playing the game.

You'll do lots of backtracking as there are tons of secrets that require advanced abilities to get through.

The reason why I love this game is that it has fun really fun platforming style of gameplay and the transformation sequence is back from the first and Shantae: Risky's Revenge. The graphics and animation in this game really beautiful I could just really look at all the amazing work done in this game. The gameplay has that charm the WayForward is known for making. Another thing I love about this game is the Relics you can get to upgrade Shantae such as the Shampoo's to make your hair stronger, the Silky Cream's to make your whip faster, Scmitar to summon swords to protect you. and many other Relics. I also love how this game requires exploring in some stages.

Half-Genie Hero has more in common with Megaman than it does with its previous entries in the Shantae Series, while trying to hold to its original roots, and somewhat failing at it. \n\nWhere HGH succeeds the most at is in its fidelity. This game is really colourful, the animations are bouncy and lively, it's just very pleasant to look at. The soundtrack is really good too, however, I do find it to sound REALLY flat due to its really high volume. After downloading several soundtracks from the composer, Jake Kaufman, that seems to be an ongoing issue with his masterings. So if the game sounds too loud when you first start it up, it might catch you off guard and I defnitely recommend lowering your volume.\n\nWhen it comes to being a sequel, the game improves a few things from it's closer sibling, Risky's Revenge, is the dancing system and overall powerups. The new system implemented in this one works better as you only have to press the dance button and then choose which transformation you want by pressing a direction. It works well and if you think it's too slow, you can even get a powerup to make the dance faster. In fact, HGH is probably the fastest feeling entry so far thanks to its responsiveness.\n\nProbably my personal favorite part of the game when it comes to gameplay are the first four stages... when played linearly. They are quick, action-packed and are quite fun to traverse with fun bosses (Except for the last two...).\n\nThe first part where game falls apart to me when they want you to backtrack to stages to get specific items. It wouldn't be a huge issue if the stages introduced new things but they just don't. The ''new paths'' are usually one or two rooms, which more often than not, will either be coursed through in less than a minute, or are big and open with nothing in them, just to pad things out. It gets really monotous to since you have to do exactly that, several times in a row to even progress to the next stage.\n\nThe second part is actualy the final third of the game. The stages feel unfinished, with even less original set pieces, hazards, especially when two key characters are haphazardly placed in the second to last stage, with no introduction. In fact, a lot of characters in HGH are completely forgetable and have barely to no development at all and when the game ends, it really feels unsatisfying. Now if you factor the rather dull design, and combine what is essentially the game breaking transformation, the Harpie, you get a final stage that is insultingly easy. Why? The stage was designed for you to take advantage of a couple of transformations. The Issue? The harpy can fly over the majority of them. There were only two counts where I switched to the monkey. This makes some rather elaborate traps completely useless.\n\nThe final boss and endings are not much better. First, my game crashed once when I defeated the first phase of the boss. Second, I skipped the cutscene as the fade to black was still on the screen, leaving it black and making the fight impossible (I've encountered several glitches so far, some worse than others). Third, if I am either regular Shantae, Mermaid Shantae or Harpie Shantae, the background of the second phase will never rotate like it should and screw with the movement of the boss' attacks. FOURTH, the final phase has an attack that circles the whole arena, and it makes no sound effects. If it does, I can't hear it. It also blends with all the other assets during the fight due to their colours. FIFTH, the endings are almost identical, regardless if you get the ''best'' or ''regular'' ending. It's  just not satisfying at all and feels slapped together.\n\nThe final slap in the face to me from this game, is the fact the DLC will have to be paid for non-backers. Considering how barebones the game felt, along with the lackluster two final stages AND the full price of this game, I flatout cannot consider even getting the DLC. I feel like they should have been part of the game ''and the price'' from the very start.\n\nIf Shantae Half Genie Hero was not forcing mandatory exploration and padding and was more like Megaman, as its stages are clearly focused on being much more linear than the areas from the previous entries of the series, this would be so much better. However, as it stands, and WITHOUT THE DLC AND AT FULL price. I can't really recommend this game unless you're a die hard fan. If you want a significantly better experience, go get Shantae and The Pirate's Curse.\n\nIf the DLC releases and they have a bundle for the launch price of the game and cut the standalone game's price, then it might be worth checking out.

Dando el salto al mundo HD, Shantae se enfrenta a una nueva aventura para detener a Risky Boots una vez m\u00e1s, del dominio del mundo.\n\nComo es caracter\u00edstico de esta saga, es un Metroidvania, es decir, plataformeo con eliminaci\u00f3n de enemigos y rejugabilidad de niveles asegurada gracias a las nuevas habilidades y movimientos que vas obteniendo a lo largo del juego, lo cual va haciendo el juego muy entretenido y te fomenta e incita a investigar los niveles, lo cual consegu\u00edan los otros y lo cual en mi propio caso es muy bueno por que no he sido nunca, NUNCA de rebuscar objetos en los niveles, y aqu\u00ed estoy que me lo he pasado al 100% por que, entre la investigaci\u00f3n y b\u00fasqueda en los niveles es primero divertida y segundo, gracias al movimiento que responde a la perfecci\u00f3n, y un dise\u00f1o de niveles que es perfecto, hace que la jugabilidad sea algo muy disfrutable en este juego y muy satisfactoria. Tambi\u00e9n es menester comentar que gr\u00e1ficamente es un juego, precioso, animaciones muy bonitas y vivas, y el sountrack, como viene siendo costumbre ya, viene a cargo de Jake \"no se cuantas veces voy a decir esto pero te com\u00eda las bolas\" Kaufman, que hace que este soundtrack sea genial y me vaya a llevar tarareando y canturreando las canciones y temas de este juego durante meses. Y por cierto joder que bonita es Dance Through the Danger co\u00f1o la primera vez que la escuch\u00e9 me ech\u00e9 a llorar como un poseso de lo bonita que es.\n\nAhora, en comparaci\u00f3n con las antiguas entregas, el nivel de dificultad, al menos en el modo normal, jugando como Shantae pelada y mondada, es considerablemente bajo en comparaci\u00f3n. No te resultar\u00e1 dificil llegar a cierto punto en el que estar\u00e1s muy roto y en vez de pasarte los niveles parece que le haces bullying a los niveles de lo roto que vas lo cual, es algo un poquito triste sinceramente. Pero justo hace tres d\u00edas a fecha de 9 de marzo de 2017, los desarrolladores lanzaron la primera actualizaci\u00f3n a este t\u00edtulo con, aparte de bugfixing, introdujeron un poquito m\u00e1s de contenido, es decir, el modo Hardcore. En pocas palabras, cuando empiezas el modo Hardcore, entran ocho negros en bolas con bates de b\u00e9isbol de pinchos en tu habitaci\u00f3n y la mitad te violan y la otra mitad de apalean, haciendo turnos entre los que apalean y violan. [b]Es el desaf\u00edo que este juego necesitaba, Y ME ENCANTA.[/b] Vaya, en el primer nivel me qued\u00e9 af\u00f3nico de lo que me estaba cagando en todo, por que en comparaci\u00f3n al modo normal que el primer nivel es un paseo, en el modo Hardcore puedes tranquilamente morir unas 15-20 veces si est\u00e1s acostumbrado a jugar a este juego ya, que yo ya me he pasado dos veces este juego, as\u00ed que, si eres nuevo en esta saga y nunca has jugado, y te gustan los desaf\u00edos bien complicados, te recomiendo que empieces directamente al modo Hardcore, junto a un t\u00e9 o cualquier bebida relajante y una pelotita de estr\u00e9s.\n\nPero, es necesario que comente esto. Este juego est\u00e1 completamente traducido al espa\u00f1ol, junto a una serie de idiomas m\u00e1s. Si sabes ingl\u00e9s y no quieres que los ojos te lloren, por favor, en tu biblioteca, ve a las propiedades de este juego y en la pesta\u00f1a Idioma, ponlo en Ingl\u00e9s. La traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol que tiene este juego es [b]INACEPTABLE[/b]. Hay una infinidad de faltas ortogr\u00e1ficas, de errores a la hora de referise al sexo de otro personaje, de incoherencia en las frases, de todo. Es un puto desastre de traducci\u00f3n. En los cr\u00e9ditos aparece que las traducciones corr\u00edan a cargo de una empresa llamada DYS. Pues qu\u00e9 quieres que te diga, pero yo, he cogido y he descomprimido el archivo pak de localizaci\u00f3n, he cogido una linea de texto en ingl\u00e9s, me he ido a puto Google Translate, lo he pegado, y ha salido exactamente lo mismo. WayFoward, t\u00edo, os la han pegado esos t\u00edos, [b]que ten\u00e9is un juego lanzado con traducciones de Google Translate[/b], que os devuelvan el dinero de todos los patrocinadores y que os han donado dinero. Mirad, os hago una oferta: me propongo a traducir este juego. Gratis. No quiero un puto duro. Solo quiero que este juego tenga la traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol que se [b]MERECE[/b]. Lo hago por amor al arte y por amor a la saga. En serio.\n\nEn resumidas cuentas a to este tocho: es un juegazo, jugabilidad excelente, si quer\u00e9is un desaf\u00edo lanz\u00e1os al modo Hardcore y si sois unos casuals po id con el modo normal y si sabes ingl\u00e9s y quieres enterarte de algo de la historia c\u00e1mbiale el idioma a Ingl\u00e9s en Steam por que hasta lo que cago es mejor que la traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol de este juego.

I beat it on both normal and Hero mode. The level, item, character design are amazing. The transformations are great and they lay the puzzles out pretty well. But the problem is that I breezed through the game, it was way too easy! But now that Hardcore mode has come out it feels hard and I can actually die to minions now! Before Hardcore mode I only ever died to environmental hazards. I never died to Bosses either.\n\nI never really do reviews but I feel like this game deserves it, because even if it was easy it was just that enjoyable. If you have never played the newest installment in the series and are thinking of buying it. Definitely! But if you do and want an actual challenge then go for Hardcore mode right off the bat.

Please hear me out.\n\nThe game is way too easy. You quickly become ridiculously overpowered. After less than half through the game I didn't even care about taking damage. You practically never run out of hearts, and if you happen to be close to death you have lots of potions, magic, pickups, and food to restore health. You can turn off the upgrades that you've acquired, but that should NEVER be required to make the game sufficiently challenging. Really bad game design.\n\n[b]Edit: People are talking about a hardcore mode. But that doesn't justify that the \"normal\" mode feels like beginner difficulty, especially since the previous games were really hard in their normal mode.[/b]\n\nThe story is very forgettable. The plot progression is very often ridiculous, as the developers couldn't come up with believable ways to acquire key items. It just feels very rushed.\n\nThe humor isn't at as funny as it was in previous games.\n\nWay too many transformations. Some of them are really boring, and some of them are almost never used apart from that one single stage you acquired them at.\n\nThe charming pixel art is gone. It was one of the things that made the Shantae series stand apart from other platformer games, but now even that is gone.\n\nNot really the hardcore metroidvania style from the previous games. Really easy to acess the hidden areas.\n\nVery easy boss fights. Very easy platforming. No charming characters. The game is very short.\n\nReally bland game.

While not quite as good as Pirate's Curse, it offers snappy controls, plenty of movement and combat options, and a solid (if episodic) storyline with the series' trademark adorable pitch-dark humor.\n\nShantae herself controls as wonderfully as always. Once again possessed of her genie powers, she learns transformations from each stage or from hidden items. Most of them, such as the elephant (which can crush blocks) and the mermaid (which can swim freely underwater) are primarily movement-focused, and open up new areas of each stage.\n\nAh, yes ... stages. And therein lies the only problem with Shantae: Half-Genie Hero. In previous games of the series, Shantae would travel across the land, face a number of challenges, and then open up a dungeon for exploration. These dungeons were very much in the Metroidvania tradition, and navigating them successfully was the game's primary intellectual challenge.\n\nIn Half-Genie Hero, the dungeons have been removed entirely; at the point in each stage when you'd be unlocking them, you go directly to the boss fight instead. The stages are mostly slightly longer than before, but not really enough to make up for the loss. A couple of them -- Main Street and a late-game castle -- remain downright puny.\n\nThis makes the game's other negative more serious: the amount of BACKTRACKING. In the previous games, you mostly returned to old areas to seek out power-ups like life bar powerups or caches of treasure. While those are still here, some of the stages have little corners and nooks that contain MANDATORY items, including a transformation without which you can't even enter the last level! It honestly seems like you're intended to replay every stage to date whenever you get a new movement ability, or else take an amount of notes on obstacles that would put a JRPG to shame. (And even that wouldn't help in a couple of places -- I only found two crucial items by exhaustive searching.)\n\nAll of this shouldn't put you off the game, though. Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is linear, sure, but you'll still get many hours of sweet gameplay for your admission fee. It's absolutely worth the price, even if it doesn't quite live up to its immediate predecessor.", "timestamp_created": 1488078853, "timestamp_updated": 1488078853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30180765": {"recommendationid": "30180765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160466369", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514591777}, "language": "english", "review": "So this is my third time reviewing this game. This update includes the DLC Risky Mode and Firends Forever.\nPros of Orginal:\nGood music\nGood graphics and animations\nWhen there is voice acting it sounds good\nLevels have many secrets\nGameplay wasn't too hard or easy (for the most part)\nSmooth controls\n\nCons of Orginal:\nStory is very lacking and feels rushed at points\nRisky is pure evil despite what happened in the last game (Pirate's curse)\nLevels were short and linear\nDifficulty spikes because of different mechanics (such as the slide or using transformations for difficult sections)\n\nOveral fixes:\nUnderwater mines now show explosion effect (No longer causing confusion)\nHypno Baron's castle can no longer be flown over at the outside area (at least in hardcore mode, not sure about orginal)\nand some other small fixes I can't think of at the moment\n\nHardcore Pros:\nEnemies are actually a threat and take more damage while doing more damage (although some enemies do way too much in my opinion)\nEnemy attacks are faster and aim more for Shantae\nDeserves the name \"Hardcore mode\" \n\nHardcore Cons:\nEnemy placement can feel just jerkish and annoying\nThe amount of enemies is way too high\nSome enemies doing way too much damage for normal enemies\nBosses take too long at times or don't give you enough time to attack their weak points (Giga Mermaid is the worst in this case)\nThe first phase of the last boss has an instant kill attack (which is cheap not hard)\nRisky takes even longer to defeat (doesn't help that if you die on the last boss you have to face her again)\nThe difficulty spikes from the orginal feel even worse and I hated them\nIt made this game a bad experiance for me (I loved the orginal story a lot and made me a Shantae fan but this made me feel like crap and I didn't enjoy playing it)\n\nOverall I feel like people should play the orginal and should only play the hardcore if they're looking a for a big challenge, It's a shame that the hardcore mode changed my opnion of this game so much but it feels like it was made just to be hard, not to be fun or fair. I still like the game and I'm still looking forward to the other modes (like Risky mode or the other playable characters) but if they end up with that same difficulty I might take a pass. \nMy scores of this game are \nOrginal : 78/100\nHardcore: 60/100\n\nDLC Review\n\nRisky Mode\n\nPros: \nStages are made different and use Risky's skills to get through them. \nYou can do any stage in any order, makes for replayabilty and a change of pace.\nRisky is good to control and her abilites are fun and helpful.\nUpgrades to abilities that make them more useful. \nHard but fair.\n\nCons: \nStages use the same music and have some of the same collectable locations.\nThe Kraken ball is useless to upgrade.\nToo many buttons to press to do complex tricks needed to progress.\nSome bosses like Giga Mermaid last too long.\nHuge difficulty spike at the last level.\n\nFriends to the end\n\nPros: \nThree unique characters to play.\nLevel up system is cool and easy to handle.\nThe stages are changed up again.\nRetro music is used in stages that make the stages feel more unique to this dlc.\nEach character is fun and easy to control.\nLess button clutter.\n\nCons: \nCollectables are useless and just there for collection.\nBollo and Sky's dream magic abilites are almost useless.\nThere is no way to upgrade health or abilites making this debatably the hardest mode yet.\nBosses are very stressful as you only have three health.\nOnly one way to heal without finding hearts.\n\nIn the end I liked Shantae Half-Genie Hero.

Half-Genie hero looks very beautiful the art style, effects and characters look very colorful and its really pinnacle of 2.5D art if you ask me. I had very steady frame-rate during my play-through and i felt controls with (Xbox 360 controller) worked really well and smoothly, sadly there wasn\u2019t option for windowed mode in PC though (Very few optimization options in general).\n\nI enjoyed the music \u2013 there was couple remixed songs from older games, but i felt that lot of the map songs were too uptempo, which left me bit mixed feeling (I expand this more on the video).\n\nHowever the game is not that long really, if you don\u2019t count Risky Mode and Hero Mode, which unlock later. I had around 12-13 hours with Pirate\u2019s Curse, but with Half-Genie hero i had 93% item completion and it only took me less than 8 hours? I\u2019m not sure how i feel about that, i mean the game is priced at 20$ but then again ive played lot of Indie games with same price which were longer like Ori and the blind forest or Don\u2019t Starve. I Don\u2019t regret buying it, but i would recommend buying it from a sale or small discount at least especially if you are not going to do the game on Hero Mode or Risky Mode.\n", "timestamp_created": 1487853336, "timestamp_updated": 1487853336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546993", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30112707": {"recommendationid": "30112707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016158213", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488860672}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoy the Shantae Series, yet can't say this iteration is a step up. The only thing going for this game is the upgrade in graphics (Completely Objective) and that it continues the story for Shantae the character.\n\nThe story in this game was weak. It does however give a nod to what of the main characters mentioned before, and they did just that. ( Trying not to spoil the game here).\n\nThere are far more transformations in the games, which is nice. Say, we have 6 transformations in all, 3 would be base abilities, while the other 3 would be upgrades to those previous. Like a level 1 fireball that shoots 1 fireball to a level 2 fireball that shoots 2. Some transformations are oddly specific and have no other use to them.\n\nDances is what Shantae does, yet she does only one dance for all the transformations. Which was sad to see.... I liked where she had many dance moves (animations) when she would transform.\n\nIt seems art styles change with each game, and I am a huge fan of the Pirate Curse art the most. It had personality. I would blame transformations for taking up production time on making the conversation art better. \n\nPuzzles are nearly nonexistant, or way too easy. The game was fairly easy. I did not have to worry about dying due to lose of hearts, well, neither did I in the last game....\n\nThere is no map this time, and finding things was easy. Some items made the game too easy. You can turn them off if you think that would present a challenge. Then if thats the case, don't look for items.\n\nSadly, I would have rather played Pirates Curse again for the ingaging characters, side quests, and other such stuff.\n\nThe good part is that they made it easier for you to travel where you want faster with a travel dance and a whistle to travel from world to world. Save points arent the usual, where you find the guy and choose to save. Each section of a level requires you to make the choice. In case you die or are trying to do a certain achievement this shines. A Little.\n\nI still recommend this game. I wished I got wind of the Kickstarter so I could support them. I want them to continue making more Shantae games, but I think they need to look back at Pirates Curse, which I think to be the best of the series.\n\nPlatforming is really weak. I'm not sure if this game was trying to cater to some group that thought the platforming wasn't important. They even threw in a small castle level with those detestable magic doors that warp you all around.\n\nI feel the lack of funds and the over-ambition of making so many transformations has watered down the level design for puzzles and more animations for the characters has made this game not up to par.", "timestamp_created": 1487826232, "timestamp_updated": 1487826232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498878", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30093625": {"recommendationid": "30093625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199487425", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486752703}, "language": "english", "review": "This game succeeded everywhere that Mighty No. 2 could not.

I'm a gamer of over 25 years, and this game is simply AMAZING! New features: More direct level designs, a fresh \"2.5D\" graphics engine with HD support (4k+), AMAZING animation,  fun and memorable soundtrack you'll be humming all day long, and 10+ hours of gameplay. Super cute characters, PG-13 animated boobies on nearly everything, and nearly everything dances! Oh, and it's NOT a frustrating roguelike!\n\n\nLong review:\n\nGraphics: 10/10. Supports 4k+ resoutions. Beautifully animated (hand-drawn, not \"flash game\" type), \"2.5D\" graphics. Everything is bouncy, round, wiggly, jiggly, and FULL OF LIFE! Such talent and effort! Even the backgrounds are animated, every enemy, all the widgets, everything! If I could give an 11, I would! Thank you for raising the bar on what a modern platformer should look like!\n\nSound/music: 10/10. Beautiful, level-matching, custom soundtrack with loop points, an energetic song with vocals, fresh and original. A TON of effort was put into this soundtrack! Quality over quantity, every song is unique and very memorable! I LOVE THE SNARE IN MERMAID FALLS (a'la Sonic 2)!\n\nControls: 10/10. Accurate, precise, fast and responsive movements. Flawless and natural feeling with a gamepad! \n\nGameplay: 10/10. Everything in the game \"fits\" and has a purpose. The level design is top-notch, reminiscent of games of old; nearly every level is like an onion, with multiple layers depending on your current abilities. They're not too mazey, not frustrating, yet they're challenging and clever. FUN BOSSES that aren't too frustrating or difficult! You never really get tired of revisitng a level and searching for treasures unfound. The only notch off a perfect score is the transformation selection system: it's NOT BAD, don't get me wrong, I didn't DISLIKE it, but it felt a bit out-of-place in this finely polished gem of a game. Noticeable when you need to change often in a level. I would have prefered a right-analog-stick menu, but I understand the choice that compromised between keyboard, non-stick gamepads, and xbox-style gamepads.\n\nStory: 6/10. It's very fun and gives the game a way-better-than-most-platformers plot device. It's not going to bring you to tears or make you think about philosophy or anything beyond providing a fun plot device for the game to progress on. \n\nGame Length: 8/10. I got about 10 hours out of my first playthrough, and managed 92% item completion. At the end, I was hoping for one last uber-boss to appear, becasue that would've been perfect. I haven't played the other modes as of this review (2/20/17), but I'll give them a try and see how long I can actually stretch this game out to.\n\nOverall: 9/10. Buy this game, it's EASILY worth $20. You'd be hard-pressed to get a meal for two for that amount, a couple coffees, or a boquet of flowers. The developers put thousands of hours (cumulative) into this game, requiring decades of talent and learning; and it shows BIG time! EXCELLENT JOB!\n\nFinal thoughts: I've been playing platformers hardcore since the early 90's. I like some platformers, and I dislike others. I like my platformers to be challenging yet fun (like Mario 3 or Sonic 2), or deep and immersive Metroidvania 40+ hour games. This game filled my \"challenging yet fun\" bucket FULL of candy!  I dislike games like Megaman, I Wanna Be the Guy, or most \"that's a game mechanic, not a glitch\" type games.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game. Everything about it is fun, detailed and engaging. I love the new engine, and the animations stand out in the best way possible. I like the \"like an onion\" level designs, and I wish every level had the same depth that Mermaid Falls had, even if it were for some pointless loot and a completion percentage. I wanted to use the mouse (transformation) and spider a little more! I REALLY like how the levels are shorter, much less mazey, and don't require a minimap to navigate.

The sprites are lovingly animated and move with a bubbling energy, often, seemingly, in rhythm with the background music.  The game is a joy to the eyes and the ears, with an aesthetic integrity that's rare in indie titles.\n\nThese visuals compliment the story and characters of HGH. Shantae is surrounded by barely threatening antagonists and frequently obstructive friends, all of whom are charming and fun. Lacking a central antagonist for much of the narrative, the game is presented as a series of tangential episodes strung together by a vague goal, an undefined threat, and a series of humorous contrivances. As refreshing as this approach is, it often makes the game feel directionless. Further, whereas the previous installment gave Shantae a foil in the form of Risky Boots, HGH only casually touches upon the protagonist's relationship with her friends and enemies, making her feel unmoored in the setting.\n\nAs a platformer HGH gives a solid performance. Shantae controls with precision and grace in a world that makes her limitations clear; players won't struggle against false impressions of what obstacles Shantae is and isn't capable of surmounting. Puzzles are solved by transforming into various animal and monster shapes that are unlocked over the course of the game, most often at the expense of offensive capabilities. Combat is a fairly bare-bones affair, with Shantae being limited to a melee attack that's supplemented by underwhelming mana-dependent spells.\n\nHGH is paced like a mad dash, with the game throwing power-ups and new abilities at players faster than they can find a use for them. Indeed, Shantae has a wide assortment of tools with too few obstacles to apply them to, and many of her more interesting powers go underused or are rendered superfluous by later acquisitions. Complicating this problem is all the backtracking that's required of a Metroidvania title; revisiting the game's small handful of areas quickly feels like padding, and makes replaying from the beginning feel unlikely. On the other hand, the dizzying volume of options available to Shantae by the end of the game will undoubtedly delight many players; for all of its backtracking, the sense of progress and growth is palpable.\n\nWhile not without its flaws, it's difficult to not recommend HGH. The game is clearly a labor of love, with an emphasis on color and energy that's uncommon in today's industry.", "timestamp_created": 1486676613, "timestamp_updated": 1486676613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29794295": {"recommendationid": "29794295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114299932", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496709935}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego, valio cada centavo", "timestamp_created": 1486612371, "timestamp_updated": 1486612371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29792689": {"recommendationid": "29792689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041154477", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487023641}, "language": "english", "review": "......That worm, that's why I don't recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1486603147, "timestamp_updated": 1486603147, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.335038", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29781912": {"recommendationid": "29781912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062627633", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505746046}, "language": "english", "review": "dont know what else i can say, it's a great game, much better than those fancy, same and boring 3D game out there, i tell you it's worth every penny you spend on this game, and support the developer!", "timestamp_created": 1486561906, "timestamp_updated": 1486561906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29772890": {"recommendationid": "29772890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036539426", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487020599}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as good as Pirate's Curse, but still a great game.

Then I heard about WayForward making a new Shantae game. That got me excited about how would this new release would be.\nI got Shantae Half-Genie Hero as a friend's christmas gift, and needless to say I was really really happy. Not only because I got a gift from a friend, but also because I was really into getting this game. That turn out to be the best gift I received in years!\nThe HD Graphics are amazing! Never thought an 2D platformer could look so good and so fluid (even for my not-suited for game laptop). Which just makes me wonder how much better it would be if I had a better pc.\nThe story is quite interesting, with lots of puns, gags, 4th wall breaking, etc. Never taking away the immersion of the player from the game.\nGameplay, which is the most important (imo) is as fluid as the graphics and animations. The challenge of the game is not too simple, not too difficult, it's just right for a non-hardcore platformer. The teleport mechanics are SO SO handy, since there's a lot of sidetracking to do, which could've make the game a bit tiresome without it.

Before playing Half-Genie Hero I have played Shantae: Risky's Revenge and Shantae and Pirate's Curse. \n\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero is much easier than previous games. I think I died only once while playing the game. The problem is that you can easily get Shantae overpowered for each stage. You get plenty of extra health, you get different methods of healing and you can power-up Shantae really fast. Also for last stage and bosses in it, I was able to be literally invincible. In other games I was never so overpowered. Good thing is that it's possible to turn off upgrades, so even if you try getting 100% everything, you don't have to be overpowered.  I believe that by turning of some of the upgrades, game gets much more challenging.\n\nI'm also little sad, how little some transformations and their skills are used in the game. Some transformations I only needed once or twice and some of their skills I never needed. On the other hand other transformations and their skills you need little too much. Also I used some transformations to skip platforming sections.\n\nI really love the new visuals. Every character and stage were visually very beautiful.  I think this game has best soundtrack of the franchise so far. Jake Kaufman truly nailed it with the soundtrack.\n\nGame has pretty nice and very funny story. There are lots of jokes with the characters. There's even some fourth wall breaks. It's not very long game, but that is good for me. I finished the story in 100% in 11 hours. After that you unlock a new mode, which I haven't at the time of writing this review.\n\nEven though I citicised some aspects of the game, I still loved it. It might be little too easy, if you make it too easy, but it's still very fun. Bosses are clever, though little easy. It is fun game. I'm not sure, if I liked this game more than Pirate's Curse, but I would recommend playing this one first of the franchise.", "timestamp_created": 1485975943, "timestamp_updated": 1485975943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29622944": {"recommendationid": "29622944", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973438159", "num_games_owned": 769, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494139035}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played other Shantae games and this is my fave.

While I still enjoyed the more classical pixel style of the older series, this new art style brings colors that jump off the screen, while still keeping the animation quality at the series high standards. And while the sound design does leave a bit to be desired, the music is fantastic as you would expect when Jake Kaufman is involved (Shovel Knight, Shantae series fame). This game is just a pleasure to look at, and the character design is probably the best it has ever been in the series.\n\nThe gameplay on the other hand has taken a step back. While the platforming is still enjoyable, its difficulty in combat has taken a step back from Pirate's Curse, as some of the returning transformations such as the monkey form make dodging enemies a breeze. The emphasis on movement over combat still shows off the smart level design Wayforward is known for. And the boss fights do bring it a bit more this time around, as they are better designed then in Pirate's Curse. But a lack of length in gameplay and just a overall lack of difficulty plagues the game a bit. \n\nOverall, the game still is an enjoyable romp that keeps with the Shantae style. If you've liked the previous games in the series, you'll love Half-Genie Hero. Just don't expect an evolution in the gameplay.\n\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgfpjp1KdYM\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The art work and presentation change is fantastic, as the new color and line work really bring Shantae and her dancing booty to life on the screen. \n[*] Good color choices as always: putting the foreground and the action elements with the stronger hues. \n[*] Music selection by Jake Kaufman is fantastic, appropriate for the levels in question. \n[*] Boss fights have definitely gone up a notch, as they felt like more of a test of my overall skills then previous games. Giga Mermaid fight was a prime example of a good difficulty: not too hard, but needing to take some skill in order to execute.\n[*] Good humor as always from the writers of Wayforward. Some groan worthy puns as always, but it's the good kind of humor.\n[*] Level Design great as always. Always good to go through the first time, but still fun to go through on the next few playthroughs. \n[*] Enemy variety is good. Good mix ups of melee versus range.\n[*] Good difficulty for the casual player.\n[*] Performance is flawless. 60 FPS with no drops.\n[*] Character design elements are fantastic as always. Being able to recognize Shantae in her transformations is fantastic through the specific characteristics like her headband and her eyebrows.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The gameplay's combat has taken a step backwards. A bit easier to deal with enemies, and the enemies just don't pose the challenge they did in Pirate's Curse.\n[*] Was Hoping for more after beating the game. I know that more content with new characters is coming later, but I found myself disappointed.\n[*] Sound Design does leave a little bit to be desired, as some sounds seems to be missing, while others don't make a lot of sense in the big picture. Squeaky sounds on grabbing metal rings for example. \n[*] Shorter then the last games, and to me it showed a bit. Just didn't have the same impact over the full game's length.\n[*] The Genie sub-plot here doesn't work as well as other games plot lines. The thread connecting the various substories is missing, unlike in Pirate's Curse.\n[*] Keyboard default configuration must have been done with someone with giant hands.\n[*] Missing sound sliders.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1485911169, "timestamp_updated": 1485911169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602290", "comment_count": 0,

"[h1]Shantae; A Great Game With Problems (NO SPOILERS) [/h1]\n\n        As a New commer to the franchise, I found this to be a fun and interesting entry to the platforming genre. The game overall was a blast to play and I enjoyed almost every second of it..... almost all of it, dispite me enjoing this game a lot there are Two main problems with the game. Firstly, the difficulty is somewhat all over the place for example I found the game to be pretty easy till the last level where there was a huge spike in difficulty as to where the rest of the games platforming was simple to requiring a little bit of skill and finesse. Lastly, the game has some pretty bad glitches and game breaking exploits. the worst glitch I encountered was when I was about to finish the fourth level I missed a platform and died, when I respawned the game freaked out and I belive Shantae had  spawned out of the level then the game crashed; When the game was lanched again I had lost all my saved data. Besides that glitch there were a few minor ones like getting stuck in terrain and getting in to areas with no way to get out with out going to the level select screen. there is also a really bad exploit that lets you to unlock every spell and upgrade that is purchasable after you beat the second level. Other then those problems I loved the rest of the game Expecially the music. So If I had to rate this game out of ten, It would be a 7/10 overal a great game with a decent amount of problems.", "timestamp_created": 1485764339, "timestamp_updated": 1485764339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29580972": {"recommendationid": "29580972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141818174", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485684113}, "language": "english", "review": "Expect a lot of backtracking as for every mission, you are required to collect items from previous areas in order to progress the story.", "timestamp_created": 1485762655, "timestamp_updated": 1485762655, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.329526", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29572419": {"recommendationid": "29572419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129189085", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485720553}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed all previous Shantae titles, but have been signifigantly dissapointed by this entry. The artstyle and writing are top-notch but the difficulty is all over the place. My most notable gripe with it is that dying then reloading your last save does not restore Shantae's health at all. This become the most infuriating during a slide obstacle section in Mermaid Falls, where I ended up going into the section (and saving) with only 1HP making it so touching anything would kill me instantly. With no options to load previous saves, I was left with the option to try and finish it without taking any damage, or to restart my entire save file, and play through the first hour of the game again.\n\nAs of writing this I have died 45 times on that section (which is ridiculously long by the way) and have since dropped the game, and refunded it.

This is a wonderful dip into modern 2.5D vector capable gaming - the retro rebellion against the modern 3d FPS GTA stuff.  The focus on art and story.\n\nIf I'd only have one criticism is that it seems like her 'world' is smaller, no vast trek through a circular ring of islands, ruins, forests, small towns, etc.\n\nAnother thing - artistic - there's a place with lots of towers, ruined, jutting up from the ground - where in the previews they had her facing the worm monster...

I really didn't like Risky's Revenge, and never played Pirate's Curse. I was prepared to walk into another boring backtracking marathon.\nAnd then The title screen came up and I changed my mind. You can tell a game is going to be great when the freaking title screen makes you excited. I made a new file and holy shit everything just blew me away. The animations are so fluent, the graphics are amazing, it controls really well, and that was just from the intro section.\n\nI soon got into the game, surprised to see it's really more of a metroidvania hybrid of sorts. There are metroidvania elements, but for the most part it plays like a regular platformer. It's like your first time through the stage is normal, and once you clear it you can revisit it to get the stuff you couldn't before. Unlike in RR, the areas are all REALLY interesting. (Mermaid Falls is easily my favorite level in any platformer, actually!) And the backtracking doesn't get old. It'd be nice if there was a minimap of some sort, so you could easily check unexplored areas on the fly. But it's not that hard to figure out without it. I managed to 100% this game in 7 hours, and I enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nA bit of a fair warning, though. This game suffers from \"Help the enemy is too cute and I don't want to kill it\" syndrome. Especially prevalent with Nagas, Mermaids, and Slimes. You may take lots of damage from ogling the things out for your head instead of fighting.\n\nI don't usually mention music in my reviews, because there's not much to say about it usually, but this has a really great soundtrack. It's a real earworm that pumps you up. And what else could you ask for with a platformer?\n\nThe game isn't too challenging, as long as you keep yourself upgraded. If you get 99% before the last level, you are basically immortal, as you can infinitely use Invincibility or Total Restoration. And you'll NEED IT. Because WOW that last level is so freaking rough. It's incredibly challenging, much more than the rest of the game. But all that aside, the game is amazing in every other regard.

But this game man... like holy shit, i didn't know what to expect. I've heard people complaining this game is short. I've gotta agree on that point but still, that didn't stop me. I've enjoyed every single second of playing this amazing game.\nThe soundtrack is so perfect, it can keep up with many Sonic Soundtracks in my opinion.\nI love the artstyle. Strangely it doesn't look wrong with 3D backgrounds and 2D characters.\nI'm suprised this game controls quite good on a keyboard, maybe has a little too many button maps but after a little work around it was completely fine for me though.\nTo the level design. It doesn't feature a large amount of levels, but every one of them is filled with hundreds of secrets.\nYou often have to revisit levels if you wanna go for 100% or need to get story-relevant stuff.\nOver time you learn new so-called \"Dances\". By dancing you can transform into an animal and gain unique abilities like climbing, swimming, etc. to explore every single inch of these well designed levels.\nThe story is pretty simple but for a platformer its fine to my taste, i'm used to much worse stories in platformers. *Cough* Sonic Lost World *Cough*\nThe dialogues were exactly what i'm looking for from a platformer of this kind. Humorous but not over-exaggerated.\nHowever, there's that one dude who kept fourth-wall joking like it was his job. I love him and the writer for that. xD\n\nThat's pretty much all i can say for now. i finished the game with 90% item completition in about 6 hours, i probably go for the 100%, which i rarely do by the way. ^^\n\nI rate this game 9,5/10 You should definetely buy this game if you love platformers!", "timestamp_created": 1485322839, "timestamp_updated": 1485322935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29476479": {"recommendationid": "29476479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126230841", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513051697}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3068\u3066\u3082\u7c21\u5358\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u9762\u767d\u3044\uff12D\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\nBGM\u3082\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1485321674, "timestamp_updated": 1485321674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29467200": {"recommendationid": "29467200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291680795", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484703313}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing the other Shantae series, I wanted the adventure to continue.

Everything about it is perfectly rounded and well finished.\n\nThe controls are tight, speedrun tight. Default button mapping is perfect with an xbox controller, and has rumble feedback\n\nIf you like visuals, you're in it for a treat: every sprite is beautifully hand drawm, and scenery is in 3D with plenty of details. The animations, as always a strong point of the Shantae series, are buttery smooth. Nearly every character and object in the game is carefully animated! This game really comes to life on screen. It was made for 1080p, but with anti-aliasing, plays at 1440p very well.\n\nThe soundtrack, again as is the case with previous installements of the series, is a gift for your eartubes! Lively bouncy catchy music will keep you immersed in Sequin Land for as long as you play, you might even want to spin the soundtrack every once in a while! It is THAT good.\n\nAs for the story i beleive that is where i will take off an egg; it is a shame they did not continue with the turn of events that were set up un the Pirate's Curse. In fact, i feel like the storyline did not get as much care as ther other aspects of the game. Quick point on dialog: humor? 4th barrier? Massive check!!\n\nGamePlay wise, is is a traditional platformer with a twist: Shantae transforms into various creatures and you will need that power to get through, there are even mini-gauntlets targeted at some of those forms. It has some very imaginative platforming elements as well. Boss fights are super fun.\n\nA personal note here, i found the game to be a bit too easy and a bit on the short side. BUT Wayforward are at work at the time of writing and there weresome neato DLC announcements. Too bad i missed the kickstarter.", "timestamp_created": 1485226578, "timestamp_updated": 1485226578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29451713": {"recommendationid": "29451713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015439285", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506202373}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly Shantae has got to be one of my favourite platforming series and Half-Genie Hero is no exception, Beautiful Visuals and I have to say the soundtrack is mind blowing.

It's so weird that I had never heard of this game before, despite how fun its gameplay is and how charming the world & characters were. \nAfter beating Pirate's Curse, I got 1/2 Hero. I had some reservations since it is a Kickstarter funded game but this isn't the the kind of Kickstarter game that disappoints. This one delivers pretty well. It is still fun to play, the character & world is still as charming, the soundtrack is sweet, the art style is much more striking (though I don't see why the character portraits shown in conversations in this game aren't as pretty as those in Pirate's Curse, but whatever), the LD changes still work (fewer and bigger levels with some backtracking, though the backtracking doesn't feel like a chore), overall a nice experience. Overall I am really impressed, and still kind of mad that I didn't know about this wonderful series before.\n\nAs a side note in the menu there is a play mode that is coming soon (which I assume by the darkened silhouette with the hat that this is a Risky Boots mode).

I've played Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse as well and each game has it's own strengths and weaknesses despite them being similar overall.  I've enjoyed my time with each game enough that I'm not sure I could even rank them. It should suffice to say that Half Genie hero was not a disappointment for me, but I can't say it stands head and shoulders above the other games either.\n\nFirst up, the game looks fantastic, maybe not quite up to par with something like Ori and Blind Forest, but it has a crisp cartoon style that's appealing and is definitely one of the best (if not *the* best) implementations of 2D sprites on 3D backgrounds I've ever seen in terms of making the two look like they belong together.\n\nThe music is also great.  It conveys the feeling of upbeat chiptunes from platformers of old while still using a modern full (synthesized) orchestration.\n\nThe game is still basically a Metroidvania, just with discrete levels instead of a contiguous world.  The animal transformations (which weren't in Pirate's Curse) make a return and are a welcome sight.  The level of challenge is still pretty light, with the exception of two sections in the last level which can get a tad frustrating, but aren't too bad.\n\nThe one downside - the game is a little content light. There are only 5 main levels and then an ending level.  The game is structured so that you will need revist those 5 levels multiple times as you get new powers.  There's a scripted dependency where you'll get a power in one level that lets you explore a singe new area of another level, where you'll find an item which unlocks the next power in a different level and so on, at some point wrapping back around to letting you explore the next hidden area in the original level.  I.e. this isn't a game where playing through all the levels once gets you all the powers you need to unlock everything and then you can just go back to the levels one more time, getting all hidden items in one shot.\n\nThat said, the game is very generous at giving you tools to warp around levels quickly and you can quit out of a level as soon as you get an item or powerup without losing it.  So despite the need to revisit the same levels, they do actually allow you to eliminate much of the tedium of retreading old ground.\n\nI was still quite satisfied with the amount of play time and the game overall for the price, but if there was just a little more unique meat on those bones, I think this would easily be the best Shantae game.", "timestamp_created": 1485137964, "timestamp_updated": 1485233311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29435036": {"recommendationid": "29435036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052941330", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485137374}, "language": "english", "review": "Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a platformer with beautiful graphics and animations, excellent music, and fun and tight gameplay.

Whichever you enjoy is your opinion, but know it's a level select like the previous game.\n\nIt's pretty much more of the same, finding goofy items for goofy purposes to further the story, with several unique, but repeated enemies. It saw the return of [spoiler]Squid Baron[/spoiler] as usual. \n\n[i]Significantly[/i] easier than the previous games. 100%ing before the final boss makes it absolutely trivial. This is remedied though: [spoiler]several bosses, including the final boss, have mechanical phases, instead of the usual hair whip spam, and the final boss is more acceptable because of this.[/spoiler]\n\nAll in all, I loved it. [i]Pirate's Curse[/i] was way better, but [i]1/2 Genie Hero[/i] is a very welcome addition to the series.", "timestamp_created": 1484964268, "timestamp_updated": 1484964268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29386886": {"recommendationid": "29386886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042478352", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503869489}, "language": "spanish", "review": "He completado el modo normal al 100% en cosa de 9 horas.

The self destructive mayor fires  Shantae (again) and she must solve a series of problems and fetch quests to regain Scuttle Town's favor.\n\nThis game does a few new things.  First, the game is less like a metroidvania and more like Mega Man X.  The game no longer has a map, and instead has a sereis of levels with nooks and crannies that can only be accessed with new upgrades.\n\nThis game has the nicest production values of the franchise.  Characters are now fully 3d cel shaded, looking like Guilty Gear Xrd without the deliberate frame rate reduction, so all animations and movement are silky smooth.  The soundtrack is phenomenal, including electronic and funk beats.\n\nThe game starts off very strong, with wonderful humor, action and boss fights.  But as the game goes long, two things happen.  First, the action is bogged down between fetch quests.  For those who don't know, Shantae always has humorous fetch quests which depend on key items that you will not expect to need, recieve, or give.  In this game they are easily the most numerous.  You will run around in circles checking if your latest upgrade will work in \"that one spot\" you couldn't reach before.  If only you could remember where it was: you have no map!  Second, the difficulty of the game PLUMMETS.  This is easily the lowest difficulty game in the franchise.  In the time I spent running around in circles, I fully upgraded my attack and attack speed.  In the midgame, you will find heart containers like candy, to the point you can ignore enemies and damage to a silly degree.\n\nThis was the most tiresome and boring Shantae game I played.

Ever since they made A Boy and His Blob for the Wii, they have had this asthetic of hand drawn animations and amazing backdrops. I feel that Ducktales Remastered helped them solidify their style. And they brought it to Shantae, their own IP. And this game shines for so many reasons. Their art style brings every little detail to life. The music is really catchy, especially the one with lyrics you encounter early on. The gameplay gives this sense of exploration that fits the Metroidvania style of coming back to places once you have new powers. It is fun to play.\n\nNow, there are a couple gripes I've got. The game length is pretty short. Getting near 100% took me just about 6 hours to do. If the game had maybe a level or two more, I'd feel more satisified. There is also a huge issue in Mermaid Falls in the factory setting. At one point, you are jumping from hook to hook, but they are not in sync to always line up. I've spent a great deal of time just trying to get up the first time I played. It was frustrating.\n\nBut beyond the slight flaws, I have to say I love this game.

A new Shantae was very excited for me that the moment it went on sale and I had money I bought it and, long story short, I loved it. Now it's not as big as Pirate's Curse and 1/2 Genie Hero doesn't have dungeons like the last game but I still love 1/2 Genie Hero.\n   Let us start with the graphics... amazing. No joke, this is what HD sprites should look like, not just high color pixels. What made me like the graphics especially was the fact that the character portraits look like the models. Pirate's Curse had portraits similar to this game but the sprites were pixels, it created a discord between what the gameplay says characters look like and what the portraits and promo art says the characters look like.\n   The gameplay, on base level, is mostly the same as the previous game but with the added bonus of not having the well implemented pirate gear and replacing it with the well implemented animal transformations. The most useful to me was the monkey because of it's speed and jumping ability. Despite my previous statement on the animal transformations, there are many ways to cheat. Case in point, the bat. It is so easy and tempting to jump to the highest place on a horizontal scroll and transform into the bat and fly over every thing. Also the Harpie kinda makes the monkey and bat useless.\n   And now some quick thoughts on small points. The music is amazing in 1/2 Genie Hero, I recommend that you go get the soundtrack from Jake Kaufman's bandcamp page, seriously you don't have to play the game to like the soundtrack. Next, the story, it's okay. SomeCallMeJohnny put it best, it's more like a series of microstories with a big plot at the end.\n  I hope you found this review helpful and be kind this is my first review.

I had heard some great things about the franchise, I just hadn't gotten around to it until now. And let me just say, this game has made me very interested in playing the others.\nRight off the bat, the visuals in this game are absolutely gorgeous. When it comes to side scrollers, a 2D traditional animation style is my preferred choice. The game looks so alive and vibrant, and the 3D environments only serve to compliment the 2D sprites. Most of the characters also have fun and cute designs, so there's no complaints in the visual department from me.\nThe sound is also awesome, this game has one of the more rocking soundtracks I've heard in a platformer in quite a while. I was tapping my foot throughout it. The minimal amount of voice acting sounds great as well, although it is underused.\nThe control is spot on, Shantae moves perfectly with your imput and it delivers a smooth platforming experience.\nAs for the gameplay itself, it's quite solid. I love games that give us the ability to switch out character styles at a moment's notice, and Half-Genie Hero allows for a number of fun interchangeable forms to help further are exploration experience. It was always exciting getting a new ability to see how it would change the level, and overall they didn't dissapoint. I will admit that while cool, I do wish the air transformations didn't somewhat break certain platforming segments once you obtained them.\nThe only two complaints I really have about this game is the length and backtracking. The game only has a few levels, which was a bit dissapointing since I liked all of the ones offered. Also the game features some serious padding with having us have to revisit levels with our new abilities. While discovering new hidden areas with new spells is a good feeling, it ends up with us having to play a lot of sections multiple times with little new content. Although they at least didn't make us refight the bosses.\nOverall I really enjoyed this game, it is a very solid entry to the platforming genre. Without experience with the series prior, I'm not exactly sure how much this one innovated it, however the current foundation is solid regardless. I recommend this game to sidescroller fans who aren't turned off by having to revisit areas or a fairly forgiving game challenge wise.", "timestamp_created": 1484873271, "timestamp_updated": 1484873271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29365992": {"recommendationid": "29365992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085926417", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 194, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492831899}, "language": "english", "review": "Gonna make it simple, its a good game, the production values are better than the other entries (graphics and music are way better), but is not as good as \"Pirate's Curse\", and the game has A LOT of DLC coming.

That issue forces me to encourage you to buy it, but preferably on sale. This game has excellent production value in all departments, and considering it is an indie game produced through crowd funding, it is easily a paragon of the medium. I think, however, the high production value hurt the product. There likely was enough money to make it look, sound, and play amazingly; but those funds couldn't be stretched to make the game longer, to justify the price, that they need to charge to make their money back. It is a catch-22, and it sucks.\n\nThen again you might buy it and think it as worth twenty bucks. I don't know how you feel this is just my opinion.

Honestly, Half-Genie Hero, while visually pleasing and mechanically sound, is not at good. Don't get me wrong, still a good game that I feel is worth the price tag. It is simply that the game did not do what The Pirates Curse did for me. One of my favorite things is that even the hardest levels of the game aren't too frustrating and I found myself wanting to complete the level no matter what. However, my main issue with the game is level design. There are 2-3 levels set up around the idea of you dying a handful of times before you learn the 'pattern' and make it to the goal. Unlike Pirates Curse, where the game would introduce you to new things individually before forcing you to deal with combinations, they made sure you had an idea of what you might be facing and then if you died, it was your fault because you didn't handle a puzzle or scenario correctly. This game makes the mistake of just throwing things at you and forcing you to find the best way while dying several times to do so. The other issue I have with level design is that the game has several animal forms that are essentally the same form just one of them is superior and the other one is required for one or two puzzles. For example, there are two water forms, one is large and lets you swim in any direction, the other is small and lets you walk under water. It can be said, oh you need the small form to get through the blocks of seaweed, but the large form gets an ability that lets it break through large blocks of stone, so the same puzzles for the small form could have been scaled to allow the large form in with the block breaking ability. Similarly you get two flying abilities, one that lets you fly left to right, and one that lets you fly freely, the left to right one also gets another ability that is only usefully for a single puzzle and most of the left to right flying power's puzzles could have been solved by the free flying one if they had simply changed the distance of spike walls or removed one entirely, the left to right form cannot go up or down, so you simply transform on a platform and float lazily left or right. My final two issues are with post game events. During the entire game you can travel back to each location with the boss fights and some hazards removed, ie. sand storms. Yet for some reason they give the option to start a new playthrough with all of the main transformations already unlocked, it seems pointless seeing as aside from the end game boss all the bosses were beaten without using transformations. The final issue is simply a continuity problem in my opinion that involves spoilers, but as you can guess from the title, Pirate's Curse, the previous game was about Shantae and Risky Boots.\n\n****Spoilers Below****\n\nAt the end of Pirate's Curse they show not only does Risky Boots reguard Shantae as some semblance of a friend, but she is extremely smart and was able to plan the entire adventure ahead insuring Shantae's Victory. So why in this game is she so dumb she not only drops a map to her hide out, but several articles of clothing around town? The other issue is that at the end of Pirate's Curse the two part ways, Shantae returning to being the Guardian Genie and Risky saying she must forge her own path, as she cannot become a 'goody two shoes' like Shantae, they part with a seeminly mutual understanding and a few nice words that make Risky seem like she actually has grown to like Shantae as the adventure came to a conclusion. So why would Risky just leave a Shantae after she converts her magic to dark magic, wouldn't she want to take her friend with her? Which reminds me, when Shantae is converted to evil nothing happens, literally each of her friends says, hey snap out of it, and she does. It's very anticlimatic and it feels like a small mini-boss fight is missing.\n\nIf you actually read to the end, I'm amazed I know I went off on a tangent, but over all the game is good and a worth while buy, it just doesn't stack up to the standard that the previous game set for me.", "timestamp_created": 1484661406, "timestamp_updated": 1484661406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29310358": {"recommendationid": "29310358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069270915", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496354676}, "language": "english", "review": "Having played and beaten every other game in the series, I was very hesitant at Half Genie Hero at first.

For those of you that are new to the series, this game is made up of 18 well-designed levels (3 levels per world, 6 worlds total).  There are 8 creatures you can transform into to aid in traversal, but some of them are redundant (do we really need 2 forms for flying, and 2 for swimming?  Surely these could have been merged).  Where the level design differs from past games is that they are more linear like you would find in a standard 2-D platformer.  This is a good or bad thing, depending on your preference.\n\nCons - The game is pretty easy, with up to 10 heart containers to find in the world, buyable armor that you can get very early to cut damage recieved in half, and a bat form that can also be found pretty early that breaks most of the platforming sections after that point (if you really want to cheat).  Bosses can be fun when trying to work out how to damage them, but with lots of health, armor, and recovery items you rarely need to even bother with dodging their attacks.\n\nThe story seems to be decently written, and funny at times, but is also unfocused.  Each level is treated like it's own episode, which sounds nice, but also means that things are introduced and quickly discarded.  For example a rival Half-Genie Holly appears after the first level, but disappears after some taunting.  After the next level, she appears in 2 more scenes before she's gone for good.\n\nThe game is really short.  My first blind playthrough of this game took about 7 hours to get to 100% completion.  When hunting for trophies on the PS Vita version I finished the main campain in 1 hour 40 minutes (any %) and 3 hours 30 minutes (100%).  More content is on the way as DLC, and it'll be free for me, since I'm a backer, but others will have to pay for it.\n\nPros - The game is beatiful, with great music.  It is made up of 2-D characters on 3-D background, but at times it hard to tell what's drawn or not.  The style blends very well.  Animations are smooth (though maybe the idle animations can be a bit over-blown sometimes).  I've enjoyed Jake \"virt\" Kauffman's music since the VGMix days, and this soundtrack is no exception.\n\nThe levels are fun when you don't break them with Bat or Harpy form.  Playing with minimal power-ups feels like a closer approximation of the intended experience.  Level and monster designs are good when the skillset is brought more in line with normal 2-D platformers.\n\nSearching for secrets in this game was a lot of fun as well.  The developers put in some interesting puzzles, making re-visiting levels something you actually want to do.\n\nRotty Tops.\n\nAs for a straight \"Recommend\" or not I'm a bit torn.  I honestly had a lot of fun playing through the game, but at $19.99 USD for what is a 4 - 8 hour game it might not be worth it.  I will click \"Recommend\" for now, but I would advise that maybe you wait for either a sale or at least for some of the DLC to come out.", "timestamp_created": 1484528422, "timestamp_updated": 1484528422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29286232": {"recommendationid": "29286232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160124274", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515105646}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "O jogo \u00e9 mais f\u00e1cil que seus antecessores, o que n\u00e3o deixa de ser excelente.", "timestamp_created": 1484525893, "timestamp_updated": 1484525893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29285265": {"recommendationid": "29285265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014659867", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498414196}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely adore this game!

Actual total playtime is just shy of 10 hours as of now.\n------------------------------\n\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero is a short but very sweet platformer with some nicely integrated Metroidvania elements and interesting character upgrades and skills. \n\nLevel design is very good for the most part of the game, the soundtrack features some very nicely remixed versions from some of the previous games and is generally fitting for the fast-paced style of the game. \n\nCharacter design is especially nice, with some pretty funny and light-hearted dialogues, deceptively cute drawings and brilliant animations. Just seeing the characters bob to the beat of the rhythm is truly heartwarming.\n\nThe platforming itself feels good and responsive at all times and integrates the skills the game has to offer nicely.\n\nThe difficulty starts off a tad on the challenging side, but actually gets progressively easier as Shantae gets more upgrades, up to the point where she's outright overpowered and some skills that pretty much break the game (talkin' about you, secret-key-bonus. ;P). Thankfully all the upgrades are fully optional and can be switched off in the menu at all times. Some transformations make platforming in some levels a little too easy in my opinion though.\n\nIt took me almost 10 hours for 100% completion, but I took it pretty slowly. If you know what you're doing you can certainly beat it much faster. The game does offer a certain replay value, although it might not be enough for everyone to make them want to replay right away.\n\nThe only real downside is that, compared to it's predecessor \"Shantae and the Pirate's Curse\", Half-Genie Hero feels a little more shallow, with less dialogues and a little less of the series' refreshing whacky humor. And even though most of the levels are extremely well designed, I really miss the dungeons of the previous game that had to be beaten at the end of a level.\n\nStill, if you're looking for a light-hearted, nicely paced platformer, I'd say you can't really go wrong here for the ~20\u20ac this game costs. I for my part have had a lot of fun with this and will certainly keep a eye out for possible DLCs or additional content.\n\nYou've made it this far.

Mais je crois savoir pourquoi.\n* Grunts Technos sont les seuls ennemis mal travaill\u00e9s du jeu (Quand l'ennemi est sous observation et vous \u00eates derri\u00e8re lui, il peut vous d\u00e9tecter sans vous regarder, ou quand vous vous laissez toucher par l'ennemi jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il reste fixe et tourne Dans toutes les directions en mini secondes).\n* Quand vous parlez d'une forme quasi-translucide, vous devez parler d'une forme particuli\u00e8re qu'il fait l'action (je me suis ennuy\u00e9 pendant 10 minutes pour comprendre -_- ').\n\nCela vous apprendra de vos erreurs cach\u00e9es pour ce jeu.

There are some pros and cons to this format, though. It's much more linear, employing stages rather than a single world for you to explore. I think this helps the player progress through the game more quickly keeping the fun alive rather than feeling like you you're constantly just running around on the map to find things like in previous titles. \n\nThe game is gorgeous. It's is colorful, the characters are adorable, the levels are fun to run through, and the music for the game has some really nice arrangements of the main tunes from the franchise. I had doubts, initially, about the style of the game when I first saw it on Kick starter, but it's grown on me and now I really love it. There are lots of transformations -- perhaps too many as some become almost obsolete after getting new ones that replace them -- and open up possibilities for combat and exploration -- and they all looked great, as well. The transformations are pretty easy to utilize and don't really require specific button motions to transform like in the original. \n\n\nOn the flipside, however, the game almost feels like it's not finished. There's a lot of polish to the game overall, but it just feels like it's too short or as if there are stages \"missing\", if you will. However, this may be remedied with the Risky Boots DLC in the future. \n\nAdditionally, one complaint I have about the linear level design is that you have to go back to previous levels many times to get things that you get either later in the stage or in future stages and you can't go backwards inside of a stage. Basically, each stage is split into separate \"divisions\", where, once you go past one within the stage, you can't go back. If you need to get to an earlier point in the stage -- which is sometimes required because on more than one occasion, you get an item towards the end of a stage that you need for the beginning of a stage for a secret or item to progress further in the game -- you're going to have to go through the entire stage all over again to get to that part of the stage. This made the game feel artificially longer than it was. It almost felt like a weak supplement to the game to lengthen it. \n\nThe last problem I had with it was that the characters aren't really developed that much in it. Pirates Curse had a LOT of character development in it. You learned a lot about Risky Boots and almost developed a friendship, almost, with her, by the end of the game. However, in this, it's as if it never happened. She's strictly the villain with seemingly no recollection of the events of the previous game. It's the same way with other characters, as well, like Rotty-Tops, for instance. You grew and learned a lot about her in Pirate's Curse, but in this, you really don't interact with her much. It's like once and that's pretty much it. Even less for Poe and Abner. You basically only say one thing to them at one point in the game and that's more or less the last you see of them. I really wish there had been more character development or some sort of additional focus on the characters than the game gave. It very much felt like a cycle of, \n\n1. Meet one character that needs item to get you to new stage\n2. Go to stage to get item\n3. Give item to new character\n4. Gain access to new stage \n5. Next to nothing for interactions with that character for the rest of the game. \n\nand just repeat that for the rest of the game. It just kept the world feeling like it wasn't fully fleshed out when you didn't really interact much with all of the characters you got to know so well in Pirates Curse. \n\n\nThose are my only big complaints, however, and they're far out-weighed by all of the positives of the game.

The graphics are really nice to look at it really fits the look of the Shantae world and I love the designs of the characters, enemies, bosses, and the levels. I love the music it is one of the best soundtracks I listned to with the boss theme and the mermaid factory being my favorite themes. I love the transformations they not only look cute but their abilities are pretty cool and usefull sometimes (except the mouse because it deals 1 damage which is kinda useless) but I also like the items with the pike ball being my favorite item to use and I enjoy the secret items like the infinite magic tiara and the waterfall relic. Overall this game is fantastic however I do have 1 gripe and that is that some of the bosses are kinda hit or miss like some bosses are excellent and fun like the Giga mermaid but then there are bosses like Wilbur that are kinda bland and I think they can be improved. But just that one gripe won't change my mind that this game is great, this game gets 10 tentacles up.", "timestamp_created": 1484374874, "timestamp_updated": 1484374874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29240358": {"recommendationid": "29240358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073006536", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492777945}, "language": "english", "review": "Obviously I'm not too far into the game but from what I've played (and having no experience with a Shantae game) I can say I'm enjoying it.", "timestamp_created": 1484373206, "timestamp_updated": 1484373206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29240119": {"recommendationid": "29240119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055019589", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504653353}, "language": "english", "review": "iz gud gaem", "timestamp_created": 1484371990, "timestamp_updated": 1484371990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29239656": {"recommendationid": "29239656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200765299", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484396309}, "language": "bulgarian", "review": "\u97f3\u4e50\u548c\u5267\u60c5\u90fd\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5df2\u901a\u5173\n\u53e6\u753b\u8d3a\u56fe\u4e00\u5f20\nhttp://hairyfood.deviantart.com/art/Shantae-Half-Genie-Hero-657095012", "timestamp_created": 1484369811, "timestamp_updated": 1484369811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29239505": {"recommendationid": "29239505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046970860", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484798555}, "language": "english", "review": "Im already in love", "timestamp_created": 1484369160, "timestamp_updated": 1484369160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29238999": {"recommendationid": "29238999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146603846", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485643389}, "language": "english", "review": "Crouching booty-shake is still a thing though apparently.......\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1484366786, "timestamp_updated": 1484366786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29236613": {"recommendationid": "29236613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118935059", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514948250}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely one of my top 5 favorite platformers of all time.

It has much of what made the previous Shantae games great, like its fluid animations, great visuals, silly story and amazing music. The gameplay feels fantastic and responsive aswell. But despite the game's numerous positives, one can't help but feel a little disappointed. \n\nThe metroidvania style world building and levels in the previous titles have been cut for \"chapters\". A chapter consists of several linear stages (go right. for the most part) and side scrollers. There are secrets spread throughout each chapter. Some you can get right away, while others you'll need a certain skill to get to. This forces you to backtrack and revisit chapters, and is a small substitution for the metroidvania styled secrets. This however doesn't make the exploration that enjoyable, as you're forced to run through the stages quite a few times to get everything. There is a dance you can get in the game called \"Warp Dance\", that lets you skip a previously completed stage. This helps getting to a correct stage faster, if you know there is an unacquired secret there. But you will still always start at the very beginning of a stage, so you'll always have to run through the beginning each time you want to visit the area.\n\nAnother minor disappointment is the absence of a few animations that exists in the game's previous titles. Some examples are the various dance animations, a proper dodge animation, and an idle \"hurt\" animation. Even though they seem minor, and not too important. It all adds up, and more fluid animations helps the atmosphere of the game greatly. However, this doesn't change the fact that the game has quite a few animations already, and of very great quality.\n\nOne can't help but feel that the game is missing something when coming from Shantae and the Pirate's Curse. There are many small things that if added, would add that little extra bit of polish and quality, and it would help out the game immensely. There are even concept art within the game that shows that there was so much more planned for the game, but for whatever reason was scrapped. If it is because of the lack of money or time isn't easy to tell, but it could also be because of the promises they have to deliver because of the kickstarter.\n\nThese are however minor flaws. Half-Genie hero is very enjoyable for what it offers. The game oozes \"Shantae\" from the very beginning, and is a treat for every fan of the series. If there is one thing WayForward doesn't get (too) wrong, it's the Shantae titles.

If you've played any of the Shantae games before, you already know what to expect.  If you haven't, you've clearly had a deprived, borderline abusive childhood, and I'm sorry for that.\n\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero is a 2D platformer that, despite the HD graphics, retains its indie-esque feel.  Mechanics of the game are simple enough to pick up quickly, yet with enough depth that the game remains enjoyable many hours later (I pause to note that Steam vastly underestimates how many hours I've put into this game.  At time of writing, it's close to 20 hours).\n\nHaving mentioned it earlier, I should mention that the graphics of this game are simply gorgeous.  It's an upgrade from the classic style without disrespecting its roots.\n\nSoundtrack is absolutely amazing.  Plenty of allusions to previous Shantae games that carry over with distinctive sequencing, and virtually guaranteed to be stuck in your head for hours to come.  Not that I'm complaining.\n\nWith regards to the plot/story, Shantae isn't known for its compelling storytelling.  The plot is best described as 'cute' or 'quirky' and mostly serves as a vehicle by which the gameplay is delivered.  The dialogue is snappy and self-aware enough to be entertaining to read, carried by characters that are caricatures of stereotypes, but are entertaining rather than annoying.\n\nThe achievement list is very reasonable with only a single 'joke' achievement, and one harder achievement for completing a 100% speedrun.  That being said, I 100%'d the game in about 10 hours in-game (which involved two full playthroughs).  If you can't be bothered to route the speedrun yourself, there are plenty of guides for it hanging around.\n\nOverall thoughts:  This game is absolutely amazing and everybody should be playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1484266727, "timestamp_updated": 1484266727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29212670": {"recommendationid": "29212670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201837847", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486769214}, "language": "italian", "review": "Let me be breaf. I completed this game with 100% two times. With 100% achievements. I have always been a Shantae fan.\nSo, why am I rating it negatively? Simply because this is not what Shantae is supposed to be.\n\n- No dungeons.\n- Extremely linear.\n- Not an Adventure anymore. Just a platformer. A bland platformer.\n- Bland level design that doesn't ever consider the power ups or trasformations you have, most of the time.\n- To much backtracking, just to make the game last longer. Otherwise it would be 2-3 hours long.\n- The world and characters don't have any kind of characterization. I know, Shantae was never famous for having a deep story with amazing characters. But this game is just to plain and uninteresting. The other games had some kind of build up and tried to give the characters more personality. This one is almost like a reboot, Shantae and Risky Boots treats each others likes the event of Pirate's Curse never happened.\n- The music is good, I found myself humming many tracks, but it doesn't fit the game at all.\n- Probably one of the easiest platform game I've ever played.\n\nThis is not a bad game by any means. It's just a plain and simple game that doesn't try to be memorable in any kind of way, but it's still enjoyable and fun. \nA complete let down for a fans of the series.

TLDR; Good game, Wait for sale.\n\n---\n\nPros:[list]\n    [*]Character Design, Visuals, and Animations: Gone are the days of the retro low-res character sprites and pixelart tiled level design. Each character has high resolution character sprites that are fluidly animated, and the traversable environments are all rendered in cell-shaded 2.5D.\n    [*]Music: Anybody that has played a Shantae game will tell you that it has some of the best music of the platforming genre. A lot of the more memorable leitmotifs from the series, such as the Burning Town and the main theme, return in a number of ways. This include such tracks as Neo-Burning Town, which retains its middle-eastern flair while also taking on a club-music feel, and Dance Through the Danger, which I'm admittedly biased about because Cristina Valenzuela (the voice actress for Shantae's spoken lines) provided A++ vocals for the song. Never get tired of hearing that woman sing. Like all Shantae Games, you'll be hard pressed not to find a track from its soundtrack that hooks you.\n    [*]Puzzles: The game loves to make you look for the solution to finding that one collectable you can see but not get to. At the same time though, they are never too difficult; it's usually just a matter of backtracking, and if you keep up with chatting with the NPCs, you'll never be short on hints. Just keep on exploring. Just be aware that some transformations completely kill puzzles, and some puzzles you can technically complete before you get the ability or power-up required to do them.\n    [*]Boss Battles: One thing I've always liked about the boss battles in the Shantae games is that they are almost always unique, and in Half-Genie Hero, it was no exception. One battle has you relying on bits of the environment introduced in a mission, while another has you running yourself in literal circles as you try to figure out how to actually damage the boss.[/list]\n    [*]Transformations: Lots of them. I won't spoil all of them, but a number of the classics from both the gameboy color Shantae title, as well as the returning forms and abilities from Risky Revenge make their return in Half-Genie Hero, in addition to a number of new ones to play with.\n\n---\n\nCons:[list]\n    [*]Performance: For a modern game with such modest specs, Half-Genie Hero has its share. For one, the game has Vertical Sync permanently enabled and expects your monitor to have the exact refresh rate of 60Hz, meaning that if you're running on a 120Hz monitor, or you're playing on a TV at a non-60Hz refresh rate, such as one running at 1080i, you're going to have a bad time. It spazzes out on higher refresh rates, and on lower rates, sprites flicker, FPS caps at 30, and within the first minute of the game the camera goes epileptic before shooting off into the void. Even if you're running it at a 60Hz refresh rate on a progressive resolution\u2014say 720p\u2014and your system meets and exceeds the reccomended system specsthere's no guarantee you're going to get that smooth 60FPS the game expects to run at without a bit of fiddling. Case in point, I had to tell Radeon Settings to use the Frame Rate Target Control at 60 just to get that smooth 60 at 720p.\n    [*]Level Design: To put it bluntly, the levels are incredibly short. Most of the dungeons consist of medium or large 'rooms' that require you to navigate back and forth through on the x and y axes, taking into account the elements and obstacles of that particular level. You might be required to hop across a series of platforms that fall if you stand on them for too long, or scale a tall room hopping from moving ring to moving ring. For the most part, it's a far cry from the Shantae standard of dungeons being a series of small interconnected rooms. Heck, it's so simplified that you don't even get a map this time around. This brings me to...\n    [*]World: In the previous Instalment, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, you access to Scuttle Town as your 'hub', from which you had access to a boat which would take you to the world you would then need to navigate and explore, just to get to the dungeon. In Half-Genie Hero, the devs took the 'boat' and decided, \"How about we just drop you right in the 'dungeon' and cut out the middle man.\" You just go to Skye's place, hop on her mode of transportation, and off you go to the dungeon select screen. Don't even get me started on Pirate's Curse vs. its predecessor. Of course, to account for the smaller world and bigger, they had to put in a lot of...\n    [*]Padding: With only a series of short dungeons, the devs definitely seemed hard pressed to make sure the game lasted. To account for this, they utilized a number of things to pad out the game. Backtracking was always a big thing in previous Shantae Games, but a lot of it could usually be mitigated by knowing where something was ahead of time. There wasn't TOO much that hinged on you having a specific transformation, or a particular ability for said transformations. I'm not talking about little mini-puzzles that force you to use specific transformations and problem solving, I'm talking about the things that draw things out such as [spoiler]the mouse form mazes[/spoiler], or one-off abilities such as [spoiler]sonar for the bat transformation, which is used for all of one puzzle that can technically be solved without it[/spoiler]. You see that collectable on display right out in the open where you can't get it because you don't have a specific ability? You're going to be tormented by those a lot for three quarters of the game until you get that power you don't have. Then of course you have things like rings that disappear from the foreground or the infamous disappearing platforms. If you've played the classic Megaman games, you know exactly what I'm talking about. They're just a right pain to get the timing down on, which just creates...\n    [*]Artificial Difficulty: I just want to say that Half-Genie Hero is not a hard game. That said, it does have segments that will make you want to tear your hair out. For example, in the very final dungeon, you are required to use your [spoiler]Harpy[/spoiler] transformation to [spoiler]navigate a series of spiked walls, some of which were moving[/spoiler]. This might not have been so bad if the game actually gave you reason to use said transformation [which was only just acquired AFTER the second to last dungeon] and some practice, but you're basically thrown into the deep end of the pool with cement sneakers on, and you've been missing leg day lately. It is basically [spoiler]Flappy Bird[/spoiler] in that section. You have an early segment where you're in a restricted movement auto-scroller, and you need to rely on reflexes and skill to not miss a jump or hit something that will inevitably damage you. [spoiler]This kind of segment returns after the final boss and is cranked up to 11, with shorter platforms, the rings where if you're not placed just right, you will miss and go back to the start, and wall of death that continues to take up more and more of the screen, making the segment a game of memory and reflex as you end up with less and less space to work with. It was, apparently, difficult enough that the devs removed your life bar for this segment. I can only imagine how bad it would have been otherwise.[/spoiler]\n    [*]Stretch Goals: In case it wasn't readily apparent, Half Genie Hero is a kickstarter game, and budget can be blamed for some of the shortness. Two of the levels in this really short game were in fact stretch goals. Yep, the game would be shorter if those goals hadn't been met. Iterestingly enough, the very first stretch goal, a mode where you play as Risky Boots, is not present as of this review, and is slated as Coming Soon. So in a way, the launch exclusion of Risky Mode, coupled with the performance issues kinda gives the game an Early Access feel rather than a full launch.[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1484251136, "timestamp_updated": 1484252102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520548", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29207581": {"recommendationid": "29207581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286223731", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487865238}, "language": "french", "review": "Apr\u00e8s avoir attendu pendant longtemps pour ce jeu, je n'ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9\u00e7u.\n\nWayForward Technologies ont tout donn\u00e9 pour ce Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, le style graphique similaire \u00e0 DuckTales Remastered est beau \u00e0 voir, le gameplay reste simple et maniable comme ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs, les musiques nous plongent vraiment dans l'ambiance de ce jeu.\n\nSeules b\u00e9mols, c'est de faire des allers-retours et aussi quelques probl\u00e8mes de traductions fran\u00e7aises, mais rien de grave.\n\nApr\u00e8s, il existe un mode cach\u00e9 qui n'est pas encore disponible, je pense qu'un futur DLC arrivera pour ce mode, voir m\u00eame d'autres nouveaut\u00e9.

I was so excited for this game, I had to buy the steam version even though I already backed the game, because I just couldn't wait for my copy to arrive. \n\nBeing in development for for nearly four years after a sucessful Kickstarter isn't always good, and I think we were all worried about a repeat of a certain blue helmeted robot boy's mistakes. Happily though, Wayforward has delivered in spades. Even though it's only January, I can already tell this is going to be one of my favorites, if not definitive favorite.\n\nLet's go over a few of Shantae's merits, if I may:\n[list]\n[*]The controls are as tight as you could ever want. Never once did I feel as if I messed up ro died because things were out of my control. \n[*]The music is astounding. Wayforward always does good soundtracks, but they've gone above and beyond for this. It even has it's own single \"Dance Through the Danger\". The first time a Shantae game has had a voiced song, and it's absolutely wonderful. I've been listening to it all week.\n[*]The art design is beautiful.  The colors and lighting will make sweet, tender love to your eyeballs.\n[/list]\n\nDemerits? I can't really think of any. There are some things I'd have liked that aren't there, but nothing that takes away from the experience. \n[list]\n[*]The first two games, the original and Risky's Revenge, had sprawling overworlds between dungeons, and while I really liked those and kind of miss them, I can see why they were removed from this game. The dungeons here are the focus, and I think they're stronger for getting the full spotlight.\n[*]The game is very short. Spent about 8 hours on my first playthrough, but I enjoyed those 8 hours so much, I immediately tried to speedrun the game on 'Hero Mode' right after finishing, so replay value is high.\n[*]I thought the dificulty was absolutely perfect. Challenging at the right times, and with simple portions as breathers.

Like \"Risky Boots Revenge\" - the first Shantae game I played. Transformations are back, the graphics feel more HD (the previous games were made for the Nintendo DS and thus had a way smaller resolution), and familiar faces in every direction.\n\nStages are set up \"Select Screen\" style again. I preferred the way they did it in Risky Boots Revenge - the world map I mean - and thought it was a downgrade to the game world as a whole when it went from that to a simple stage select in The Pirate's Curse - which they kept for this. It's not the worst thing in the world though.\n\nThe puzzles weren't hard until the final level. Most of the stages weren't set up with puzzles.  There were some here and there (avoiding laser beams, climbing a maze before time is up, the entire final level) but most levels were based around exploration or simple advancement from point A to B through a horde of enemies.\n\nA lot of the transformations completely outclassed other transformations. I enjoyed using them anyway - and I felt a bit more lenient about there being forms that were less useful when I found out some of them were just tossed in as extra rewards for the players to enjoy.\n\nWhile the graphics themselves were enhanced the animations for the characters seemed a little less amped than the previous games in the series. I mean I still enjoyed them and they still came to a point I feel keeps WayForward of the \"We care about the animation quality\" mentality, but they were clearly a little less ambitious than previous games on that specific detail. There's only one dance animation for example when everybody was amazed at her dancing in [i]Risky Boots' Revenge[/i]. I can totally understand [i]why[/i] though: they added several times more transformations so waiting for a cycle of 20 dances to roll through would have been unintuitive and probably aggravating after a bit.\n\n[h1]Pet Peeves[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]There weren't many levels. At the end I felt like the game could have gone on another few hours. The game length on my first play through - which included a lot of fooling around, some gem grinding, and a decent amount of backtracking for 100% completion - was roughly about 10-11 hours. So the game holds up in length, but the stages don't feel numerous - especially after finding out two of the levels were added as Kickstarter rewards.\n[*]The final stage was another spikes-and-pitfall level that made the game hard for the wrong reason. To be fair sometimes the only reason the challenging parts [i]are[/i] challenging is because they can be cheap, but in Shantae's series it's always shooting itself in its own foot since it throws away the point of spending extra hours finding more health. I'd have preferred more numerous enemies and stronger enemies over spikes and pitfalls again; something to give the health bar some stress in [i]combat[/i].\n[*]Holly, [spoiler]a character that seemed centered on an  interesting rival-genie arc, is resolved very quickly. She has a decent buildup to what ultimately just concludes and disappears into thin air all of a sudden. I think she would have offered something new to the universe as an rival character even if only for one game before the rivalry were concluded, but it ended so fast it could easily have been skipped entirely.[/spoiler]\n [/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI played with the transformations like toys. I [u]love[/u] the transformations. I did what I could to try and beat every stage I reasonably could as each transformation (which I'm still in the middle of doing). Ultimately I feel the transformations are what make a Shantae game a Shantae game. \nI feel like the game lost [i]something[/i] about it that was there in the earlier games but I can't put my finger on it. It also added more [i]\"something else\"[/i]. It still feels like a Shantae game. Just somehow with a little more and a little less \"something\".

With such a long time in development, backers\u2019 expectations were high \u2013 Wayforward have a pedigree, and I\u2019ve enjoyed every game they\u2019ve ever produced. The Shantae games in particular are blessed with excellent production values, level design and waifus that are frankly off the hook.\n\nIt\u2019s clear to me that those years in development were not spent productively. I completed the game with 100% items in under six hours, and I\u2019m fairly certain that it could easily be completed in half that. Of course length is not necessarily an indication of quality, as ur mum will attest \u2013 but the levels here are short and linear, so much so that there is no map screen. Some levels don\u2019t even feel finished, and considering the small number of them and the extensive development time that\u2019s pretty piss poor. Most of the levels need to be revisited to find items crucial for advancing the story, which is a transparent way of lengthening the dismal play time. Backtracking is of course a metroidvania staple, but here it feels forced and unnecessary.\n\nIn terms of abilities, transformations are back after an absence in Pirate\u2019s Curse. There are certainly a wealth of transformations compared to previous games (each beautifully rendered and animated), but some of them barely have anything to do, and there\u2019s a surprising degree of redundancy. The level design also feels very flabby and under baked \u2013 certain abilities borderline break the game at the point they can be acquired, like the bat that allows you to pretty much skip half the desert level.\n\nOutside of the amazing visuals and music (and they really are best in class), Half Genie Hero is entirely inferior to Pirate\u2019s Curse, and if I\u2019m being honest it doesn\u2019t even hold up particularly favourably to Risky\u2019s Revenge. Looking at Half Genie Hero in a vacuum, it\u2019s a fun little platformer, and I can\u2019t deny I enjoyed my (short) time with it - however, compared to both its immediate predecessor and the stiff competition in the metroidvania market on Steam, it just isn\u2019t worth the fifteen quid.", "timestamp_created": 1484007007, "timestamp_updated": 1484007007, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499339", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29149520": {"recommendationid": "29149520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352082981", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "last_played": 1515874709}, "language": "english", "review": "I spent more time then id like to admit trying to defeat that mother fucking giant mermaid", "timestamp_created": 1483995932, "timestamp_updated": 1483995970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29149320": {"recommendationid": "29149320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189375493", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492798898}, "language": "italian", "review": "Il gioco \u00e8 bellissimo, lo coniglio a tutti quelli appassionati alla serie. mi raccomando non giocatelo tutto di un fiato perche senn\u00f2 diventa corto, mi aspetto il dlc, ma intanto godetevi la maestia del gioco: i luoghi, i personaggi, i nemici, sono fatti in modo da sembrare in modo carttoonesco il cui \u00e8 questo gioco. ripetendo, \u00e8 un bellissimo gioco il cui da soddisfazioni di ogni genere, avventura, storia, danze bellissime (per il solo fatto che abbiano implementato il movimento delle parti della ragazza sia pure affascinante),  ma ritornando,  \u00e8 un CAPOLAVORO! \nP.S. se vi capita di leggere questo messaggio, potresti per favore mettere al mio profilo un +rep?\nP.S.S. consigliate questo gioco daltronde ai vostri amici.", "timestamp_created": 1483995310, "timestamp_updated": 1511532064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582963", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29148705": {"recommendationid": "29148705", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980745827", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484943292}, "language": "english", "review": "Tight controls, lively animation, awesome music.

It requires a lot of backtracking to previous areas, which I personally enjoy, to gain extra abilities and story related items. The great part of this is the areas change visually after the first time you visit it. Sometimes good, sometimes bad(no more counterfeit mermaids). Unfortunately, it's a short game. I managed to finish up the main game within a couple of hours and achievement hunting isn't really hard or too time consuming either.\n\nThe visuals and soundtrack are absolutely beautiful. I couldn't help but get immersed into the game whenever I started it up and an hour or 2 would fly by. Whenever I would have to go back to Tuki I would always pick Tassel Tower just for the music.\n\nThe gameplay is great. Very smooth handing and fun interactions with enemies and environment.

wrong for me to recommend it.  There are 6 stages in all, including the final stage which holds no secrets and another stage that holds only a couple that you'll visit maybe three times.  As you play, you accumulate more abilities and forms for Shantae which enable you to visit previously inaccessible areas and acquire more items and powerups.  But because the final stage has no secrets and another one has only a couple, you'll spend most of the game visiting the same 4 stages repeatedly.  To pad the length of the game and make up for a lack of content, you are occasionally given strange, lengthy fetch quests to complete to advance the story.\n\nI'll be blunt:  Half Genie Hero doesn't feel like a complete game.  It isn't just the lack of stages.  A few of the transformations--like bat and spider--have no real part to play in the game.  You use them a couple of times to collect optional items and nothing else.  Half Genie Hero was funded on Kickstarter and I suspect the developer may have hoped to be funded for more stages that would make use of things like the bat and spider transformations.  And unlike a traditional metroidvania game, there is really no variety or sequence breaking to be had.  You either have the right upgrade or you don't.  And since the game is so small, there really isn't any sense of progression.\n\nThe game starts out at an average difficulty, but once you start buying some of the items in the shop and upgrading your life the difficulty soon vanishes.  You'll have so much health and take so little damage from attacks that you can literally just walk through normal enemies.  You can even buy an invincibility spell which further reduces the challenge.  There are a couple of places where the difficult absolutely skyrockets.  One is an area where you must climb quickly to avoid instant death, and another consists of a long path of one-hit kill spikes that you must fly through with extremely awkward controls.  It's like the developers struggled to balance the difficulty and then decided they needed some areas with serious challenge.\n\nI really like the style of the game and its characters, but the game just doesn't live up to its potential and I can't recommend it.  If you want a platformer, grab Shovel Knight or Freedom Planet instead.  If you'd like to play a game specifically like Castlevania, I'd recommend Valdis Story.  If you like games like the classic Metroid (or just good games in general) check out Axiom Verge.  If you're set on playing Shantae because it looks interesting, I'd recommend checking out the previous game in the series instead.", "timestamp_created": 1483958184, "timestamp_updated": 1483958184, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584488", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29134303": {"recommendationid": "29134303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098818880", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483776798}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't like the game, I'm not saying it's bad, in fact the only reason I didn't like it was because I thought the keyboard controls were (in my opinion) not too good. \nBut in other aspects the game was great of meh...

Looking back at the previous installations of this series, all that needed some refinement was the minimap and maybe enemy combat. However, Way Forward tries to solve the navigation issues by making all levels linear, completely debilitating a lot of the established core design patterns, and we can see the consequences of this: the game has a mere six levels, yet there are eight transformation abilities, each of which can be further upgraded. The game's world is too small to bring all these abilities to life in a meaningful manner. What follows is the tedious kind of backtracking: Revisiting previous levels to find that one block you could not previously break, that one spot you could not previously climb, that one platform you could not previously reach, all while traversing exhausted content that has lost its meaning by the time you come back with your bag full of upgrades that allow you to fly past everything, just so you can get some thing using some other thing you just got, which, afterwards, you won't be using again, except maybe once in some later puzzle, deliberately designed to make you use the thing, all in order to feign the presence of meaningful choice; but there is none. This design decision spawns further problems, but I'll refrain from emphasizing.

To start off, 2D animation amongst 3D shaded backgrounds looks sharp! I was a little surprised at first, because I had played Shantae so much in it's pixel art form, but this new style WayForward has adopted for the series is fantastic and I got used to it fairly quickly. That also including the control scheme which is very snappy and responsive! Shantae has become a living realtime cartoon and it is a major factor that I'm so glad the series now has.\n\nMajor and minor characters are back including Bolo, Uncle Mimic and Rottytops and they all have great dialogue and look great in the new style. The character interactions and text are all very funny, even including some fun unexpected moments where the characters will speak automatically, used a bit more here than in Pirate's Curse. I also really like how townsfolk give you hints and small clues, which comes in handy for dummies like me in those moments where I'm stupid and can't put 2 and 2 together.\n\nMusic is great as always, Jake Kaufman bringin' it down with more sick remixes of Scuttle town and Burning Town. The new song sung by Shantae (Cristina Vee) is awesome when you first hear it on Main Street. Absolutely a major factor that makes the game stand out and goes along great with it. Though I will say I take more of a liking to Pirate Curse's tracks, these orchestral songs are great and are very dance worthy.\n\nThe transformations are back from Shantae's earlier games, being staple powerups. They are used awesomely in this game! Very quick to transform and each stage uses different transformations for key areas to find secrets and other essestial items for achievement hunters and casuals alike. For Pirate's Curse of course, I did like how snappy and fast it was to use the pirate items for the corresponding buttons, but each key feature of the chosen transformation helps out greatly in areas, not just to get around the level, but also to find secrets. And hey, it's all worth it just to see Shantae dance again!\n\nOh man, the bosses are pretty good too this time around. They all have some cool attack patterns and look great all while the kickin' battle them is blasting from your headphones. They're all varied and some do bring out great fun. Whoever thought up that rad giant mermaid needs a big ol' smooch.\n\nIf I had to bring up any cons at all or stuff that just irked me personally, there's nothing that kept me from enjoying the game majorly. But the story is a biiiiit more straight forward this time around, and each world is sort of broken down into tiny subplots that don't really show up again, such as with Holly Lingerbean, the new kid on the block who's sort of just kicked out in a few minutes. But the small stories are essential for getting items back into the main plot.\n\nSome characters also felt kinda weird in this game, there's not a lot of ongoing character development carried on from past games. Risky in Pirate's Curse was Shantae's arch nemesis doin evil stuff as always,  but when the pair had to work together, she became a sort of hothead with a short temper while she worked with the good guys compared to Shantae's upbeat goofiness. She also came with a backstory where she used to have a powerful master. Here's she's just kind of the generic main baddie. Don't get me wrong, I know they kinda want the games to be accessible in any order, but for me it was just kind of a shame to see characters who have been sorta fleshed out in other games back to their plain old selves. Though it was kinda just a thing for me with Risky upfront.\n\nSomething I noticed was that some aspects can make the game feel too easy, flight abilities can have you skip entire sections of levels, you can rack up gems like nobody's business though who's ever complained about free coinage?? And with enough gems, armor and hearts, getting hit every once in a while is really no problem.\n\nBut hey, I love Shantae, and overall, this is a dang fun Shantae game with lots of great powerups, funny writing, a sweet new artstyle once again and a great soundtrack. It's just that compared to Pirate's Curse, it felt a bit more compact. While I would rate that game my favorite in the series, trust me, Shantae Half-Genie Hero is definetely my second. A great effort to everyone at WayForward and another definite step in the right direction.

It's bright, colorful and is super smooth with it's tweened animations. Really impressive art and animation. \nI'm less into the 3D backgrounds, they contrast too harshly with the character art, they work for the most part. \n\nGameplay is nice, it's a mix between Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse, you get the transformations of the 2nd game and the faster gameplay of the third game....Buuuut it's levels are not as large or have the depth of the previous games. They feel simple and easy. Maybe this changes a bit more later? I'm not sure yet. One thing that's a bit frustrating so far is there's a lot of weird backtracking. \nWeird as in, you'll beat level, go back to the level with a new power to get some more stuff right? But you won't have the ability to get through a wall...So you can only collect 2/5 items required to progress ...till you go further down the level, talk to an NPC who gives it to you making you walk back what you JUST did....twice. As said earlier, levels aren't massive so it's not a huge deal but it's just weird to make you run back right away. \n\nOverall, so far I think Pirate's Curse is a better game. But this is a game worth getting all the same. Lot of charm and polish. \nOne thing is for sure, despite Mighty No. 09 getting all the hype and all the money this game managed to do more with less.

Thankfully, I decided to purchase Shantae: Half-Genie Hero entirely on a whim.  I hadn't heard about the kickstarter otherwise there's a strong chance I would have backed it.  I've since rectified that mistake and bought the game when Steam suggested it to me.\n\nShantae is a game with great artwork, and incredibly catchy sound track, and a plethora of unlocks to get you through your quest.  The levels are designed incredibly well which is great since you'll be revisting them multiple times to get any new items you can find as the game progresses.  Bosses are humorous, animated well, and sometimes challenging.  \n\nShantae isn't without it's flaws, though those are incredibly minor.  Really.  While the next bit sounds like a lot, I'm being incredibly nit-picky.  A few animation glitches occur during the opening sequence when Shantae first gets out of bed and in the mid-level save sequence.  Jumping can be a bit stiff but if you've played enough platforming games, you can quickly adapt.  \n\nOne of the coolest parts of Shantae is also one of the most disappointing parts.  On your first go around in a level, you'll see many details that bring the stage to life.  These are usually tied to the story of the level and once you clear it, they go away.  Future vists see the level altered slightly to reflect what you've already accomplished.  For example, in the second level, a number of fair maidens are being carted away in a factory.  Once the issue is resolved, the women are obviously gone seeing how you saved them, but it kind of ruins the atmosphere a little.\n\nAgain, nitpicking and critiqueing classical art.  Shantae is worth a playthrough.  It's a tad on the short end but don't let that detract from the quality of the game you get.  \n\nTL:DR If you're still pissed at Mighty No. 9 and need a platformer to scratch the itch that disaster promised, then Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is here to fix you right up.", "timestamp_created": 1483763322, "timestamp_updated": 1483763322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29076835": {"recommendationid": "29076835", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994953223", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483770079}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, feels like an old school platformer with enough stuff from the new age to make it a complete package.

The story is weak and uninteresting apart from some cool characters and nostalgia from the older shantae games. \n\nThe game is also not the best platformer I have played. Alll tough the games has great controls and shantae is wonderfuly animated. The game can not stand on itself by just having good controls. The game suffers from some wierd level deisgn issues and som incredibly frustrating boss patters. that does not mean shantae is however quite easy for a platforming game. The game gives you so much to work with that you should never feel the game is too hard to finish. It is a great beginner entry tough for the series and bring people easily into the series. Its a great starting point. \n\nBut with all its flaws I still recommend shantae based on both the astethic and simply that it is not that bad of a game. the biggest issue to me is the content available at its current price (06. january 2017) The game is quite expensive for what it gets but may be worth its asking price later with DLC or extra content.

Well look no further then Shantae: Half-Genie Hero for an example of how both kick starters and platformers can be done well.

Risky's Revenge was solid and improved a lot of the gameplay, and I became a bit excited when I heard that Shantae and the Pirate's Curse was coming out. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse was absolutely one of the best games I've ever played, so when I found the option to kickstart a new entry to this series which I've become really fond of, I absolutely did.\n\nAnd it delivered.\n\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero is an incredibly solid entry into the Shantae series. While the pixel art of the previous games was amazing, I really do like this new art style, and I'm a sucker for 3D backgrounds with 2D characters. The game is really pretty, keeps up with the silly quirky story and characters I've come to love, has great platforming, and is absolutely a worthwhile sequel.\n\nThe game improves upon a few things from previous entries. One of the biggest problems in the first two Shantae games was how long transformations took for the amount of times you needed to use them. Transformation dances took a LONG time, and really took you out of the moment. To be completely honest, the best part of Pirate's Curse was how there were no transformation dances. The Metroid-style pirate items they used as a replacement made the action smoother and more enjoyable. Half-Genie Hero did take a page from this to an extent, and made transforming MUCH easier and quicker, especially with the optional Metronome item that increases the speed further, but the best thing they did was triple the amount of dances Shantae could perform. This gives the player many options on how to tackle a puzzle, and while I think some could have been utilized further than they were, I really appreciate having so many creatures to transform into! I really feel like they hit the sweet spot of Shantae having her signature transformations while keeping the gameplay smooth.\n\nIn terms of music, Half-Genie Hero has definitely gone more electronic than its predecessors, but in a good way. It's very lively and really gets your heart pumping. It makes you feel good to play while listening to it. I think good music is a very important component to making a game enjoyable, and the Shantae series has always delivered on this. I love the track for Mermaid Falls especially!\n\nThere are a few negatives, of course. I feel that some of the unlockable items are utterly useless except for achievements (a lot are just attacks for your animal forms, which generally are very weak and serve little purpose). There are also times where I would get stuck in an area after a puzzle and need to exit the entire level just to get out of that room, or going into a new room would totally screw up my camera requiring exiting the level as well. I also really miss dungeons, which were a Shantae staple up to this point, but the new level-based design really wouldn't have allowed for them the same way, so I can give them a pass on that.\n\nIn terms of gray areas, things that some people might like and some people won't: There is a LOT of backtracking through levels, and its really hard to avoid some enemy attacks. You're going to get hit and need items to restore your health. Both of these are really common in all Shantae games though, so they're just kind of expected at this point. I didn't mind backtracking in this game as much as games like Pirate's Curse or Risky's Revenge, though, where you have to go back through entire dungeons to find stuff you might have missed. I also really don't like the TOTALLY CAPS YELLOW TEXT that appears in a lot of dialogue. I just feel it shows up way too often, but it's really not a dealbreaker to a lot of people.\n\nOverall, I think I would still consider Pirate's Curse to be the better game. I think its puzzles, bosses, and levels were more fun, and it had a really good story as well as some interesting bombshells, whereas Half-Genie Hero's story falls a little flat as far as these games go. That said, Half-Genie Hero is no slouch, and has been an overall great game that I had a really good time playing.\n\nWhether you're a fan of the series or just want to try it out, I recommend Shantae: Half-Genie Hero as a very solid platformer with wonderful visuals and music, and I recommend checking out the other games in the series if you can!", "timestamp_created": 1483717995, "timestamp_updated": 1483717995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.791664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29062173": {"recommendationid": "29062173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090373469", "num_games_owned": 2250, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483993865}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6211\u4e0d\u662f\u753b\u9762\u515a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u753b\u9762\u7ec8\u4e8e\u4e0d\u662f\u50cf\u7d20\u4e86233\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u5e94\u8be5\u7b97\u662f\u7c7b\u4f3crabi-ribi\u7684\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1483715530, "timestamp_updated": 1483715530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504926", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29056321": {"recommendationid": "29056321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046421303", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498070906}, "language": "english", "review": "Really cute and interesting game. \n10\\10", "timestamp_created": 1483697874, "timestamp_updated": 1483697874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419845", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29054161": {"recommendationid": "29054161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010332925", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483520346}, "language": "english", "review": "Here's my review of Wayforward's Shantae: Half-Genie Hero.

The game stand on it own. \nShantae is the guardian genie of the town and spend her days solving problems and stopping pirates. After a strange dream followed by a pirate attack, Shantae set off again to save her town.\n\nThe story is straight forward. Not as much character development as previous games, but it felt like a good game for new players to jump onto the franchise.\n\nGameplay: Shantae can jump and hair whip her opponents into submission. As a Genie she can dance and transform into various creatures to gain access to new areas. You can buy upgrades for Shantae hair whip at the item shop and also buy magic spells. The magic spells have always seem to break the game. If you're a completionist  than you're going to upgrade all your magic and with magic that can make you invulnerable, well let just say some bosses become a cake walk. But they give you option in the menu to disable any upgrade if you feel the game is too easy.\n\nFinal Comment: Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a good game for new players to start at, and veterans will be glad to see the return of loved characters.

Shantae's model is adorable...well all the female characters are adorable both their models and illustrations. It's so clean, crisp, and very colorful. With this new style, details like facial expression are very easy to see on these new models. Every character looks amazing. The characters/items really standout from the background. So it doesn't matter if you are playing this on a teeny tiny screen or your 55\" screen in the family room, it's going to look great. \n\nThe game ran smoothly.Everything Shantae does looks good. Same goes for enemies. There were some hiccups, not like lag or anything but some blinks of color in spots of the screen. This could be fault with something in the game or something on my end.\n\nThe levels were well designed. Many of them seem to be designed for several ways of navigation up until end in the event you miss some transformation or moves hidden along the way. On the topic of transformations. I enjoyed all but one, the one I'd have to say it is nothing more than a joke. \n\nI found the levels to be moderately difficult and some small spots kind of hard. Part of me wishes most was hard but at the same time given the number of times I treked back and forth in levels, I think perhaps moderate is for the best. If you are into time trials be it just finishing as fast as possible, getting all unlocks, or going for 100%(buying all shop items) There levels are large enough that they take a good amount of memorization and creativity to navigate them as quickly/efficiently as possible.\nThis game also rewards those have keen eyes for finding things in the levels/taking the time to get them. I found the Mermaid level to be my favorite level. Lots of jumps, its really big. Really pretty and cute. Spoiler, don't read unless you played game [spoiler] So sad that all the girls are gone after beating the boss, the level loses much of its charm, it would of been nice to have Mermaids/village girls in the background overseeing those croc guys on the hooks instead of the girls[/spoiler]\n\nThe last game's levels were bigger and everything was conencted. There was a lot more exploring. I really liked that bout the last game. I could care less for it all being connected but I really love big levels that can be explored because it really makes you feel like you found stuff rather than it just being inevitable that you'd come across it. \n\n\nI feel like Shantae's amazing hairproducts overshadowed the offensive spells, fire and electricity a bit. I would wager that if there were no basic atk upgrades that the fire and lightning spells would feel very relevant. In contrast to the shield and pike(swirling DPS) which can be used with your basic atks. Nonetheless its good to have variety. xD I almost never found out what they were because the last game stuff like that were consumables rather than learned abilities lol.\n\nI ended up getting all of the acheivements for this game. I beat it 3 times. 1st playthrough was 7hrs long 100%. The 2nd was 3hrs20min long, 100%, while the 3rd was 2hrs 14min 88%. The game was really enjoyable. I did leave wanting more. i felt that it was a bit short. Honestly I think whether it was a legit 20hr+ game or not, I'd still be left wanting. I'm looking forward to Risky's DLC which gives her, her very own campaign and unique abilities. So I will definitely be playing that whenever it comes out.\nUnfortunately I wasn't a backer because it ended by the time I even learned of this game. Seeing some of the other stretch goals really makes me pray this game does well and perhaps does some of them.\n\nPlaying as Rottytops, Sky, or Bolo all with their own unique moves sounds amazing. A new chapter (who doesn't love more playable content.) Lastly animated cutscenes that are fully voice....................*drools*   \nRealistically I hope for the chapter and characters the most.The stretch goals that were not met I'd definitely pay for if they were DLC. \n\n\n\nSo my only 2 real complaints are these.\n\n1 I already covered, I wish the game was longer.\n\n2 I wish some of the transformations we gained had more time to shine with much larger parts of the levels dedicated to them. Some of them were pretty neglected.[spoiler] The underwater ones, flying, and most definitely the spider.[/spoiler]\n\n*3 need more Mermaids.\n\nAll in all this a great game that I would recommend getting. I hope it does well and that they support it in the future.\nI've been stepping away from larger companies/AAA and been playing more games from smaller studios and I have been very happy with that choice.", "timestamp_created": 1483452525, "timestamp_updated": 1483452699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28971856": {"recommendationid": "28971856", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998223683", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "last_played": 1515950630}, "language": "english", "review": "Straight-forward and fun.\n\nSome people may find the title lacking in the exploration department, but that does not mean this game is unenjoyable.\n\nFar from it, the pacing is well executed and there's always something to do immediately in short bursts after a main mission, such as seeking a hidden object or extra heart container or key item.\n\nGrab it when you can, have a solid 6 hours playthrough.\n\nYou won't be disappointed.\n\nWell, I guess you can be disappointed if a game is \"too short\" for you.", "timestamp_created": 1483439384, "timestamp_updated": 1483439384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28968066": {"recommendationid": "28968066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112744413", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500681088}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc0e8\ud0dc\ub294 \uc804\uc791\uc774\ub354\uc774\uc05c\ub300 \ubab9\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\uac8c\ub354\uc774\uc068\n\n\uc774\uc0c1\ud55c\ub178\ub798\ub098\uc624\ub294\uac70\ub9cc\ube7c\uba74 \ub9d8\uc5d0\ub4ec", "timestamp_created": 1483426681, "timestamp_updated": 1483426942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28964668": {"recommendationid": "28964668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136924246", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514235095}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like platformer games such as Mario, grinding for gracious rewards, and clearing achievements, you'll definitely like this game.

I really love the animation and art of this game. I'm hoping Risky mode will play similar to Shantae and the Pirate's Curse and look forward to all the future DLC. Game is short and straight foward can be easily completed under 2 hours if your trying to speed run it about 4 to 100%. First time play through for 100% can range from 7- 11 hours. This is simple platforming done right. Wayfoward have perfected the tight controls and have continued to use it. The Soundtrack is epic, Jake Kaufman is on point!\n\nNow then for my complaints:\n\n1) I wish Shantae would have kept her GBC dance mechanic with the different pose animations. It was very Zelda OOT ish would have been great to just press the 2-4 key commands correctly to activate your desired trasformation.\n\n2) Fighting moves! Also wish it stayed in!\n\n3) The Real \"Harpy Talon\" I miss one shotting monsters ingame !\n\n4)Squid Smith - For obvious reasons <3\n\nOverall this game to me is a 9/10, it could have used more content on release!

However, you're never forced to play any stage from beginning to end more than once, as you can get the ability to warp between all 3 parts of level and also drop out of the level at any time, keeping whatever new items you've grabbed. While it sounds a bit tedious to backtrack, the aforementioned warping plus the added mobility of your new transformation abilities really cut down on the time it takes to backtrack.\n\nThe story plays out like a day in the life of Shantae, with all the offbeat humor and cute babes intact from the rest of the series. It's nothing revolutionary, but it makes a lot of shout outs for longtime fans of the series, in addition to serving as a great introduction to the world of sequin land for those who haven't played Shantae before.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game with loads of speedrunning potential. It would be apt to compare it to something like a theme park ride. A rather long wait for an ultimately short experience, but with theming and entertainment so good, I can't help but want to go again sometime later.

I would have happily joined you had I known how awesome the Shantae series was, but I came late into the game, and it was only shortly after the campaign ended did I take the time to enjoy Risky's Revenge and The Pirate Curse. Playing those two games, I've come to expect a lot from this series in terms of its artstyle, soundtrack, and gameplay. Needless to say, this game has exceeded some of my expectations while underwhelming others.\n\n[h1]The Artsyle[/h1]\n\nRight away you can tell this game is beautifully drawn and the characters are well animated. The colours, the movement, and even the backgrounds are vibrant and beaming of life. I don't usually pay attention to backgrounds, but I can see how much time and attention has gone into them along with the smooth character animations.\n\n[h1]The Soundtrack[/h1]\n\nAlthough most of the music is rearranged and redone, the Shantae soundtrack continues to match the levels and the dialogue moods perfectly. None of the new music really stands out as super catchy and memorable, but when they are used for specific moments and levels, it composed well enough to immerse you into the situation.\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\n\nAs much as I love the aesthetics for this game, I feel like the gameplay has taken a stepback. A lot of long times fans come to expect a more Metroidvania kind of structure to the levels and worlds, and for me this more level select method is a better for backtracking. There were times in previous games where I just got lost easily and felt like some stages lost their importance after a while.\n\nThankfully the levels are all simply structured to have three stages each, along with a few obstacles you can't get past until you earn an animal transformation. I can see they wanted to focus on the use of them along with making the game more accessible to newcomers.\n\nSo while the puzzles and extra sections are a ton of fun to figure out in terms of using the right transformations and abilities, I feel like the selection of transformations was overwhelming. There were too many transformations that could have been consolidated into less animals with more abilities as opposed to one animal with one unique ability each. I get excited learning a new ability and this game didn't seem to reward my experience as much as I'd like because you barely ever get to use your new abilities that often except for maybe one or two situations that call for them.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\n\nAll in all though, I still had a ton of fun with this beautifully designed platformer. I patiently wait for the DLC that is already available for backers *shakes fist* and look forward to more of what WayForward can come up with in the future. \n\nI give this game a solid 7/10. The art, music, and levels are well crafted. Learning and using new abilities felt underwhelming when they were horribly underused, but the game makes up for some of these flaws for having a decent level of difficulty in puzzle solving and its exciting boss battles.\n\nOn top of all that, I know that Shantae stories are usually meant to be light hearted and on the Saturday Morning cartoon side, I still can't help but feel like there could have been more to it than what was presented. There were moments where the story could have had some strong themes elaborated on. [spoiler]I was severely disappointed that the evil Shantae section was over as soon as it started. Maybe a level being inside Shantae's heart or something would have been nice. Like a good challenge to rid the evil that she's been inflicted with, instead of just having all these characters monologue at her saying how much they care for her. That would have been better if it was a reward to a one time level in the game.[/spoiler]\n\nBut I digress. Gameplay is king in Shantae games and having the story skimped out on is not a huge loss since they're not usually known for their stories alone. All in all a fun and exciting game that is good for its length and what it offers. Replayability is debatable and more geared towards a speed run, but we shall see what gets add for DLC later on!", "timestamp_created": 1483402560, "timestamp_updated": 1483402560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28949249": {"recommendationid": "28949249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043831554", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482971684}, "language": "french", "review": "Plus simple que les anciens mais l'ost est toujours aussi agr\u00e9able \u00e0 \u00e9couter et la qualit\u00e9 globale du titre fait de ce nouvel opus une r\u00e9ussite", "timestamp_created": 1483378695, "timestamp_updated": 1483378695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28947786": {"recommendationid": "28947786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028612780", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 432, "last_played": 1516154950}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay... I have no idea where to start. Shantae and The Pirate's Curse amazed me. Half Genie Hero astonished me. I have literally tried for hours to find the right things to say and give this game a proper review, but I'm at a loss. There are just too many good things and not enough bad things to say about it. Nonetheless, here are my personal pros and cons...\n\nPros: \nAMAZING GAME\nAdorable characters\nWonderful visuals and animation\nJAKE KAUFMAN'S MUSIC\nExtremely fun gameplay\nShantae's voice\nDecent game length\nGiga Mermaid was such an awesome boss fight!\nShantae\n\nCons:\nI sometimes felt that having to transform so frequently stalled gameplay.\nNot enough spoken dialogue for our favorite lil genie girl.\nSome of the fan art was... weird :P\nI was initially disappointed at how Shantae goes off-center of the screen when running through Scuttle Town. I was\nmuch relieved to see this wouldn't be the case throughout the remainder of the game.\nLast but not least... I really don't like how the background of the stages adopt a blue fog after you've completed it. It especially hurts the Mermaid Falls' appearance... there goes my prerry sky and clouds.. :(\n\nI feel really awful that I wasn't aware of the kickstarter campaign. I had no internet at the time, but I would have gladly pitched $100 to this game. I also feel awful that it was gifted to me... and my friend got it on sale. I would have wanted WayForward to get the extra $2. Every little bit counts, and it certainly shows in this game. I love Shantae and I love WayForward for making this amazing title happen. An amazing series with an amazing character, Shantae Half Genie Hero is a continuation of some of the best games I have played since the rest of the gaming industry went nuts on us.\n\n9/10\n",

If you have all the upgrades (which doesn\u00b4t take a lot of work), you\u00b4ll lateron barely have to dodge any enemy attack, since heart drops are also frequent. To be fair, I COULD of course have deactivated some power ups in my inventory to set up a fitting difficulty level for myself...\n- you\u00b4re able to exploit some powers to get some huge advantage, for example (Spoilers!) [spoiler]you can use the Super Mega Puff-Thunderbolt combined with the Magic Tiara to float forever. With this method, I managed to finish the final slide level at the very end by just holding one button continuously and just floating through the stage[/spoiler]\n- the game is a bit too short\n\n[spoiler]What I love is that the gallery shows TONS of great concept art AND fan art (no matter the quality, which is nice since it really shows how much the fandom loves the game). [/spoiler] I also gotta find hout how they managed to make all those 3d models so painterly, must be a combination of great textures and good shaders, hmm...\n\nNevertheless, it truly matched my expectations and I know that I\u00b4m going to listen to the soundtrack for the next few weeks while drawing some of those cute monster girls, especially that percious bone spider lady < u <", "timestamp_created": 1483362737, "timestamp_updated": 1483362737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28937338": {"recommendationid": "28937338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006679454", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483359953}, "language": "german", "review": "Eigentlich ein gutes Spiel.

Unlike previous Shantae games, almost all the songs in the sountrack are not remixed and are completely new (one of them being Burning Town). The characters are humorous and lovable, just as usual.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Half Genie Hero is a very fun and enjoyable experience. The platforming and quests aren't very difficult. The game itself isn't very difficult either; at most, something in a boss battle catches you off guard but when you try again it's simple. The game is very linear, and there are no dungeons or labyrinths unlike previous Shantae games. Despite these differences, the game is still extremely fun to play and I see it as WayForward trying a new, fresh approach to making a Shantae game. Half-Genie Hero still has its fair share of backtracking to collect secret items, though.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this game is the amount of content. It feels a bit short. The game also has a weaker plot structure compared to the other games. My first playthrough of the game, collecting everything, took me approximately eight hours. There are always the achievements, though, and you'll probably have to play the game some more if you want them all. The game is good, though, so no trouble. Also, additional downloadable content for Half-Genie Hero is scheduled to come out soon. It looks really interesting and will add more things to do in the game.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Half-Genie Hero to anyone who likes Shantae, platformers, or anyone who just wants to play a well-made game. The game has a bit of an arcade feel to it, kind of like Mega Man, and is very entertaining and simple to just pick up and play. While the game may seem short, extensions will be released in the near future. The game is definitely worth playing (especially multiple times) and I suggest picking it up and experiencing it yourself, too.\n\nedit: a few soundtracks were remixed", "timestamp_created": 1483322781, "timestamp_updated": 1483631228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585364", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28924283": {"recommendationid": "28924283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355196380", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483861826}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u9019\u904a\u6232\u592a\u6709\u610f\u601d\u4e86\n\u6211\u5f88\u559c\u6b61\u9019\u500b\u5973\u4e3b\u89d2\n\n\u6574\u9ad4\u984f\u8272\u52d5\u4f5c\u90fd\u5f88\u8212\u670d\n\n\u883b\u53ef\u611b\u7684\n\u4e0d\u904e\u904a\u6232\u5f8c\u4f86\u6108\u4f86\u6108\u5403\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e86\n\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u559c\u6b61\n", "timestamp_created": 1483322669, "timestamp_updated": 1483322669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28922652": {"recommendationid": "28922652", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975270677", "num_games_owned": 857, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503535305}, "language": "english", "review": "a kickstarter that actually delivered what was promised", "timestamp_created": 1483318298, "timestamp_updated": 1483318298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28921820": {"recommendationid": "28921820", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993214769", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483316575}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a big fan of this series.

Some aspects and mechanics recur, but every single game is made up of those \"classic\" elements mixed evenly with the developers tossing new ideas up into the air and seeing what sticks. But it feels like they rarely test these things(except to avoid bugs), as long as nothing's outright breaking the game, it stays in, and the final test of whether it's actually fun or functional, is left for the game's buyers to figure out.\n\nFor instance, we've got the shapeshifting from Risky's Revenge back again, this time with even more forms. But there are a couple of forms that you'll never actually use(outside of their mandated one or two applications for gaining bonus items or quest items), because their uses are either extremely niche(elephant, spider and mouse, looking at you) or heavily overlapped with another form. Some also feel like they weren't tested much, since the Bat allows you to trivialize large parts of some areas(sky bridge in the desert, hello to just flying past all those platforms).\n\nBoss fights also still feel spastic rather than tactical. I'm sure I'm going to get the usual \"git gud\" comments for this, but in some platformers, I can go into a boss fight, and after screwing up one or two waves, I can go: \"Oh, okay, this is what they want me to do.\" And then sure, I may lack the brains or dexterity to actually do it, but I can always see the IDEA. In HGH, there are some attacks where I just can't see HOW to dodge them, some bosses where I just can't figure out their mechanics(what actually triggers the Tinkerbrain popping up its canisters?) and the game also suffers a bit from some things that look good being a bit counterproductive.\n\nIn the case of boss fights, circular boss arenas are VERY neat, since they basically give you \"infinite\" horizontal space without any screen scroll, but it makes it hell to judge the distances of something rolling towards you, and when there's a LOT of stuff in the middle of the circle, like in the final battle, it can be hard to see projectiles spawned on the other side of the circle before they're all the way past the clutter and way in  your face.\n\nIn general, the improved graphics also feel like they make things a bit more vague. It's less \"sharp\" where spikes end and where they begin, or what parts of a heavily animated flame projectile actually burns you. I mean, it looks GREAT, not denying that, but it feels like if you're gonna do that in a platformer, you should be a bit more forgiving about hit areas. \n\nIt also feels like there's no \"good\" difficulty in the game. Like, again, I enjoyed it, but I never really felt challenged except by instakill spikes in a couple of areas, and that's not the sort of challenge that appeals to me(seriously, WayForward, the final dungeon of Pirate's Curse was a mistake. PLEASE don't try to recapture any of that. Ever.). But unless you intentionally avoided upgrades and heart holders, it just feels like you can brute force your way through most areas, chugging a few consumables when necessary, and the same for the boss fights. \n\nOn the one hand, a bit more challenge would make it feel a bit more satisfying when beating an area, but on the other hand, I appreciate that if I really get stuck on doing something \"right\" I can just power through it with potions.\n\nI'm also not sure how I feel about the new approach to travelling, with the world map and warp dances. It makes everything feel easier, backtracking is considerably less of a pain, but it also makes Sequin Land feel less like a world, and more like a series of levels. But that's probably a personal thing.\n\nFinally, there are a few technical issues, mostly related to some animations \"chopping\" a bit, sometimes characters flicker partway through animations, etc. but it's pretty rare. It's almost completely isolated to the world map screen where Sky, Wrench and Shantae sometimes behave a bit oddly.\n\nSo ultimately, the verdict is: It needs polish, and in some cases issues that have been showing up in Shantae games since Risky's Revenge need to be recognized as issues and addressed, but it's got so much heart that I can't pretend I don't love it. This was money well-spent for me, and it will be for anyone else who likes the Shantae games. Because like me, I bet you've spent half an hour listing all the things that could be fixed about Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse, but then you finish by going: \"I loved the game anyway. How did they manage to make a zombie so cute?\"\n\nYou know, unless you have no taste and don't agree that Rottytops is best girl.", "timestamp_created": 1483295494, "timestamp_updated": 1483295494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720220", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28910736": {"recommendationid": "28910736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015593223", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486766197}, "language": "german", "review": "Superschicke Animationen und Gameplay ist sehr variabel dank der vielen notwendigen Transformationen.

I liked the game, which seems strange considering my final vote on it \u2013 my final feelings lie somewhere in the middle, but Steam doesn\u2019t have neutral score, so I cannot use this.\nThe game certainly looks polished when you play it \u2013 characters look beautiful, music is fantastic and animation fluid. Game plays smoothly and responsively (usually, we will talk later about some forms...). The level design is good and most of the levels are blast to play. Transformation are fun and open a lot of new ways to move though levels, other power-ups and spells make fight interesting and give players a lot of options to dispatch enemies.\n\nSo far it seems like very nice platformer, doesn\u2019t it? However, the longer you play, the more cracks start to show. There are only few (hub, five main and final) levels, which wouldn\u2019t be a problem \u2013 game doesn\u2019t really have to be very long to be good and leave nice impression, but you can see that creators saw short length of the game as big problem and were afraid that it seemed to short. Most of my problems stems from methods they applied to combat this problem.\n\n- First, that five main levers? They are very interesting first time you play though them and nice second time, with some small changes in monster or trap placement. However, you better hope you will really like them, because you will be playing them over and over trying to find that missing upgrades necessary to progress your story. At this point I just cannot look at beautifully designed and interesting creepy factory level considering how many times I have to beat it. When you have to give players spell to skip parts of the world to get instantly to next level (you get that and this is immensely helpful, but still doesn\u2019t  eliminate main problem) you really should think if amount of backtracking isn\u2019t too big. At some point it just stop being fun (and I\u2019m a completionist type of player) and start to seem like artificially padding the game\u2019s length.\n\n- Instant death traps spanning entire sublevels. Well, they are not exactly instant death (you only lose some energy after failing and are moved to the beginning of challenge), but they are rather long with no checkpoints in the middle. It wouldn\u2019t be that bad, but they are designed for you to fail at least few times before you can play them from memory. Two of them remove most of your special skills and make you fall down slippery slope while jumping over chasm and avoiding barrels (don\u2019t know, maybe it is series tradition? Doesn\u2019t really seem fun), with some jumps timed in the way that you cannot really succeed on them without inhuman reflexes or precise knowledge coming from failing them before \u2013 and if you will, you will have to replay entire segment from the beginning.  Another one is \u201clava rising\u201d type of the level \u2013 you need to climb tower while instant kill condition rise from the bottom. This is classic platformer design, however even in Ninja Gaiden series it was clear where you should jump \u2013 Shantae sublevel is long and have tons of blind ends, making you constantly fail until you progress to almost the end and can play sublevel from memory where you should move to avoid moving into blind end.\n\n- These instant death trap type of sublevels? One of them comes just after final boss. It\u2019s extremely fun to have do trial and error long gameplay segment when you have just won final fight and want to sit back and relax while story unfolds ;-)\n\n- There is instant death sublevel build entirely on how unwieldy and full of inertia is one of the transformed Shantae\u2019s forms. I know that controls of that form are bad, you don\u2019t have to show me that so much ;-)\n \n- Lots of upgrades seem like afterthought \u2013 for example, special power of bat transformation is used exactly once and only to get relic that allows another (not really useful for combat) almost optional form to attack.\n\n- There is an upgrade late game (I think you get it for unlocking entire art gallery? Not sure) that gives you unlimited mana allowing for endless casts of spells. Doesn\u2019t seem too bad, strong bonus for completionists, until you realize it means unlimited instant full life heals, unlimited healing items spawn and unlimited invulnerability bubble spell.  Because of that final level consist mainly of instant kill spikes, while final bosses are a joke.\n\n- For the end \u2013 characters. They seem fun and interesting. They seem to know Shantae, but I have no idea how and why. If you don\u2019t know them from previous installments, there is pretty much zero explanation who they are, how they know Shantae and why are they friends/enemies.\n\nTo sum up -  I enjoyed most of this game, at least until more annoying parts came up, killing my enjoyment each time. It is a very nice game and I hope there will be next game in the series that will polish problems this one is full of \u2013 but at this point, my opinion is a little more negative than positive (I would really like to be able to choose neutral opinion in Steam review options).", "timestamp_created": 1483205962, "timestamp_updated": 1483206471, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28874884": {"recommendationid": "28874884", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970980626", "num_games_owned": 636, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483202754}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1483202850, "timestamp_updated": 1483202850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501597", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28870392": {"recommendationid": "28870392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003920085", "num_games_owned": 1024, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493866981}, "language": "english", "review": "Around $776k compare to $3.8mil.\n\nGoes to show talent on Kickstarter can be a thing.", "timestamp_created": 1483194489, "timestamp_updated": 1483194517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 208, "votes_funny": 57, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776556", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28869221": {"recommendationid": "28869221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013107436", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509388399}, "language": "english", "review": "Had great fun playing Shantae: Half Genie Hero!

It's like 4AM though, so I'm not sure how coherent this is going to be, but uh, here we go.\n\nFirst of all, I love the direction that they've taken the art style. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. The hand-drawn characters over the 3D backgrounds look very nice. Speaking of the characters, I feel that the more chibi-style is really cute. All in all, it's just a great game to look at.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic as usual. A couple of tracks really reminded me of Mighty Switch Force!, which y'know, makes sense considering Jake Kaufman composed the soundtrack to that too. I don't think he's ever produced a track I haven't liked.\n\nNow in comparison to the previous titles in the series, I do feel like Half-Genie Hero takes a couple of steps back in places, particularly the level design. I wouldn't really call the game a Metroidvania. The more exploration-based dungeons are gone and have been replaced with much more linear levels divided up into a few sections each followed by a boss. If I had to draw a comparison to something similar, it'd probably be Mega Man. (This certainly doesn't mean I think Mega Man has bad level design or that I think the level design in this game is bad. Really, it's just different.) The scale of the worlds also feels a lot smaller, especially in comparison to Pirate's Curse. I was a little surprised at how short they all felt, even on my first playthrough. I also feel like the game doesn't utilize all of the transformations enough. There are a couple that are really only used once and then never again. There are also a few that don't even really need to be used at all. Most of those are optional though, so it's not a huge deal.\n\nI've got a few small issues with the story, too. I'm sure others have said this before, but the game is sort of a soft reboot. There were some character development moments in Pirate's Curse that I was interested to see possibly get expanded upon, but the game kinda just ignores them. It's not really that big of a deal, though. It was just something I was kinda hoping to see. Something that does bother me though, is how disjointed the story feels at times. The events of the game never really feel all that connected and are more like random tasks that are just there to move the plot along. It doesn't really feel all that much like an adventure. The dialogue is great, though. I did enjoy the references to previous games and I laughed at most of the jokes.\n\nI know it probably sounds like I'm being too critical, but I really enjoyed the game. It just feels a little weaker compared to the rest of the series, in my opinion. On its own, it's a really great game and a hell of a lot of fun. If you've never played a Shantae game before and you're interested, this is a great place to start. I feel the game does a good enough job of introducing the characters and the world to newcomers. If you do pick it up and enjoy it, then I strongly recommend you check out the others as well. It's a great series and it's really a shame that it's still so relatively unknown.\n\nTo sum everything up, I feel the game takes some steps forward in certain areas and some steps back in others, but it's still a great experience. Give it a try if you're interested!\n\nThere's probably more I would like to say, but it's really late and I'm tired so I think I'm about done here.", "timestamp_created": 1483187836, "timestamp_updated": 1483188107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28864436": {"recommendationid": "28864436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077033302", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485765842}, "language": "english", "review": "My Review On dis bootyfull game.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fVl2Zl4Figg", "timestamp_created": 1483182103, "timestamp_updated": 1483182103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28861858": {"recommendationid": "28861858", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990182486", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510872492}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fun as fuck and FULL of character.

For example, trasformation dances, which was not in the last game, but comes back for this game. If your not a fan of platformers, I suggest avoiding this game.

Initially downvoted because of lack of content, and even now I feel like the base game only barely meets the $20 asking price, especially since there will be paid DLC in the future (unless you were a backer in which case it's all free). If you're looking to get into the franchise, I would VERY strongly recommend Pirate's curse instead, or even Risky's Revenge: Director's Cut since Pirate's Curse is a continuation of that story.\n\nPROS:\n-Platforming is fluid and satisfying.\n-Absolutely amazing soundtrack. Less tracks here than PC, but what is here is golden. My only critique is that the first run of the first level had vocals which I found distracting, but that same track is also played during the credits which is perfectly fine.\n-Transformations are more fluid than previous games, and there are many more of them.\n-New art style isn't bad (chibi isn't really my thing personally, I prefer pixel sprites and Inti Creates' art style from Pirate's Curse).\n-Humorous dialogue. I laughed out loud on multiple occasions.\n\nCONS:\n-Easily my biggest issue is the switch from the metroidvania playstyle. There are no dungeons, no save stations and no open world. HGH plays more like a Megaman game. You have stages divided up into a few areas that give you a save option between them. Stages can be replayed from the beginning to collect upgrades/items previously unattainable, and later on you get the ability to warp ahead to the next area of a stage if what you're looking for is in that area, but there is no backtracking to the previous area in a stage. If you miss something in the previous area you have to restart the entire stage (warp is handy here).\n-Overall less content than PC, as stated before.\n-Story is severely lacking. Rather than an overarching plot, HGH consists of several mini-plots, none of which are very interesting.\n\nIMO, the game feels like less effort went into building the game and instead that effort went into creating new assets and engine. Probably the reason Pirate's Curse was so awesome was because it reused so many assets from Risky's Revenge, and so much more effort was able to go into the game itself. If so, then I can only hope that the next game turns out to be at least as successful as PC was by reusing assets from HGH.\n\nAlso, I would absolutely LOVE to see the return of Inti Creates artwork for the next game.", "timestamp_created": 1483156250, "timestamp_updated": 1491874611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505374", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28853976": {"recommendationid": "28853976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029989429", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483011302}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u6c34\u6e96\u7a0b\u5ea6\u306e\u51fa\u6765\u3067\u3001\u4e00\u65e5\u3092\u8cbb\u3084\u3059\u306b\u306f\u60aa\u304f\u306a\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u6bd4\u3079\u308b\u3079\u304f\u3082\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u98a8\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30ce\u30a2\u3092\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3059\u308b\u3068\u8fd1\u3044\u3082\u306e\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3060\u308d\u3046\u304b\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u4e0d\u8981\u306a\u8981\u7d20\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3001\u6f54\u304f\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u305d\u304e\u843d\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308c\u3070\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002\n\n[b]\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u3067\u3057\u304b\u306a\u3044\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc[/b]\n\u524d\u4f5c\u300cPirates Curse\u300d\u3067\u3082\u76ee\u7acb\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u5411\u3051\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u3088\u308a\u5148\u92ed\u5316\u3057\u3001\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u300d\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u4f55\u7269\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044\u72b6\u614b\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306b\u3082\u3068\u3082\u3068\u306e\u611b\u7740\u304c\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u5358\u306b\u30c6\u30f3\u30dd\u3092\u60aa\u5316\u3055\u305b\u308b\u306b\u904e\u304e\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\n[b]\u7121\u99c4\u306a\u975e\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u8981\u7d20[/b]\n\u672c\u4f5c\u306f2D\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3060\u304c\u3001\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u306e\u4f4e\u3044\u5f37\u5236\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u9762\u3068\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u5b58\u5728\u3059\u308b\u3002\u3053\u308c\u306f\u79c1\u898b\u3060\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u672c\u6765\u306e\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u3068\u7570\u306a\u308b\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u7a81\u7136\u631f\u3080\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306f\u5927\u304d\u306a\u4e0d\u5feb\u611f\u3092\u899a\u3048\u308b\u3002Gears of War\u306e\u4e57\u308a\u7269\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u3067\u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30e9\u3057\u305f\u899a\u3048\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3060\u308d\u3046\u304b\uff1f Call of Duty World at War \u306e\u6226\u8eca\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306f\u3069\u3046\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3060\u308d\u3046\uff1f\u3000\u3053\u308c\u304c\u672c\u4f5c\u3092\u63a8\u85a6\u3057\u306a\u3044\u6700\u5927\u306e\u7406\u7531\u3060\u3002\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9\u6599\u7406\u306e\u5408\u9593\u306b\u3001\u9177\u304f\u4e0d\u5473\u3044\u53e3\u76f4\u3057\u3092\u631f\u307e\u308c\u3066\u306f\u305f\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1483154939, "timestamp_updated": 1483154939, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28853062": {"recommendationid": "28853062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245306088", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499287793}, "language": "english", "review": "The Game was fun it's not a broken rushed mess.

Pirate's Curse is my all time favourite platforming game, so I concede that I may be judging this game more critically due to the high bar its predecessor set. For the sake of simple formatting, I'll make a pros/ cons list. \n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The OST is really fun and varied - there are some funky, catchy songs mixed in here. \n[*] For the most part, the animation is great, especially on Shantae herself. Most of the animations have a certain bounce to them, which compliments the music.\n[*] The controls feel tight and responsive. \n[*] Being able to transform into a bunch of 'Shantae-ified' objects and creatures is really cool. It's certainly swooped in and stolen Momodora 4's '2016's Best Game With A Transforming Anime Girl' award. \n[*] The general tone of the game, in terms of presentation and writing, are really light-hearted and upbeat. The game has this sex-positive vibe without taking things too far, and I personally enjoy the sense of humour in the writing (e.g. fourth wall breaking). \n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The level design isn't very intricate. It's too often just a straight shot from left to right, with a few little extras to find here and there. In comparison, Pirate's Curse's levels felt more Metroidvania-ish in design, looping around or reusing rooms in interesting ways. \n[*] There's a lack of variety. Since transformations are this game's core mechanic, it's basically just a series of platforming challenges with slightly different rules introduced throughout (e.g. 'you can swim now', 'you can climb walls now'). Again, comparing to Pirate's Curse, those out-the-blue levels, where it turns into a runner, stealth or puzzle game, are almost non-existent. \n[*] The game's way too easy, and I'm not a person who usually cares or complains about challenge. There's just such an abundance of healing items, and enemies do so little damage. There came a point where I wasn't really engaging with boss fights, but instead just standing there, whipping constantly, because that's all I had to do to win. Once you have Shantae's hair fully upgraded, bikini armour and a few heart containers, enemies may as well not exist.  \n[*] Some of the transformations feel redundent (and I'm not including the ones which are redundant by design, for comedy). For example, (avoiding spoilers) I feel the first two transformations assigned to D-Up could easily have been combined to be one form. Transforming is a cool mechanic, but with so many, it slows the pace of the game down. I feel as though dropping some forms in favour of fleshing out some other's movesets would've helped the pacing of the game. \n[*] The backtracking feels like padding. I don't recall feeling this way about Pirate's Curse, so I'm not sure if there's just more fetch-quests here, or if the level design is part of the reason for this feeling. \n[*] The world-building is weaker than past games. The hub area, Scuttle Town, though more refined in terms of utility, feels more restricted and shallow. \n[*] There aren't any real narrative stakes. The episodic nature does work, but there isn't really anything tying it all together (unlike Pirate's Curse, with both Risky's and the Ammo Baron's plotlines). I was hoping [spoiler]the new town genie[/spoiler] would play a larger role, [spoiler]but that narrative thread ends way too early[/spoiler].  \n[/list]\n\nI feel bad for writing so many negative opinions about the game. Again, I think I'm biased towards being critical because I hold Pirate's Curse really highly. I appreciate that Half-Genie Hero tried something a little different, rather than just rehashing the last game. It's obvious that I'd recommend Pirate's Curse above this game, but I honestly think it comes down to preference. Overall, it's still a fun platformer with an upbeat atmosphere and some compelling gameplay mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1483133366, "timestamp_updated": 1483133660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28843406": {"recommendationid": "28843406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020432468", "num_games_owned": 675, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498128082}, "language": "english", "review": "Sad to say this has been a bit of a let down.

Developers made prefect transition from pixelated graphics to 3D background mixed with cute and colorful 2D characters. Gameplay is solid and rewarding. I love new mechanics implemented in fourth shantae game (its a shame that some of them have only five minuts to shine or only one location then they are useful). I had lots of laughs and great time with this game.\n\nHowever... almost everythink about the story is weak or makes no sense at all. Great example is the way you get \"Light shard\" (look it up if you want since I dont want to include heavy spoilers here). Main story seems great in concept but it seems like devs didnt knew how to support this plot and it is a big waste in my opinion. For example the trapdoor in workshop from the every beginning of the game is never mentioned secound time.\nStory in previes game \"Shantae and The Pirate curse\" made perfect sense and was done masterfuly. This is nowhere close to it. Even final boss had 2 different fights before, verion when you didnt collected all \"key\" items and when you callected them all.

Once you are decently equipped with pick-ups and upgrades, the game and boss fights do get easier.  This game is built around the same premises that keeps Super Metroid in the spotlight.  Super Metroid has good replayability and is as challenging as you make it.  Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, all the same.  This game is as challenging as you make it.  If you don't want the last fights too easy, don't collect everything or put everything to full use.

Risky's Revenge had a large world that was entirely open, but Pirate's Curse broke the world into islands containing a dungeon. Half Genie Hero only has pure levels.\n\nThe levels are mostly linear, with a few side areas you can explore if you have the right transformation. The transformations while fun, are too abundant and have the obvious consequence of having their roles overlap. Their usefulness depends on the player. If you care about optimizing your movents, all the transformations can help you blaze through levels and collect items. For regular and casual players, half of them will probably never see any use.\n\nOther than that, everything else is what you'd expect from a Shantae game. The character art is beautiful and animates nicely. The platforming is very fluid and flows really well. There is also an option to turn off items you collect. Don't want Level 3 Fire? You can turn it off and enable Level 1 if you want to use that. It's not a major thing, but I appreciate it's inclusion.\n\nJust keep in mind that this isn't a Metroidvania. It's a Mega Man game.

I went out of my way to look at other people's opinions on the game and reviews of the previous titles in the series, as well as look over the wiki a few times, all just to make sure I knew what exactly what I was talking about. Without further ado, here's my review (oh hey it rhymes !)\n\nHalf-Genie Hero is fun, really, really fun. \n\nThe gameplay is just great, with super smooth controls, rapid transformations that open up new paths, magic powers to use and abuse, and despite the level design being on the weaker side, levels are a joy to play over and over again, collecting all the things you can find, and speedrunning is just the icing on the cake. It is a shame the levels are completely disconnected from the main hub, it makes the world feel rather disjointed. A shame for an entry in a series that is usually praised as a good example of Metroidvania (and god knows I'm a sukker for Metroidvanias).\n\nGraphically, the game is gorgeous, pure eye candy (and i'm not saying that for all the lovely Jigglypuffs, IYKWIM). The lovely art direction is only an added bonus on top of some of the smoothest animations I've seen in my life. Every level is a joy to explore thanks to the clever mix of 2D and 3D. It's just a shame that most of them are rather generic, with a port, a jungle with waterfalls, a desert, a volcano...the real standout level was the magic carpet ride, which isn't something you see everyday.\n\nMusically, it's also great, with many catchy tracks that don't feel the need to venture into 8/16 bit territory to be good. Jake Kaufman's the man when it comes to making great music, and I'm happy to say he delivered big time with his work on Half-Genie hero. The mermaid factory theme has to be my personal favorite, along with the boss fight theme. Sound design is also neat, it's very satisfying to fight enemies and hear them burn or get crushed.\n\nThe story is pretty weak, however. It's kind of all over the place, with mini-plots that don't go anywhere, and no real big narrative to string it all together. Characters get introduced only to be ignored or forgotten, and it doesn't make a strong impression. For what it's worth, the writing is funny and the interactions between characters are great, and the whole thing can be ignored, but it's a shame that a game like this couldn't give its story more attention. It's all over pretty quickly, as is tradition with games designed with speedrunning in mind. \n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game, even if you're not a fan of the series like me before playing it. I'm going to give Pirate's Curse a look one of these days, and I'm definitely looking forward to the extra content coming to HGH in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1483056198, "timestamp_updated": 1483056198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28808976": {"recommendationid": "28808976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061913320", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484074940}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, lots of exploration!", "timestamp_created": 1483054364, "timestamp_updated": 1483054364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28808160": {"recommendationid": "28808160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200071745", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512840376}, "language": "english", "review": "The Game it\u00b4s great but we need:\n\n- FIX THE SPANISH TRADUCTION!!!

The level design is superb, the music is fantastic, the visuals are gorgeous, and the characters are likable. Add those with one of the most unique and well-designed protagonists in gaming, and you get one of the finest games of the year. Unlike the previous installments, Shantae travels via map rather than a connected overworld. Keep this in mind if you were expecting more of a Metroidvania style game. Each area of the map counts as a chapter, with each chapter having a seperate plot, making it somewhat akin to Kirby Super Star. Assuming the player is a completionist, the game shold take roughly around 6-8 hours. Some may feel this is too short, but for me personally, I think it's fair for it's price. I do wish, however, that Risky Boot's story was availabe at purchase, and that Hero Mode gave the player access to ALL of Shantae's transformations and transformation attacks. Other than that, I find it hard to find any notable criticisms with the game itself. What I think this game really did well at was achieving it's own identity.

Half-Genie Hero is a good game in its own right, but IMO it's a big step down from Pirate's Curse. The transformation dances from the original game and Risky's Revenge are back, but many of them feel shoehorned in and don't serve much purpose outside of getting an item here and there. The level design is much more linear and straightforward compared to the previous entries, and dungeons with maps and keys are completely absent. Even so, there are still plenty of secret items that you can go back and find throughout the levels.\n\nThe bosses are a lot of fun but also pushovers, it's true that these games have never been particularly difficult to begin with but I think even by the series standards this game stands out as being the least challenging one yet(Hardcore mode update rectifies this). As far as story goes, it still retains the charm and humor from the previous games but there's not really any continuation from Pirate's Curse, as if all the character development and events that occurred never took place. The game acts more like a soft reboot.\n\nDespite everything, I still think it's a good and very fun game, I definitely recommend it if you're a fan of the series. Music is top notch, controls are tight, the game looks great and DLC is coming in the near future that'll let you play through 4 additional campaigns as other characters, so that may alleviate some of the issues.", "timestamp_created": 1483045805, "timestamp_updated": 1489242621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28804777": {"recommendationid": "28804777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100851076", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514878013}, "language": "english", "review": "Like always, I enjoyed the writing and quirky story behind Shantae series from Wayforward. I played Shantae games for the comedy and how the characters developed around them.

Still the graphic is excellent (even though I experience diagonal screen tear in my laptop) but it's undeniable that the game is beautiful and the animations are smooth.\n\nBut for some reason, I felt that this time, the game ends too early (unlike the the pirate curse) and story even though still full with funny memorable moments but it felt too short and suddenly before you know it the game is already ended. The gameplay is also a bit too easy this time with a very easy puzzle and easy bosses... (especially if you go for 100% completion)\n\nBut still overall, even though this is not the best of the Shantae series for me (so far the best is still the Pirate Curse IMHO), the game is still highly enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nHopefully next time, Wayforward can come out with a better Shantae game series with longer story, challenging puzzle, platformer and bosses but with the same charming aesthetic of 1/2 genie hero. :)", "timestamp_created": 1483045479, "timestamp_updated": 1483045479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28802881": {"recommendationid": "28802881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076176736", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482658094}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game.

It was the $18 price tag for the release special, but it would be $20 normally. I would recommend trying to find it on sale if you can.\n\nIt was pretty good. I had a lot of fun playing it and I'm glad to be adding it to my Shantae collection. It's a little bit expensive for the length, but I think it will be much more worth the price when all of the rest of the Kickstarter-promised features get added in. Like I said, I recommend it on sale and mostly to fans of Shantae.\n\nIf you own previous Shantae games, you should probably get it. If you haven't played a Shantae game before, I recommend you get Shantae and the Pirate's Curse much more.\n\nWarning: My review perspective will involve a lot of comparisons to Risky's Revenge (RR) and the Pirate's Curse (TPC) since I played all three this year.\n\nIt also has a lot of gripes and may come off as slightly negative.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe main way it deviates from the previous two Shantae games is that the levels are much more linear. Each level is divided into 2 or 3 separated sections that you have to sift through to get the collectables. It's much closer to TPC's island levels than RR's single connected overworld. No more dungeons, which is a little disappointing because I really like the previous games' dungeon designs. I think it completely loses its status as Metroidvania, even though TPC wasn't very Metroidvania. But that's fine.\n\nI felt that the platforming suffered. Shantae runs slightly too slow and jumps slightly too short to be satisfying. Platforming only felt good in monkey form. And unfortunately, transforming from human to monkey repeatedly was not great. It was much more jarring compared to RR's dance transforms because it requires more complicated inputs and briefly pauses the game. The platforming with Risky's items in Pirate's Curse can't be outdone.\n\nThe dance system felt sort of \"crowdfundy\" with a bunch of transformations thrown in just because they could. However the transformations were generally really fun to use once you got used to it, even if some were a bit too niche. My favorites were the monkey and crab mechanics.\n\nCombat was solid. The character hitboxes and attacking animations were super smooth and fluid. The max attack speed upgrade surpassed my xbox button pressing abilities, which is kind of absurd.  It also added the spellcasting system back from RR which is fun, but pretty much optional for most of the game. Upgrades allow you to become completely overpowered very quickly.\n\nBoss designs were pretty good, all had pretty cool designs and unique mechanics. However, I did not have very much fun with the final boss, or the final level design in general.\n\nThe overall difficulty is pretty low. It was the easiest of the three Shantae games I played.\n\nStory:\n\nI think it was almost a soft reboot?\n\nThe story was okay. I felt like it was clearly \"crowdfundy,\" meaning it was kind of garbled to fit a desired checklist. I had no idea what my main storyline motivation was for the first 80% of the game and I had to get invested in these little villain-of-the-week episodic stuff. But the episodic stuff was fun and amusing, so I was able to roll with it, even though some of the subplots weren't fleshed out enough. Shantae has never been known for its gripping story line, but I didn't think it was as good as the last two games.\n\nCharacters:\n\nAs with every Shantae game, the characters are super appealing. They are as endearing, flirty, and ridiculous as I expect out of Wayforward. The dialogue writing is clever and funny. My one big gripe is that all of the Sequin Town NPCs are just there to bombard you with hints for progression, which feels wrong. Also, some of the great characters don't get a long enough exposure because the story is so scattered.\n\nMusic:\n\nVirt's work is godtier. No exeptions. I downloaded the OST (free on his Bandcamp!) immediately.\n\nArtstyle:\n\nThe art is great overall. The character and world designs are top notch, and together with the music it makes a very pretty package.

I'll go into some details on the game however because its not flawless, no game is.\n\nShantae managed to make a game many times better than Mighty No. 9 on a fraction of the budget, beautiful artstyle with solid gameplay with a feel of a Saturday morning cartoon. This really was a kickstarter done right.\n\nShantae is not without its problems however, the main thing to point out in these flaws however is they've been persistant throughout all Shantae, so if these are a problem for you its more a problem with Shantae in general instead of this specific game:\n\n1) Game is linear compared to the past..... I guess? The past Shantaes were no Symphonies of the Night as far as exploration goes either, I don't know why it suddenly becomes a huge thing for this game. And in all honesty while they don't have alot of screens, theres still alot of stuff hidden in them for you to find using your powers which kind of ties right into the next major complaint.\n\n2) Alot of backtracking and fetch quests as \"content\":  I got no counter for this, its absolutely true. Even if the fetching is comical and corny on what they make you find, a spade is a spade. They do make you backtrack alot as playing in Hero mode proves. Most every shantae I've played however used this formula so its more a knock against Shantae than this game specifically.\n\n3) The game is short: my first play through was 6 hours, and has only gotten shorter in replays and hero mode.... once again however this is something Shantae has almost always been known for (I mean hell Risky's revenge you can 100% clear in 2 hours X minutes) Platformers are rarely epic 60 hour games unless they are a castlevania where most of that time is grind.\n\nWhat should be made important here is the game is put together very well and solid, while its a short experience its one that is great from beginning to end and is colorful and fun. I also sort of liked the format of this one that really felt like playing an old Saturday morning cartoon, as in each \"level\" feels self contained like an episode out of a show that all contribute a small thing that the last level feels like the conclusion of a season arc, it added to the over experience and made it fun.\n\nIf the game is a bit too pricey for you, just wait for a sale, but if you love platformers this ranks up as one of the best ones.", "timestamp_created": 1482970490, "timestamp_updated": 1486325283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580716", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28771731": {"recommendationid": "28771731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045640669", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512843822}, "language": "english", "review": "Every since I heard they were developing this game, I've been so excited to play it.

But I'ven't seen as much hand holding ina game as this. \n\nYou have a spell that shields you from almost everything, and then you have a spell that heals you completely. \n\nOn top of that, if you go around and collect all the keys to unlock the concept art gallery you'll get an item that gives you unlimited magic! Why so much hand holding? The Final boss is a joke by the way, regardless if the game has 2 endings (I think squid baron was harder) \n\nI like the art of the game, it's not pixel art it's stylized and it works nicely. The voice acting is pretty much ... the same (wish there was more) \n\nThere are some very tedious sliding levels, while the first one is ok, the second one is ok, I thought the last one was pushing it. Not in terms of skill level but rather how long it was, I ended up basically memorizing it to completion. \n\nAnd backtracking is another thing, there's virtually no reward for finding items in this game because you buy an item to make your hair do more damage. You buy a spell to completely heal you. You buy this, you buy that. The items that you find are usually worthless. The spider form is only useful in like 2 areas so why does it even have an attack? \n\nOn top of all of this the game lacks the comedy aspect that was delivered in The pirates curse. It's just so bland I found myself just trying to complete it as fast as possible. \n\nI'm only recommending because I still liked the game, it's just a slight dissapointment to the shantae franchise.", "timestamp_created": 1482929996, "timestamp_updated": 1482929996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28748060": {"recommendationid": "28748060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010728711", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514189040}, "language": "english", "review": "My review may contain minor spoilers, you have been warned. \n\nMany other reviewers are going into the specifics of why this game is a great buy, I pretty much agree with all of them so I'll save you time on that. I'll just talk about what I would have liked to have seen instead:\n\n- Closure on who's Shantae's mom (I have a feeling about who her father is)\n- Closure on Rottytops and her brothers finding out about their pasts (cliffhanger from previous game)\n- I would have liked to have learned more about Sequin Land's Sultana, but as of yet there isn't even concept art of her.\n- Boss Rush mode (I know the DLC for bolo, sky and rottytops weren't successfully funded, so I'm not worried about that)\n\nThis is really nitpicky stuff, I'm honestly grasping at straws to find any flaws with this one. If this isn't wayforward's last Shantae game, you can pretty much ignore this review, I'm treating it as though it is.\n\nOther than that, this is easily the best Shantae game in the series to date (I've been playing since GBC, still have my tinkerbat transformation!), the visuals are outstanding, the soundtrack is out of this world, the writing is still funny.

This map designs itself has really good view, like in 3D viewing. \n\nShantae's dance transformations allow players to re-explore the stage to collect hidden items, even the purpose is to achieve 100% game completion.

As a beginner for playing the game, transformations are what increases the player's desire to explore even further. Although there are unreachable areas that requires certain transformations to reach, that doesn't mean it's impossible to progress further.\n\nThe dialogues before every boss fight (probably except Risky Boots), makes me think that there are some hidden references.

Updated for the modern age and brought to Steam, the game is in full color (big shock) with a wonderful \"indie\" feel. Is it any good? Let's find out!\n\n[h1]Story: 7/10(Quirky and fun, but awkward pacing)[/h1]\nShantae's story in this game is fairly straightforward. It's definitely an indie-written story, but it wears that designation on its sleeve. The story itself is like the game: Quirky and fun. However, its pacing is somewhat awkward. It's not bad, but it seems to have some sections that drag on from a lack of direction (Thankfully, \"Bathroom Angel\" can fix that somewhat) and some that blow by.\n\nThere's also some funny references and 4th-wall-breaking. The writing itself is fantastic, giving everyone personality and charm. I just wish the story itself was paced a little better and the initial directions you're given at the start of each quest were clearer, but nothing in the story has made me consult a walkthrough yet.\n\n[h1]Characters: 10/10 (YESYESYESYESYESYESYES)[/h1]\nOK, I have to gush about the writing for the characters. There is so much charm and personality to the characters, ESPECIALLY Shantae. Shantae is a mixture of a straight-woman to the weirdness, a generic hero-type (played with), an airhead (without being a motor-mouth), and a bit of thickness. (She's not dense by any means, she seems pretty smart, just naive.) I like all of the characters and their dialogue is all great.\n\n[h1]Gameplay: 8/10 (Well-refined platformer with a bit of side-scrolling brawler)[/h1]\nShantae is evocative of the old-school Nintendo platformers, including some Metroidvania elements. You jump around like a maniac looking for platforms, look for every tiny hint to a secret/easter egg/new power-up, and some Castlevania-like brawling.\n\nShantae's also bringing some tricks to help make platforming better and uncover more secrets. She can use her Belly Dance (which has an adorable animation) to transform into different Forms, each with their own unique traits, jump height, attacks (or lack thereof), and special abilities. Most Forms have an upgrade to unlock a new attack, which is, unfortunately, not that interesting. (Mermaid Form gets a bubble, Crab Form gets a quick snap that clips through seaweed, Mouse Form gets a spammable-low-damage bite, and so on.)\n\nThe platforming itself is highly refined, practically to a science. The controls are tight and intuitive, Shantae's movement and jumping is consistent and controllable (You can adjust and correct your jumps mid-air, thankfully), and it's usually clear what you can and can't jump on. My only real complaint lies with a couple of her Forms, mainly with Harpy Form, where the controls become extremely floaty and nigh-controllable. Sometimes, the hitboxes can be a little iffy, especially with Mermaid Form where I've taken damage while close to (but not touching) an enemy that only damages you by touch because my TAIL got near it.\n\nThe brawling is very simple: One button makes Shantae slap a short distance in front of her (your generic Hair-Whip Attack) and another uses your Magic. It's very simple one-button combat (technically, two-button, but w/e) and works well.\n\nI think my current major complaint with the gameplay is just the insane amount of backtracking you have to do. This isn't anything new if you've played a Metroidvania-style platformer in the past 10-15 years, but it really drives the pacing into the ground sometimes as you run from place to place, running the same levels at least 2 extra times each just praying you'll see the one thing different you can do with a new Form or upgrade. Granted, I'm not huge into Metroidvania, so take this with a massive grain of salt.\n\nOne more minor complaint I have to get off my chest is the inventory. There's no quick-use keys, so if you want to use something, you have to go into the Inventory screen, select it, and Use it. This is a very minor complaint, considering this actually HELPS, since the Inventory screen pauses the game and can let you get your bearings.\n\n[h1]Music: 9/10 (Amazing Soundtrack)[/h1]\nThe music in this game is fantastic. It has that indie quirkyness to it without being grating. My only real complaint is that the music can get a LITTLE repetitive due to the Metroidvania nature of the game, forcing you to backtrack a ton and hear each track plenty of times.\n\n[h1]Art Style: 10/10 (Awesome, A Visual Treat)[/h1]\nThe art style in this game is absolutely awesome. It's 2.5D (meaning, gameplay on a 2D plane, but 3D models) with a very anime-esque style. In fact, this whole game looks like a playable anime. Everything has this cute-quirky style to it and just drips with personality. It's an absolute treat to look at, combining an old-school 2D game with a 3D art style flawlessly.\n\nAny the animations are just...AAAAAAAAAAA I LOVE THEM! Everything has this bouncy energy that brings the game to life. Shantae's idle animations are fun to watch, her Belly Dance is playful, just everything is beautifully animated.\n\n[h1]Conclusion: 9/10 (Fantastic)[/h1]\nSimply put, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a fantastic game. I'm rarely a fan of platformers, but Shantae has me absolutely entranced. I can't stop smiling at this game. Its fun old-school gameplay, energy-filled art and animations, just everything about the game oozes charm and personality. This was clearly made by developers who love their craft and wanted this game to be fantastic. While I haven't played any of the previous Shantae games (Nothing against them, just wasn't interested), this game seems to fit perfectly with the rest of them, but with some excellent modernization.\n\nIt's an absolute STEAL at $20. I can't wait to see how the developers will follow up to this fantastic platformer.\n\nMaybe a Squid Baron standalone with $0.99 Shantae DLC is in order too. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1482882182, "timestamp_updated": 1482882258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28731081": {"recommendationid": "28731081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275355365", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503636438}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La continuaci\u00f3n del anterior juego de shantae y uno de los juegos que m\u00e1s esperaba este a\u00f1o, dejare claro que es lo bueno y lo malo del juego pero quiero dejar en claro que en general me parece un buen juego. :) \nPros:\n-La banda sonora es absolutamente maravillosa.\n-Visualmente est\u00e1 muy cuidado, los colores son preciosos y muy vivos. \n-Se incorpora la mec\u00e1nica de las danzas y transformaciones lo cual le da m\u00e1s variedad al gameplay.\n-Es un juego muy f\u00e1cil y divertido.\n-Las plataformas y en general la jugabilidad es bastante satisfactoria.\n-Vuelve a aparecer Rottytops y es best waifu. :D XD\nContras:\n- Tiene una traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol completamente espantosa, frases sin sentido, traducciones literales e instrucciones confusas, si lo juegas te recomiendo encarecidamente que lo hagas en ingles porque da bastante pena la traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol y espero que  en un parche  pr\u00f3ximo lo arreglen. \n-El jefe final da bastante c\u00e1ncer y hay un par de zonas en el juego que personalmente sobran mucho. \n-Vas a hacer  mucho backtracking ya sea para completar el juego al 100% o para avanzar en la historia, lo cual puede molestar a m\u00e1s de uno. \n-Dura unas 7 horas si coges todos los objetos, quiz\u00e1s menos si  buscas los coleccionables hasta el final de la aventura, cuando tienes todas las transformaciones.

Not the best in the series, but I had fun anyway. \n\nThere were a couple of parts in the story that I felt were resolved too easily (deus ex machina moments) . WayForward could have easily tweaked the game to fix these \"convenient\" problem resolutions and given the game a lot more depth. I do wish they would have taken a darker turn at certain moments, but I suppose that I should remember that Shantae is a lighthearted series. \n\nThe transformations are fun, but a lot of them are pretty much useless (mouse, spider, crab, pot, tree, fish IMO). I wish WayForward would have either put more effort into making more levels that used the tranformations or just left out the ones I listed and focused on the others.\n\nI had a lot of fun in almost all of the levels. I feel that some had a lot of potential, but were not used to their full potential (hypno baron mansion). My favorite parts were the race up the tower and the carpet race. All in all, it was a good platformer.\n\nI wish that the supporting cast would have had a larger part in the game. In previous games, I felt that you got to see Sky, Bolo, and Rotty Tops a lot more. In 1/2 Genie Hero, Sky is basically just your ch\u00f3fer, Rotty is present in maybe three scenes, and doesn't really do anything, and Bolo I think is in maybe three or four parts. I was hoping that you could play as them or have at least a little more interaction in the game. We'll see if they put out DLC that lets you do that.\n\nThe music, as usual, is superb. I bought the soundtrack after my first playthrough.\n\nOverall, it's a good game. I've played every Shantae multiple times, and speed run it a bit, and despite a few flaws in the story and gameplay, it's overall a good game. I recommed you play it (and the others in the series as well).", "timestamp_created": 1482870898, "timestamp_updated": 1482870898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28724914": {"recommendationid": "28724914", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995578206", "num_games_owned": 829, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482867133}, "language": "german", "review": "1A Spiel, habe seit Monaten auf den Release gewartet, und nen key konnte ich nicht ab stauben da ich den Kick-starter nicht mit bekommen hatte... was solls, direkt am 20.12 gekauft und gesuchtet!  \n\nDie level sind recht kurz und \u00fcbersichtlich, aber da es wie ein Metroid-Vania aufgebaut ist, muss man viele orte erneut besuchen um alle Kr\u00e4fte, Herzen etc zu bekommen. \n\nDie Grafik ist echt sch\u00f6n umgesetzt und das Gameplay ist sehr fl\u00fcssig und l\u00e4sst sich super spielen.\n\nAlles in allem, top!", "timestamp_created": 1482869066, "timestamp_updated": 1482869066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28723757": {"recommendationid": "28723757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175746887", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482483505}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9664\u4e86\u753b\u9762\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u611f\u89c9\u4e0d\u5982\u524d\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u9519\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1482866940, "timestamp_updated": 1482866940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28722698": {"recommendationid": "28722698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012227320", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482674802}, "language": "russian", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPannIeww3E", "timestamp_created": 1482865109, "timestamp_updated": 1482865109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28720869": {"recommendationid": "28720869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000063459", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483642167}, "language": "english", "review": "This game's really fun and has lots of challenging levels with great upbeat music.

Personally I'd say Risky's Revenge is even a little bit better.\n\nOn the bright side they did progress from pixel art and have what I think is a great engine for the game. So perhaps there's some great potential in the future. The graphics, music and general movements are on point, although there are some minor bugs causing the game to stop for me from time to time. So overall it still plays great like a Shantae game. You get a lot of dances and the typical magic, which is very fun.\n\nWhere it gets insufficient and I suspect may be due to the kickstarter forcing them to implement so many elements to the game and thus not having enough time left, is the content and the story. The writing, first of all, seems a bit off. Shantae isn't a story focused game by any means but I thought this game story wise is especially shallow and did not portray the main characters as well as they can. Content wise you have so many powers and forms but there is very little content specifically designed for them, in some cases only one zone or none at all. Also, to inflate the content the devs added a lot of backtracing the the zones and since this game is no longer metroidvania style that's also not as good an experience as in previous games where revisiting zones and doing challenge dungeons can be so much fun. Another issue is boss difficulty tuning-- the later bosses are a joke unless you restrict yourself to not using any magic or item at all.\n\nI think if this game was a bit more polished story wise and had 50% more content (that's not backtracing) it would have been great. As it is I still can't hate it because it's still Shantae but I don't regret not joining the kickstarter either.", "timestamp_created": 1482821421, "timestamp_updated": 1482821566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28701445": {"recommendationid": "28701445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114697376", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481697554}, "language": "english", "review": "Got to whip my hair back and forth. 10/10 would recommend the game, not the song.\n\nSrs note, music and art is beautiful.\nGame is a lil repetitive and kinda short.\n\nUhhh, but it's supes fun.

It's a very beautiful platformer that feels just as good or better than previous Shantae games and also has some great level design that focuses more on linear megaman-style levels than those games more open Metroidvania or Zelda influences, and then lets that new focus down by adding unnecessary filler. I'm going to be comparing this game to the previous modern Shantae games quite a bit in this assessment, they are games that are pretty dear to me as far as modern-but-classic style platformers. Pirates Curse particularly I hold in very high regard, it's definitely the highest point where the series correctly iterated on the prequel and knocked it out of the park with the new skills. 1/2 Hero doesn't quite hit that mark.\n\nJust to be clear, the core levels are all great and a pleasure to play. The upbeat music (I really don't like the lyrical version of the main theme, but everything else is great) and flow of the game works exceedingly well when you are jumping and hair whipping enemies. That first time you finish a level and a boss feels great...but after you do that there's this middle time when you meander around doing fetch quests for various NPCs. If these quests were optional they would be much easier to stomach, but their quirky weirdness don't make up for the fact that it's clearly game padding. Instead of filling the game with interesting side stuff to collect, most of it is all there to progress the main story. These levels are not really made for exploration either, and there is no map to assist you for finding the hidden stuff. It's mostly just reading NPC dialog to figure out where you need to go out of the levels you've already been, going there to get the necessary plot item. It seems like this game is trying to have it's tight platformer levels and is adding metroid elements to extend it, rather than building them into the game naturally. It doesn't really work too well, the game would only be about 4 hours with just the levels, but I would definitely prefer that to all of the filler.\n\nTied into the monotony of the between-levels is that most of the transformations just aren't very fun to use. The Monkey might be my favorite, but it is criminally underused because many of the later game transformations make it redundant. A lot of the transformations accomplish *almost* the same thing, Crab lets you sink underwater, Mermaid lets you swim. Sometimes you need to be a crab to fit underneath tight spots but there would be no way to know that by just looking at a body of water. When this happens you would have to jump out of the water, go back to the land area, dance to the right transformation and dive back in. This kind of thing sounds trivial, but it's just one of the many quirks that annoy me about the transformations. The entire idea of pausing the game and dancing just to have access to a traversal element seems unnecessary. The game doesn't even use all of the buttons on a ps4 pad, they could have let you bind transformations to individual buttons. If you compare this to the sleek implementations of Shantae's abilities in Pirate's Curse it definitely falls flat. Add to the fact that the charge, triplejump, saber, pistol, and Hat were all just way more fun to use in that game and integrated into the main game more often instead of being used just for item collection. Some of the transformations in this game are used for literally one item and never again, while some of the powerups you get for Shantae's different forms like the Spider Venom or Mouse bite seem never used at all.\n\nAnother issue I have with the game is the plot, or rather the lack of one. The dialog keeps that Shantae charm found in the previous games, Shantae herself remains a good protag with the right amount of snark. It is however tonally all over the place compared to Pirate's Curse. This series has never been about the amazing writing or anything, but at least Pirate's Curse had a solid goal and a tone that remained consistent. 1/2 Genie Hero drops the ball on this, most of the stuff that happens is silly for silliness sake and there is hardly an end goal to speak of. There are times when I really appreciate the weirdness of this game and the character interactions, but it also uses that weirdness to feed into those mandatory fetch quests I was talking about earlier which is unfortunate. None of the chapters really have much to do with each other, they don't build towards anything by the end. I think the desire for this to be THE Shantae game to bring the series on modern hardware, as well as the expectations associated with a kickstarter game encouraged Wayforward to find a way to cram every Shantae villian into this game to its detriment.\n\nSo what does work? Why am I recommending it? I would like to emphasis I really enjoyed playing this game a lot especially when I was playing through each of its 6 levels for the first time. As far as Shantae herself goes minus abilities this game might be the best feeling one yet. The levels are all utterly fantastic in that special linear megaman way. Hair whipping feels great and I hum the music obessively in my day to day life. Every level is an incredibly varied and unforgettable platformer experience that mostly makes up for all of those shortcomings I listed. I am able to look past those annoyances and confidently say I love this game and you should definitely play it, just temper your expectations a bit regarding everything else. I honestly can't wait for a more Pirate's Curse style game to come out with this engine they have crafted, it would be truly incredible.", "timestamp_created": 1482790386, "timestamp_updated": 1482790464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28687383": {"recommendationid": "28687383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010859628", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484850103}, "language": "english", "review": "A decent platformer, but with it has its faults\n\nI was a huge fan of the previous game in the series, and I was very excited to play this, unfortunately some things feel like a step backwards rather than forwards. There, however, are a lot of things to love here: The art is fantastic, and is easily one of the best looking platformers you can play on PC. \n\nThe music, as composed by the great Jake Kaufman (Shovel Knight/Mighty Switch Force)  is generally top notch, although a few tracks (such as the last two parts of the game) I found very underwhelming. \n\nThe levels are extremely fun the first time through, they all have fun gimmicks to them that make them stand out among the others, but you will be doing a ton of backtracking to find items, which can feel like a chore, and make the levels feel very small after a while, I know it was done to lengthen the game, but it spreads too thin, and I'd have preferred a 3-4 hour game that stayed fresh than a 7-8 hour game where you constantly comb through the same areas.\n\nThe boss fights are hit and miss, not horrible for a platform game (a genre not generally known for good bosses, outside of megaman and metroid) but not as challenging or charming as they were in Pirate's curse.\n\nThe biggest positive of the game by far is the transformations, there are tons of forms Shantae aquires and they all have fun and unique properties that change up the game a lot, and they all look dang cute.\n\nI give this game a soft reccomendation, but hope there will be more that feels in line with Pirate's Curse in the upcoming Risky Boots campaign, as it was left feeling pretty dry at the end.\n\nStill, one of the better platformers on steam, and for 20 dollars it's not a bad way to kill a few hours.", "timestamp_created": 1482787396, "timestamp_updated": 1482788322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28686849": {"recommendationid": "28686849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103130204", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482784647}, "language": "english", "review": "Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a game that wastes my time and jerks me around.

This basically says to people who wanted to wait for a finished product and reviews, \u201cyour money is worth less to us than those who backed it\u201d.  [b]More on this at the bottom of the review.[/b]\n-Very little bang for your buck. I frustratingly played through this game in 8 hours, it is designed to be beaten in 4 hours. This is a 20 dollar game.\n\nDetails of this filth:\n\nI have invented a new term just for this game, which upon reflection can be applied to a lot of bad games.\nThis term is called, \u201cMonkey Island solutions\u201d what is a, Monkey Island solution you ask? It is when a game, not just point-n-click adventure games, ask you to perform a series of complicated tasks to do a simple objective but also in which none of the steps nor end result makes sense and cannot be deduced naturally. Some other people in the video game realm might call this, \u201crub the fish on everything\u201d syndrome.\nHere is an example from this very game: you must get the power, as a mermaid, to shoot bubbles. How do you do this? Well, one of the villagers tells you that only \u201celder\u201d sea creatures know this power! Well look at that, in town suddenly is the Grandma Blobfish (which earlier you had to find two tickets for her grandkids to go see a magic carpet ride via killing gator enemies with magic you must grind money for to unlock until they drop \u201cgator stakes\u201d to give to too villains for a ticket and that was only HALF of that quest).\n\nAhem, the example:\n\"We're gonna need you to get this blobfish a new hat so she can sing you a song and give you the mermaid shooting ability but to do that you must get the hat from a WACKY CHARACTER GUY that tells you to find ANOTHER WACKY CHARACTER GUY but to do that you first need to unlock the Mermaid form (several step subquest), combo into Harpy unlock (several step subquest), and figure out this cryptic clue that actually makes no sense (subquest to get clue)\"\n\nDo you see how this is a problem, how it is unfun to deal with and why guides are so popular for games today? This game is entirely like this, the whole game.\n\nLet\u2019s mention some gameplay; there is a point in this game in which you must control Shantae through a SPIKE MAZE using the WORST CONTROLLING form in the game, the Harpy. The harpy controls like a flappy bird clone but you can move forwards and backwards. She does not stop in midair, she always slightly moves forward which is a problem when this is happening:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=826681326\n\nSee these two blocks? They are rotating around each other, and before them there are a series of three columns that block the entire way from ceiling to floor (the floor also kills you) and you must step in between the middle set of these spike walls as it opens to wait for the next to open; all doing this mind you [b]while the harpy cannot hover in midair[/b] so you must constantly tap jump to flap while wiggling back and forth to not die in a space less than an 8th of your screen for a character that takes up 90% of said space you are safe. This section alone is so disgustingly made, so poorly thought out I almost quit the game right then and there; [b]and this is at the very end of the game, right before the big finish.[/b] Oh right, for good measure they take you back to the start of the level if you die so ya know, have fun backtracking through the level to get up to the point you died, only to then die again on the very next trap you have no idea is coming.\n\nThe examples I give above are not single instances, but throughout the entire game. This whole game is a huge mess of poorly thought out choices, obscure and often offensive puzzles, poor controls for multiple transformation forms, and a absolutely terrible check point system that will make you want to quit. [b]Do not buy this game.[/b]\n\n[b]Why backer exclusive content is anti-consumerism [/b]\n\nBacker exclusive content is anti-consumerism in pure form.\n\nWell fear not, for I shall explain; you see by offering 'backer-exclusive\" content the game devs are tempting you in parting with your money before a finished product is made. They are offering you promises for cash, this is anti-consumer.\n\nPro-consumer is waiting for a finished, final product. If you are offered a chance to wait for a product, to see if you would like it and to experience reviews then you are in the clear and so are the devs. Backer-exclusives can be grouped in with other scummy practices devs/publishers often use. Here is an example:\n\n\"If you buy this game now, you will get access to X thing! No one else will get access to X thing because they bought it AFTER the game was released.\" Can you name that anti-consumer practice? That's right, preorder bonuses! Buy now, get product later! Secure money now for nothing, offer a game that might be as good we promise ;). Sound familiar? In the above sentence replace \"after the game is released\" with \"after the game is funded\". Nice.\n\nA quick question to people that will come shilling in because of the bottom of this review: please riddle me this, how did games get made before kick starter?\n\nHow did a game get produced without the backing of a publisher, triple A or otherwise? How did indie games come into this world without the hand holding of kick starter? Through the blood, sweet, and tears of game devs everywhere.

Everything is familiar for fans of the series, maybe a little too much so in some respects, and if you're unfamiliar to the series and looking for a light metroidvania-esque platforming game that isn't too hard, you'll enjoy this.\n\nThe world is bright and colourful and the 3d background visuals are a pleasant departure from the standard 2d pixel art.  The soundtrack is pretty solid, as usual for the series.  Controls are mostly smooth, some jumps didn't feel quite as responsive as I'd like but good on the whole.  Though, Relic usage for animal transformations could be more seamless in game. On the topic of Relics, there are far too many transformations and not enough puzzles using them.  A few of the transformation upgrades only get used once or not at all.  There may have been plans to use these upgrades that never made it into the game, but it still feels like there's unnecessary clutter and it's disappointing to have useless abilities.  A lot of the magic you can buy from the store also isn't as useful as in past series.\n\nPlotline is disappointing.  Just... disappointing.  It's like the events of the previous game were completely forgotten.  Whilst I do enjoy seeing familiar faces like Sky, Bolo, Rotty and Mimic again, too many of the minor antagonists were reused from previous games in shallow ways and the culmination of the plot just felt very half-baked.  That being said, there is some witty banter and some enjoyable dialogue.  And some nice 'plot' as usual.\n\nThe level design is decent and there are some interesting concepts and designs, though the execution isn't entirely there.  Bosses... eh.  I think the game misses not having any dungeons whatsoever, though, and the difficulty curve is pretty nonexistent.  I've no major issue with the backtracking elements to the game, but I do think that the game spoonfeeds a little too much with regards to some of the hidden items.  The hinting system is pretty inelegant as well.  \n\nOverall, enjoyable.

It's definitely not an amazing game, by any means, but it's good throughout, despite some issues.\nThis is a 2-D platformer that succeeds in bringing in some Metroidvania elements, to a certain extent.\n\nPros:\n- Self-aware humor.\n- Good level design.\n- Colorful graphics and vivid animations.\n- Lots of power-ups and transformations to play with.\n- Soundtrack is catchy and memorable (for the most part).\n- Doesn't overstay its welcome (around 7-7:30 hours, which is perfect for this type of game).\n\nCons:\n- No map to see which places you've already explored in a specific level.\n- Way too much backtracking.\n- Obscure objectives.\n- Some transformations are redundant, serving purpose for only few specific locations.\n- Last stage has a rather big difficulty spike with poor checkpoint placement.\n- Last boss fight is painfully slow and annoying,\n\nOverall, the game is bigger than the sum of its parts. I did enjoy it and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good platformer with some solid exploration elements.\nIt's a shame the last stage and boss weren't so good as it left me with a bitter taste, though.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1482752536, "timestamp_updated": 1482752536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0,

This game involves a lot of backtracking, which is the reason I guess fans are disappoint. As a person who usually hates backtracking more than any other video game mechanic, I have to say this is the one of the few games that did it right.\n\nGameplay:\nPros-\nAs I tried to imply, I barely know much about Shantae or the gameplay so overall how I can describe this game as the love-child of the Paper Mario series and Donkey Kong Country. As I said, a 'lot' of the game revolves around backtracking, yet it honestly didn't feel at all like a chore. It flows well for this type of game as levels feel brand new or updated once you acquire more power ups and dances. My fear when I purchased this is that the animal dances were going to be used as gimmicks for obstacles and puzzles, but there are several situations where you can get through a level more efficiently than base Shantae.\n\nCons-\nThis game goes from delightfully challenging(while annoying on a few parts) to being way too easy. You'll get multiple hearts and food to keep them full forever later in the game, despite the x9 limit for each food. Combining her hair whip with the spike balls/scimitar magic could pretty much smash virtually every enemy away with ease. In fact, magic is immensely unbalanced in this game. You could literally just only purchase the weapon summoning and barrier magic then still beat the game with ease. The difficulty jump and lack of checkpoints can get annoying at times, if you fall off or run into a spike then 2-3 minutes of platforming is basically gone.\n\nStory:\nHow can I describe it? It basically feels like a Saturday morning cartoon. I don't mean that in a negative or positive way. The dialogue feels witty and the characters keep the liveliness of the game going. Even though I found it funny, I actually felt characters taking catastrophic events to lightly to be rather museless about. The main characters seemed a bit cookie cutter, but they were solid through and through. Even though it was mostly Shantae doing the work, you enjoyed the moral support you was giving from your friends. It's hard to go too deep into it without spoiling. The town NPCs felt like characters in the beginning, but then they reverted into mere hint givers. Overall, I did find it awesome how a simple anti-monster Beacon turned into genie corrupting war machine.\n\nMusic:\nOverall it was enjoyable to play through the game, but it didn't feel memorable aside from maybe the slide theme. Although, I can't get over Shantae dancing to the town theme.\n\nOverall:\nI give it a 7.5/10. Despite a lot of my nit-pickings(and a couple more I didn't mention without spoiling), there was nothing in this game that was game breaking. The platforming by itself is... decent. What saves the game is the versatile abilities and how you can use them to get through puzzles along with faster methods to defeat enemies. It also could've been 'much' longer, yet seeing how this is a Kickstarter game it's understand they had to use the funds they were given in such a little time.", "timestamp_created": 1482745625, "timestamp_updated": 1482745625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28663477": {"recommendationid": "28663477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065498513", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482740807}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished my first playthrough so i thought of sharing my thoughts. \n\nPros: Very Colorful\nGreat platforming\nGreat Soundtrack\nAmazing Boss fights\nYou are using abilities you got early on into the late game and not enough games do that *cough* Zelda *cough*\n\nCons:\nOnly one major one i can think of.

C'est cens\u00e9 \u00eatre un jeu tout public, et vas-y les \"t\u00eate de con\" et les \"sale con\" qui s'encha\u00eenent sans raison, des personnages qui parlent \u00e0 la place de leurs interlocuteurs et des fautes de frappe sur ABSOLUMENT TOUTES LES LIGNES DE DIALOGUE !\nEt bien s\u00fbr, le siffler (et non le \"siffleT\") \u00e9tant le premier objet de l'inventaire, les profs de fran\u00e7ais et autres fanatiques d'orthographe pourront s'arracher les yeux \u00e0 chaque fois qu'ils ouvriront le menu Pause...\nNon, le jeu n'est pas traduit par un \u00e9tudiant random pay\u00e9 au black, mais \u00e7a aurait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 moins choquant que de voir \"Dys Translations\" dans les cr\u00e9dits, une bo\u00eete sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans la traduction de jeux-vid\u00e9o qui recrute apparemment des \"Dysl\u00e9xiques\"\n*Badum tsss*\n\n- Lorsque je parlais de speedrun plus haut, je disais qu'il \u00e9tait important de noter le \"glitchless\", je n'en aurai pas parl\u00e9 sur Risky's Revenge ou Pirate's Curse, puisque je n'ai jamais eu affaire au moindre bug sur ces deux jeux, m\u00eame en faisant des choses assez absurdes.\nDans 1/2 Genie Hero, danser ( = principale feature du jeu) juste avant de se faire toucher par un ennemi, ou m\u00eame simplement tomber dans des pics peut d\u00e9clencher un bug ! L'un peut rendre le personnage invisible jusqu'\u00e0 faire certaines actions, bon \u00e7a \u00e9ventuellement, si \u00e7a peut en faire marrer certains, pourquoi pas, mais la chute dans les pics qui ram\u00e8ne la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e du niveau au lieu du dernier check point, puis la deuxi\u00e8me fois laisse la cam\u00e9ra dans un coin random du niveau et le personnage compl\u00e8tement ailleurs, \u00e7a c'est non... Et pourtant, je ne les ai pas cherch\u00e9, ces bugs, j'y ai eu droit \u00e0 ma premi\u00e8re partie, en faisant le jeu normalement, sympa non ? ...\n\n- Le farm... Hein ? Moi j'ai dit que c'\u00e9tait un jeu \u00e0 faire en speedrun ? Ah oui pardon :D\nBref, oui, alors le farm d'argent, dans Shantae, c'est pas nouveau, il y a souvent des objets \u00e0 acheter, que ce soit pour progresser dans l'aventure ou pour optimiser le speedrun, et dans les deux autres jeux, il y a souvent un personnage pour nous aider en nous offrant des sommes non n\u00e9gligeables (le chien de la cuistot et Bolo dans RR ou Sky dans PC), m\u00eame si au final il faut toujours prendre quelques minutes \u00e0 la fin du jeu pour farmer quand on veut faire le jeu \u00e0 100%.\nDans ce jeu, aucun personnage ne semble aider finaci\u00e8rement, et pourtant je crois avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 tout le monde et \u00e0 chaque moment du jeu, donc \u00e0 moins que \u00e7a ne soit la \"Navi-spoileuse\" des bains (qui est le genre de perso avec qui je d\u00e9teste parler), je ne vois pas. Donc oblig\u00e9 de farmer soi-m\u00eame en cassant des pots ou en tuant des ennemis... Ah non pardon, les ennemis sont des gros radins, donc la seule solution reste de casser tous les pots qui passeront dans votre champs de vision.\nEt bien s\u00fbr, le meilleur spot de farm ne vous sera pas accessible avant le fin du jeu, car la plupart des plateformes sont \u00e0 des endroits o\u00f9 il n'est pas \u00e9vident d'aller sans la derni\u00e8re transformation, ce qui m'amm\u00e8ne au dernier point n\u00e9gatif, quand m\u00eame moins cons\u00e9quent que ces trois premiers :\n\n- Les utilit\u00e9s des transformation pas vraiment \u00e9quitables... C'est vrai quoi, c'est un peu le coeur du jeu, les tranformations, et pourtant, parmis les 8 transformations principales, 90% de votre temps de transformation dans une partie normale \u00e7a sera la souris et le crabe pour chercher les objets de qu\u00eate, le singe pour simplifier les phases de plateforme, et \u00e9ventuellement la harpie si vous faites un new game + pour skiper absolument tous les niveaux et optionnellement d\u00e9molir les boss \u00e0 coups de 20 pv par seconde\n(Une petite pens\u00e9e \u00e0 la transfo' en araign\u00e9e qui est super kawaii mais qu'on voit litt\u00e9ralement 2 minutes : tr\u00e8s lente, level design quasi jamais adapt\u00e9 pour elle sauf rares cas particuliers, attaque \u00e0 tr\u00e8s faible DPS obtenue tr\u00e8s tardivement et tr\u00e8s grosse hit-box)\n\n\n\nPour traduire ma recommendation positive de ce jeu, je dirai que je ne regrette pas mon achat, mais que j'y r\u00e9fl\u00e9chirai \u00e0 deux fois avant de me pr\u00e9cipiter sur le prochain \u00e9pisode...", "timestamp_created": 1482734416, "timestamp_updated": 1482735636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698659", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28660571": {"recommendationid": "28660571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011107573", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482731402}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of fun, good length, casual difficulty, good for a platformer novice like myself.

She's dancing her way through the danger with a variety of forms, spells, and items--but does it hold up compared to the former entries?\n\nMostly, yes. Let's start off with some pros.\n\nPROS: \n\n*The new art design is absolutely gorgeous, with painstaking attention paid to both the animation fidelity and character design. Sequin Land and its people have never looked so good. \n\n*Core gameplay is still superb: jump, whip your hair back and forth, and dodge what you can as you make your way through levels and discover hidden secrets with the help of any shapeshifting forms you happen to pick up along the way (and after). If you've played a Shantae game before? You'll feel right at home.\n\n*As always, the soundtrack is a joy to listen to. Nothing more to say on that--the music is great!\n\n*If you're a fan of the usual dialogue found in a Shantae game--wacky, weird, and sometimes a little 4th Wall-Breaking with a veritable drenching of saccharine Feel Good Vibes--then you're in for a treat. It's not gonna make you think on the existential crisis that plagues us all, but hey, it'll warm your heart and probably get you to crack a smile. Just as good, right?\n\nBut, no game is perfect. So let's look at some cons.\n\nCONS:\n\n*While the backtracking you'd come to expect from Shantae, or any Metroidvania for that matter, is still present? It feels cut down, streamlined, and less rewarding than before. While you'll amass over a dozen new forms that get your hips shaking, most of them are rarely used for more than bit puzzles--and then they're never really needed again. Mermaid, Monkey, and Harpy eventually become your main forms, and the rest are kind of left hanging.\n\n*While the dialogue remains as endearing as ever, the main storyline itself feels somewhat disconnected from the actual theme it's trying to convey. There are also elements that're introduced, but addressed in a manner that feels lacking--looking at you, Holly.\n\n*While the UI itself is very comfortable, the menu screen suffers from some clutter issues that were a minor irritation. Items you wouldn't think to use again--like the previous ranks of your damage upgrades--are kept in the inventory as toggles, so you can weaken yourself by choice. Still, that's a case of \"Your Mileage May Vary.\" I could see somebody using those toggles as self-inflicted \"hard mode\" conditions.\n\n*It's not long. I clocked in at around seven hours to complete the main campaign, though there's the additional Hero mode to tackle for fun--you get to start a new game with all of your main forms.\n\nShante: Half-Genie Hero isn't -better- than the previous games, but despite some minor gripes and irritations, I find it still holds up rather well to former iterations of the series. There's also the point that DLC will be introduced at a later date which may shake up some of my points. If it does? I'll revise my review to accommodate.\n\nStill, if you're looking for a simple \"buy it or not\" deal? Go ahead and buy it. It's good, simple fun that's worth the price of admission.\n", "timestamp_created": 1482703572, "timestamp_updated": 1482703572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28648607": {"recommendationid": "28648607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198945125", "num_games_owned": 661, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482905816}, "language": "english", "review": "Although I didn't enjoy it as much as Pirate's Curse (it's fairly linear and a little on the short side) it is still a pretty fun game.

For the record, I was a Kickstarter backer.\n\nShantae: Half-Genie hero is a big step forward visually from its predecessors... and a smaller step back gameplay-wise. In general, the game looks gorgeous. Though Crybringer's redesigns are jarring compared to the the previous game, they hold up well animated. The animations are fantastic, though there's less variety than there was in Pirate's Curse, perhaps owing the new engine.\n\nIn terms of speed and flow, this game feels like it's slightly slower than Pirate's Curse. There are more transformations, but many are just so situational you won't find yourself using them widely - most are just keys to open locks, with only a few serving as general use, and another few literally just existing to generate powerups or the like. Magic has been nicely expanded, with a third level for most of the spells. However, one issue is that it simply overdoes it in terms of upgrades - even early upgrades can trivialize things like health loss, whether it's just reducing damage or being able to generate health and healing items on a whim. One even lets you generate cash, leaving your ability to purchase upgrades down to your patience. Worst of all is the item you get for collecting all the gallery keys, which may as well have \"CHEATING MODE ACTIVATED\" in big red letters, making a number of the final boss battles trivial. If you want challenge out of Half-Genie Hero, it's only self-enforced - the menu at least lets you switch off most of the upgrades if you like.\n\nEnemies are no longer of the \"stop-go\" nature from previous reviews, and in general the enemy design is nicely varied, with a number of really great boss fights with varied styles... save for the final boss, which was an annoying slog for me. In general, though, fighting enemies is pleasant and there's more use for the varied spells against them than previous games (which mostly boiled down to \"spike ball or nothin'\").\n\nCollecting is, of course, a core element, and it teeters between reward and annoyance. I found myself revisiting levels a lot to get this or that geegaw or power, and the game enforces it a bit to pad its relatively short number of levels. While most of these trips aren't too laborious, towards the end I started to resent having to dig for the last few chunks. There's a lot of keys for various locks to open up Metroid-style, and slightly too many in my estimation.\n\nThe story is almost episodic, reflecting the varied plots promised in the kickstarter, and a lot of the side stories are much more clever than the main plot. The dialogue is often genuinely funny and sharp, and does make me wish for voices on account of it. The climax, however, is cliched to the point of being painful. I understand they probably wanted to get back to basics... but it features a twist you'll likely see coming from the very start of the game, and a pretty bad one at that.\n\nIt should be noted that the extra playable characters aren't finished yet. Presumably they'll be DLC to non-backers in the future, but it's not clear. In general, the game isn't long - it took me about 9 hours to do 100% completion without any guides or tips at all. It doesn't overstay its welcome, and I didn't mind that at all. Presumably when the extra characters / modes are completed, they'll add to the length of the game for better or worse.\n\nUltimately, despite my criticism, I really enjoyed my time with Half-Genie Hero, though I don't feel much of a need to revisit it. It's a pretty fun ride over all, with a very appealing look, solid controls and innovations... but also is the sort of step back you often see with a new engine like this. As such, go into it expecting some flaws, but it's worth getting into if you've enjoyed the previous games or want a light, colorful platforming adventure. Just bear in mind it's got a few kinks.\n\nWell, literally speaking it has a few kinks. It could just be me, but some things seem coded for certain corner fetish communities (some subtle, some not). It's nothing I wouldn't let a child see (nothing on the level of Pirate's Curse's waterfall scene), but if you detect some weirdness here and there, it's probably not just you.\n\nThat's a note to close on, isn't it?

It was a tough task to follow up the Pirates Curse, and I didn't expect a masterpiece.\n\nFirst of all, the music and graphics are simply great. The trailer gives you a pretty good impression of what this was going to be in that regard and I'm really loving it. The gameplay feels smoother overall than previous entries and they improved on the transformations, making the process less time consuming.\n\nThat said, the transformations are my first big negative. We get a mix of old and new, but really they  break the flow of the game. That's an issue previous games had already, but it feels a lot more pronounced in this one. If you want to move efficiently through levels you will change forms a lot, and that can be a bit annoying at times. Not terrible, but I would say the older games handled this better, probably because this one has more transformations, and quite a few aren't really that useful.\nSimilarly the backtracking feels worse in this one, probably because you only have 5 leveles plus Risky's Hideout. Going back to the same level, with minor changes when you enter the 2nd time, over and over just doesn't feel satisfying. Even worse every level basically consists of 2 main screens with secrets dispersed in between them plus a boss battle.\nThe biggest issue for me is that everything feels so segmented. The stories of the bosses don't really have anything to do with the main plot, the levels, due to the select screen, feel just like that: levels and not a connected world. I just feel like they could have done a lot better by connecting the villains and give us pointless connection roads. Yes they take more time and can be annoying, but they make the gameworld feel connected.\n\nThe levels themselves are absolutely great. They just feel well designed and fun to play, if you weren't forced to play them quite as often (if you want to get 100% of course). The bosses are also very creative, and some kind of boss rush at the end would have been really fun.\n\nOverall, I would certainly recommend this game to anyone who likes fun platformers.

A game with the budget of almost 800,000 USD. \nI have never been so wrong... \n\nGraphics\nFrom the very first time I played Shantae, I loved the concept and dreamed it to become an HD.\nPartially my wishes became true in RR and PC but that only involved sprites, not the actual universe.\nI like the graphics in HGH, it looks refreshing, though somewhat lacking in magic previous games had.\nI especially like the the job devs did on some of the Shantae's forms such as Mermaid and Spider, they look adorable. \nSome of my complaints lie in character animations, they are almost noexistent. Whatever happens during a dialogue, \nSky is smiling happily, Risky dances, Bolo remains pokerface etc. It especially strikes your eye during a scene when Shantae turns dark and they come for help. I don't think it is a very difficult job to change a facial expression since it's HD and it would contribute greatly to a scenes' emotional impact. \n\nMusic \nMusic is wonderful. Kaufman knows his job well. \n\nPlot \nThis is what actually disappoints me and what makes me give the game a thumb down.\nDuring the whole course of the game an impression stuck with me that devs had some great ideas which they failed (or didn't want) to implement for some reason. The plot seems rushed, teared and incompleted. No character development at all.\nNew charactes appear to be tossed away right after their debut. Main Shantae friends could have more impact on the story. I'll give an example.\n- In the very first stage - mermaid falls, Bolo catches up to Shantae and complains he is always left out of her adventures.\nIt was a great reference to the previous game but unfortunately it didn't go anywhere.\nThere is a couple of funny moments with him in this episode, but after that he doesn't play any significant role at all.\n- The same thing with Rotty, I have an impression the devs had no idea how to insert her into the plot and just got away by giving her some nominal role. Abner and Poe are introduced and forgotten.\n- An episode with Shantae taken over by dark magic just cried for a fight with her dark self or an extra level \"inside her\",\ndon't get me wrong, the thing her friends coming to her rescue is great but still a lot of potential is lost.\n- The new \"villain\" Holly was downright pathetic. Her reasons ridiculous, dialogues far-fetched, character - bad guy cliche. It was a real challenge to beat the boss with a palm on my face. \n- Moreover I was negatively suprised when I discovered it was actually a \"bonus chapter\" (along with the cape crustacean) inserted in the story because the kickstarter goal was achieved. \nWould would be left of the game without those? Bonus chapter should be BONUS and usually after you BEAT the game or can be completed optionally, but here it is an integral part of the story. I don't oppose this approach, just don't call it BONUS. Call it: \"Initially we planned to make the game 4 hours long, but since you funded it we will make it 8\".\n- The game has two endings and they differ by a couple of lines. If the whole genie realm was destoyed, Shantae will say something like: \"Well, that's a bummer.\" and Mimic like: \"Well, maybe it wasn't\". \nYes, I know it is a kind fairy-tale and there is no place for heavy dramatic moments but this very ending should motivate a player to search for a better one, but it doesn't.\n\nDifficulty\nToo casual. It does give you some challenge in the beginning, but once you have a bikini and 4+ hearts you dont really care to avoid attacks at all. Some people complained the last boss to be very difficult, but when you have invincibility magic what difficulty are you talking about??? I really like easy games, when I don't have to smash break the gamepad and just enjoy the gameplay, but there must be balance between difficulty and enjoyability, which this game definitely lacks.\n\nConclusion.\nI, as a fan of the series, am very disillusioned because the potential the series had was destroyed by this game.\nMaybe the DLCs will brighten things up a bit but we'll have to pay for them which highlights the desire to only earn money, not caring much about their product. \nI'll repeat myself, as I was going through the game it seemed to me the devs had great ideas but right after the beginning they decided to save budget, which I don't understand. They raised twice they pledged + income from release, did they only care to make it \"ok\" but not \"great\"?\n \nWell, it was just my personal opinion, there are tons of positive reviews, so I probably just dramatized a lot.\nAgree or not?

The first phase is a callback to the first Shantae game where you fight Risky in a one-on-one battle. The next two phases are really boring and are super easy to beat. The \"Harpy Gauntlet\" heading up to those bosses was a much more satisfying challenge. I can't say I was too impressed with the other boss designs either. In previous games, they forced you to fight them using your newly acquired upgrades/transformations. The bosses in this game basically just force you to tank damage and go all out with lots of magic attacks and health potions... not very smart or creative. \n\nThere is also a really random difficulty spike in platforming in the third level \"Tassel Town,\" which is then followed by one of the easiest bosses.

Creare un seguito ad un gioco perfetto come Pirate's curse non \u00e8 un'impresa facile, ma Wayforward \u00e8 riuscita a confezionare un ottimo sequel! LA cosa che fin da subito mi ha preoccupato \u00e8 stato il radicale cambiamento dello stile grafico, scartando la pixel art fantastica dei primi capitoli per passare a uno stile 2.5D molto simile a Ducktales Remastered. Per quanto gli ambienti risentino di un design abbastanza squadrato e poco organico, i fondali sono fantastici e i design dei personaggi sono troppo adorabili! Mi sono innamorato a prima vista di questo stile non appena iniziato a giocare e la colonna sonora di Jake Kaufman \u00e8 la ciliegina sulla torta per un ottima presentazione. Shantae \u00e8 ritornata in possesso dei suoi poteri e si ritrova come sempre immersa nella sua routine di proteggere Sequin Land da pirati e cattivi di ogni tipo. La trama \u00e8 forse la parte del gioco che pare pi\u00f9 affrettata, ci sono svariati punti dove sembra che sia stata un p\u00f2 tagliuzzata per questioni di tempo ed \u00e8 un vero peccato. PEr quanto un gioco sia sempre un platform con una componente esplorativa, \u00e8 stata rimossa la componente Metroidvania dei titoli precedenti, per un approccio pi\u00f9 lineare e concentrato sul platforming, vi sono comunque molti power up nascosti che spingeranno i pi\u00f9 cleptomani ad esplorare ogni punto dello schermo, quindi anche gli appassionati dello stile Metroidvania hanno qualcosina su cui aggrapparsi. Shantae \u00e8 pi\u00f9 ricca che mai di poteri e trasformazioni in questo gioco, alcuni molto sottosviluppati, altri molto utili e alcuni che sono talmente overpower da spezzare il gioco in due! Se volete godervi Half Genie Hero senza renderlo incredibilmente facile, il consiglio migliore che posso darvi \u00e8 fare una run ignorando totalmente l'esplorazione, oppure evitando di usare potenziamenti overpower. \nIl gioco inoltre offre nuove modalit\u00e0 di gioco con diversi personaggi, i quali saranno in arrivo in futuro come contenuto scaricabile gratuito, ciascuno con il loro stile di gioco che offrir\u00e0 un incredibile rigiocabilit\u00e0 per coloro che hanno apprezzato questo titolo. C'\u00e8 da dire, per quanto non lo considero un seguito superiore a Pirate's Curse, Half Genie Hero \u00e8 comunque un ottimo seguito per la serie di Shantae, nonostante gli evidenti tagli subiti durante la produzione.

Small puzzle rooms inbetween and one main gimmick. \n\nI miss the Zelda like dungeons from the other games, but this Mega Man like approach isn't so bad. It's just a shame that it starts out with huge amounts of puzzles in the first 2 levels then the rest just peeter out. The last 2 levels have like no collectables in it whilst around 45% of the games collectables are found in the SECOND one. It's insane the weighting on content. \n\nNot too pleased at the concept of DLC being made during development that's free to backers. I'd have backed if I knew backing was even an option.

Though heir to a fan favorite series, it stands out pretty well on its own and shows a lot of crafting.  There's a few issues of polish and levels of difficulty, but the overal experience is very enjoyable.\n\nI Kickstarted this game.  Not because I was actually into the series, but as a lot of friends were, and were thrilled to see it returning.  I figured \"what the heck\" and tossed some money into the pot.\n\nFast forward to now, and the results of a non-fan of the game?  Pretty damn good.\n\nShantae is a platform-heavy metroidvania type game.  Start in a town, go to various areas on missions.  Complete missions, find new abilities, return to other areas to find stuff and use abilities, repeat.  Unlock new areas and new treasures.  It's a standard formula we all love.\n\nSo let's see how it breaks down.\n\nPRESENTATION: The game is colorful and fun, with great graphics and soundtrack.  Characters have plenty of personality.  The game's look and feel is excellent.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Gameplay is very old-school and there's a heavy emphasis on exploring the environment and platforming timing. If you're not ready for it, it may be a bit of a shock.  When you \"get\" it then the game really comes together.\n\nCHARACTER GROWTH: Shantae basically A) finds new dances to transform into things, B) Buys spells and some combat upgrades, B) gets increased health.  It's not exactly complicated - the dances are the important part as they give you access to new areas.\n\nPUZZLES: Though the need to re-return to areas can be annoying,the different abilities you unlock make them easier to navigate, and help you access hidden areas.  A few times you'll have an \"aha\" moment and figure out how to solve something and get a real rush from it.\n\nSTORY: The story seems to be more of a \"Shantae's greatest hits gets the band back together\" so you're not getting Game of Thrones or Dragon's Age here.\n\n\nIf there's a flaw to the game, its some of it feels a tad disjointed, from varied difficulty to a grand adventure suddenly turning into a fetchquest that feels like it should have been optional.  It's a minor concern, but it did stand out for me.\n\nSo do you buy it?\n1) If you're a fan, judging by the game's quality AND the fans I know you either should or already did, and I'm shocked you read this far.\n2) If you like colorful old-school patformers you'll probably enjoy this.\n3) It'd make a GREAT gift for a friend who liked old-school platformers.\n\nWho shouldn't buy it?\n1) If you don't like platformers, really, don't.  This game will make you angry.\n2) If you're not up for a game that involves repeating levels several times and poking around in their corners.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1482611049, "timestamp_updated": 1482611049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28606714": {"recommendationid": "28606714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035844245", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482606960}, "language": "english", "review": "The thing about this game is that it might be good for new comers to the series but as a fan, I don't like it that much.

get exteremly broken by the end of the game...so much so that you feel invinicbile (i dont think i ever died in this game and came the cloest to dying on the first level due to how weak shantae starts out)\n\nunlike most games of this genre, when you beat a boss you get a new transformation then usually you have to backtrack through a level you beaten again to find more upgrades (and this isnt optional the game halts and forces you to do this to continue the story and it happens every time)...this may sound like a negative but since you just got a new transfomation and became even stronger, it wont seem like backtracking through a stage and you might find optional upgrades to make the rest of the game even easier...\n\nand thats the charm of the game, you really feel the progression of the main character who starts out super weak with very traditional moveset you will see in most platformers then slowly start breaking the mold once you start finding upgrades and start going back to levels that gave you headaches in the past and just watch them get broken apart due to your new abilites.\n\nAlso you eventually get a warp spells so you can skip unneccary parts of a level to find that 1 upgrade or part you need in a level you already beaten and you can leave the level at anytime you want if you gotten everything you need...\n\nit does become super easy at the end when you can go invinicbile at will, fly over the whole stage, and have so many heart containers that theres no way the enemy can kill you but ya you sorta earned that right? though hard work and upgrading yourself...its not a hard game in the slightest but its so much fun when you are so strong at the end of the game and it feels justified with all the time you spent on making shantate stronger...\n\nLastly this game is getting dlc to extend the gameplay later on...and its not just skins...its new playable characters with unique gameplay styles and their own storylines so you have something to look forward too...and this game rewards speedruns so if you thought it was so easy by the end...try going for the achivements, some requiring you to speedrun the game...",

And Although I don't recommend this game, YOU SHOULD GO PLAY SHANTAE AND THE PIRATES CURSE! (which is a great game).\n\nFirst impressions about this game.\n\nThe graphics are amazing (much more so than predecessors) and music is fantastic. And as usual, the gameplay is exceedingly smooth and controls respond very well. The dances are pretty cool and the story also leans more on the comical side compared to most games leaving a lighthearted feeling.\n\nDespite my glowing remarks above, I have 3 large issues with the game.\n\nContent: The length of time required to beat the game and get full completion is ridiculously short, ~5-7 hours for the average gamer.\n\nStory/Character Development: This is also related to the content. The story is pretty weak and honestly if you remove playing the actual levels, I could tell the entire story of the game to completion with like 2 sentences. Connected to this is character development. This game in no way makes anyone really care about any of the characters! Not even Shantae! If I hadn't played both the prequels, I would have no idea why Shantae was a half-genie and why she cared about the genie realm, or what her relation to Risky was! And then the supporting characters, rotty-tops/brothers + sky + bolo/grandpa: the game really does a disservice to how these people relate to shantae as from this game alone you could barely even tell that they were friends and not just some random townfolk A, B, C.\n\nDifficulty: This is yet another problem. Going through the levels are like a walk in the park (even so for non gamers) and the bosses while looking cool, are extremely dissapointing. All of the bosses patterns are extremely easy and they are honestly so weak that as long as you decide to use a potion (which you shouldn't really ever need), you can completely face-tank never dodge any of the bosses attacks and still smash them! Also the 4 skills which have always been a shantae staple are pretty much never needed. The fireball->flamethrower and lightning cloud are excessively weak and useless it pretty much every scenario. The pikeball/scimitar aren't really necessary but are usefull for clearing out monsters/bosses faster. And then the bubble is really good enough to make you invicible to some bosses (not counting the 3rd upgrade which is literally invincibility). And the magic power these things use is almost negligible for the time you need to activate it.\n\nAside from ease in monsters and bosses, getting 100% completion and finding all the \"secrets\" is so simple that I don't even need to put any thought to find every single item! While it wasn't extremely hard in the Pirates curse at least I had to go revisit some areas just to search every nook and cranny for the special tinkerbells. In Half-genie hero, all the secrets are pretty much just lying in front of you waiting for you to get the right power to unlock it.\n\nOverall, the game is lovely but is waaaay too easy with a laughably simple and short plot that does not make you care for it in any way. I was really looking forward to this game but it really dissapointed me on many levels, even as a Shantae fan. Although I don't regret buying the game because I was a fan of the Shantae series (and this is probably the last game I'm guessing), I can't really recommend this unless this game is under $10. However, if you haven't picked up any Shantae games before I recommend you try out Shantae and the Pirates Curse. That game is way more polished than this one and doesn't really have any of these big issues that I listed for this entry here.", "timestamp_created": 1482565204, "timestamp_updated": 1482565204,

After playing it, I feel like I got my money's worth.\n\nWayforward has a good track record with 2-D platforming games (the other one I have played is Ducktales Remastered).  Half-Genie Hero is a fun, bright, easy-to-pickup game that I recommend to fans of platforming games.  The development team put a lot of effort into ensuring that this was a well-executed, polished, product. \n\nPros: Easy-to-play, fun platforming, interesting special moves/transformations, varied/interesting stages, great soundtrack.  Accessible challenge level that doesn't ever feel unfair - no \"cheap deaths.\" \n\nCons:  Sometimes too easy - there is a relic/magic combination that makes the final boss trivial, but you have to do all the legwork to get everything and then realize the combination.  \n\nOther thoughts:  I recommend using a controller (my Logitech F310 worked perfectly).", "timestamp_created": 1482552436, "timestamp_updated": 1482552436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28580011": {"recommendationid": "28580011", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975625823", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499202931}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is every bit as fun as it looks!

Visually, this game, is so vibrant and joyous to watch, it simply leaves you feeling good.\n\nThe music is also nice and simple, having a sort of retro feel to it without the exclussive use of 8-bit samples. It feels very Early-Sonic-ish at some points, wich is high praise considering that the early Sonic games had nice, catchy and energetic tunes for each level to give emphasis to the rapid action.\n\nThe game controls very much like most 2D platformers, the controls are fast and responsive and after only a few minutes they will feel like second nature. This game also adds a bit of variety with transformations, meaning that as you progress through the game you will gain the ability to transform into a variety of cratures with different abilities, but I won't spoil too much about that. This mechanic adds to the value of each level, as when you return to them with your new transformation abilities, after you played for a while, you will be able to explore more areas that you couldn't before.\n\nNow, the game in total is not all that long, in fact if you are really into it and don't do much of exploring around each level, you could easily get to the end in the same day you downloaded it. As mentioned before, bacause of the transformations, you will have to do a lot of backtracking, which it can get tedious if you are not into this sort of thing, but discovering little secrets in each level can feel so rewarding at times.\n\nOverall, it's a pleasant little game that I highly recomend to people who want a nice platforming expireince, amazing visuals and simple story that doesn't take forever to finish. It just makes me wonder; if the team had a bigger budget (the game was crowd-funded) and maybe more time, what more could have they accomplished.", "timestamp_created": 1482551257, "timestamp_updated": 1482551257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28579544": {"recommendationid": "28579544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245048848", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482553860}, "language": "english", "review": "I regret not backing this game on Kickstarter.", "timestamp_created": 1482550498, "timestamp_updated": 1482550498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28579270": {"recommendationid": "28579270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061863902", "num_games_owned": 692, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504076780}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a Fun platformer with some of the catchest music ive heard in a long time and for the cost u get way more then ur moneys worth good job WayForward if nice to see a game dev not Screw its consumer base\nthe game is rely easy and especaly if u buy the armor early on but i dont mind that tbh as the game feels fresh even after hours ive ended up looking at my watch and going wooo were the time go i will defntly be geting and dlc for this game and i look WayForward to and sqeuals to this lol", "timestamp_created": 1482549633, "timestamp_updated": 1482549633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28578603": {"recommendationid": "28578603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019827764", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482606244}, "language": "english", "review": "i jus want a little shantae in my life", "timestamp_created": 1482547841, "timestamp_updated": 1482606591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514286", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28577743": {"recommendationid": "28577743", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976950298", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512534729}, "language": "english", "review": "Haven't been so engaged with a single player game in a while.

I no longer reccommend it, and honestly I think the devs should probably just make porn since that seems to be what they want to be doing.\n\n\n--Original pre-DLC review--\nI backed this game on kickstarter and have no regrets. The gameplay is fast-paced and highly enjoyable. The main mechanic, transforming, is very well executed and a pleasure to use. This is definitely one of those games that makes you feel powerful, jumping around and whipping things to death with hair attacks and shifting smoothly between whatever forms you need for the task at hand. I played with an XBox 360 USB controller and had no issues whatsoever. You can even rebind the buttons if you want, something not every game offers.\n\nThe game has a cute but fairly light story, which is honestly perfect for it. It is enough to keep you moving without bogging you down or getting in the way of the main feature, which is the excellent gameplay. Pretty much my only issue with the game is one I knew I'd have going in. I do find the female outfits and character designs a bit silly/fanservicey (personal preference here, not an attack). That said, they don't really exploit that in gross ways like some titles do. Something I read on TVTropes seems pretty true, describing the style as 'sexy but not sexualized'. \n\nThe only exception I found was the first playthrough of the second level Mermaid Factory. I found that level seriously squicky in a variety of ways. [spoiler] Seriously, girls tied to some kind of assembly line looking thing, being shoved into cans to be sold (as you find out later) as *food*? That's pretty messed up.[/spoiler] Thankfully all the disturbing elements are gone when you come back later. And to be fair this series has always had some squicky elements to its humor. \n\nI am generally pretty sensitive to this sort of thing, so if you aren't this may not bother you at all. If you are very sensitve, then, be aware. I still definitely reccommend the game, which I feel has a great deal of heart and is well worth it. I have already beat both normal and hero mode, and am looking forward to the extra content that will eventually be released.\n\nEDIT: Something I forgot to mention was the soundtrack, which I found highly enjoyable and perfectly suited to the rhythm of the gameplay. It's all instrumental with the exception of the theme song, 'Dance Through the Danger', which plays during the first run of the first level as well as during the ending credits. That song... well, let's just say that three days after playing it was still getting stuck in my head. xD", "timestamp_created": 1482545273, "timestamp_updated": 1504314956, "voted_up": false,

I haven't even played the full game yet and I highly recommend those who haven't played the Shantae series at all should go back and try them all out :D", "timestamp_created": 1482541338, "timestamp_updated": 1482541338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28575313": {"recommendationid": "28575313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087603120", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485956662}, "language": "english", "review": "i really loved this game but i found the game gets much easier the further you go in and some power ups in the shops are better than others", "timestamp_created": 1482538750, "timestamp_updated": 1482538750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28575173": {"recommendationid": "28575173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007101427", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482528593}, "language": "english", "review": "I've always been a fan of the series, so it's hard for me to write a negative review.  So I won't :). Like most of the series it's short and sweet. I think I ran the first time in about 8 hours with a 100% collection.  There are a few items that make the game easy mode but they are towards the later half and by that point I was more focused on the story.\nThere is a part in the begining where they mention that this game is a reboot/sequel/etc, and honestly I feel that is 100% true.\nThis game has a strong feel of the classic Nintendo/Sega 2D platformers with a linearish story line (there are side missions and you do go back to the same maps a few times).  In light of that this game needs a controler so if you don't have one, I wouldn't bother getting it, but if the price is reasonable for you than I would defnitly play this game.  \nIt is good to at least have played the other games in this series (and they are playable even this late) just to know the story line.  The only one that will be hard to play again is the gameboy one which started it all (if memory serves.)\nAnyway sorry for this scatter brain review, but I hope this helps", "timestamp_created": 1482538421, "timestamp_updated": 1482538421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28574993": {"recommendationid": "28574993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025191348", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503771421}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: I backed the kickstarter (sort of). To be more accurate, I gave a paypal donation that counted towards backing the game well after the campaign had been successfully funded. I'd just finished Pirate's Curse and was excited to see how they'd treat the franchise going forward. Well, you see that red thumb in the corner so I've got some explaining to do.\n\nLet's start things off by saying that my actual feelings towards this game lie somewhere in the middle, however, steam only has a binary \"good or bad\" system for rating games. Given what I have to say though, I'm sad to say I'm going to have to give this a thumbs down. The game leaves a great first impression but the deeper you get in the more you can see the cracks in its structure.\n\nLet's start off with the positives. The music is fantastic, Jake Kaufman continues to be one of my favorite game music composers and I'm delighted to enjoy the soundtrack to most games he's worked on. The upgrade from pixel art to drawn sprites is absolutely wonderful. The future looks great assuming they stick with this art style, the game looks fantastic. The controls are nice and responsive and the basic gameplay has a good feel to it. While my issues with the genie transformations, that have followed me as I've played through all four games in the series, aren't entirely solved in this game they're much quicker to access, especially with the metronome, which I consider a must have item. There's a couple fun ideas for settings and it's neat to see how the tech of this world is advancing in each installment.\n\nUnfortunately, good music and visuals do not alone for a good game make, now we're in the negatives. The game only has a small handful of levels that feel shorter and shorter the more you have to scour over every inch of them to find more collectables to progress the story. That's the biggest problem with the game, it's spread incredibly thin over a very small and tightly packed space. I loved my first run through each level, the first time through mermaid falls is my personal highlight of this game. The second run through, it was neat to see how little elements had changed. However, by the time I'd finally gotten everything there was to pick up I was pretty much sick of every area. Well, aside from the first and the fifth one which are both, comparatively, tiny levels with little to do.\nThe linear \"level\" structure really went against what I've become familiar with in this series. While the map design is nowhere near as bad as Risky's Revenge, (Which, as it stands, is my least favorite entry in this franchise by a wide margin.) it's definitely a huge step back from Pirate's Curse. They went from open maps to screen to screen \"levels\" packed with things you are required to get but can't until you get more transformations. Aside from that, the biggest problem with them is how they're checkpointed, which is really only an issue because of any of the instant death traps that are in the later environments. The game isn't really all that hard but instant death spikes/lasers isn't how you remedy that. (Side Note: Games don't have to be \"hard\" to be good.) At best, it's a nuisance, but at worst it's a complete waste of time. Some genie transformations are usefully only for one or two manditory uses to collect an item but outside of that are completely pointless when put up against the other transformations you get (spider). Any points I can get into beyond this get more into the territory of nitpicking so I'll spare you that.\n\nIf I were to give you a recommendation it'd be for what is, in my opinion, the best of this series and perhaps the only 5/5 worthy one on the list. I'd highly encourage you to check out Shantae and the Pirate's Curse. It goes above and beyond all 3 of the games it sits alongside. Funnily enough, it's the only game where Shantae doesn't have her genie powers (animal transformations) and I think it plays like a dream because using your abilities flows better with the controls. There's no stopping to turn into a less powerful, less interesting form. Instead you flow smoothly through actions. Be careful though since there might, unfortunately, be some odd issues with the PC port of Pirate's curse based on my browse of the community page. [strike] If Wayforward could \"remaster\" Pirates Curse with these visuals it'd be a dream come true. [/strike]\n\nEdit: 12/30/2016 This review was made with the base version of the game in mind. In the event that any of the added characters/campaigns be paid DLC I feel my review will not need to be adjusted to reflect content sold separately of the original product. There's no guarantee that I'll think to return to the game by the time additional content is added. Any willing to \"take up the mantle\" are free to do so in my absence.\n\nAuthor's note: If you enjoy the game, great, more power to you. I'm honestly happy that you have a thing to be happy with. You don't have to agree with me, in fact, I don't expect you to. I just felt compelled to put this together by the time I'd finished with the game.

Backtracking no longer feels like the chore now that the dungeons are removed altogether and thanks to the buttload of new transformations and the majorly increased visual quality added to the once again catchy tunes and wacky gameplay it's ensured that you won't get annoyed about the fact that you have to visit the very same place for the 6th time.\n\nIf the difficulty or the P.O.O.P.load of dungeons were the only things holding you back from getting a sip of the Shantae universe, then now is the perfect time to join our forces of relentless belly dancers.\nTogether we shall dance through the danger!

It's got very well executed gameplay and controls. Shantae can transform into various animals to get around the area. There's a bunch of world to explore with their own themes and hidden secrets. It's very linear and easy compared to the previous installments, so I would recommend getting this one first to get a feel of the series, but overall I feel Shantae and the Pirate's Curse was a much better game.\n\n\n\n\nIf you're a veteran: This game left a bittersweet feeling in my mouth. Half Genie Hero is still a well done game, but it feels so terribly bare bones compared to Pirate's Curse and Risky's Revenge. It's much shorter at about 5 hours long, way too easy especially with upgrades, no dungeons, very linear compared to the other games, plot that is very boring and goes nowhere, generic and few interesting setpieces, much smaller and linear stages that don't have any emphasis on exploring since most \"hidden\" objects just require a dance or upgrade you don't have yet. However, with all that said, it's no Shantae on GBC. What the game does, it does well. I just feel it lacks in a lot of areas, but it's by no means bad.

I reminded myself that WayForward is a company with a good service list, but to err is human, right? Well, It has been out for 3 days now and I'm glad to say that it's not Mighty No. 9. In fact, HGH kinda blows the Kickstarter failure out of the water. HGH is a neat experience of a great colorful and vivid artstyle, amazing music and comfortable gameplay. The gameplay is your typical metroidvania: scattered over the levels are areas that are reachable only by performing a certain dance that transforms Shantae into a spider, a crab, a mermaid and et cetera. You could seperate the transformations into two groups: group 1 is made for platforming and group 2 is made strictly for puzzles (at least I have never personally found a platforming use for the mouse transformation). You're going to spend most of the game travelling back-and-forth, collecting hidden items with newfound transformations.\n\nThis is when you get to the cons of the game. The transformations are, long term, pointless gimmicks. The mouse transformation is used around 5 times all over the game, while some of the other ones (mermaid, for example) come in too late to be a viable alternative to the one you got earlier (crab transformation). There's also no point to use them to combat enemies. In the end, you're going to use transformations to discover the occasional blocked off area, transform back to original Shantae because she's stronger, faster and more versatile, and then go on. By the way, as I've said, that's all you're gonna do for the majority of the game. I didn't really find that too bad because I'd be doing it anyway, but the fact that you're basically forced to repeatedly go through the levels to find hidden stuff makes it easier to 100% the game. And if you 100% the game too early, you get an eight hours long playtime. Now, I think that's quite normal for an indie platformer (for example, Shovel Knight takes about 8 hours to beat it too), but some people may disagree - that's quite alright, though WayForward has new characters for the game in the works. Maybe that will make the game longer?\n\nBasically, as a summary: Shantae: HGH was a very good experience, however it's only two real flaws are the most important ones: the transformation gimmick that dies off as the game progresses and the length.", "timestamp_created": 1482523902, "timestamp_updated": 1482528625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28567613": {"recommendationid": "28567613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004658705", "num_games_owned": 1261, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484762439}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc9c0\uae08 \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0b4\uac00 \ub3c8 \ub123\uc740 \ud0a5\uc2a4\ud0c0\ud130\uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uc131\uacf5\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840. \ubc1c\ub9e4\uac00 \ub2a6\uc5b4\uc84c\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \ub098\uc640\uc918\uc11c \uace0\ub9d9\ub2e4 \u3160\u3160", "timestamp_created": 1482523711, "timestamp_updated": 1482523711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28567268": {"recommendationid": "28567268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011237530", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483563633}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good.

Pirate's Curse is, to me, the best game of the series and sadly, Half-Genie Hero does not surpass that game's level. It has too many flaws for that.\nFor one, the past games had a sense of exploration. Big worlds which you'd discover all kinds of new things in when going through them later on, metroidvania style. Half-Genie Hero...tries to have that, but the worlds are just so tiny. There's a feeling that there should be more, but there simply isn't.\nThe end-game also has a very strong \"Collect 10 Bear Asses\" feel to it. Just padding to make the game last a bit longer for those who want to get the proper ending. While it is a tradition for Shantae games to do something like that, it never felt as obvious as it does here. \nThen there's the various forms you can take. Some just feel a bit tacked on, like the Spider form which you need only for one little thing, and is never needed again except for an achievement. The Crab form also feels redundant with the Mermaid form around, with only a very few small things ensuring you must use it.\nFinally, the game is on the short side. 7.5 hours for 100% completion without actually rushing through the game...it's not horribly short, but I had hoped for longer.\nHaving said that, these aren't huge problems. The gameplay itself is smooth as ever, perhaps even smoother than before. The flow of most of the game is perfect, the enemies are nice and varied, the level design itself, while small, is very well done, so gameplay wise there's nothing really wrong with the game.\nThe graphics are also top notch. A lot of work has gone into the animation and it shows, the game looks fabulous. The music also helps, the ever-present ear worms keep up a great tone.\nFinally, the absurd and hilarious conversations are, as ever, another highlight of the game. It does refer it's predecessors a fair bit which might be annoying if this is your first Shantae, but even for those people there's plenty of good humor to go around.\nAll in all, I think that this game's biggest problem is the existence of Pirate's Curse. That game set a very high bar that Half-Genie Hero falls just short of. I definitely do not regret the purchase, I had just hoped for a bit more after the kickstarter and the various postponings.

A charming artstyle with beautiful and bright HD graphics, fun level design, and tight platforming controls make this a must-buy for any fan of the 2D platforming genre. The mechanics of your genie powers, the great music, and Shantae's cheery personality itself makes this an amazing game in my opinion. If you like the idea of playing a head-strong, spunky girl who transforms into animals as she saves the day, then this is the game for you.\n\n\nThis is more of a Megaman style of platforming than a Metroidvania, this means the levels are going to feel alot more linear at first. The real exploration comes from after you get your animal abilities, where the extra means of movement allow you to explore the untouched nooks and crannies  of the levels you previously cleared.\n\nThe cons I can think of are:\nbacktracking to find every item in every stage may get repetitive. However this is entirely optional unless you either want to do the little bit of extra work to get the good ending or just 100% complete the game.\n\nThis game is also probably the easiest game in the Shantae series. Shop items might as well be given to you with how cheap they are, barely any real threats in terms of enemies, and thinking creatively will sometimes let you use your animal transformations to completely bypass entire sections of the game.  \n\nEdit:\nThe new introduction of hardcore ups the difficulty on a grand scale. More enemies, different enemy placement, more damage, and new boss attacks make for a much more exhilerating experience.\n\n\nHowever.\nEven with its faults, I stil llove the game. It is an excellent edition to the series and a pretty good step forward.\n\nPersonally I loved the story, but heads up, its episodic like a Saturday morning cartoon. *SPOILERS* There is no Big Evil threatening to destroy the entire planet that requires an epic adventure. Instead Shantae has to deal with a bunch of smaller threats and go on smaller adventures one at a time. It's less of \"This is one of the most important days in this character's life\" and more of a \"This the stuff this young lady has to deal with sometimes.\"\n\nUsing internet guides at the late part of the game, I was able to 100% the main default story within a total of about 7 hours. Its a short game, but it was fun enough that I'm going to be revisiting this story plenty more times.\n\n I also need to mention that there is going to be alot of DLC coming out in the future of writing this review. Costume swaps for Shantae, and extra story modes where you play as some of the side characters are all underway.

Despite being overlooked and criminally under funded when compared to the likes of the now long forgotten Mighty No 9, Wayforward has once again have shown their true talents as a game developer.\n\nHGH is the first Shantae game that's in full HD.  It's also a more linear adventure, although there are secrets and hidden areas to find and discover. There are a total of 6 levels. Each broken into 3 to 4 stages each with a boss waiting at the end of each level. In this new adventure Shantae has more transformations at her disposal that totals up to 12 forms she can use. The animations and the overall look of HGH is possibly the best visualls WayForward has brought to the table with the series. The soundtrack has once again hit another home run thanks to series composer Jake Kaufman and also credit to Shantae's voice actress Christina Vee for lending her talented voice in main theme. \n\nPros:\n-Beautiful visuals that match with the equally vibrating soundtrack\n-Shantae's arsinal and transformations is the most varied in the series yet\n-Each of the 6 levels do well to make use and compliment the way the transfomations are used in certain situations\n-Gameplay is simple, but does offer some complexity\n-The 6 levels are varied and offer plenty of action platforming that doesnt get dull\n\nCon:\n-Short playthough that could be completed around 6+ hours on a blind run\n-4 of the transformations are forgeteble and are hardly used\n-Certain pickup items can make Shantae go extremely OP\n-Difficulty is easiest entry out of the entire series\n\n\nVerdict: Despite the game's shortcommings, this is still one of the better Shantae titles released being behind The Pirate's Curse. It doesn't change the formula too much, but rather it gives it a bigger, HD paint-job.

The developers seem to be either unable or unwilling to create levels that are anywhere between easy and hard.\n\nMost of the easy levels feature platforming and enemies, but with little or no consequence for failing the platforming - and enemies can be easily dispatched, ignored, or avoided most of the time. I never once died to any of the enemies, including the bosses, and I imagine most other players will be able to say the same thing.\n\nHowever, some of the levels are completely different, and feature very few enemies, and often difficult or finicky platforming, with the consequence of missing a jump being an instakill, which sends you back to the last checkpoint. Unfortunately, there are very few of these, so falling into a pit can send you back quite a distance.\n\nThe final zone is where this all culminates into one huge mess. The levels leading up to the final boss consist mostly of screens that are almost literally Flappy Bird, with instant kills lining every wall. Getting through those screens took me significantly longer than beating the final boss itself, and after that I was dropped in an auto-run level that was even more difficult, and took me even longer to complete. I didn't feel a sense of accomplishment by the time I was done; just frustration.\n\nBottom line: Watch a playthrough instead.

The game consists of bright colors and the cute, cheery half-genie hero Shantae as you play through several different environments, be it a mermaid factory surrounded by water or a hot desert with strong winds. The transformations are really interesting. Some are chibi looking animals while others are cute monster-girls with every one having their own unique abilities that can be built upon if you find the hidden upgrades throughout each level. Shantae herself can be upgraded from the item shop by buying new spells and hair products and accessories.\n\nThe game is a reasonable length of about 6-7 hours for your frist run (hard for me to judge because I left the game on in the background so my own time is not arcuate), although there's speedrunning challanges that time you for under 2 hours.

The game is hud based, and you can revisit previous levels in order to collect items needed to progress. So, what you are looking at is a game that's part traditional run left to right platformer, and part collectathon. You will get various powers and upgrades as you progress through the game not unlike a Metroid or Castlevania title. You'll have a scene with characters in a hub town, go to a level and make it through, then likely have to find something you couldnt get before to progress to the next level by revisiting previous levels. The good news is that you won't be playing the exact same things over again as levels do have some changes as you go through them again but it's mostly the same.

While other reviews will talk about the great level design, the (occasionally) amusing writing, the phenomenal music (thanks to Jake Kaufman). I'd like to talk about the thing I truly love about the shantae series (excluding the original).\n\nThe game engine in these games is flawless. The greatest crime I feel a platformer can commit in my opinion is have a poor engine. If I ever feel like missing a jump is the game's fault, or some BS pixel perfect jump requirements, then it is a bad platformer. \n\nThis is never the case in Shantae. Shantae always lands from every jump exactly the way I expect based on the buttons I pressed. If I miss a jump, it is clear and obvious what I did wrong. I timed it wrong for the moving platform, I misjudged the arc, an enemy attack threw me off. I never fight the controls, and I never yell at the screen \"OH THATS BULL, I MADE THAT JUMP\". Hard sections feel challenging, not frustrating.\n\nThat right there, the silky smooth controls and rock solid engine, are the best part of this game and its predecessors (except the original, lets not talk about the original....)\n\nUPDATE:\nNow that I'm less starry eyed from just finishing the game. I'll give my honest opinion to long time fans of Shantae. The biggest difference in this game is the style of level design. Its less metroidvania, more mega man. This isn't a bad thing, its just different. Levels are less about being labyrinths, and more about combining enemy placement and platforming to create a challenge. To those that prefer the labyrinth style designs, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse remains your best bet. To those that prefer stuff like Mega Man X, this game is perfect.

However, in comparison to Pirate's Curse I found this game to be shorter without much justification gameplay-wise\n-- Difficulty, Half-Genie Hero is an easy game.

Is Half-Genie Hero worth the weight? Well, let's find out.\n\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero is the fourth game in the sassy and charming Shantae series and now in high-definition. The visuals in this game are fantastic to say the least. The game mixes colorful and nicely textured 3D assets with high-quality 2D sprites. The animations on characters are also excellent and gives the game some life. Game also ran very well at least for me it did. No crashes either.\n\nUnlike Pirate's Curse, Half-Genie Hero brings back the transformations from the first two games; however, they made some more changes to the system in this one. The way transformations work now is that you go into dance mode and the game goes through a menu of transformations automatically and you use the d-pad (if you played it on a controller which I did) to select your transformation. Additionally, there is now a grand-total of 14 transformations (2 of them can be swapped) with some being more useful than others. The transformations are fun to use but they are not as good as the Pirate Gear from the previous game due to having to pause and wait to select the transformation you want to use which can ruin the flow of the gameplay. There is an upgrade that increases Shantae's dancing animation speed which helps somewhat.\n\nNow for the most important part, the gameplay. Is it any good? Absolutely. It controls nearly as well as Pirate's Curse and using the transformations is still fun despite not flowing as well as the Pirate Gear. The game is more linear than its predecessors but the metroidvania elements are still there as you will be doing a lot of backtracking in earlier levels to go into areas you wouldn't have access to before. The levels are fun to explore but the lack of dungeons is really disappointing. The Shantae games always had really fun dungeons to explore and the lack of them in this game is a crime. I don't know why they removed them but hopefully they will bring them back in the next game. Also, there is no map in this game which is odd considering that Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse had maps. The game seems to be quite shorter than the other entries but there will be new character modes that will be coming up later on which should increase the length of the game.\n\nThe music is composed by Jake Kaufman once again and I must say, some of the tracks in this game are the best in the whole series. The soundtrack of this game consists of high-quality remixes of songs from previous games and new tracks. There is one track from the previous games that gets reused but is only used for one section. Overall, the soundtrack does not disappoint and Jake Kaufman has done an amazing job once again.\n\nNow for the story, I know the story isn't really the main focus in these games but Pirate's Curse did a pretty good job on that aspect and this game seems to ignore some of the character development from that game. Risky just goes back to her \"LOL IM EVIL\" self without any explaination and a few characters from the last two games don't make an appearence in this game. Speaking of Risky, there is a lack of Risky in this game as she only appears in the beginning and the end of the game. The story feels pretty unfocused throughout the majority of the game as each level in the game feels more like an episode of \"Shantae beats the bad guy from doing bad things\". The rival Half-Genie that appears early on in the game would have made for an interesting story but they just conclude her story shortly afterwards. Despite the story being unfocused, the dialogue is still very funny and charming.\n\nOverall, Half-Genie Hero is a very polished and well made game that will not disappoint any fan in the series. It may not be as good as Pirate's Curse but it's still a great entry to the franchise. Due to its pretty short length, I would recommend to pick this one up on a sale and/or when the new character modes come out.", "timestamp_created": 1482432444, "timestamp_updated": 1482501939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28533235": {"recommendationid": "28533235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040403353", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482359922}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me just say it first: yes! The game is pretty good.\n\nHowever, when you played Pirates Curse before, then may not expect a direct sequel to that. I mean, yeah, Storywise it is the continuation of the Shantae francise, but when it comes to gameplay, it's kinda more like Riskys Revenge and the first game on the GBC.\nAnd even then it is quite frankly less of a Metroidvania then before. There are no Dungeons anymore for example. Instead you got regular levels who seems more linear at the first sight, and play suprisingly more like the old Mega Man games, with focus of challenging levels with plenty of obstacles to avoid instead of the open nature with a lot of exploration what Shantae used to be (yeah, the old Games had also a lot of tricky platforming, but in this game there are way more bottomless pits and instant death Spikes like in Mega Man as I already mentioned).\nHowever, when you unlock more and more transformations (and there are a lot of them, much more then in the old titles) and revisit old areas, which the game forces you on a repeatedly routine, then you realise that there are more and more open areas hidden inside of these levels where you can find new Items and upgrades and such. And because you can buy a move which can warp you through revisited levels and later even unlock a transformation with that you can fly and skip hard platforming, backtracking isn't even that much of a problem anymore. However, there is no more Map that help you to orient, but too be honest, it isn't needed, since the levels are still quite linear.\n\nSo yeah, the gameplay rocks, but sadly, the Story doesn't. Instead of a fully fletched Story, we got more like a Saturday Morning Cartoon approach with small stories that surround every level and a tiny, tiny main plot that got it's focus at the end of the game, and is pretty predictable to be honest. It's not bad, but kinda dissapointing since Pirates Curse felt more massive beause it was one big story (and the Story in that game was really good!). \n\n\nBut that aside: It is really a good game, the second best in the series too be honest. and while I had my problems with the Story,  the gameplay, the really excellent humor and awesome Soundtrack made me forgive this one particular flaw. If you are a Shantae fan: buy this game! If this is you are a newcomer to the francise, hmmm, try Pirates curse first, or even Riskys Revenge so you can tell if you like this Gameplaystyle.

Wait for DLCs.\n\nAs it is, and considering how the game's supposed to be expanded, it's good, it's really great. Most importantly, the graphics are really well done and don't even get close to straying off of the style the game usually goes for: Toonish, charming, colorful, vivid, and with noticeable details and tweaks. I believe it's the first time WayForwad does 3d models on one of their IPs, and they did it great for a first time. Characters are still well-put sprites in a 3d-2d parallax world. Really comes together as a modernized classic way of doing things.\n60FPS engine, but animations aren't all 60fps. It still looks consistant and doesn't really bother. Also, yes, it comes with chest jigglies. As it's obvious. I mean, WayForward? Fanservice? Isn't that the same thing? /joke\n\nThis however doesn't stop the game from being fun and really great. As always, the prime 3 aspects i like about this company are on point: Decent difficulty (questionable here but whatever) and fun gameplay, great artstyle and personality, absolutely rocking synth muslc from Jake Kaufman AKA Virt. [b]Album is out on bandcamp now btw[/b]\n\ngame's a bit short, you can get 100% in the base game mode in 5-6 hours approx, considering how the other games took up to 8 hours for that (all of those are player-dependant times, might take longer if you're not familiar with the games or genre).\n\nThe game's very iconic and takes everything positive from the other games, such as returning gags, levels, enemies, bosses, transforms and abilities, while still refreshing everything really well.\n\nOn the minus side, because of how short the game is, some features fell under the \"situationally helpful\" cape of negligence, but at least they get used once. There are a few annoying mechanics that were uncalled for, overall for the very stupidly placed pauses inbetween the action (Why is the level start Ready! screen a thing, and why can't you move while it's playing?), but for the most part it still is a great game.\n\nBuyer's advice: Play the other games before. Some of the content might go unappreciated if you haven't played the other games, or just watched a full gameplay. Any works. But still, playing is much more fun than watching, at least for me.\n\n[i][b]Overall, i give it a [8.5-->10]/10 depending on how well executed the DLCs and extra modes come along.[/b][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1482419432, "timestamp_updated": 1490705573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28529725": {"recommendationid": "28529725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024781614", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482418239}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein Armband das den Zauberverbrauch auf Null senkt und ein Zauber der dich unverwundar macht sagt eig. alles \u00fcber den Schwierigkeitsgrad des Spiels aus.

The Graphics might be the best graphics for a platformer ever (up to interpritation) The game play yet simple is always fun. The game is a metroidvania, meaning you will be searching through levels for items instead of just completing the level traditionally. You also tend to go back to levels you completed to find new items to progress the story which can add a ton of replay ability as some of these items are not mandatory and can be pretty neat to play with and score a 100% completion.\n\nThe story ranges from Above average to good. Some times there are questionable scenes that you may think didn't need to be in the story. But its a pretty simple story and im ok with that. I can dig a game with a simple story because sometimes a simple story is better than a complicated one and i think thats the case here.\n\nOverall this game is an amazing platformer with the most stunning graphics in a platformer I've seen and an incredibily rocking sound track and gameplay to back it up.

The bosses were very easy to beat, almost too easy.\n\nDespite all that, it's pure fun and joy. I adore Shantae and I hope this series will never die.

Same spells, same upgrades. Even the transformations are largely recycled from previous games. In fact there are probably too many transformations. It sometimes felt contrived how the level layout required certain transformations to progress.\n\nThis game can't seem to decide whether it's aiming to bring in new fans, or pander to old fans. The game is more simple and linear compared to previous games, but spends next to no time on character introductions, expecting you to already know who everyone is. And while the old transformations do look great in HD, they lack personality. In particular, I really miss the monkey's idle animation from Risky's Revenge.\n\nThe pacing is also kind of messy. As with previous games, to progress you need to find the relevant collectibles in levels you've already cleared. This creates a sort of slow, leisurely \"scavenger hunt\" type of game, during which you jump around and fight enemies set to an exciting soundtrack. This structure was also in previous games, and is not a problem.\nWhat I'm talking about is the \"in-between\" segments, when you talk to NPCs to get hints and hand in quest items. There's very little dialogue before you're onto your next task. So you might spend half an hour finding the item you need, and then you get less than a minute of plot before you're onto the next level. The game felt really short, too.\n\nWhile we're at it, boss battles. This game's bosses are pitiful. I'm not talking about difficulty, I'm talking about buildup. Risky's Revenge had actual dungeons in which the bosses resided, and you would know their name before meeting them.\nPirate's Curse was longer, so didn't do this for each boss. Those it did build up, though, were well done.\nThen we get to Half Genie Hero, and there's practically no build up for any of them, least of all the final boss, which is only introduced when the battle begins.\n\nThe final bosses are the most irritating example of this. RR had the boss take something the player themselves had come to cherish, and turn it against them. PC had a deliberate repeat of this, but getting the right collectibles adds a twist to the ending which turns everything upside down. HGH has the boss show up and fight you. And... that's pretty much it. If more effort had gone into developing the plot or characters, the stakes might have felt higher, but as it was, it was just a moderately more difficult boss battle.\n\nIf you've read this far, you might be wondering when I get to the reason this is in the positive reviews section. And that reason is that despite all its flaws, this is a good game that I enjoyed playing, and I think it is well worth the $20 USD pricetag.\n\nThe other games are better though.", "timestamp_created": 1482404311, "timestamp_updated": 1482404311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28524987": {"recommendationid": "28524987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271142770", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482463597}, "language": "schinese", "review": "dlc please", "timestamp_created": 1482400822, "timestamp_updated": 1482400822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500393", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28524633": {"recommendationid": "28524633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052970597", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482399117}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great addition to the Shantae series!

I might be a bit biased because of this, lol.)\n\nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward as a platformer, but even if it's a little more on the simple side it's very polished. Most of the game involves platformer puzzles and exploration, greatly expanded by how the transformations affect your ability to move through levels.\n\nSome forms unfortunately only see use for one or two puzzles and don't have any practical use outside of that, which is a little disappointing, but far from a dealbreaker.\n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely killer, and just to stress again the visuals are great. I haven't seen a non-pixel 2D game look this good in a very long time.\n\nThe only other gripe I have would maybe be some of the fights are underwhelming or overly simplistic: wait for enemy to use X attack, then attack back a few times. Rinse and repeat many many times until dead. The AI for the fights is more based on patterns rather than reaction--enemies won't do anything different depending on what you're doing, they'll just go through their own motions and soak up what damage you output. There also doesn't feel like there's a lot of randomness in the fights--when a boss uses a move, it operates the same way every time.\n\nIt's a little short and a bit easy--leisurely playing will take maybe 5-6 hours to beat, but the game also is only $20, so it's hard to complain about length considering its cost. Plus it's a game that has a decent bit of replay value with speedrun achievements and alternate modes (including a few upcoming and DLC ones). It's also worthwhile going for a full clear.\n\nOverall though it's also a game with a focus on its art, soundtrack, characters, and writing, all of which are good or better, without being held back by elements such as length, difficulty, and mechanics which are 'adequate'.\n\n[spoiler]Also Tuki was woefully underimplemented :([/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1482394172, "timestamp_updated": 1482810523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28523559": {"recommendationid": "28523559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267810482", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497452692}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u62fc\u6b7b\u62fc\u6d3b100%\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u7269\u54c1\u9690\u85cf\u573a\u6240\u8fd8\u662f\u548c\u524d3\u4f5c\u8111\u6d1e\u4e00\u6837\u5927   \u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u6b22\u4e50\u7684\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u8f7b\u677e\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u9002\u4e2d\u7684\u96be\u5ea6(\u67d0\u51e0\u4e2a\u5173\u5361\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u7ec8\u4e8e\u6ca1\u524d\u4f5c\u90a3\u4e48\u9b3c\u755c\u4e86)\uff0c9.5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1482393257, "timestamp_updated": 1482393257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28523474": {"recommendationid": "28523474", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997524525", "num_games_owned": 1867, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503473571}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty much all you'd expect from a Shantae game with refined controls, more content and a much improved level-select system which cuts out the filler content and lets you get right into the action.", "timestamp_created": 1482392774, "timestamp_updated": 1482392774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28523301": {"recommendationid": "28523301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088905537", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482416811}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u044b\u0445 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 - \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u044f\u0448\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439. \u0413\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0447\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u043c, \u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f - \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0442\u0435\u043c\u0443. \u0412 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c, WayForward, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430, \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442.", "timestamp_created": 1482391826, "timestamp_updated": 1482391826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639601", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28523140": {"recommendationid": "28523140", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990794729", "num_games_owned": 5860, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489450938}, "language": "english", "review": "DISCLAIMER: I KICKSTARTED THIS GAME\nI suck at sidescrollers.

Nun zum Spiel selbst. Die Story kn\u00fcpft logischerweise an das Ende von Shantae and the Pirate's Curse an, also w\u00e4re es empfehlenswert diesen vorher gespielt zu haben. Es ist jedoch nicht zwingend notwendig. Das Spiel hat eine optische Anpassung erfahren, die sich wirklich sehen l\u00e4sst.

Altough quite short and simplistic on some aspects, Shantae delivers in what it promised. Shantae has:[list]\n[*]Lovely visuals and character-design\n[*]Interesting level design that encourages exploration and revisits\n[*]Likeable characters and a easy-going plot\n[*]Power-ups\n[*]Awesome music[/list]\n\nHowever, the game falls kind of short on some areas. For starters, it is incredibly easy... so much in all my playtime I didnt even died once nor had a hard time figuring where to go or do next.  Thats not inherently a bad thing but way sooner than later your character gets so strong it becomes laughable how you breeze through the stages. Magic spells are incredibly strong and in general, power-up items are really easy to get, you can pretty much start breezing through the game after the first hour of playing. Bosses are incredibly easy (with the exception of one or two, but not by much tho) and stages are pretty to see, but easy to traverse once you start getting one or two items and power-ups.\n\nOutside of the game being way-too-easy for its own good in general what it offers is great. The levels are pretty and intersting, the music is insanely good and, even if it easy, it will provide you with a handful of hours of great fun.\n\nAgain, its only sin(?) is just that its way too easy for its own good but that might be a plus to some, not so much for the more hardcore of players tho. \n\nTotally recomended", "timestamp_created": 1482351216, "timestamp_updated": 1482351216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28514813": {"recommendationid": "28514813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165824037", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510687040}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u044b\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0434\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0439, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0449\u0443\u0449\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0435. \u041f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438, \u0430 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0438 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u041d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043a\u0443\u0441, \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430 \u0431\u044b \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435.\n\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0449\u0451 DLC c \u0420\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438.", "timestamp_created": 1482350498, "timestamp_updated": 1482351993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28514638": {"recommendationid": "28514638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204171983", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508376369}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game!

Well now that I've finished a playthrough I'd like to give it a good, honest review.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the series, Shantae is a half-genie who protects a tiny little town called Scuttle Town that sits along the coast of a place called Sequin Land.  She defeats enemies by whipping them with her hair, and can eventually transform herself into multiple different forms that are useful for accessing hidden parts of the map (Some of these you'll unlock as the game progresses. Others you'll have to find on your own).  If you've played any other Metroidvania-style platformer, you'll have an idea what you're meant to do. Jump on often shaky platforms, defeat enemies, find lots of hidden items.  The platforming works well--the controls are quick and responsive and everything feels really good.  The game's story is pretty light fare, written cleverly.  It's not laugh-out-loud funny but there are a few good lines scattered about.\n\nGraphically, the game is a treat.  It has a very cartoony art style, full of vibrant colors--it's a welcome relief from all the brown, gritty reality of most of today's games.  The game's audio is well done too. Voice acting is limited (only a few characters have any lines at all, and most of their lines aren't voiced).  This is easy to overlook, however.  The soundtrack is provided by Jake Kaufman (you may know him as virt) and the music in the game is up to his typical standards--it's mostly a combination of dance-pop and 70s funk with a light Middle Eastern vibe that fits the game really well.  Most of the music in the game is either new, or arranged versions of tracks from previous games. I don't think any of the music is carried over from previous titles, but there are a few that will sound familiar to anyone who's played older games.\n\nIf you are looking for a hardcore platformer, this isn't your game.  The difficulty curve in Half-Genie Hero is pretty mild, and even a novice player should be able to complete their first playthrough in about 6 hours or so. The challenge to this game comes in finding all the collectibles scattered throughout the world, or in attempting speed runs.  Some collectibles are hidden in plain sight and it's just a matter of unlocking the right power to get to them. Others are hidden deep in barely-accessible parts of a level and require some serious searching to locate.\n\nSo would I recommend this game?  Overall, yes.  It's not too expensive, and there's a lot of fun to be had playing it even if it's not incredibly hard.", "timestamp_created": 1482342524, "timestamp_updated": 1482342524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28511307": {"recommendationid": "28511307", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990287175", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482337898}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game to play through, controls are tight, attacking feels good.

Some puzzles can be fun to solve while others are merely wait until you get X powerup then backtrack, which honestly didn't really fit that well in an arcade style game like this.\n\nBut this game has a few issues with challenge, there are a couple of parts which are challenging BUT because of 1 hit kill hazards, so it is more of a change the angle of your jump or timing challenge.\n\nSpells feel quite useless, only ever needing to use one just because I had to for a quest. Some forms just outright break some of the platforming stages allowing you to just skip entire segments by simply going off screen (Much like with Super Mario World and the Cape).\n\nThe main meat of the game, the gameplay itself the generic enemies are rather forgetable outside 1 - 2 enemy designs and many enemy types you can easily just ignore and run through if you feel like it. The main offender for this happening is how easy and quick it is to obtain powerups in this game that basically breaks your character. You will find that you are practically invincible after the first stage, once you obtained 2 health powerups and the armor that reduces all damage taken by half.\n\n\nSo to put thing short, the game is fun to play but if you are after something that can challenge you this may not be the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1482338854, "timestamp_updated": 1482338854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28510984": {"recommendationid": "28510984", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998145827", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515489265}, "language": "french", "review": "toujours aussi bon niveau game play ( + de transformation + de secret a d\u00e9couvrir ) en a vraiment envie de d\u00e9couvrir les moindres recoins de la map.\nles musiques sont impeccable \u00e7a colle bien au nouveau graphisme du jeu.\ncependant le sc\u00e9nario reste toujours aussi moyen, la traduction FR est assez mauvaise (quelques faute d'orthographe et de compr\u00e9hension ) et il y a aussi quelques bug du genre (le h\u00e9ro se t\u00e9l\u00e9port a un endroit de l'\u00e9cran) mais bon on les pardonne le jeu vient juste de sortir \u00e7a se corrigera avec le temps.\n\ndans l'ensemble le jeu est bien et reste correcte pour son prix", "timestamp_created": 1482337923, "timestamp_updated": 1482387838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28510874": {"recommendationid": "28510874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298535915", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488521957}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is another tight, entertaining adveture from wayforward.

See it [url=www.omaralikaj.com/reviews/games/shantae-half-genie-hero]HERE[/url]. Here here a lot things I liked about the game, and a few I didn't:\n\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\nInteresting plot, and sub-plots and missions, plus funny and what-on-earth moments.\n\nTransformations, acquired from the messenger, item shop, or snake merchant make a fun gameplay. Unlike Mario, they're essential in clearing certain areas.\n\nI like that this game is not too cryptic, but some ways of collecting items were harder than others to figure out.\n\nGreat soundtracks. Having played the mobile version of \"Lit\", WayForward did it again.\n\nCool audio and sound effects, but some like Shantae ducking, or the centipede making grunt sounds, felt out of place.\n\nThe graphics feel like an interactive cartoon show. The stages are pretty, and surprisingly interactive.\n\nBoss fights are fun and challenging, but, getting heart holders, power-ups, items, and acquiring new forms along the way, I felt like the later ones were easy.\n\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\nShantae's story at least is really short. Thankfully, the other stories/DLCs were funded via Kickstarter.\n \nThe game triggers purchased certain power-ups upon controlling my laptop's volume, as opposed to just pressing \"C\".\n \nI avoid blowing up enemies with my flame attack when there are many of them on the screen, so the game won't crash. This happened 3x.\n\nNo clarification that store-bought items are essential for 100% completion.\n \nYou get \"Hero Mode\" after beating the game, but it feels unneeded, and only ideal for speedrun or clearing early stages and side missions quicker.\n\nThe brat the Mayor replaced Shantae with, even when she was genuinely worried, WayForward still showed the same image of her being a snub in the dialogues.\n\nAnd finally, some stages or missions take a long time to get back to, especially the \"Great Escape\", where you can't get hit by a gear during [u]first try only[/u].

I can definitely recommend it.\n\nFor those that ask, is it like Pirates Curse? Yes and no.\nWhile 1/2 Genie Hero keeps the goofy Characters (friends and foes alike).\n\n- I think the major difference to the prequels is: \nNo more \"Zelda like\" Dungeons where you have to go back and forth collecting keys to unlock doors.\nInstead each world has stories when you visit them. The developers made it a nice touch that almost every world is a bit different when you visit them a second time and the mainstory bypassed them.\n\n- The Graphic is a pure collection of ART XD\n- The Music is good too\n- The Gameplay is good. Controlls are easy, but in my opionion the game should also have had a hard mode. Its way easier to beat than the former games. \nIronically the game seems harder to me in the beginning when you only start with 2 heart containers... later you easily upgrade to half demage and collect like 10 more Heartcountainers. Only in Bossfights you can run into trouble of losing all energy then.\n\n- That aside there are lots of items to search for. Stying true to a metroidvania like game you can only reach certain upgrades and items after you got something else at other places.\n\n\nThe Main story (including collecting all sidequests items) can be done in around 6 hours of a first playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1482318776, "timestamp_updated": 1504335054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

It has its shortcomings, but its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. 9/10\n\nFrom the studio that brought Booty Genie, Booty Genie 2, and Booty Genie 3: Booty Pirate, comes a new installment in the Booty Genie franchise, this time with full animated HD jigglies.\n\nNow for my serious review.\n\n-----------\n\nGAMEPLAY: 8/10\nIt's a platformer, and a very good one at that. The jumping feels exactly as you'd expect, and Shantae's movement speed is at a very comfortable pace.\nI very much enjoyed the amount of transformations available in the game, but at some point there were simply too many, and as a result, there were some transformations that ended up not being used at all. For example, I think there were 2 areas total where bat form was required, whereas every other area could have been covered by harpy form much more quickly and easily. If not for the fact that you don't get harpy form until later, I don't think I would have used bat form at all.\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero follows the same formula as the games before it, in which you collect items for people in different areas to unlock the next. Every now and then, you have to return to a previous level with new powers in order to access areas you were previously unable to. Now, this works extremely well in Pirate's Curse, where you only really have to go back maybe 3 or 4 times. In this game, however, I ended up going back to Main Street maybe 6 times, and because of how linear the levels feel this time around, it seems a lot more tedious than it really is. Gone are the exploratory corridors and branching pathways in this game. Seriously, where are the dungeons?\nWhile it may seem tedious, the overall game feel, I think, makes up for the tediousness of the game. These were minor inconveniences at worst. The game still plays exactly as it should, and it feels amazing.\n\n-----------\n\nDESIGN: 10/10\nWayforward strikes out of the park once again with this game. The art design fits the style of the characters and the tone of the game so well. It uses a mix of 2D graphics on 3D environments, and still manages to fit the series as well as the old pixel art style, almost better even. Backgrounds were memorable, and really popped out, to the point where you could tell what level you were in just by the lighting. The new 2.5D approach to this one got a little bit dizzying in Scuttle Town Square, but it was something that I got used to very quickly.\nThe music, as usual, is a major high point to the game. The retro vibe mixed extremely well with the Middle Eastern tones, especially in Main Street. Virt, applause to you.\n\n-----------\n\nOVERALL: 9/10\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero is most definitely a Shantae game. It's got great controls, great gameplay, great art design, and amazing music, and I am excited for the upcoming DLC. Can I recommend it at $20.00? You'd probably wait for a sale or something, unless you plan on replaying this game a lot. It's no Pirate's Curse, but it's definitely one of the best in the series.", "timestamp_created": 1482304940, "timestamp_updated": 1482304955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28502111": {"recommendationid": "28502111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042706874", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482570426}, "language": "english", "review": "More like Shantae: hafta to take a shower sometime today because boy do I reek", "timestamp_created": 1482303630, "timestamp_updated": 1482303630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28501987": {"recommendationid": "28501987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041604933", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483249252}, "language": "english", "review": "The graphics are adorable.

Now we have it Christmas 2016 and its finally there, after 3 years of waiting. Is the game good? Was it worth the wait? That all will i try to explain here in my review.\n\n[h1]Shantae and the long story short[/h1]\nShantae began her journey back on the GBC but got more fame on the Nindendo DSi systems with her 2nd game \"Risky's Revenge. Both titles were more like [b]Action adventures[/b] with (more or less) open worlds, metroidvania-like and a lot room to explore. Since Game nr. 3, \"The Pirates Curse\", The series changed more into a \"stage-like-RPG\" game. Still, the \"stages\" were pretty big and you really had a lot room (\"still\") to explore. Half-Genie Hero actually made more a step backward and gave the player only [spoiler]7 pretty short stages[/spoiler] to explore, one of them is the main town. Said that, HGH feels somehow \"smaller\" and even plays that way. the stages have maybe about 3 areas and are not even \"that\" big. At least not so big that HGH has a Map system (so it doesnt has one) unlike other Shantae games. They also are more like \"walk from left to right\" unlike in the Pirates Curse.\n\nIn terms of music and sounds i can say they really did a good job, i actually like some of the tracks playing in the background. Still, they actually are not better than from the other Shantae games and some others fails to shine, like the song with actual lyrics.\n\nFor the grafic i can say i actually enjoy them but i have to say, if i looked at the concept art, i really miss some emotions or animations somehow, like Shantaes actually Belly-\"dances\" are now just the stereotype \"move the hip from left to right\". No other, cute dances or animations or like.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=822449288\n\nNext to this they ported the Stand animation from RR/PC into this game and it looks, honestly, very very awkward. They should have gone with the original stand from the GBC Shantae game - i might understood why they used this \"stand animation\", still it really doesnt fits the artstyle of the game. But as i said already, it feels like the game lacks some animations. a good sample would be here:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819664109\n\nThe characters are suppost to show fear but they dont, no emotions at all.\nI know, animations \"handdrawn\" like the game already shows is a lot work but thinking about that they had 3 years time(+), and normaly it SHOULD had been done in 2014, it looks a bit \"rushed\" all of a sudden. The only \"effort\" i can sadly see is how \"badly\" they sexualized Shantae and all other characters. The full game feels like, if you dont look only \"its gameplay\", like (nothing personal) some nerd who wants to get laid created a character with tits that all effort and money went right between the characters tits. Like for real, if you dont belive me, here a timeline:\n\nhttp://www.dmgice.com/revs/images/shantaethroughtheyears.png\n\nAnd if you dont belive me, nearly ever \"good\" looking character is Female, has a very \"obvious\" short looking dress and mostly moves (and \"talks\") that way...[b]and the cherry on top is that THAT also counts for good 90% of the \"monsters\".[/b] \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819664595\n\nFemale Spiders, Slimegirls and other \"female\", \"boobed\" monster appiers in someway, showing her \"content\" in all their best way. I have no problem, as \"normal Hetero Male Person\", to see tits and hips in a video game but it gives a right time and moment....and the right games for that, if you know what i mean. But we are talking about a game from [b]Wayforward[/b]...\n\n[h1]A Backers opinion...[/h1]\nThinking about that this game \"should\" be done in 2014 and its now 2 years to late is a [b]HUGE[/b] and long time to wait. At the end, it sure is finally there but the game feels still rushed and somehow, it really misses a bit more \"emotions\" which went only into the (so it seems) \"female breast sizes\". I mean, if they wana make it [b]that[/b] obvious that the full game is only about tits and hips, they should make it like namco and bring out a \"nearly naked shantae DLC\" for 5 bucks, really. If i dont look only on the sexualized characters (which is pretty hard since nearly every good character is female and nearly \"half-naked\" somehow...), the game plays really good and nice. Still, it misses the \"charm\" of the older games from the series since its only \"Level based\" and not \"Metroidvania\" World based. Next to this, i finished the game with 100% in about ~7 hours (my screenshot shows more but i also was afk for a moment and forgot the game was running) which feels, next to 3 years of wait which were to long, way to short for the peroid of waiting time i had as backer. I didnt expect a very huge Zelda-like clone adventure but if i look back at, as sample, RR, you had a pretty large world to explore and that actually made a whole lot fun, which i miss in this game. It just feels \"short\" even if i had fun playing it it felt more like a cookie you eat but you want more but you know, this was the last.\n\n[h1]So is it worth it?[/h1]\nIf i look at the pricetag for 20\u20ac, i [b]can recomment it[/b] but only if you really [b]want it or youre a hardcore Shantae-fan.[/b] It is not a bad game but it lacks of content (right now at least) and feels somehow rushed even after 3 years of pur waiting. Next to this you have this game done in round about ~7 hours (or less) - and that 100%. It looks nice, maybe a bit \"to much\" [b]sexualized[/b]. I actually had fun playing it but if you want to try a better Shantae game you should try the Original GBC or risky's revenge, with both great worlds to explore which you will [b]NOT[/b] find in this game title, Sadly. Still, it sure is worth playing but as backer im kinda a bit disappointed about that whole 3 years went only into tits and hips and not into a better gameplay, longer levels or maybe even a Metroidvaina-Open World...", "timestamp_created": 1482299891, "timestamp_updated": 1488983453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28501218": {"recommendationid": "28501218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064054185", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487412567}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd8\u662f\u539f\u6765\u7684\u5473\u9053\uff0c\u6b22\u4e50\u840c\u9a9a\u8111\u6d1e\u5927\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4f4e\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u6bd4\u524d\u4f5c\u8fdb\u6b65\u5f88\u5927\uff08\u867d\u7136\u7acb\u7ed8\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u524d\u4f5c\u7684\uff09\u3002[spoiler]\u770b\u5230\u4eba\u9c7c\u5de5\u5382\u6211\u5c31\u55b7\u4e86[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1482299019, "timestamp_updated": 1482299019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28501004": {"recommendationid": "28501004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002148595", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505008412}, "language": "english", "review": "A good game, that could have been a great game if Wayforward would have put a bit more into it.

Two, monkey controls for climbing might take you a bit of getting used to, as they're not what you'd think they'd be (pressing toward the wall does nothing, pressing away from the wall holds you still, can't remember if it felt this sticky in Risky's Revenge).\n\nOverall though, I am loving the game and am very happy with how it turned out!

Sort of like a Metroidvania with the level-to-level gameplay of Mega Man.[/i][/b]\n\nGameplay is fun. There's lots of items to collect if you want to get the 100% clear rating! Revisiting the stages with power-ups you've collected since is rewarding, occasionally expanding into areas you didn't expect. The upgrade shop is a nice idea, but could do with a bit more stuff in it. The difficulty curve starts a bit higher than average - it might be a bit difficult for a beginner player - but it peters out towards the end as it doesn't scale well to match all of the upgrades you've amassed. The bosses are okay, but some of them are quite boring, especially [spoiler]the two phases of the final boss[/spoiler]. Controls are nice and responsive (as they should be!), but I'd recommend using a gamepad.\n\nThe visuals are great! Shantae definitely benefits from not being on a tiny handheld screen! They've built upon the techniques they learnt while making [i]Ducktales: Remastered[/i] - bright 3D environments with 2D animated characters. The characters are really well animated, and share a nice, consistent style.\n\nMusic is on point as well! It's been done by the wonderful Jake Kaufman (who also appeared on previous WayForward titles). Definitely some very catchy songs in there, my favourite being the [spoiler]haunted castle[/spoiler] stage.\n\nLuckily the story isn't the focus of the game, because it's an afterthought at best. I'm not familiar with the series, but it seems clear that they tried to squeeze every single earlier-established character into the game. They also introduce a new character... only to have [spoiler]that character be killed off five minutes later[/spoiler]. Overall, it doesn't really make much sense.\n\nThe writing is terrible - it definitely tries way too hard to be funny. It seems like it was written by a four-year-old; I remember one of the worst offenders being \"[spoiler]hey, guess what? Monkey butts[/spoiler]\". Unfortunately, you need to read some of the text to know what to do next; if you don't want to read it, try skipping through the main text, then talk to the NPC characters afterwards to get them to repeat the important details.\n\nOverall, it's a good platforming experience!

That being said, the experience was a thoroughly enjoyable one. There is DLC content on that way the will no doubt add several dozen more hours of play time to the game for me. I'm actually half-considering learning to speed run it, that's how much fun I've had with it.\n\nThe sprite work in the game is phenomenal, animation that is both smooth as butter and full of personality.

The art and music are excellent, the character designs are cute and fun, and the gameplay is solid.\n\nFor those who have never played a Shantae title, the premise is fairly unique: You play a half-genie bellydancing heroine who fights enemies using her magical prehensile hair and magical dances that allow her to transform into a dozen-odd different animals.\n\nThe game, unlike most previous Shantae titles, is split into distinct levels, which vary between being fairly linear to fairly open-ended, though both sorts allow for a fair amount of exploration and discovery. This division does make getting 100% much easier, as the level select lets you know what's left to find in a given level, so rather than having to hunt through the entire overworld you just have to explore on level, which is rather nice.\n\nIt's not flawless, the story is largely an afterthought, the jokes can fall flat, and some of the transformations see essentially no use, but the game is definitely fun and very much worth a look.\n\nIt took me about 7 hours to 100% the Shantae campaign (an additional campaign where you play as her arch-nemesis, Risky Boots, is being worked on), so this isn't going to occupy you for months, but that does make it comparable to Super Metroid for the amount of content, which is fine by me.", "timestamp_created": 1482274871, "timestamp_updated": 1482274871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28495595": {"recommendationid": "28495595", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970739339", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 355, "playtime_forever": 993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513663532}, "language": "english", "review": "I am proud to have backed Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero, and along with games like Shovel Knight stands as evidence to the usefulness of Kickstarter in delivering the game developers wanted to make to the players who wanted to play it. From the onset to the credits, its a delightfully colorful and vibrant platformer, that happens to be well written and funny on top of its mechanical excellence. I consider it a treat for returning fans and I'm sure, for newcomers as well.\n\nAs the first title in the series built for home consoles and PC, the graphical improvements are immediately apparent. We have come a long way from Game Boy Color, with vastly more fluid sprite animations over pleasing 3D backgrounds. It has notably lost none of the magic of its predecessors, as well as its reputation for charmingly attractive character designs that have just enough appeal to not be tacky. The controls are spot on, and should be familiar to anyone to has played SNES or Genesis era titles with a keyboard. \n\nI must give special consideration to the soundtrack, which I coughed up extra for during the Kickstarter. If you're at all familiar with Jake \"Virt\" Kaufman and his work on the previous Shantae games, Shovel Knight, Contra 4, Scurge: Hive and many other projects, you'll know what to expect. He's really outdone himself this time.\n\nThe transformation dances that are a hallmark of the series return, including at least once dance that hasn't been seen since the very first game. This one has by far the most dances and other upgrades, enough that collecting all of them makes you virtually indestructible, in particular making the final boss fight rather trivial. This would require you to actually FIND everything, but it's not the hardest Metroidvania to explore. In fact, it's structured more like the Megaman X games. It also has some harder platforming segments then Pirate's Curse.\n\nThe few negative reviews of the game all talk about the difficulty, or rather, the lack of it, and the afforementioned backtracking. At no point in the game did I find either of these things aggrivating. Having recently completed a solo playthrough of Bloodborne, I can tell you that there are hard games out there. And there are cheap ones, overhyped ones, and ones that value leaderboard scores over anything resembling fun. Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero is none of those things, and that is fine.

The animations with Wrench are particularly fun.\n+ Factory stage has a nice narrative progression.\n+ Stage progression is more arcade-style than metroidvania-style, which is a fun change for the series.\n+ New-form-containing genie rooms remind me of Rayman (PS1), and make understanding the basic utility of new forms very easy.\n+ The writing is fun and self-deprecating. Most of the dialogue has great gameplay utility as well, guiding the player with hints (though the bolded text takes some of the fun out of parsing dialogue for the important bits).\n+ VO is sprinkled throughout the game and contributes to the personality of the characters and dialogue. It seems like a clever (and budget friendly) way to equip our imaginations with a little more material.\n\n- The megaman-style disappearing blocks are played out, and a little overused in some of the level designs.\n- The dance selection screen is colorful, but has an odd timing-element that automates the cycling of menus. More than once I mis-selected as the menu switched at just the wrong time.\n- Stages tend to introduce a new mechanic, but they don't seem particularly novel so far. This level features something you can climb / hang from (Donkey Kong Country). This level features wind that pushes you (Megaman). This level features...enemy spawners? Levels don't feel surprising after the novelty of new visuals wear off.\n- The monkey form feels weirdly sticky when climbing on walls. It can feel awkward when I try to climb up over the side of a wall, or transform back into human form. The time lost performing attempting these acts often leads to cheap damage in combat situations.\n- projectile-wielding enemies tend to shoot from off-screen, which can lead to cheap damage when playing an area for the first time. \n- The Wilbur worm escape features level design that essentially dooms the player if they proceed up the wrong path. The choice is arbitrary the first time a player sees it, so these deaths are very frustrating.\n- Game over screen should have more character in a game as colorful as this. Players may see it several times, so why not try some arkham-asylum-style flavor dialogue?\n- The hitbox of Shantae's human form seems a bit large. Shrinking it a bit within the actual sprite raises the odds for a daring, exciting dodge. Players who get used to the smaller hitbox can use it to make combat faster, more risky, and more showy\n- Characters often animate during cutscenes and dialog, but without any zoom, this easily goes unnoticed (some dramatic zoom wouldn't seem out of place in a story this goofy).\n- Monkey form seems to have far more general utility than the crab form.\n- I wish there was an overarching villain to give the story a visible destination. As it stands, the magnet contraption ties things together a bit, but the player isn't even told how many pieces remain, or what the final design looks like (unless I'm missing something-- perhaps there was a way to look at the blueprints before handing them to uncle).\n- The liberal use of VO really gives the characters...character, but we don't need Shantae revealing the high-level strategy to each boss phase. It takes away the fun a bit, and most are simple enough to simply not need it.\n- There seems to be little difference between a fall-death and a game over. The latter should be a more impactful fate than the former, yet the latter typically places the player at the exact same location as the former, but with full health! Often, it is the better option, as being forced to restart an area without having health replenished sometimes sets the player up for quick, highly-probable (and frustrating) failure.\n- Bosses don't seem to emphasize new abilities much, in the way a Legend-of-Zelda boss would. While LoZ bosses may go overboard with the way they require stage-specific abilities, the bosses here feel a little rote-- all they seem to require is a bit of hair-whipping and jumping, for the most part. Mechanics never really come together, or combine in interesting ways during these fights, and they never really feel exciting as a result.\n\nThank you for your effort on this game, and best of luck moving forward!", "timestamp_created": 1482273705, "timestamp_updated": 1482273743, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.302238", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28495322": {"recommendationid": "28495322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025654300", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482198478}, "language": "english", "review": "Adorable, and hilarious.

The cute style and great humor is all there, but in HD. You can probably tell from the screenshots, but this game looks beautiful and set a very high standard for future Shantae games to come. I also don\u2019t know how Jake Kaufman did it, but the soundtrack is even catchier than the last. I\u2019d also like to note that I really like how many older animations were carried over such as the butt wiggle as well as both the bouncy Shantae and Rottytops idle animation, because it wouldn\u2019t feel right without them.\n\nGameplay:\nWe\u2019re back to regular movement with genie transformations. I thought I'd miss the Pirate items, but transforming is quick and each one serves a good purpose. Levels are pretty big and while there is a decent amount of backtracking, it really feels like you\u2019re exploring the map a lot more than previous titles. So while it is technically backtracking, it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re going back to levels just for the sake of padding. Most of the time you\u2019re looking for more items, if not you\u2019re at least compelled to because finding secrets in this game is fun. Some of the secrets don\u2019t blatantly stick out either so you\u2019ll have to use a bit of brain power to find everything, which I perfectly welcome. Much of the annoyances some people had are also gone, such as being able to leave a level at any time and skipping any parts that you\u2019ve already clear for free (once you receive the ability to). This means more playing and less waiting.\n\nThe combat is quick and satisfying like an old school Castlevania game. You get access to spells and upgrades that generally help you do more damage and take less damage. One of the great things about every one of these upgrades is that they can be toggled off. This is great because after fully completing the game I started a playthrough with minimal upgrades as a challenge. Bosses are generally fun, with a few that are the \u201cwait for your turn\u201d variety.\n\nSome gripes:\nI really only have two issues with the game, the first one being the missing dungeons. If you\u2019ve played the previous Shantae games, you would consider these dungeons a staple in the series. You could say they\u2019ve made up for it with bigger, more explorable levels, but fans have shown that they are missed.\n\nMy second gripe is the difficulty, way too easy this time around. I actually died being careless once or twice on the second level, but once you clear this and you get access to some money, you can reduce your damage by half. On top of that, you start to gain access to a lot more health upgrades so you\u2019ll have tons health. Another issue is that most enemies will not knock you back when getting hit like you would a lot of the time in Pirate\u2019s Curse. Because of this, I normally just ran through levels taking damage for the sake of speed. Most bosses can also be brute forced before you need to use items, however I will admit I had to use healing items for the last boss. If you really wanted to, you could also fully nullify damage by end game which is a very questionable balance decision. I mentioned earlier I'm on a limited upgrade playthrough thanks to being able to toggle off upgrades. Again, I'm glad this is something you can do.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nThis marks the beginning of some great Shantae games. They have the engine and everything they need to make a great game now. I see this game as a little reboot to the series so I\u2019m hoping for many more to come. Some people might call this game too short. My first 100% playthrough was about 5 \u00bd hours, about 1 hour shorter than my first Pirate\u2019s Curse run. I would say the amount of content is just a little under the last game because you save so much time with the new features I\u2019ve mentioned before, such as skipping beaten sections. Another thing that saves time is that the town NPCs actually give you hints on where to go so you more or less always know what you have to do. Regardless of the short time, I loved every minute of it and I\u2019m still re-playing the game even with all the achievements. I can\u2019t wait for Risky\u2019s campaign and any more content to come. If you\u2019re into these types of games, there\u2019s absolutely no reason you shouldn\u2019t own Pirate\u2019s Curse and Half Genie Hero.\n\nEdit: And now the added content/DLC (received free for being a kickstarter backer)\n\nHard mode: It's actually pretty hard. There is smaller limit to useable items and enemies not only do more damage, but are faster too. Definitely harder to brute force your way through.\n\nPirate Queen's Quest: Fun alternate story where you play as Risky. Has altered levels tailored to the returning pirate items you receive throughout the story. It rewards you for looking for the extra collectables by using them make your abilities stronger.\n\nFriends to the End: Tag-team control Shantae's 3 friends each with their attacks and abilities. A decent challenge too since there is shared health and very limited healing. Similar to Pirate Queen's Quest, the levels are tailored to the abilities, which are all available from the get-go. There's also an interesting mechanic where your characters do more damage the more gems you collect, but you drop some upon taking damage.\n\nThe extra content altogether can easily extend the game for another 4-10 hours depending on how much of a completionist you are. If you want really want extend your stay in Sequin Land, I'd say pick them up, but maybe wait for a sale as it is a little pricy.", "timestamp_created": 1482271708, "timestamp_updated": 1513761894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28494701": {"recommendationid": "28494701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001366381", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506180485}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome", "timestamp_created": 1482271092, "timestamp_updated": 1482271092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28494576": {"recommendationid": "28494576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045044568", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482484947}, "language": "english", "review": "So far this game is fucking awesome.

The art style and animation is so fluid and detailed, there are times when I'm honestly not sure if what I'm looking at is a sprite or 3D model. I've NEVER had a game make me question this, and it's a testement to artists and animators who brought Shantae to life.\n\nThe game is equally a blast to play. Controls are fluid and responsive, even the seconds needed to cycle between Shantae's animal forms don't take too long to break flow. Combat with Shantae's equally detailed and expressive foes is challenging, without being too frusterating. The platforming never gets so pixel-perfect as to want to break your controller, especially with Shantae having multiple ways to progress through challenges. I am also happy to say I never needed to go Googling for the answer to any puzzles or platforming challenges.\n\nThe game is relatively short, I finished in about 3 days, spending 2-3 hours each run. Despite being metroid-vania in structure, the game is spread over different stages you chose to travel to, akin to Shantae and the Pirate's Curse. However, every stage is PACKED with secrets, and I found myself going through each stage again whenever I gained a new ability. The stages themselves visually change after the boss is defeated, making return trips feel fresh. Plus, there's new characters that will be added to the game for free with their own campaigns in the future, and I am eager to play them!\n\nThe boss fights themselves are amazing. Many even zoom out to make room for the massive boss on screen. Each one is intense and satisfiying to fight, though none proved to be so difficult that I could not defeat on the first try.\n\nLike most of the Shantae games, the plot is fairly standard, and you can probably see all the twists a mile away. Though, like most of the Stantae games, the story is more defined by the characters and their dialogue, all of which is cleaverly written. Shantae and her friends are utterly hilarious and witty, and it's worth playing the game just to see them bounce quips off one another.\n\nMy only serious complaint is the relatively weak finale, especially compared to the previous games. The final battle is disapointing, as is the conclusion, at least compared to the last 2 games. For less serious complaints, the story overall, especially in terms of character development, isn't quite as good as Pirate's Curse, though still good. There's also an issue of balance, as most of Shantae's animal forms are pointless to use in combat. You even wind up finding upgrades that enable them to attack too late in the game for them to be of any use. Shanate my actually have too many attacks, spells and abilities, most of which can't match her standard hair attack. And by the end of the game, I was stuffed with so many healing items and restorative abilities, I could brute-force my way through anything.\n\nNone of these issues make me regret Kickstarting this game. The greatest testement to its quality, is the longing I felt to play more games like it, and seeing nothing in my steam library that match it.\n\nIf you enjoy platformers, quality indie titles, metroid-vania, or just want a enjoyable tale about a beautiful and witty Half-Genie, Buy This Game!\n\n*Note: Was a backer on the Shantae: Half-Genie Hero Kickstarter.", "timestamp_created": 1482265675, "timestamp_updated": 1482265675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28492979": {"recommendationid": "28492979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049157424", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484642896}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich hab mich nie weiter mit der Reihe besch\u00e4ftigt und nach kurzer Zeit spielen merke ich das, das bedauerlicherweise ein Fehler war.

I completed my first playthrough on December 19th. There are no spoilers in this review.\n\nI have been a long time fan of the Shantae series, the unique charm of the protagonist combined with the world the stories are set in made it for a fun and unique experience every time. The series falls into what qualifies as a Metroidvania. All games encourage backtracking and exploration as you gain more powers and mobility, the rewards being more story and of course, a higher completion. To my knowledge the latest two games even have multiple endings determined by your completion rate.\n\n\nSome history:\n---------------\nThe first game in the series called \"Shantae\" came out late in the Game Boy Color's life (2002) and was a superbly animated game for the time. In my opinion it is also the most difficult game in the series so far as the first hour or two before you gain more abilities can be brutal. In this game, Shantae was set out to stop her ever present rival, the pirate called Risky Boots and her horde of Tinkerbats. The physical version of this game is quite rare nowadays. Thankfully, if you own a (New) 2/3DS/XL you can play this game via Virtual Console.\n\nThe second game \"Risky's Revenge\" came out much later (2010) for the DS/DSi and was a worthy follow up that saw Shantae once again facing off against Risky Boots as the pirate lady sought revenge for the events in the first game. This game is still available for the DS series of portables and a PC version has been released as well, available right here on Steam.\n\nThe third game came out in 2014 and is called \"Pirate's Curse\". This is the first game in the series to provide some voice acting, but also features a plot where Risky Boots seeks Shantae's help in defeating a foe more dangerous than her. Nevertheless I think this is the best game in the series so far. This game came out on a lot of platforms, including PC. The 3DS version has some nice depth effects as well.\n----------------\n\nDoes it mean that Half-Genie Hero is an inferior game? Not at all! From a personal perspective I think Pirate's Curse has a better story and higher stakes (although even that could be argued as there is a lot at stake in HGH too, plot wise). But the gameplay, graphics and music are superb as expected from the experienced team at WayForward as well as the designs of Matt and Erin Bozon (who created Shantae) and the music of my favourite games musician, Jake \"Virt\" Kaufman.\n\nThat said, in HGH, Shantae is once again out to face off against Risky Boots who seeks to abuse the knowledge she gained during \"Pirate's Curse\".  The controls are good and the storytelling is funny in the right places. Transformation magic returns once more (it was absent in \"Pirate's Curse\") but has been simplified to speed up game play.\n\nIf you wonder if you should play all games in chronological order...that depends on you! While each game can be played on its own without knowing the earlier stories, there are some small nods here and there to events from previous games. Even so, HGH makes sure you are introduced to each character and immediately know what they are like.\n\nThere were some problems in the version I played and I expect they will get ironed out after the game is released tomorrow. While not breaking, some powers can be exploited to make sections of the game extremely trivial. If you happen to find such a way, consider challenging yourself!\n\nAll in all, it took me the listed time as of this review (11.7) hours to finish the game first time through. I had to peruse some youtube videos to find some items I missed, but the game does clue you in . I recommend talking to everyone after each plot event!\n\n-----------------\n\nTL;DR: Great game, as polished as expected from the creators. Personally I think the story in the previous game was better, but that's my opinion and doesn't detract from the gameplay enjoyment.\n", "timestamp_created": 1482262374, "timestamp_updated":

While it still has a lot of growing to do to live up to everything WayForward has promised (in the form of DLC and other bonuses), the core game is ret-2-go, and for the most part, it's pretty wonderful.\n\nAs with previous installments, Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero follows a policy of \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" retaining the same core gameplay mechanics it's always had while further refining the way extras like items and transformations work.\n\nAs always, Shantae runs, jumps, and attacks enemies with her hair, exploring (and occasionally backtracking through) five main worlds, each chock full of secrets and surprises, and as with the first two titles, earns (or discovers) new transformations that enable her to navigate her world in different ways.\n\nWhile the immediate predecessor (The Pirate's Curse) temporarily did away with transformations in favor of new abilities that blended seamlessly with Shantae's standard controls, reverting to the transformation mechanic is handled tastefully. Shantae can now choose from a palette of up to 12 \"dances,\" which are accessed via a single button press and subsequent single directional command, enabling Shantae to transform in and out of forms hastily to suit the occasion. Many of these dances are optional, hidden, or available for purchase, and a few are actually mutually exclusive- players must decide if they'd rather hold onto, say, a convenient teleportation dance, or a form that spits out free money. Players are free to change their mind on these choices, but only via trade with the merchant who sells said optional dances.\n\nWhile a few of these forms are combat-capable (or can be made so via hidden upgrades), few if any are ever more viable for combat than Shantae's base form. Though Shantae can no longer pick up hand-to-hand secret techniques or upgrade her arsenal with pirate weaponry, her trusty battle-ponytail can be upgraded as in previous titles do deal quite a bit of damage. If this seems duller than integrating projectiles and blades into your fighting style, fear not. Series mainstay items like the Pike Ball and Storm Puff have been given a very welcome upgrade- rather than consumables to be purchased and used at the player's discretion, these magic items now manifest as permanent upgradeable skills in Shantae's arsenal, swapped out as sub-weapons and usable for as long as Shantae has the magic power to deploy them (think Mega Man). Thus, players can now hurl flames and thunderbolts at will, or protect themselves with barriers and damaging satellites. While not quite as seamless as the previous title's pirate powers, this is a fun system that puts the series' classic quirky weapons on full glorious display. \n\nThis is largely a welcome change, but I couldn't help but notice that sometimes the extra powers made things *too* easy. The fully upgraded bubble shield, for example, makes Shantae completely invincible for as long as she has magic remaining. This synergizes very well with items that expand Shantae's mana pool, to the point that by the game's final challenge, I found I was able to remain invincible indefinitely. I'm not sure if this was an oversight or simply poor judgment, but I hope to see it fixed in the near future- I'm not opposed to letting players enjoy some casual godmoding, but I feel like offering it to players just before the last boss is in poor taste.\n\nIndeed, the difficulty of the game is perhaps its weakest attribute. While the game has a few sections that new players are very likely to need to repeat again and again (an aspect soothed tremendously by the introduction of frequent autosaves), I often found myself sufficiently geared and upgraded to pass most challenges on my first try, not from skill, but from simply having so many health items and defensive upgrades at my disposal. The game does offer players the choice to turn off any specific upgrade at will (which is, honestly, a fantastic option to provide), but offers no real incentive to do so- after facing the odd gauntlet of instant death two or three times, I falsely presumed the rest of the game would match that challenge and prepared accordingly, only to watch the rest of the game crumble before my seemingly-bottomles well of force fields and monster steaks, and before I knew it, it was over.\n\nAfter three years in development, I'm a little surprised. True, the worlds are enormous and the powers vast, but five main worlds? Just five? I confess I'm a bit disappointed by the shortness. I completed this game with 100% progress in exactly the same amount of time as I took to complete the previous title. DLC promises new levels and modes, such as the ability to play as the other main characters in their own separate stories, and as much as I did truly and consistently enjoy my first playthrough as Shantae, I do welcome the chance to do it all again differently. Still, until those new modes arrive, I must say, the game feels a little scant for all the work that's clearly gone into it.\n\nAnd to speak of that work- my goodness is this game ever gorgeous. The characters are presented as hand-drawn faithful recreations of their old sprites, and if one recalls just how fluidly-animated those sprites were, one can correctly assume the degree to which this title absolutely gushes charm. The visual style of lively 2D characters against lovingly-rendered 3D backdrops works marvelously here, and unlike other 2.5D titles there's no question of where obstacles begin and end.  Shantae: Half Genie Hero is without a doubt the tightest 2.5D game I've yet experienced.\n\nAs for the story, it's a bit less compelling than its immediate predecessor, but every bit as hilarious. Shantae has really found its essence in humor and awkard charm- I caught myself laughing out loud once or twice, and my heart lept to see certain characters reappear. Still, while I was never bored by the dialogue or story, I don't feel that this game has yet managed to outdo itself in terms of weaving a truly epic narrative. Pirate's Curse opened the characters up to a measure of depth not previously seen- we saw a powerless Shantae, a vulnerable Risky, a lost Rottytops, a successful Bolo and a terminally misfortunate Sky. None of this is present in Shantae's latest adventure, and while it does tell a pleasantly lighthearted story, we've seen WayForward do better.\n\nAfter so much time in development, Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero feels solid, if surprisingly sparse, and is over long before it has a chance to wear out its welcome. With the promise of expansive DLC on the horizon, I feel hopeful that WayForward will gradually flesh this game out into the epic adventure we imagined it becoming. Perhaps future stories will introduce us to new sides of beloved characters, offer us the chance to approach the world from a new perspective, or simply expand upon an already successful formula. For now, though, it's another short yet fantastic romp through Sequin Land, and well worth the price of admission.", "timestamp_created": 1482260174, "timestamp_updated": 1482260174, "voted_up": true,

As you beat bosses and explore the mostly linear levels, you will earn upgrades to open up new pathways through levels and discover secrets in previously completed areas. \n\nWhile relatively small in scale, it matches the length of the previous installments in the franchise (about 6 hours for my first time to 100%) and certainly lives up to the legacy of its lavishly illustrated predecessors, trading in it's former pixel art for hand animated characters and brightly painted textures. Level design is clean and concise, making up for a lack of quantity with a density of quality content for the price. This game maintains the series focus on light-hearted humor and cute characters, with a strong soundtrack to tie the experience together.\n\nSome upgrades curiously seem superficial and under utilized in the level design (i.e. the Bat Sonar ability is only use-able in one side room and the room can still be navigated using visual cues from other light sources), but most content in the game is well utilized throughout the game.\n\nThe storyline feels much more segmented than previous titles, probably due to the fact that each level was a different \"stretch goal\" when the game was being kickstarted. This makes the plotline and characters feel much more episodic and less developed than previous entries (especially comparing it to Pirate's Curse), but overall tone maintains a sort of \"Saturday morning cartoon\" feel that remains consistent across the entire game.\n\nWhile the current release only includes Shantae as a playable character, [i]future updates have promised an expanded roster of playable characters[/i], but they are [b]not[/b] in the game as of this review. Wayforward generally doesn't do many post-release updates (they have a good track record of releasing games that very feature complete), but this is also their first crowdfunded game so time will tell just how well these promised expansions end up being.", "timestamp_created": 1482258770, "timestamp_updated": 1482268905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28490955": {"recommendationid": "28490955", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974653316", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503509763}, "language": "english", "review": "Backed the game, loved it.

The addition of fully-drawn graphics especially help this game shine, especially during Boss Fights and occasional set-piece like sliding through the Mermaid Falls or escaping certain death in Tassel Town's Tower.\n\nTransforming into certain animals has been retooled from the first two games, and this time for the better. It's great to be able to switch between forms on the fly rather than having to perform a brief dancing mini-game or waiting for Shantae to make a specific dance. Only downside is that I felt some transformations are better than others (the Spider Form is borderline useless. ;;), though thankfully there's more good ones than lame ones.\n\nThe overall playthrough did feel pretty short, with only 6 levels (some of which you need to do some backtracking for the sake of plot), but it's not that much shorter than say the entirety of Pirate's Curse. On top of that this is only taking Shantae's Campaign into account, so the matter of game length is currently negligible at best. Really looking forward to when they bring about the Risky Boots and the other Campaigns starring Shantae's friends.\n\nOverall this is a very tightly made package, and is worth the investment!

Playing similar to previous titles like Ducktales Remastered, A Boy and his Blob, and various other titles by the company it shows that Wayforward has not lost it's touch with making platformers. Bright, cheerful and a difficulty that ranges from easy to difficult without being a cackewalk or mind-numbingly difficult. Often compared to Mighty No. 9, Wayforward delivered on something that Comcept failed to do so: a relatively smooth game that has very intuitive gameplay mechanics and stages that put the mind to work as much as the fingers. The bosses, while really large (HUGE in some cases) all have a very capable strategy to beat. To add, while there are cases of a large number of enemies, I never felt at any point where I was forced to take a hit, making untouchable runs a fun challenge. To add, as with most Wayforward titles there is a game clock so speedrunners are going to have fun optimizing this game. The music and voices are superb as always with variations of Jake Kaufman (Wayforwards cheif Maestro) and Cristina Vee's (the voice actor for Shantae amongst others and the lead singer) \"Dance Through the Danger\" interspecced throughout amid an incredible selection of other music.\n\nAs good as the game is, it is not perfect however. There are two nagging issues. The dances are not as dynamic as the tools from Pirate's curse though the mechanic has been improved from previous iterations, utilizing a radial menu system instead of button presses or timing cues. However there are three panels of four icons that cycle automatically, slowing down the gameplay. This can be sped up with a store purchase but that also has the drawback of accidentally picking the wrong dance. Second, like Ducktales Remastered the game is laid out in a stage format as opposed to a single world format like the original game or Risky's Revenge and each stage has a LOt of stuff to collect, often requiring special hidden dances and abilities. This necessitates a LOT of backtracking in the stages, in some cases being required to progress. Personally, not a huge issue but it can frustrate players. Both of these issues are relatively minor and only impact the game in marginal ways. \n\nOverall, another fantastic game from an incredible team who have the support of their fans. People on the fence waiting to know whether it will be any good or not can rest easy knowing that Wayforward can still deliver a fun game with a mix of fast paced gameplay, humorous characters and story, and a bright, colorful world.", "timestamp_created": 1482258230, "timestamp_updated": 1482258230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28490736": {"recommendationid": "28490736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193783002", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505042478}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30ad\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u306e\u767a\u8868\u304b\u3089\u9577\u304f\u5f85\u3061\u7d9a\u3051\u307e\u3057\u305f\n\u4f55\u3068\u4eca\u56de\u306f\u5f85\u671b\u306e\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u300d\u304c\u53ce\u9332\uff01\uff01\u3000\u82f1\u8a9e\u3060\u304b\u3089\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u3063\u3066\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u65b9\u306f\u662f\u975e\n\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u524d\u4f5c\u304b\u3089\u5727\u5012\u7684\u306b\u9032\u5316\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01\u3000\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u53ef\u611b\u3055\u304c80\uff05\u5897\u3067\u3059\n\u3055\u3089\u306b\u524d\u3005\u4f5c\u306b\u3042\u3063\u305f\u5909\u8eab\u304c\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u529b\u306b\u79c0\u3067\u305f\u30b5\u30eb\u3084\u6cf3\u3050\u30ab\u30cb\u306a\u3069\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u3084\u306f\u308a\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u9054\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u652f\u3048\u3089\u308c\u3001\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u6210\u529f\u3057\u305f\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u5b8c\u6210\u5f62\n\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u597d\u304d\u306e\u65b9\u306f\u662f\u975e\u4e00\u5ea6\u624b\u306b\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u307f\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044", "timestamp_created": 1482258053, "timestamp_updated": 1482263883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.806146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28490690": {"recommendationid": "28490690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040904595", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513511379}, "language": "english", "review": "Gotta get that right off the bat: I'm one of 18.500+ backers that made this game possible and I'm happy how it turned out.\n\nYou play as Shantae, a half-genie and sole protector of Scuttle Town, ready to defend it against any threat. She uses her long, purple hair as a weapon, alongside few offensive and defensive spells. Her magical heritage allow her to perform a variety of belly dances that transform her into various forms, each with different uses. For example, she can turn into a crab and a mermaid, but only her crustacean form can snap through tangled vines, while as a water nymph she can swim properly and attack with bubbles.\n\nEven though it is a part of a series, you absolutely don't need to play any other Shantae game. All characters from previous installments (plus few new faces) make a return and are properly reintroduced. Plot is once again silly with tongue-in-cheek, self-aware humor sprinkled all over. There are six levels in total, but as you unlock new abilities you can replay them to find numerous hidden collectibles and secrets. \n\nThis time WayForward went for HD graphics instead of pixel art I dare say it turned out pretty well. All character models are hand drawn, big, colorful and wonderfully animated. They mesh really well with lush, detailed backgrounds.\n\nNot everything is shiny though. Sometimes a tool tip or two would be helpful. For example, it took me half of my play through to realize that you can jump directly down through some platforms. There are also few frustrating sections that simply require player to memorize sequences of obstacles by trial and error. That wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't for inconsistent checkpoints. Thankfully you can obtain a special dance to skip sections of a previously completed levels. Levels that try their hardest to hide that they are way too short and  you will be revisiting them many times even if you don't want to get 100% of items. Story is also noticeably weaker compared to previous Pirate's Curse, where Shantae, Risky and each side-character had a story arc.\n\nFinishing the game took me around 7 hours and unlocked new game plus mode. There is at least one planned free DLC (for backers) with (supposedly) brand new story. There might be more content coming along the way based on stretch goals, which may or may not turn it into best Shantae game to date.\n\nA solid entry in the series, slightly below Pirate's Curse.

As the titular half-genie, Shantae, you run all around the world of Sequin Land, alternating between finding machine parts for your uncle and solving various crises that might pop up. Instead of an interconnected sidescrolling world map with towns and dungeons like previous games in the series, Half-Genie Hero opts to give you a handful of large stages, each divided into sub-areas and each filled with hidden permanent upgrades and/or new mobility options. On your first visits to these stages, you'll only be able to grab a few items. As you unlock new powers, however, you gain the ability to explore new parts of the levels and gain even more abilities and powerups to help you through the game.\n\nShantae's main attack is whipping her hair, but you also have the ability to transform into different animals. These vary in usage, and they'll be often used to get to the aforementioned new areas. From a wall-climbing monkey to a sea-swimming mermaid to a high-flying harpy, the powers are welcome and interesting to use... although some are situational. You can also purchase magic spells for more offensive/defensive capability, and these are helpful items to grab as well. The game looks and sounds amazing, with HD art assets for all the characters and 3D rendered platforms to jump and climb over. Its soundtrack by Jake Kaufman is especially catchy, and you'll have the hooks of more than a few stage tracks in your head. Helpful, since you'll be revisiting them a lot.\n\nThere are only one or two flaws with the game, and one is far less a transgression than the other. Some of the upgrades hardly change anything, and feel like filler. Attacks for forms you'll hardly use unless you're messing around, or powers used exactly once in a single area to gain another hidden item. In addition, things peak before the climax; the final two stages offer almost no hidden treasures to be found whatsoever. It's as if the game runs out of momentum before the end, and speaking of that we must discuss the penultimate boss. The fights before and after it are relatively engaging and straightforward, but in this middle fight you can only deal damage when the boss uses one of three attacks. The problem is that it spams the other two over and over again, turning what should be a three-minute fight into an agonizingly slow-paced slog where you're just waiting around, dodging the same two easily-dodged attacks over and over again and waiting for the game to decide to give you a chance to deal damage. It's unfortunate and really deflates the climax of an otherwise great game.\n\nAt $16 USD you're looking at a five to six-hour experience, if you go for 100% item completion. That would be a bit short for the price, but there's an unlocked \"Hero Mode\" that lets you play the game over with most of your endgame transformations, and fly through it for kicks in half the time. Other playable modes are forthcoming, so I feel confident in saying the asking price is a worthy investment and giving this the thumbs-up. If you're a fan of the \"retro\" style of platformers, or love exploratory games like Demon's Crest or Odallus The Dark Call, this will absolutely be your jam.", "timestamp_created": 1482257852,

Every level feels fresh and unique, and the game very heavily (almost to a fault) promotes revisiting old areas with new abilities to discover secrets and items.  There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing that harmed the experience.  My only gripes with the game is that there aren't enough areas to explore (5 in total), and the lack of overall challenge in the game.  I said that the areas are fun to explore, but they are considerably less fun the umpteenth time an npc sends you out looking for an item.  Many items can be achieved prior to an npc asking for them however, and those looking for the shortest completion time will be challenged to find the quickest way to collect everything.  Enemies do very little damage and falling down pits does even less.  Additionally, the game hands you upgrades in the form of \"Relics\", which grant secondary abilities to your transformations, magic attacks that draw power from a mana bar, or passive abilities.  One such relic, obtained by gathering 10 keys hidden throughout the game that unlock concept art in the town hall, gives you an endless mana pool to draw on.  This is very easily abusable with the magic powers you acquire over the course of the game, including a shield that makes you invisible.  By collecting this one relic, you essentially activate god mode and can't be damaged at all.  You are able to turn the upgrades on and off at any time, which I found very welcome trying to give myself a bit more of a challenge, but even without them you'll very rarely see the game over screen.  The game also relies on manual saves where an autosave system would serve so much better.  For instance, going to the map screen mid-level calls a save screen, and upon selecting any other area on the map calls ANOTHER save screen.  The game is also rather short (I achieved 100% completion in about 7 hours according to the in-game timer), so I would mostly recommend this game to completionists or those looking to speed run.  Overall, this is a fantastic game marred by just a few disappointments.  As of the writing of this review, I have only finished the standard game mode with 100% completion with an early copy provided by backing the kickstarter campaign, so the bugs I mentioned earlier will probably be ironed out by the time the game fully launches.\n\nPROS:\n-Great sound design/OST\n-Fun and diverse levels\n-Incredibly tight controls\n-Great for speedrunning\n\nCONS:\n-A little too much backtracking\n-Lacking in overall number of areas\n-Some minor oversights (such as the save system)\n\nI give Shantae: Half Genie Hero a 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1482257319, "timestamp_updated": 1482257319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28490484": {"recommendationid": "28490484", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960485250", "num_games_owned": 1052, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482690463}, "language": "english", "review": "So far it's the platformer game i have had the most fun in!", "timestamp_created": 1482257311, "timestamp_updated": 1482257311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28490454": {"recommendationid": "28490454", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994372073", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 337, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503621594}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A worthy successor to the Shantae franchise[/h1]\n \nOnce again imbued with her magic powers, Shantae has access to a record-breaking twelve transformations. Each form bears a unique function that allows you to further unravel a level on subsequent playthroughs.\n \nThere's plenty of fresh, risque content to pique your interest. Several new, cute enemies are bound to catch your eye. It's refreshing to see fantasy mainstays like ghosts and slimes portrayed as cute, sultry ladies. Newcomers and familiar faces both are given a fresh look as the entire game is now beautifully rendered and animated in cel-shaded art, an upgrade from those classic pixels.\n \nThe storyline remains as lighthearted and humorous as ever. Progressing the story once again hinges upon catering to fetch quests and revisiting old levels with new powers. Levels are now incredibly linear, complete with a level select screen ala Megaman.  A tremendous amount of effort has been put into developing the bosses, these are by far the most developed in the series.\n \nUnfortunately I must temper my praise for this game by pointing out a few fundamental, glaring flaws.\n \nSeveral transformations and their upgrades go nearly or entirely unused. Most forms can't attack by default, and those that can be upgraded to strike are not viable compared to Shantae's regular form. This game should have focused on four main transformations, consolidating their abilities (Mermaid and crab have too much overlap) and giving them decent attacks. Majora's Mask did it better. In Pirate's Curse you had access to every upgrade at the press of a single button. The final gauntlet was complex, requiring all of your abilities in conjunction with one another. In here you have sections of gameplay sharply divided between each transformation with no interplay.\n \nI love going back to a level with new powers to find new items. Here I ended up repeating the same levels four or more times, well beyond being able to enjoy my revisits. You can 100% the game in under 3 hours, but your first time without a guide may take you up to six. Since the levels are entirely linear, the game world feels less interconnected and more sterile. Unlocking new transformations no longer fills me with any sense of wonder partially since there are so many and also since they're not punctuated by deeply buried, ancient shrines. There are no dungeons, and the penultimate level is painfully brief.\n \nAmazing art direction coupled with Jake Kaufman's musical prowess make for a winning combination. Half Genie Hero is another wonderful installment, but doesn't hit the same high notes as Pirate's Curse.", "timestamp_created": 1482257181, "timestamp_updated": 1482257181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28490409": {"recommendationid": "28490409", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999003804", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512922681}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclosure:\nI backed this game during it's crowdfunding campaign. Upon launching the game offers a 64bit DX11 version, this is the one I played.\n\n\nShantae returns to once again do battle with her arch nemisis Risky boots and save Scuttle Town from certain doom. \n\nGraphics:\nThis time out the pixel styled graphics from the previous games make way for new hand drawn sprites and 3D rendered environments (think Duck Takes Remastered). The game looks beautiful with high quality assests used throughout also teamed with the high quality animations the series has had in the past. The game also runs at a locked 60fps. However the graphics options are lacking, offering only resolution changes and AA options of off, on or dynamic.\n\nControls:\nControls are nice and responsive, press a button and the action is immidiate I was unable to detect any input lag or delay during my playthrough. The game supports both keyboard and mouse and controller configurations. However the game is best played on a controller and also gives out Xbox One button prompts. The default keyboard controls are a little odd with movement on the arrow keys, but are fully rebindable in the optins menu. The options menu is fully mouse driver as is the inventory screen, but the level select and save promps are not which is a little odd.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game plays out in the same way as the other Shantae games. Scuttle Town acts as the main hub world for the game offering a shop, access to the games art gallery (with unlockable concept and fan art), a save point and a selection of npc's to talk to who offer game hints or side quests to undertake. Heading into Sky's Hatchery allows Shantae to access the world map where the games levels are represented as desitnations that are unlocked using maps Shantae uncovers along her journey.\n\nThe levels themselves consist of two platforming areas followed by a boss battle, however subsiquent visits to a level once completed does not have the boss battle and there is no way I have found yet to replaying bosses without starting a new game. The game does offer three save slots so new games can be played without fear of data loss.\n\nAs with previous games in the series, Shantae unlocks transformations and abilities which allow her to further explore each of the levels and uncover more secrets each time through. It is the upgrades that are bring up the first negative of the game which is difficulty. The game is more on the easier side than previous installments if you go for all of the upgrades, especially health. Max health gives Shantae 14 hits before she is defeated and the game is quite generous regarding healing items as well. But these health items are optional and the game can be played through to the end with the starting 2 hit points if desired.\n\nSound/Music:\nThe sound in this game is great. Nice high quality sound effects are used throughout and some dialogue is even voice acted at times, although this is limited to Shantae and Risky Boots. Shantae even has voice lines for her magic spells.\nThe music is also fantastic in this game, with personal notable tracks for me being the music for Mermaid Falls, the boss theme and of course the rocking main theme of the game Dance Through the Danger.\n\nOverall:\nI would thoroughly recommend this game as a purchase for those who are into platforming games or those who want a fun (all be it quite short, but replayable) experience. My first playthrough took me 7 1/2 hours to complete, with a 98% completion rating. There are unlockables such as gallery art and a Hero mode which opens up after completing the story once.

Animation, Music, and Writing.\n\n\n\n[b]Animation:[/b] It's literally the best i've seen throughout the games yet, i'm not only gushing over the transition into 2.5D but am also liking the cartoonish character portraits.  The small image bobs gives a sense of liveliness and brings across the way each character is feeling quite adequately.  It's her first HD adventure and and HGH (Half-Genie Hero) fully captures the visual look of a Shantae game.\n\n\n\n[b]Music:[/b] Jake Kaufman (who has composed each Shantae soundtrack) is the \"Audio guy\" yet again and has done yet another great job.  You can listen to remixes of older Shantae music and fully original tracks as well, my favorites being the title screen music and Neo Burning Town.\n\n\n\n[b]Writing:[/b] Wayforward yet again gives you their classic tongue-and-cheek style of writing so you can enjoy both the plot and all of the silly jokes that go along with it with one of my favorite quotes being: \"Blast it All. That airship cost billions of crowd-funded dollars!\"\n\n\n\n[b]Gripes[/b]The major gripe I have with the game currently is the content, it's somewhat of a short game and you'll find yourself finishing it with 100% in about 6-9 hours, Risky's Revenge is a shorter game but the story for HGH leaves more to be desired with the only other option available being the speedrun achievements).  Also two of the transformations only really have one-time uses and are under-powered in comparison to the others.  Granted the other transformations are very useful and gives shantae both tools for tackling a stage and a different means of attacking various enemies.\n\n\n\nHowever, they plan on adding THREE seperate playable costumes for Shantae (similar to the Dancer costume in Risky's Revenge) and plan on adding FOUR additional campaigns for Risky Boots, Rottytops, Bolo, and Sky which should solve the game's launch-date content issue.\n\n\n\nIf you want to get a full-enjoyment out of HGH, I recommend you play through Risky's Revenge and Pirates Curse beforehand since it'll increase your enjoyment for HGH.  Regardless, this is a good starting point if you're thinking about getting into the series since it does a good job capturing the feel and gameplay of a Shantae game.\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoy!

Sure it took 3 years for this kickstarter game to come out, but I can say I got my money's worth for backing this game...and the game only just has the FIRST of FIVE playable characters so far with the rest coming up soon!\n\nWayforward's best traits are simple yet enteraining gameplay & amazing animation, and both are on full display in Shantae: Half-Genie Hero. They really took what they learned from Ducktales Remastered and refined it into some of the best use of 2D Sprite and Vector animation in a videogame to date. All the characters are drawn by hand this way, no cop-out use 3D-Model characters like in Rayman Legends and many other similar 2.5D games. 3D is only used for the colorful levels and backgrounds, but even you can hardly tell half the time by how well painted and textured they are that the characters feel right at home in the game.\n\nThe game itself is probably the easiest to get into of the Shantae series; keeping the mainstay of the series' gameplay, but reducing the amount of backtracking of its metroidvania roots for a wider audience, though a little bit does remain, especially  when trying to get the optional upgrades and 100% completion. I would say that Pirate's Curse is a bigger and more epic adventure entry in the series then this game. However throughout the development of this game I felt like Wayforward were trying to make a more accessable game for the Shantae series, as the first three games are all tied together in their overarching story, making playing only one of the games a bit confusing if you didn't know the plot of the previous ones. Half Genie Hero is its own self contained story so there is no need to play the other games, which can be troublesome for many people as the first game for the Gameboy Advance is a bit arcadic; Risky's Revenge though still enjoyable is a tad flawed with bits of its gameplay, and Pirate's Curse relies on the player knowing the story up until that point in the series.\n\nCurrently as of the day before release, none of the DLC has been implemented yet, but once everything is set in it should be avaliable. The only DLC that may take a while is the other playable characters as Wayforward plans to release them one at a time as the three stretchgoal characters Bolo, Sky, and Rottytops aren't quite ready if I remember one of their previous development logs. But the backer level DLC and Risky Boots character story should be coming in soon hopefully.\n\nThat said, there are a couple minor shortcomings I am a bit disappointed about. Nothing that impacts my enjoyment of the game, but just a couple nitpicks I have:\n\n1) Once you beat the boss of some levels, if you return to a place you have beaten before, the background is fill with a glooming fog, obscuring the wonderful and charming backgrounds of the levels. It's a shame that such nice looking levels become muddied up by the choice to put up a fog in some of these levels once they are beaten.\n\n2) This one bugs be more then the other: Shantae only has one dancing animation for all her transformations and magic dances. Reguardless of which transformation you choose, she currently only has the hip-shaking dance and the finishing pose for all 14 of her dances. In previous games she had various dancing moves for each one; most notable was the first game where each dance was unique to the transformation or magic; then in Risky's Revenge she only had three dances, but each one was different for the animal she transformed into though the final pose was the same one for all three. FInally is Pirate's Curse, which granted do to plot didn't have transformation dances, but using the lamp item did give two different animations, one of which was a all new belly dancing animation. It wasn't necessary for the gameplay or plot, but it was a nice little touch to her character. However here in this game there are 14 dances, but they all use the same one.\n\nIt could easily be fixed by tweaking the animations a bit. Here's how the dancing works to get an idea. You press the \"Dance\" button to bring up the dancing menu. Soft music and a steady beat starts playing and Shantae dances to it in rhythm. The menu shows the first 4 dance slots for 2 beats then for the next 2 beats it switches to the second set of 4 dances, then 2 beats for the third set, then it cycles back to the first four, making 12 slots for dances total. Risky's Revenge had a similar concept with the dances where holding down the dance button would cycle through the three dances in that game and releasing it activated the transformation she was performing. \n\nThe issue of Shantae having only one dance and one finishing pose could be fixed of each of the 2 beats she did a different dance move for each set of dances, then finally once the dance is selected she does a finishing pose that represents the transformation she turns into.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, regardless of the minor shortcomings that may get fixed, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a success in my book. Sure this kickstarter isn't the groundbreaker or epic adventure Shovel Knight is; but it is FAR from the disaster Mighty No. 9 was. This game isn't meant to be grand, but rather a fun, charming adventure with likeable and often funnily-bizzard characters you know from Wayforward. So if you enjoyed Wayforward's previous games or want to start getting into their games; Half-Genie Hero is a full time winner, and will get even better as the stretchgoal content is released.", "timestamp_created": 1482256975, "timestamp_updated": 1482257034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560810", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28490383": {"recommendationid": "28490383", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969385493", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500001887}, "language": "english", "review": "As a Kickstarter I got the game 2 weeks early for being a Backer.\n\nI personally enjoy this game, so much that I'm going to also be speedrunning it quite often.\nBut this is a review so I'll give my review.\n\nPros:\nBeauitfully done animation\nJake Kauffman comes through again with one of his best soundtracks yet\nFan Service, Fan Service, Fan Service!\nEnjoyable Story\nAll the enjoyable Shantae gameplay is still there\nDLC will have Risky Mode, more costumes and hero modes when released.\nAs a Kickstarter, the DLC will be free for me\n\nCons:\nShort, first time playthrough averages 5-6 hours\nUntil DLC comes out, not much replayability aside from Speedrunning/Hero mode\nHaving compeated with Mighty No. 9 during the kickstarter - It didn't get as much backing, so content is considerably lacking due to it even with the upcoming DLC.\nMore linear, lost quite a bit of the Metroidvania feel and less exploration.\nNon Kickstarters have to pay for DLC\n\nNeutrals:\nIt's easier, which can be a con to some.

The story is very basic but it is very charming, it gives the game a fun and light feel. The hub world can get annoying because it isn't always clear what you have to do, to move on to the next level, and you have to return to the same levels allot and search for that one thing you need to move on to the next level. It sometimes felt like I played the same level 10 times. I feel like they didn't put in everything they wanted to in the game, either because they didn't have time or some other reason.

This latest release continues the trend with updated abilities and a combination of hand-drawn and 3D graphics.\n\nAs mentioned, this game doesn't deviate much from previous Shantae games - though this isn't a bad thing. Bad guys are up to bad things in Sequin Land, and it's Shantae's job to collect what she needs to stop them. Fans of the series will be on familiar territory, and metroidvania fans will find a lot to like. The characters are endearing and memorable, and the plot would fit nicely in a well-written Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nOf course, an important element in any game of this type is the quality of the puzzles and secrets. This game has well-crafted ones just difficult enough to make you want to finish them, without being overly frustrating. I was able to clear 96% of the game without a guide, and the items I had to really work for can be passed over if you just want to play through without finding every little secret. The boss fights are mostly of the \"action puzzle\" variety as well. At times, the method for beating them wasn't immediately clear, but it didn't require much work to figure it out, and the fights themselves were still challenging.\n\nAs for the shift in art style, I am in favor of it. As much as I appreciate well-done sprite graphics (and I do), the hand-drawn characters really suit this series, and it goes well with the cartoony atmosphere. Speaking of, I enjoyed the dialogue as well, with well-written humor that managed to be sharp without resorting to being too crude.\n\nAll in all, I think adventure fans will enjoy this game if they've never tried the series before, and returning Shantae fans will be well satisfied. Shantae is securing her position among gaming greats.", "timestamp_created": 1482256870, "timestamp_updated": 1482258333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1518, "total_negative": 85, "total_reviews": 1603}}

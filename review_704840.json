The Short Beta Key from Bundlestars (as of Nov.1 named Fanatical) I enjoyed very much. \n\nI didnt beat the game despite wielding the Giant almost every playtrough and blasting everything with one shot weapons... but I see its potential. Of all the twin stick coop shooters I played this has one of the best gameplay feelings to it. Repetitiveness is also not a big deal since you yourself can chose how fast you go from chapter to chapter. \n\nThere are lots of weapons which you can all collect and select on a weapon wheel while the time slows down around you THere is also a melee component which is a must to get rid of incoming enemies and some projectiles. Furthermore you got your trusty randomization, respawning enemy waves, shops and crate drops after clearing out houses. It is also kid friendly since most of the time you will be slaughtering bizarre looking vegetables - which you can still hit with you melee weapon for a short time after you already killed them. So satisfying!\n\nThe music is just great. Depending on how much action is going on there are heavy metal tunes kicking in and fading out after the onslaught. Like bread and butter coming together for an epic breakfast meal.\n\nThere is an exploding Angel or Ghost... (he prefers the name Bob) who gives you the chance to get one of your items from a previous run. Its a roulette wheel that you can stop yourself so it does not give a feeling of complete random ripoff, but I only saw him once. \n\nEither way.

You are about to join Department Radical, the grooviest police force on Earth to clean all this mess and return the peace to the streets. \n\nYou have to play several chapters divided in areas where an army of vegetables (carrots, potatoes, onions an so on...) are going to try to kill you. There are multiple buildings filled with enemies too, where you can fought through for a loot or for a some keys to unlock chests and some other buildings. There are a shop too to improve you weapons or buy medical kits and at the end of each area you are going to beat a boss.\n\nThe guy is easy to control using four arrows to move and mouse to aim and shoot. You can use several weapons (two of which are active and the rest selectable via a mouse wheel), a melee weapon and a a rechargable item that you can unlock. There are awide range of weapons and it's a good point that you can press the mouse button to shoot continuosly instead of destroying it, clicking thousands of times on it.\n\nTha main character and all the vegetables are well defined but, in general, graphics are very pixelized trying to emulate the games of 80's \n\nMusic sounds well at the first ten minutes but then it turns a little bit annoying. Sounds are quite good too and the sound of weapons are nice.\n\nThe game is not very difficult but scenarios are wide and there is not checkpoints so, five bars of life sometimes are very few to complete the chapter.\n\nThe game has achievements but it has not trading cards. I encourage to developers to add them in next releases. \n\nSometimes when you  play a game, you find something different, sometimes, you find a gem and sometimes you find a game you had played before. This game is in this last group of games, so if you like the games like  The The Binding of Isaacc, play it. In other case eat some carrots.

I honestly nearly wrote it off when I first checked it out, but I'm really glad I gave it a shot; it's a fast paced and fun rogue-lite shooter with a rather unique theme.\n\nSomething I really loved about the game is how the theme is used to create some very visually distinct enemies. Every enemy type is a different vegetable which allows, at a glance, to know not only what I'm facing but allows me to figure out what to expect. Lemons? They will leave pools of harmful lemon juice. Broccoli, on the other hand, will charge at me; while leeks will try to ambush and so on. With the game's more fast paced combat, having that instant recognition of the different enemy types is a definite plus.\n\nAnother thing about the combat I really liked is that it didn't feel as reliant on the rolls of the dice as other games in the genre. When I lost it always felt like it was due to a lack of skill on my part and not having enough power though my guns and pick ups. I always had options to overcome bad luck by simply killing more of the horde for money or hitting optional buildings for more rolls of the loot dice and objects to destroy for chances of drops. I never felt like I was out of options and I was under-powered, just lacking in the skill to make it further.\n\nThat's not to say there's aren't things I dislike about the game. One thing I didn't care for was sheer lack of info the game provides. Now, I realize that figuring things out on your own is, for the most part, a staple of the genre. However, hiding gameplay mechanics seems a bit much to me and a lack of tutorial does just this. Perhaps the greatest example of this is in melee and that melee weapons can be used to knock back bullets to kill enemies. The only place the game made mention of this, when I spent time in the game, is in the tool tip of an unlockable skill as its requirement. This seems like a pretty key game play element that is hidden and does make wonder if I am missing other important things. \n\nSpeaking of skills. The other thing I didn't like is how slow it is to unlock things in the game. While I don't want all the skills handed to me, but some of them are a rather long grind to unlock, even ones that you would naturally unlock by playing the game. Destroying 3,000 objects, for example, to unlock a single skill. Weapons also seem to unlock rather slowly, requiring a currency, called rad rocks, to unlock new drops via the in game store. While the dev did drop by my video to say that there's ways to get them that I didn't find yet, at least at the start of the game, until you find what the dev was hinting that, it's a bit of a slog to get new guns in the drop pool.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my time with The Walking Vegetables. It's a silly concept that has been developed well into a fast paced, unique rogue-lite. To top it all off, the game is getting a lot of post-launch support with new enemies, modes, and of course bug fixes. While the game may not be as deep as others in the genre, it has a lot of style and fun that makes it well worth a look. \n\nVersion Played: Post-Launch Patch 1, 10/02/17\n [url=https://youtu.be/ziTKDSLbhRk] My full first impressions video [/url] \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1508475421, "timestamp_updated": 1508475421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35778024": {"recommendationid": "35778024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299718188", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508004917}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything right about indiegame dev. \n\nThe Walking Vegetables is made by the insanely talented dev behind Zombie Kill of the Week.

I was treated to a really interesting and hard rogue-lite game that infuriated me but for some reason kept bringing me back. I didn't love it, but I couldn't stop playing it. \n\nIn the short time, the game has been released the developer has been reacting to player feedback with bug fixes, tweaks, and updates. This sort of responsive understanding and talented game dev is doing everything right. I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It was worth the asking price at launch and it's an even better game now. \n\nIt's not perfect, it can be frustrating and a bit cheap at times. But it's fun. Damn fun. It's fun to play alone.

I found that Part 2 of the first campaign had too many \"solid\" and repetetive colors, that the first part didn't. But, in general, the game's graphics are put together well. Playing this game on a laptop with a rather bad display was not as enjoyable as playing on a better quality screen with more vibrant colors. \n\nThe game relies heavily on randomness, much like The Binding of Isaac, but in The Walking Vegetables, almost everything feels random, which adds a lot of replayablity, but I dislike the fact that it relies on randomness so much. Some playthroughs can be easier, or harder, just based on what enemies spawn on which playthrough. Health can only be replenished with a health crate, or a health drop from an enemy. But these drops are always random, 1 heart, 2 heart, etc. The game's difficulty is rather well balanced though, despite the randomness.  \n\nThe music for The Walking Vegetables is good, and I really liked how depending on how low your health is, the faster the music plays, which add's a feel of adrenaline.\n\nSince the game came out, the developer has pushed out multiple content updates, and by the looks of how often his previous game got updated after its Steam release, this game is going to keep on receiving content updates for a while.\n\nIf you're a fan of previously mentioned games, I would recommend this game to you.", "timestamp_created": 1508174334, "timestamp_updated": 1511380095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35522994": {"recommendationid": "35522994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027327956", "num_games_owned": 964, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507276864}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun Indie style top down shooter!

Maybe not GOTY, but most things work well enough.\n\nThe structure is simple enough - to beat the campaign (which is something you'll do multiple times), you have to get past several \"chapters\", each concluding with a boss fight. Areas consists of a large \"hub\" (which has paths to other areas and constantly spawning enemies), multiple \"objective areas\" (where you fight a number of enemies to unlock the path to the boss), multiple buildings (which are also filled with enemies and can be fought through for loot) and a shop.\nThe player can carry multiple ranged weapons (two of which are active and the rest selectable via a wheel-menu), a melee weapon, and a rechargable item (effects from use vary).\nChoices of enemies/bosses per area, building layouts, item drops, etc. are randomized, which has it that you encounter familiar hand-crafted elements but in different pattern on each session.\nA single session can take between 20 to 60 minutes depending on how many optional paths you decide to take - sticking with a few weapons and taking only required paths generally has you looking to finish one session in 30 minutes or less. Par for \"speedrun\" unlock is 15 minutes (which I was able to beat with 12m after several attempts).\nPerforming specific objectives unlocks \"skills\", which stick between sessions and influence one or other aspect of the game (e.g. increasing health, making some attacks more powerful, or changing equipment the player starts with). You can pick several of these to be used for a session (eventually up to 4 at once). Other things that persists between sessions is \"meta-currency\" awarded for beating bosses (which is used to unlock new weapons/items).\n\nI'd say that the game is well-rounded in terms of difficulty - enemies come in multiple shapes and forms, but so do weapons, and the fact that you can find and carry multiple of them at once allows to prepare for most situations. Bosses are manageable, switching between several patterns. Achievements mimic in-game skill unlocks and should be managable enough with some practice and strategy (many unlock conditions are much easier met with specific equipment/skill combinations).\n\nArtwork is distinguishable enough and generally stylish. The game makes use of several visual effects by default, which can be disabled in settings menu.\n\nAudio is fine. Using some of the melee weapons (such as \"shivs\" and throwing stars) too quickly allows to reach the point where sounds of preceding attacks start to cut out before finishing.\n\nMusic is remarkably catchy and fitting.\n\nI was able to unlock all skills/achievements in ~12 hours (counting a few offline), though I'm yet to unlock a number of weapons.\n\nSubjects of consideration:\n- \"tongue of steel\" skill (which prevents player from taking damage when walking over pools of fire/acid) is more or less a requirement with a number of bosses, as arenas can be small and dancing between boss, enemies, and hazards can be a trouble.\n- Either by design or not, but the fact that melee weapons deflect all projectiles in front of the player and have generally high attack rate has it that you may very well just swing them constantly. Multiple other games in the genre share this mechanic and it is only a little unfortunate when the game's balance is built around this. Too late to change anyway.\n- With keyboard controls, when moving straight into an obstacle, the character seems to simply pick clockwise direction. This makes for a bit of inconvenience in first few hours of play, as the usual behaviour in such cases is to have the character move towards the nearest corner (i.e. pick direction that has a shorter walk distance until movement in original direction can be resumed) if at all in such situation.\n\nOverall, it's worthwhile.", "timestamp_created": 1507249327, "timestamp_updated": 1507249327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648567", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35457607": {"recommendationid": "35457607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008768479", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 179, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506803891}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Um jogo muito divertido no seu estilo rogue-lite que ensina a ter cuidado com os vegetais...\nAgora a s\u00e9rio, jogo bem trabalho, gr\u00e1ficos muito loucos em retro, sem d\u00favida um \u00f3ptimo rogue-lite.\n\nFica aqui o meu gameplay, junta-te ao meu Ex\u00e9rcito Indie, subscreve no canal! :)\nhttps://youtu.be/RmoewNIBl60", "timestamp_created": 1507068294, "timestamp_updated": 1507068294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455397", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35440461": {"recommendationid": "35440461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185960974", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508163543}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is freekin' awesome!

didn't think it would work, but in the end, it was very appealing to look at, and the mechanics of the game were somewhat similar to Hotline Miami & The Binding of Isaac. \n\nFrom playing the game I really enjoyed it and found it visually pleasing and the gameplay was seamless and I will be continuing to play this for some time. \n\nOverall I would say this game is a great pass time with some awesome elements and gameplay and I would recommend it to a friend in the future, then again I would need a friend... oh well back to playing. \n\nIf you would like to see some gameplay here is the

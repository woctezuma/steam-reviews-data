On one hand, you have the Time Rifts, which most of them could be nearly indistinguishable from retextured Super Mario Sunshine secret levels, (but this time they don't make me insanely frustrated) and you have the actual levels. There are 4 levels with multiple parts, and they're all pretty fun and unique. Mafia Town is the first area, and progression is structured like Mario 64 / Sunshine. You get one time piece, the next one opens up. Battle of The Birds is similar to the previous, but instead, it has a forking path, and it's apparently a competition. You do the first level, then two more show up, and for completing them, you get points toward whoever's side the level is on based on performance in the levels. The other levels have unique elements as well. (Subcon Forest's thing being that you sign contracts to unlock each level, and Alpine Skyline's thing being that it is a freeroaming level.) The character is fun and easy to control, the art style is reasonably good except for the unmodeled 2D texture faces that don't move along with the voice lines, the level design is pretty good. There's even modding support, so if you know / learn how to use Unreal Engine 3, you can make your own levels, or you can just play with other people's mods. All really cool stuff.

There are tons of mod that add a new map.\n\nConclusion, this game worth every penny. I don't regret buying this game at almost full price.

Whether you're hunting for vault codes to open a safe, sneaking around to find evidence of a murder, using a scooter to deliver mail to underlings or using various tools at your disposal to ascend to the top of a giant windmill. Each challenge in the core worlds is a joy to tackle and the variety ensures things never get old. For the platforming challenges naturally many of these stages will test your leaping skills, but special note to the time rift stages - bonus levels akin to the ones in Super Mario Sunshine where the focus is entirely on platforming your way from A to B.\n\nHats and badges form the core of your powers to assist you. Hats grant powers like sprinting, throwing explosive potions or using dimensional powers to alter certain platform's solidity. These hat powers really help to shape the adventure by requiring players to switch around as necessary. As new hats are obtained new areas in old locations open up. Badges are more optional (with the exception of the grappling hook, which is needed to access many areas) and offer perks like preventing fall damage or letting you charge up a beam attack.\n\nAside from the 40 time pieces in the core game you have many other collectables to acquire. Yarn balls are needed to craft the hats to progress, although there are more of them than needed to craft all hats, leaving the rest just for fun. Artefacts open up new time rifts for some of the time pieces, while rift tokens can be exchanged to play a slot machine which rewards cosmetic items like clothing dye, music remixes and hat styles. Even if this sounds a bit short to you then fear not, because this game also has Steam Workshop support. Currently the feature is in beta so requires players to actively sign up via the game's properties to the beta, but once done you have a wide variety of additional content. Some of this is even more cosmetics, yet you can also find entire new levels within the workshop.\n\nDid I mention the charm this game has? Hat Girl, for being a mostly silent protagonist (outside of a few general shouts) exudes personality. Even just leaving her idle shows her dancing on the spot or playing with dolls. During play you can play patty-cake with certain mafia goons, see her hiding scared from a monster that puts even the resident demon to shame or play the lead of a marching band. Other characters don't slack here either. The mafia goons are hilarious with their dialogue, the contract demon of the third world is a riot from start to finish and we certainly can't forget Moustache Girl's rebel antics.\n\nAdmittedly, like with any 3D platformer, the camera can get a bit wonky in places (most notably if it has to go up against level geometry). However, this has been a magical adventure, and with Workshop support there's plenty more to do even after finishing all the official content. This is definitely standing out as one of my most memorable experiences of 2017.", "timestamp_created": 1514630187, "timestamp_updated": 1514630532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38854553": {"recommendationid": "38854553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004711710", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 867, "last_played": 1514630166}, "language": "english", "review": "A Hat in Time is [i]fun[/i].\n\nLet's start with options. I always say that the quality of the main menu and available options speaks volumes about the quality of the game itself. There is a surprisingly detailed assortment of options available here. Hell, motion blur is even separated into per-object motion blur and screen blur (because who likes screen blur?). Every option is accompanied with a description of what it does. In terms of essential options, you have all the ones you'd expect from a decent PC game: FoV sliders, individual audio sliders, wide array of FPS locks, and plenty of graphical options.\n\nPerformance wise, I get a consistent 120 FPS on a i5-6600K and GTX 1070 with every option maxed (except screen blur, of course). Seems fairly optimized for my particular build, but your mileage may vary.\n\nControls are tight. You never feel like you're fighting against the game.\n\nLevel design is, well, good. Not great, but good enough that you certainly don't notice its shortcomings while playing. When you step back and think about it though, the level design really isn't anything to write home about. In general I found the levels to be too busy and lacking cohesion. They're not very memorable in the sense that if you were to drop me in a random part of a level, I'd have difficulty identifying exactly where I was.\n\nThere's a ton of little details in the world that are just delightful. There's an adorable little roomba that roams your spaceship! But the one thing that really stood out to me is the 4-piece band you have in your spaceship. You can tell this band to play you some tunes, and get this: the members of the band only start playing at their corresponding parts of the song! If there aren't any drumbeats, the drummer doesn't drum. The trumpet player doesn't start playing until the song has trumpets. That's an incredible attention to detail.\n\nWhich I guess brings me to the soundtrack. It's phenomenal. At the time of writing (with a -20% discount), the deluxe edition is only $4 extra, and is well worth the cost. Gear with Breakfast has also put up the full soundtrack on YouTube, so go check it out!\n\nThe platforming is solid. It's not hard as nails; there's some measure of difficulty but not frustratingly so.\n\nThere's a lot of collectibles. Typically you get cosmetic rewards for your efforts. The platforming is satisfying enough that I had no qualms in going out of my way to collect 'em all.\n\nOverall A Hat in Time is an exceedingly good game. I think it's one of those games that are greater than the sum of its parts.

From its title screen to the first cutscene, the game feels\u2026 alive.\n\nI like-a-me some 3D platformers. [i.e. Uber biased] Several games that A Hat in Time\u2019s are some of my all-time favorite and it\u2019s great to see that legacy continued. 3D Platformers (especially, triple A ones) are becoming less and less predominate with only a few significant releases for the genre in 2017. It\u2019s heartwarming to see people vote with their wallets to fund passion projects and to then see those games become successful.\n\nEnough rambling. Hat Kid controls smoothly. Most jumps are composed of combination of a single jump, double jump and dash [with a small cancel]. There\u2019s also one long jump that the sprint hat uses (same distance, not as much height), wall momentum (double jump gets you way higher) and wall jumps. There\u2019s not much complexity [that I know of] here for, say, the wizards of Mario 64 speedrunning to utilize, but for us mortals, it\u2019s plenty. The double jump is forgiving and you can easily recover from most slightly over/underestimated jumps. You\u2019re not allowed to switch directions with the dash, but that\u2019s pretty fair considering how that might be abusable. Wall jumps felt a little off a times, despite their rarity. There\u2019s no way to cancel sliding down a wall into a straight fall so I found myself instinctually pressing A out of impatient to get off a wall resulting in a tumble into the abyss. More than anything, the fact that I felt obligated to mention these moveset hiccups both displays my involvement in Hat Kid\u2019s movement and the potential for even more subtle mechanics that might allow for a higher skill cap.\n\nA Hat in Time orchestrates a beautiful aleatoric soundtrack where leitmotifs and unique instruments breathe life into and give a signature feel to both characters and chapters.. Tunes, like the Main Theme, appear in numerous situations, branding the aspects of the game as connected adding to their memorability. There are plenty of great examples of this. The way the music in purple time rifts fades between instruments or how an overworld melody changes between biomes or how boss themes ramp up during battles, to name a few. It\u2019s something you were and think, \"Once I'm done with this game [avoid spoiler tracks] I'm going to listen to this stuff over and over\". [Although it should be noted that the music always sounds better when you\u2019re enjoying it as a part of the game]. Parts of the OST also fulfilled my chiptune element quota :3 [i]Serious[/i] props to Pascal Michael Stiefel for capturing a brilliant sense of adventure.\n\nA few technical problems did show up here and there but it wasn\u2019t anything unforgivable. Sometimes collision errors appeared when the game had tricky geometry or struggled with apply wall jumps. One instance forced me to return to hub after getting caught falling above ground endlessly. The way this game handles circular objects can be a bit off sometimes as well. Grabbing nonexistent ledges and generally being afraid to hop onto round surfaces also hurts the game\u2019s otherwise polished surroundings.\n\nChapters feel like toy boxes and have a good density of little secrets/intractables. Chapters not only change up visually but have an assortment of unexpected variety (hallway sprints, races, stealth segments, parades etc.) that have you wondering what they\u2019ll come up with next. Nothing ever feels like that game has failed at trying to contain too many types of gameplay, a common trap for other platformers. Outside of Chapter 2, areas have a central act that let you explore and choose what objectives you want to complete first. Personal choices like where to explore, what Acts/Chapters to do and even what Hats/colors you wear make for an adventure of your very own.\nSecrets, in the form of token/relics [for time rifts]/yarn, foster spatial awareness that turn landscapes into memorable play-places. Finding and playing the bonus time rifts, with their somber music, were some of my favorite moments.\n\nA Hat in Time is filled with frienemies who, plot-wise, are on your side but seem to be okay with a few murders here and there (perhaps in acknowledgement of Hat Kid\u2019s god-like superiority). The personalities of NPCs are across the board silly and enduring. For example, Mafia Town hosts some Mafioso that are both aggressive and a few that just want to chit-chat or play patty-cake. I also love Hat Kid\u2019s lovable and confident nature. Detail in the animations for walking have her stomp around like a superhero and extras like that are topnotch. Collectively, A Hat in Time has too many little moments to count. It feels like love and care went into bringing these areas to life.\n\nThankfully, completion is forgiving, there no achievements about getting every token/yarn. 100% means you\u2019ve seen every mission and done a few goofy extras. Going all out and getting all the yarn or tokens to grab hats/colors is your choice. Some of the harder achievements, the four I don\u2019t have, are all something I spent a decent amount of time on before becoming too frustrated to continue. I\u2019m a little disappointed in myself for diving into them knowing my typical response to \u2018beat with one health\u2019 challenges. Through my drive to pointlessly acquire achievements, I ended up hurting my last few experiences in a game I enjoyed. For Steam\u2019s in-game overlay, this has been its final nail in the coffin and I\u2019ve chosen to disable it from now on and learn to savor games in the moment more.\n\nA Hat in Time has been, and will continue to be, a fantastic escapade. It\u2019s a great reminder of why I love video games and there\u2019s plenty more I could discuss. There\u2019s always an element caution when shouting praises at a game in this manor so it\u2019s good to try to stay real. After all, the worst way to recommend something to someone is to completely overhype it. In the end, A Hat in Time blew me out of the water and it\u2019s something that I hope others can enjoy as much as I did <3\nI can\u2019t wait to see that crazy stunt Gears For Breakfast tries to pull off in the future. In the meanwhile, I\u2019ll be anxiously waiting to play custom levels and watch the community flourish with the inclusion of modding.\n\n[Note to Self: First shot at trying to give games I enjoyed as many words in a review as the games I\u2019ve disliked. Structure and content wise, it\u2019s way easier to write with a critic stance but it\u2019s still important to talk about what worked and why. If this assortment of scratches did make any sense, oops.

Though not without its faults, A Hat in Time is an exciting 3D-platformer romp with quite a bit of love and charm backing it all up. \nMarooned in space on the way home from.... Something, the protagonist Hat Kid must retrieve the Magical Hourglasses used to power her ship. The stakes are high--however, as once people find out these trinkets have the power to reverse time, all bets are off. In typical 3D-platformer fashion, Hat Kid has a wide range of moves, powers, and gadgets to maneuver the jump-heavy worlds and plenty of goals to achieve. Missions range from challenge stages to races, and while many of said challenges aren't particularly challenging, they still offer an enjoyable time. The levels are backed up by a distinct artistic vision reminiscent of Wind Waker and Paper Mario--a cutesy, almost storybook world with goofy characters. The soundtrack evokes the orchestral pieces from Super Mario Galaxy along with newer, groovier tunes, and the voice acting ranges from excellent to somewhat annoying. Thankfully the developers included a special item to turn most dialogue into the jibber-jabber made popular by Banjo-Kazooie, so nothing grates too much. As for the script itself, it's simplistic, but fun. You won't find yourself laughing at every joke, but there are definitely ones you will laugh at. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, nor does the plot. In conclusion, if you find yourself weighed down by a few extra dollars and you catch this on sale, give it a shot.

Think along the lines of Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, and Donkey Kong 64.  Thoroughly enjoyed my playthrough of this little gem; A Hat in Time is a fine example of what someone can make utilizing Unreal engine.  You collect yarn to unlock a variety of hats which contain special powers.  Each power allows you to reach new areas or unlock new stages.  You also collect gems as currency to purchase ability badges that either upgrade your hat powers or give you some abilities.  3 badges and one hat may be worn at a time, so learning to switch when needed is essential (but not that difficult).  A few takeaways:\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[b]+  Art Style:[/b] Well-funded.  Wonderfully textured environments that fit the cartoony feel.  Whoever the main artist is, there are tons of in-game \"artwork\" and illustrations to be found.  Kudos to whoever the artist(s) was/were, as well as the director for investing to have so many illustrations done.\n\n[b]+  Platforming:[/b]  This is the main difficulty and focus of the game.  While not impossible or requiring mastery levels of practice, there are some solid challenges to overcome.  Hopefully you, the reader, understand when I describe a \"pooper retracting up your spine\" feeling, yes?  \n\n[b]+  Level Design:[/b]  Like the Art Style, the various worlds shine brightly.  Each are beautiful in their own way and are full of life.  Besides your main spaceship (think Peach's Castle), you have 4 themed worlds to visit.  Each world has distinct zones to visit that differ, but fit in with the theme of the world.  Most are open worlds while one is instanced.  Puzzles mix between fighting bosses, scavenger hunts, difficult platforming, and even stealth!\n\n[b]+  Voice Acting:[/b]  Suitable, non-cringy dialog.  A few adult-nudges for any parents that are playing with kids.  No obnoxious, Eddie Murphy sidekick.  \n\n[b]+  Controls:[/b]  Surprisingly smooth.  \n\n[b]+  Original Soundtrack:[/b]  Subjective, but very well done.  Original songs that fit the game, with the exception of two.  One is a mixture of two Zelda OoT songs and the other... I swear it is a remake of Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence.  Not complaining though, MCML is one of my favorite songs.\n\n[b]+  Steam Workshop:[/b]  Custom fun!  Players are creating their own levels and designing their own hat skins.  \n\n[b]+  Ends:[/b]  The game ends.  You don't have to grind, buy loot boxes, or whatever online nonsense.  Strange to think one would get excited about something ending, but its >current year+1.\n\n[b]+ (Almost) No Political/Social Agenda:[/b]  Story is free of any of that nonsense.  There is onneeee small political joke against capitalism tucked away in a level.  I'm guessing whoever owns Gears for Breakfast likely believes differently now that this game is a hit.  Funny how that works, huh!\n\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[b]-  Length:[/b]  You will likely not reach the [$1 / 1 hour] quota on you first playthrough.  Mario 64 had 120 stars and cost $70 at launch in 1998.  This game has 40 \"time pieces\" (same as stars) and costs around $30.  I managed to collect them all in the course of 18hours while not exactly speeding through levels (taking screenshots, eating meals, looking around the levels for fun).  In addition, did not use any guides.  More time will be invested to collect the achievements.  the Achievements call for beating a certain number of stages without losing a life or beating a boss without taking damage.  If you dabble in user-created levels through Steam Workshop, you will likely cross the $1/1hr threshold.\n\n[b]- Collecting / Power Ups:[/b]  Once you know the main use of each ability, there's very little \"creative applications\" for them.  The game is very straight forward.  When originally starting the game, I was speculating if one could further upgrade their hat powers with extra yarn (items needed to unlock the ability hats).  Turns out they don't.  There's a badge that powers up one hat, and another that reduces cooldown for two others.  That's it.  Additionally:\n[list]\n    [*] No investing currency/yarn to power or level up items.\n    [*] Very small amount of \"relics\" to collect.  I think 14 or so?\n    [*] No side-quests or trading items to NPCs. \n    [*] You cannot obtain every cosmetic unlock. \n    [*] In the Purple Time Rift (World themed stages), collecting all the photographs doesn't seem to do anything.  No achievement or in-game scrapbook to review them.  They don't appear to count towards save-file completion %.\n    [*] No final, ultimate, power hat for 100%'ing.\n[/list]\n\n[i]Note:[/i]  Don't sweat like a thick, elephant cup, elf milf in a sinkhole when you suddenly realize you have no more coins to use the cosmetic-item-giving slot machine.  Also, don't scratch your head when you end the game with 100% and still have hat-creating yarn leftover.  This is working as intended.  You can obtain additional slot machine coins by playing user-created levels.  As for the leftover yarn, no idea what (if anything) is planned for them.  \n\n[b]- Enemies / Challenges:[/b]  Boss fights are challenging and very entertaining.  However, the normal rank and file enemies are extremely limited.  Once you observe the one way they attack and the easiest counter, that's all you need to know.  The challenging aspect of this game is platforming, not fighting.   Puzzles do repeat, however.  None are overwhelming difficult or elaborate.  No Zelda 64 Water Temple, but also no Skyrim spinning totems.  While more focus is placed on platforming, doing the \"throw the bomb\" puzzles became dull after the 10th time.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nYou will know from the art style and hearing \"N64 platforming\" whether or not you will want this game.  I found it to be an extremely enjoyable, light game and enjoyed every minute of running around.  Wondering now if there will be any updates / DLC that add anything.  Its a bit interesting that the game ends with excess yarn in your inventory.  I certainly do recommend A Hat in Time to friends.  If by some remote chance a member of the development team is reading this, please consider these for the next DLC or game in the series:\n\n~ Ability to power up hats with a currency/yarn.\n~ More relics to hunt.\n~ Sidequests with NPCs.\n~ Some sort of a final hat to spend excess yarn with.\n~ Collection notebook/menu that shows progress of everything collected and numbers that are missing.

it's cute, humorous, challenging, and a lot of fun, while also meeting modern standards with high-quality graphics and fluid, precise controls. There's also modding support with a bunch of well-made mods already available on the Workshop (currently in an opt-in beta).\n\nAlso, you can ride a Roomba.\n\n(Note for OSX users: Modding support beta is currently only available on Windows.

I finally got to give it a chance, and after I started I couldn\u2019t stop, the whole time with a smile on my face. The devs know exactly what their game is in terms of game design and it shows, in other games I would consider it too ambitious to switch up level design so much but A Hat in Time does it with a lot of tact, and I actually welcomed it. Whether it was the short vignettes of the movie studio or the vast, beautiful expanse of the mountains, this game made me smile at every turn, it was infectious, and I couldn\u2019t help but see the love and care put in by people who actually care about video games.\n\n\nPros\n------\n-Change in level design from act to act was done well and was actually welcomed\n\n-Adorable story and characters\n\n-The controls felt great, and the tutorialization was fun\n\n-Kept gameplay fresh with badges and other missions\n\n-Some of the visuals are absolutely amazing in this game, and some of the visual experiences left me audibly saying \u201cWOW!\u201d\n\n-Exploration was fun\n\n-Surprisingly deep amount of customization for the main character\n\n-Great music!\n\n-Made me laugh constantly\n \n\n\nCons (minor complaints, just little things I think the game could have to make it better)\n------\n-Lack of free roam after completion of worlds/ levels (you can practically free roam in most \tlevels, but it would be nice to have a dedicated feature for free roam on all levels that \t\thave collectibles.)\n\n-Sometimes it felt like a map was needed to navigate, and I think would be useful to younger and/or more inexperienced players who have a trouble with landmarking in games (I\u2019m thinking mainly in the forest level)\n\n-Graphically there was a lack of polish, but no game breaking bugs, and totally understandable for an indie dev for a game of this scale (this seems contradictory to my pros statement, but this game was on a spectrum graphics-wise).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOverall this was one of the most pleasant experiences with a game I\u2019ve had in a long time, and it was good from top to bottom.

The humor's fantasic and the platforming is fun. It controls well and has a good sense of difficulty.\n\nPros:\n+Awesome soundtrack\n+Colorful atmosphere\n+Cute artstyle\n+Great level design\n+Memorable characters\n\nCons: (Mostly Personal Nitpicks)\n-The Camera can be annoying to work with in tight spaces\n-Feels a little short but its great to replay the levels\n-I've had some collision issues when Dashing into certain things but that's the only giltch I ran into\n\nA hat in Time feels like a throwback to old school golden age of platformers. It takes insperation from the collectables from Banjo Kazooie without making collecting everything feel like an outright requirement. Super Mario Sunshine with the various amounts of ways you can travel, jump, run and pounce your way through the game along with some level ideas. And even physchonauts of all things from its original and very funny humor. To memorable characters you meet while progressing through the game.\n\nThe Story of the game is pretty simple, there isn't much that happens spoiler wise. The main character Hat Kid is trying to get home but while doing so she lost all of her Time Pieces which is fuel for her ship. If she wants to return home she needs to collect them. You don't need all of them to beat the game but its nice to play extra levels and it feels great when you complete and gather everything. The controls for the game are great! you can use a keyboard or controller to play the game. You can unlock different abilites by collecting yarn and turning that yarn into hats. Each hat acts differently and can bring something new to the table in regards of movment, combat, or ultility.\n\nMy few complaints about the game is the camera doesn't feel like it likes to cooperate in tight spaces, which can make certain jumps pretty tricky or annoying to deal with. Another complaint I have is that I've had Hat Girl's collision when dashing into certain objects getting her stuck in certain objects or places and having me to restart the level. Its nothing game breaking and its mostly nit picks, But for a game that was on Kickstarter its a great game to play. It can feel a little short towards the end of the game but all the levels were memorable and there wasn't one that I hated.\n\nAll in all its a solid kickstarter game that made me enjoy playing and collecting everything I could.

But all things goes so wrong when she passes through Mafia Town. Now, in order to return home, she must retrieve all the timepieces while meeting all new friends and foes.\n\nThe game features multiple levels, called \"Chapters\". For each chapter there would be multiple \"Acts\" for specific scenarios and activities. So level diversity is something that's definitely not lacking. Activities can be racing, fetch quest or going into special levels called timerifts. Players are dropped into a Chapters and they can either follow that scenario or just go around and explore freely without time limits.\n\nAs Hat Kid, you are aided by your trusty umbrella as a weapon and a collection of Hats with special abilities to overcome obstacles. This can be a simple default Hat that locates the main object of interest, or a time-stop Hat, or even a Hat to see the alternative world. Keep in mind that a Chapter may feature obstacles that is impossible to do until you get the right upgrades in later Chapters, but these are usually not game-stopping, so no worries. You can still progress through the stories normally from collecting enough timepieces.\n\nThe overall tone of the game is amazingly diversed. It's upbeat, funny, a little bit spooky and maybe sad. But there's no noteworthy cringe moments so people can watch you play without feeling awkward.\n\nIt's no suprise that the game is inspired by other 3D platformers such as Super Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie, and for these games, music has always been a great part of them and it's no exception for A Hat in Time. The music definitely gives me a lasting and positive impression.\n\nThe game is my personal GOTY for 2017.

The influence of Banjo-Kazooie, the Super Mario series, a bit of Conker's Bad Fur Day, and a healthy dose of Psychonauts to name a few is sincerely noticeable. Also noticeable is a soundtrack that soars with the whimsy of Mario Galaxy, the cutsie charm of Banjo, and something entirely own with the likes of several guest musicians including Grant Kirkhope, of Banjo and Conker fame. And what also sticks with you is the constant barrage of clever and adorable details that didn't need to exist to make this game stand on its own, but was lovingly crafted regardless. Though it stumbles once in my opinion, I couldn't recommend this game possibly more. If you're on the fence and reading this for some reason: Buy. This. Game.\nThe cuteness is unlike any other, entirely its own brand of adorable lovability and unending charmfullness. \n\nHowever, there are a few moments that were especially damning for this beloved game, and that is one of its levels: Alpine Skyline. This level is a bit of a callback to Banjo-Kazooie's Click-Clock Woods, a 4-part level with seasons differentiating it. Alpine Skyline by contrast is divided much more subtley by various themes such as visual puns like Lava Cake being a several story tall row of increasingly smaller piles of lava, like a super-heated wedding cake. The level is devoid of linear pathways in a more find-it-yourself fourway. It allows for freedom but is devoid of the game's typical charm and cutesy  style. It's a gorgeous level that feels very empty due to the lack of direction present in all other chapters. No major supporting character was present to offer the level of memorability that Mafia or The Snatcher had. Throw on top of this the gameplay extending Finale that was just a bit absurd in the way that it tests patience more than any other. Frankly, Alpine Skyline was an unnecessary level that could have been replaced by something far more memorable. But with such a shining star of a game, a knick in the paint isn't that bad overall.\n\nDespite that rant, though, A Hat in Time is a modern classic of 3D platforming and a wonderful addition to a childlike longing for the happier times. A world of unending intrigue, love, and charm is something we all need from time to time.

The only thing I knew I'd be getting was a platformer from a kickstarted indie developer.\n\nWith that being said A Hat in Time has surpassed all of my expectations and has been one of the few new games I've not only purchased in recent years, but enjoyed enough to want more, and more.\n\nThis review will discuss aspects of the story, characters, levels, etc. and thus will contain mild spoilers. If you've watched trailers and/or played the Beta none of this should come as a surprise, but nontheless here is your obligatory:\n\n - MILD SPOILER WARNING - \n\nThe Story: (everything discussed is seen in the trailer)\n\nA Hat in Time is about a young girl (Hat Girl) trying to find her way home. Suddenly while in orbit above \"Mafia Town\" a member of the Mafia breaks his way into Hat Girl's starship in an attempt to force her to pay a tax. While rather simplistic and certainly a callback to other popular platformers' style of handling story such as the Super Mario series this direction also feels fresh and charming.\n\nWith such a simple goal as 'get your Time Pieces back so you can go home' A Hat in Time really frees the player to have as open-ended of an adventure on the planet as they want in the meantime.\n\nAs is customary with games in this genre though, there isn't much to talk about here. Story is never the selling point of games in this genre and A Hat in Time focusing on letting you make your own story out of what they've provided should only encourage gamers to pick it up.\n\nCharacters:\n\nIt's no surprise to anyone that's watched the trailers or played the Beta that Gears for Breakfast has gone out of their way to make likeable, and very memorable characters for their game.\n\n - If you're one of the people that hasn't watched trailers or seen anything, let me assure you, they're fantastic -\n\nThe protagonist, Hat Girl, is \"heckin'-cute\", or adorable as I'd simply put it and helps give the game a very unique charm. Other minor characters such as the Mafia are given just as much attention and they really help make the areas you explore feel alive. This is a great improvement off of other titles in the genre which just feel like you're jumping across random platforms suspended in space (like many newer Mario titles would have you do).\n\nI won't give a breakdown of each character, as I'd like to keep spoilers to a minimum, but I can assure you there is plenty of charm hidden in this gem of a game.\n\nLevels:\n\nHere I'll mostly discuss what the levels bring to the table as I'm not quite qualified to speak on behalf of level design (although I did enjoy how they were all layed out). So here goes:\n\nA Hat in Time is broken up into five 'Chapters', each Chapter being a different portion of the planet your starship is in orbit above. Chapter 1, Mafia Town is a large town built on a tropical island paradise.  Chapter 2, Battle of the Birds takes place within a film studio (and movie sets). Chapter 3, The Subcon Forest is (as you'd guess) set within a forest. Chapter 4, Alpine Skyline is a very beautiful level set atop lofty mountain peaks (and totally open to free roaming might I add). Chapter 5 I will leave as a surprise, mostly because I didn't expect it to be anything like it was and I'd like to allow you a similar opportunity to be surprised.\n\n\nOverall, I have no idea if any of this would help someone to pick up the game, but these are my thoughts on these three aspects of the game after beating it. I haven't 100%'d the game as of yet, at the time of writing I've beaten the game with the minimum of 26 time pieces (with 40 total to collect in the game - although I hear there's also rumors of free DLC going around, I'll have to look into that), so I may come back to edit this if my opinion on anything changes between now and when I 100% finish. Throughout my playthrough I was graced with wonderful platforming that was not too challenging (even with a keyboard and mouse - no controller needed here folks!), a good difficulty that straddled the line between easy and hard, never too easy but challenging at times, and a wonderful overall experience. A Hat in Time is the kind of game I used to expect from 'AAA' companies before they became consumed by greed and I wish the best to Gears for Breakfast. I genuinely enjoyed A Hat in Time and I will more than likely continue to for a long time. From what I've heard the game is also open to modders so I likely won't get bored of this title for quite a long time.\n\nAfter all is said and done my final rating is:\n\n(Minimum % rating): 10/10\n\nNow that I have finished I can say that I stand behind my initial rating: 10/10.\nI hope this review helped you!", "timestamp_created": 1514422942, "timestamp_updated": 1514579325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38760450": {"recommendationid": "38760450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099378170", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 889, "last_played": 1514422717}, "language": "english", "review": "By far the best game of 2017.

I expected the comedy aspects of the game to be cringe due to the cutesy nature of the game, it was hilarious. if you havent played corgi quest yet please do, you wont regret it. I expected the story to be bland and for the wonder of the well designed maps to wear off before late game, but each new area was more spectacular than the other and each time piece i aquired gave me a snowball feeling of wanting more. The difficulty was easy enough for me to feel unencumbered as i explored the maps, but challenged enough for it to keep me engaged with the levels mentally, the boss fights are hard enough that you may spend a few lives learning the attack patterns but not enough to frustrate you in any way, it amazes me how devs balance difficulty so well and its always something i look for in a single player game.\n\nNow for the negatives, please be aware that i was intentionally looking for negatives and all of these are very much nitpicking, some you may not even notice. For one i noticed that i began finding some minor glitches in the later stages of the game specifically in the time rift levels. Secondly and personally my biggest downfall is the price to time played ratio, i have a rule i like to follow which is that i need to get 1hr of gameplay per 50c spent on the game, at full price that would mean 60hrs which is simply unreachable without replaying a considerable amount of missions, i took my time playing through, checking for secrets and only reached 19 hours. i will likely continue playinf for the last few time rifts and yarn that i missed, but i doubt i will get above 30hrs. lastly i would simply like more acheivment to go for, just some goofy ones that i can do to get more playtime down.\n\nsuggestions:\nthere is basically nothing i can suggest to \"fix\" the game as it is not in any way broken. The dev team is FAR above my level of knowlage on what makes a game great. One probably stupid question if the devs would like to continue working on the game would be to add a multiplayer race mode with simple linear maps the test who is the best platformer player of you and your mates. But honestly i see no need on adding multiplayer to this game when it is already such an excellent  single player experiance.\n\nRating: 9.8/10\nNever thought id give such a high rating", "timestamp_created": 1514378031, "timestamp_updated": 1514378031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38735408": {"recommendationid": "38735408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136985451", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 543, "last_played": 1514369703}, "language": "english", "review": "I got an achievement for searching bird porn on the internet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a pretty good game.", "timestamp_created": 1514376800, "timestamp_updated": 1514377177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38734616": {"recommendationid": "38734616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155277414", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 272, "last_played": 1514508221}, "language": "english", "review": "SMASHING!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1514375168, "timestamp_updated": 1514375168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38734067": {"recommendationid": "38734067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179192994", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1247, "last_played": 1514667395}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is everything you'd want in a platformer.

There's a freeroam section, and it's rewarding and varied. There's a survival horror segment, and it's creepy as hell. I had a boss fight with a haunted outhouse and it was bloody awesome. I led a marching band across rooftops in a marching band equivalent of Snake, and instead of being frustrating it was the cutest thing I've seen all year. The marching band music was better than actual marching bands. I got an umbrealla that shot laser beams, fell in a mud puddle and pretended to be an alien monster, and rode a scooter through an exploding train, and it was all masterfully executed. This game just cannot fail. [i]It. Cannot. Fail.[/i]\n\nIf someone asked my why sequels exist, I'd show them this game. Because sometimes it isn't a matter of fixing things - sometimes it's just making more of utter gaming perfection. Buy this game.

A Hat in Time hat mich von der ersten Minute an \u00fcberrascht. Das Spiel verspr\u00fcht sofort einen gro\u00dfartigen Charme, der mich als alten Nintendo-Hasen voll abholt. Dabei bedient es sich derart schonungslos bei Genre-Gr\u00f6\u00dfen, dass ich beim Spielen mehrere \"Flashbacks\" hatte. Das gro\u00dfe Vorbild ist definitiv und un\u00fcbersehbar Super Mario Sunshine vom Gamecube \u2013 ohne die Wasserschleuder. Die erste Spielwelt riecht in jeder Ecke nach Piazza Delfino & Co. \u2013 was gut ist. Auch der Grafikstil, das Gl\u00fchen der einzusammelnden Ster... \u00e4h, Sanduhren und nicht zuletzt die Special Stages sind sehr stark inspiriert. Ich musste eine Weile \u00fcberlegen, wo ich das alles schon mal gesehen habe. ;-) Hinzu kommen nat\u00fcrlich eigene Ideen sowie ein klasse Humor. Dazu meine ich starke Einfl\u00fcsse aus Super Mario Galaxy, Banjo-Kazooie und eine Prise Zelda: The Wind Waker zu sehen, was nat\u00fcrlich ebenfalls rockt.\n\nWas bei mir immer ganz wichtig ist: die Musik. Und hier streichelt das Spiel direkt so die Ohren, dass ich einfach feiern muss. Melodische Ohrw\u00fcrmer noch und n\u00f6cher, stets mit passender Tonlage und Dramatik - top! Das verleiht A Hat in Time meiner Meinung nach das gewisse Etwas, welches bei mir den Unterschied zwischen \"gutes Spiel\" und \"Perle\" ausmacht.\n\nNat\u00fcrlich stimmt auch das Gameplay. Ich hab's direkt mit einem Xbox-360-Pad gestartet und war entz\u00fcckt \u00fcber die direkte, stets pr\u00e4zise Steuerung. H\u00fcpfen, Gleiten, Pr\u00fcgeln, alles ist so, wie man sich das w\u00fcnscht. Sogar die Kamera ist gelungen! Mit Maus und Tastatur w\u00fcrde ich aber nicht anr\u00fccken. Grafisch rei\u00dft das Spiel trotz Unreal Engine 4 keine B\u00e4ume aus, aber der Comicstil ist nett und weitgehend sauber, wenn man vom (kurioserweise) fehlenden Temporal-AA und kleineren Schatten-Artefakten absieht.\n\nA Hat in Time hat mich noch st\u00e4rker in seinen Bann gezogen als Yooka-Laylee und daher bin ich sehr froh dar\u00fcber, das Spiel so spontan und unvoreingenommen eingesackt zu haben.

Refunded when I got to the movie set part of the game(second level). After beating the chef I didn't want to play anymore.

With the right work, however, it has the makings of a GOAT in this category.\n\nGood things: Quirky main character. Cool ideas with different hats.There is a strong resemblance to the old collectathons like SM64. Gimmicky boss battles. The first boss had small \"hiccups\" of action where you could hit the boss, but you were SUPPOSED to wait about a few seconds.\n\nBad things:\nThe level felt cluttered and the yarn felt useless. I had gathered 8 yarn before the first time you catch the moustached girl. Parts of the level reminded me of super Mario 64 where you could go into  one level and see different \nstars to collect, but you couldn't interact with the collectables.The characters faces textures look stuck on like a robot chicken episode, but when the game is in 3d. It just looked shitty when I realized this and it doesn't seem to match the rest of the game. Going through the game and all of a sudden there is a character from deep space I GUESS that sells you upgrades.\nWhy is the dash the only thing to hurt enemies when they get red? There are lots of parts in this game that just happen without explanation, like the game is unfinished. \n\nI feel like the game is not worth it in current state at 30 dollars. 15 would be better with updates, but you won't find me with this game in my library again.", "timestamp_created": 1514241553, "timestamp_updated": 1514241553, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.375778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38675022": {"recommendationid": "38675022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044735044", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 952, "last_played": 1514616450}, "language": "english", "review": "Once you get a handle for the double jumping, belly-diving, and wall climbing movement mechanics, this game gets really fun, really fast.

Even on lowest settings, this game could barely handle 20fps.  Basically, this game is not optimised for mac at all!

good pc specs to run properly, which is weird for a cartoony game, but the areas are so big that rendering everything on the highest quality requires a really good pc\nKeeping it on performance mode

Each level is beautifully detailed in a style that reminds people of Elf in Tights 2: Sea Shanty of the Red Boat and they pull it off swimingly. There's a good amount of collectibles strewn about each level map, including balls of yarn to make new hats with different powers, special coins that your space child can gamble with to get new aesthetic changes and the usual platformer currency barfed all over the place for people to collect called pons. Pons can also be used for upgrades, particularly for pins, which you wear on your hat to gain extra effects.\n\nEach world has chapters, which has a different objective based on the same map. After enough chapters are completed, there's a finale, which involves beating the snot out of people with protective raingear like an umbrella. There are also things called Time-Rifts, which are basically obstacle courses that you have to go through in a similar manner to Italian Tropical Janitor 3: Maximum Hydration on the gamecube.  Simple enough concept, sure, but this games music score, tight controls and whimsical feel are extremely happy, anti-depressive and really wrap up an extremely solid package of a game.\n\nIt is a short-ish game though, even if you want the 100%.

While I've only played Mario 64 and Galaxy, I'd still easily say I enjoy this game far more than them;  The hat system is great, and I love using each individual power, as well as using them one after another on certain occasions.  All the chapters have a unique theme: [SPOILERS START HERE] Mafia Town is an island with enemies that you can choose to fight, and a flying sub-island which contains the boss.  Battle of the Birds has the crowd-pleasing acts of DJ Grooves, and the wild west train acts of the Conductor.  Subcon Forest has the overall spooky atmosphere, the eerie (Not really eerie, more like run like hell or get frozen by a shadow of a person) mansion of Queen Vanessa, and the Snatcher's contracts.  Alpine Skylines has the four portions which are made up of platforming, be it over lava, over death pits, the inside of a windmill, or trying to not get slapped into hell by the pompadour birds.  [SPOILERS END HERE] While there are only a few main characters (Around 2 or 3), the plot is good, the player character is extremely loveable, and I found myself enjoying a large amount of the other characters, whether they're main characters or side characters.  (My personal favorite is Snatcher.)  The bugs are extremely hard to notice and rather insignifcant when they are found.  \nThe boss fights are difficult, but not too hard;  They're going to pummel you sometimes, but that's until you figure out how to dodge the attacks, and a lot of the time it's a simple matter of leaping or diving at the right time.  Some of the bosses can be wacked all the time, but that's incredibly rare, or it's going to get you killed if you do try to.\nThe collectibles are fun to get and rewarding when you do get them, but besides the yarn, it's not going to give you anything more than cosmetics, so it's not too bad if you don't get them;  It's nice to get a lot of the cosmetics so you can give Hat Kid a look you're happy with. (My current favorite is lady bug hat flair for Sprint hat with the Blood Moon color scheme.)  The soundtrack is nice in the way that it sounds good and varies;  They're not going to give you a bloody orchestra for a train ride in the wild west, they're going to give you something fitting.  \n\nTL;DR This game is great in many ways and has very little flaws, so buy it if you like quality platformers with good soundtracks.", "timestamp_created": 1514098290, "timestamp_updated": 1514098290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38609527": {"recommendationid": "38609527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299843669", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 721, "last_played": 1514719052}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud0a4\ubcf4\ub4dc\ub85c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc810\ud504 \ud6c4 \ub2e4\uc774\ube0c\uac00 \uc880 \ud798\ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc544\uc27d\uae34 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8\uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc678\ud558\uba74 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\nIt' really fun.

While it is an achievement by the development team and it is not a bad game by any definition, there are those who would say this game is on par with Mario.  They would be crazy.  \n\nThe game lacks A LOT of polish.  \n\nThe platforming is pretty medicore and quite often more annoying than rewarding. There is a lot of tight rope platforming where you cannot gauge where your character is in relation to the rope itself.  A lot of the level design is confusing and does not offer much in the way of visual cues to naturally guide you.  Instead you need to rely on a hat power up to point you in the right direction. \n\nBoss fights carry on FAR to long, and while they are not terrible exactly, a lot of bosses rely on TONS of visual clutter to provide an artifical challenge rather than a tightly crafted one. In fact, looking back the most difficult stages were ones with tons of visual clutter (Penguine Parade, Owl boss fight.) The most challenging boss however is the camera, good luck beating him. \n\nThe controls feel way to loose. you will often find yourself running up a wall only to pull yourself up and over the platform and then falling to your death shortly after. Careful not to push that analog a bit to hard, hat girl will launch herself in that direction at tims and often to your death.  Something feels very off with your homing attack as well (Think sonics homing dash only slow and clumsy) then again the combat in general is pretty unfullfilling. \n\nThere are quite a lot of bugs as well. Power ups that don't work at times (umbrella safe fall), clipping issues in some instances and a few other minor issues as well.  While not game breaking, after a while it starts to get harder to ignore.\n\nIt may be unfair to be so harsh on a small development team and kick starter game.  Anyone who can put out a game of this calibur through kickstarter should be proud of their achievement.  However, I personally did not enjoy this game at all.  After 10 hours I put it down and uninstalled because I found myself more furstrated fighting with the controls and camera (and I've been platform gaming since the 80s) on top of zoning out mentallly while just aimlessly running around some of the levels. \n\nI write this negative review because I bought it on the fact that everyone was overhyping this game and some even made the bold statement to say they enjoyed it more than Mario Odyessy.  Obviously that is their opinion and they are 100% entitled to feel that way but let me just say I almost completed 100% of Mario Odyessy but could not make it past 10 hours of this game.  I would strongly recommend you try this game before buying it as I feel this game comes no where close to Mario (which I would have never assumed it could if it wasn't for other reviewers).\n\nNegative rant aside, I am positive Gears for Breakfast will only improve on this game and should contiue making games they love.", "timestamp_created": 1514083278, "timestamp_updated": 1514083278, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.390939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38603696": {"recommendationid": "38603696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072998688", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 184, "last_played": 1514082299}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly better than Super Mario Oddysey.", "timestamp_created": 1514082338, "timestamp_updated": 1514082338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499255", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38602602": {"recommendationid": "38602602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090382657", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 983, "last_played": 1514406068}, "language": "english", "review": "If you peruse the review section before buying a game like I do, (and if you're reading this, you are definately considered a knowledgable consumer, this is a good thing) you will see a few reviews calling this game a throwback to the days of games like Super Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, and Spyro the Dragon.

A amazing throw back to collectathon game play like Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario 64. The game play is flawless and smooth, albeit a tad frustrating at times. Some levels are harder then others, especially late game. This game also has amazing potential for speedrunners.\n\n[h1]Long Review, describing each rating form the current above catagories.[/h1]\n\n[b]Soundtrack, 9/10;[/b]\n\nThe soundtrack for this game is just amazingly perfect. Each song is fitting for each level and location in the game, and sets the atmospheres of the levels well. There are even a bunch of remixes for said levels that you can unlock via slot machine rolls you can get from completing the \"Time rifts\" (AKA, challenge levels). All the remixes are very well made as well. From the hard rock guitar rifts, to the western themed songs, to the spooky tunes, everything sounds great.\n\n[b]Gameplay, 9/10;[/b]\n\nI knew going into this game that it was a collectathon 3d platformer, but the depth of its flow and mechanics for platforming and running are just great! The sprint hat and grappling badge make for some awesome feeling parkour moments, and it all feels so natural. All of the levels accommodate games movement system with everything you can do, with long diving, wall running, etc. The collectibles are fun to grab and are all placed thoughtfully to make a constant run feel rewarding collecting 40+ Pons with one continuous sprint. Finding the Relics and mission objectives is rewarding as well, some of the challenges are pretty satisfying to complete.\n\n[b]Art Direction and Level Design, 8/10;[/b]\n\nThe art direction and Level design is absolutely stunning. The 2d, and 3d art are all very well made. You can tell a lot of time and care went into all the pictures, models, levels, etc. All the main worlds are very pretty to look at, and the challenge levels are well.. a challenge. When you play a main world pink rift, you can collect pictures to look at. Some of them tell a story about something that happened in the world, like chapter 3's rift pictures detail a story about one of the villains you face against.\n\n[b]Story, 6/10;[/b]\n\nThe story in this game is simple... if somewhat non-sensical. [spoiler]You are a small girl who is awoken by her ship, there is a member of a mafia somehow in space to collect a toll from you for passing by. And then there are birds in a movie studio... and then a spooky forest... and then floating islands with goat people and magical artifacts, and a angry austrailian girl who steals all your magic fule for her own selfish desires...[/spoiler] It dosn't make to much sence, but it's quirky and it's entertaining.\n\n[b]Voice Acting, 9/10[/b]\n\nThe voice Acting in this game is sublime, all the voices fit their respective characters and nothing feels out of place. Not much else to say about it really.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n\nThis game is a great game.

What's not to love?\n\nIn all seriousness, this game has rapidly become my favorite platformer of all time. Mouse + keyboard controls are incredibly tight and almost never frustrating. The writing is hilarious, the characters are endearing, the scenarios are incredibly inventive and unlike anything I've ever seen before, and the sheer variety of creativity here is stunning. All of it is good. None of it is dull. I can say, without a word of hyperbole, that I enjoyed this game more than Mario Galaxy. It's that good.\n\nWith that said, there is a bit of controversy still surrounding the game. JonTron is in the game and has not been removed. His role is very small, as an optional NPC, and I understand the developer's trying to not create the massive spectacle that Playtonic Games went through when they removed JonTron, but I still don't see why they couldn't have just silently patched him out. There's plenty of silent, unvoiced NPCs in the game (and occasionally, even voiced characters have unvoiced, text only lines) - what difference would one more make? His inclusion is a blemish on an otherwise spotless game, but, in my opinion, is not enough to invalidate the work done by the rest of the development team. If no one told you about JonTron, you probably would never have known about him being in this game in the first place.\n\nAt the end of the day, A Hat In Time combines fluid, satisfying platforming with an inventive world that you'd want to stay in for hours. Sure, minor nitpicks exist - Mustache Girl should have showed up more, Mafia Town is too Mario Sunshine-y, etc. - but ultimately, all of that melts away as you just enjoy the game itself. This is a platformer that certainly deserves a spot up there with the greats, if it doesn't exceed them altogether. Absolutely worth your time, especially since two additional chapters are coming for free.

And it is the kind of game where, there are no great screenshots you can really choose to represent the game  because every great screenshot you could take is something players should experience themselves.\n\n\nThe game is based heavily off Super Mario 64, but more specifically Super Mario Sunshine. The way the game it presents itself has a lots of roots in the gameplay themes Super Mario 64 started, but it feels significantly more inspired by Super Mario Sunshine in particular. The protagonist has the classic lean-in whenever they turn, along with the same leaping slide and laying sprawled out while sliding; all very reminisicent of the animations Mario had. The game has multiple gameplay and or theme concepts which are quite similar to Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine and other games from the Mushroom Kingdom.\n\nHowever the difficulty is not nearly as mind flaying as it could be in older Mario games, and the platforming is forgiving yet still stimulating to control. The game presenting a variety of different features which while not being overly complex or unique still give the gameplay a satisfying level of diversity. The maps are filled with meaningful collectibles used to either unlock cosmetics or new hats, presenting various platforming or soft puzzles to get to them. It is very satisfying to explore and just wander around in for the sake of it. \n\nThe world itself is the strongest point, a silly cartoon dream of a place which is just dripping with sly humor that players can just stumble into while exploring the world map. It all feels just so simply enjoyable to be a part of. The music is wonderful and builds so much onto the atmosphere, and the boss fights are creative and fun.\n\nThe game goes beyond the open world with multiple objectives and scenarios theme however. There are all kinds of different unique levels and gameplay concepts implemented into them, almost none of the main levels in the game are just platforming; there is almost always a catch to it. The creativity never really goes dry, much like the games humor.\n\n\n\nThe game does show some signs of being a small developer title, some of the animations and such having a very unpolished look to them. Rough edges like this being visible in random places throughout the game but it is never really impairing in any way, it just serves as a reminder that this was not a full production game. Which is better anyways since if it was it would not be remotely as good.\n\nThe default camera can be overly sensitive at times, zooming in when the player gets too close to certain things in the environment which can make looking around for secrets tedious rarely. The presentation of various platforming obstacles players need to unlock the ability to use is also quite odd. Players can find them at the very start of the game and it just feels very crowding to be shown so many things you cannot do, so early in the game and with no explanation. Sometimes when the protagonist climbs up something and reaches the top they will vault up and ontop of it, but if the object is too narrow the protagonist will randomly vault too far and fall off. There is one level where players are expected to platform around for long periods, but at certain points the game freezes the player and shows them something changing in the map. Then it unfreezes the player and changes their camera to face that thing, so if the player is in the middle of something this will potentially screw them over and make them mess up the platforming. Which is extremely frustrating when there is an achievement for never failing the platforming in this level. The game has no autosave or manual save features for when players are just running around the open worlds, so if you spend any amount of time collecting everything in the open world maps; then your power goes out or the game crashes or anything, you lose all your progress. The only way to save to ensure this does not happen is to return to the hub, which makes the game autosave, but also wastes time and takes you away from wherever you were in the map. Certain dialogue in the game is not voice acted, even though almost all of it is. The Snatcher has the same dialogue for two different instances where you trigger his traps. The point based competition in one of the worlds is extremely biased against one of the sides. I put casual effort into one side, and repeated the levels until I got them almost flawlessly on the other side, yet the first side still won by a significant amount. The graphic for the grappling hook is not actually visible, the hook and umbrella do not appear it's just a chain that connects to things, and the trigger for status based hats is really over sensitive with the controller. You have to quickly flick in the trigger button to activate the hat, if you leave the trigger pushed in even for a fraction of a second it will turn off the hat effect when you release it again. Yet if you hold the trigger for an actual duration of time, then release it it will not cancel the hat effect. It exclusively only cancels it for no reason if you release the trigger soon after having pushed it initially; but not if you quickly flicked the trigger. \n\nIt would also be nice if there were more uses for the basic and yarn currencies, as there are way more ways to get them then there are to spend. Which feels very unsatisfying in the late game if you accumulated a lot of them.\n\nThe single significant problem with the game is the Alpine Skyline. It is an open world platforming collectathon. There is no humor, no story, no creative design, no missions, it is just an open map with various platform intensive sections where players acquire the most important items needed from the world. None of the things that make this an amazing game are in the map, it is just padding basically. It is really boring and empty compared to the rest of the game, and only serves to highlight how far beyond other platformers this one is; because Alpine Skylines is basically a regular platformer that somehow snuck into this game.\n\n\n\nA really wonderful platformer, certainly the best one I have played.

It's a game that I can relate to Super Mario Sunshine through experience, but I feels more like this is what playing Banjo and Kazooie back in the day would have felt like from how people talk about it.\n\nPros:\n- The levels are fairly vast and fun to explore! This is where it feels like Sunshine because you have the ability to run and bounce around the levels fluidly, and there are rewards to being adventurous evrywhere you go. Each is also nothing like the last, and brings its own charm to the table every time.\n-  The main character is absolutely adorable. \n- The game never feels tense or stressful. Some may argue this can be a negative/lack of challenge, but I found it allowed me to focus more on the art, jokes, characters, and game itself. It was so casual that I don't remember the last time I had this much fun just wandering around and finding all the little things the designers added in for those who looked to find.\n- I've read some comments about the game being too short, and I think that's a load of crap. This game maintains the right amount of content to be short but sweet, and should give you a sense of your money's worth at the very least. 10 hours game time is more than reasonable for a $30 game if it takes you only 3 hours to make $30. \n- The game has a slot machine element that allows you to earn different looking hats for each power, different colour layouts for your outfit, and music remixes of the game's soundtrack. I thought this was a brilliant way to utilise it because getting a dinosaur hat has never been more rewarding and the customization feels just right. It's not overwhelming but it's incredibly noticable and fulfilling to experiment with.\n\nNegatives:\n- The combat isn't very well designed as in they just didn't focus on it as an integral part of the game, which I can agree it isn't. The boss fights play fine but the rest of the enemies are all the same really. You either do a basic swing attack, or jump and attack which auto glides you to them and that's pretty much it. \n- There's some false sense of rewards in this particularly designed for the completionist, or at least that's how it feels. You can collect yarn in hard to reach places, but it only takes one yarn of a type to create a new hat, and after that it serves no purpose at this point in time. It seems like it would have been used to craft new customizations for the hats or something but that was left out. They just serve as a number, no real point to them. \n", "timestamp_created": 1513920978, "timestamp_updated": 1513920978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38515897": {"recommendationid": "38515897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240685082", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 306, "last_played": 1513921992}, "language": "english", "review": "Recently, I finally got around to finishing a hat in time and...

It also includes a well rounded humor, nothing far outstanding but it made me giggle on certain moments. \n\nI also mentioned level design. \nEvery world feels unique and has its own little touch, I mostly liked world 2, since it had the most brilliant features. \nAlthough every level is well rounded and is always entertaining but some fall flat compared to others. \nYou sometimes feel a bit bored and kinda get a feeling of being uninspired. \nAlso you get confused what you have to do in some situations, since no mechanics get introduced that well. \nI found myself often standing infront of a hurdle I had to get over. Since I had no clue what to do directly I had to take a couple of seconds to understand what I was meant to do, either because I wasnt familiar with a new feature or because my camera wasnt focussing on it, nor was it obvious that I had to interact with the object placed in the room. \nThat might sound not too troubling but in a Jump and Run it is important to keep up your flow all the time. \nThis sort of game is the best if you can blaze through it, even if you dont know what you are doing. \n\n\nAnother important point is polishing. \nThis game defenitetly needs polishing! \nCutscenes look really akward because characters only have one animation (I know this is due to budget, but such a well made game deserves to be beautiful). \nThere is only one type of enemy/npc in each level and they have the same voice... It would be nice to have variety to make the worlds of this game really come to life. \n\nThe story of this game could also have been better.. I really liked the premise going on of Hat Kid adventuring through the world making friends. But if you play the game you notice a certain formula happening. I dont want to spoil it but if you play the game you will notice what I mean. It is also sad that after you complete a world you dont get to interact with the previous characters youve met (not till after), which is sad because it could have been a wonderful story about friendship, but it rather feels like someone forgot about the characters during development after each world was finished. \n\n\nI think I might have said to much, and probably could have shortened it down, also I hope I did not scare you off with my criticism. It is a very special game and I had a blast playing through it and I plan to keep on playing it. \n\n8/10 - not enough hats", "timestamp_created": 1513632505, "timestamp_updated": 1513632505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38406728": {"recommendationid": "38406728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089600392", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511819296}, "language": "english", "review": "I can\u2019t beat the baby game \n\n62/23", "timestamp_created": 1513628254, "timestamp_updated": 1513628254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38403458": {"recommendationid": "38403458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003544761", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1425, "last_played": 1514400042}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game.

It's adorable and easy to pick up while offering something for completionists. It's no Odyssey but I enjoyed it nonetheless.\n\nPros:\n- \"Cute as heck\"\n- Easy enough to get into the controls\n- Lots of optional challenges for people who enjoy platforming\n- Great soundtrack\n- A reason to collect all things. Timepieces get Hat Kid home and powerups make it easier. No macguffins here.\n- Proper controller support. May not be configurable but at least it works out of the box\n\nCons:\n- Cute to a fault. The characters don't have much development but to be fair, neither does Mario\n- Some of the enemy patterns are downright annoying. Visually camoflauged cats that are invincible while hidden but attack you as soon as they become visible are not fun challenges.\n- Midair homing attack is worse than Sonic's. Many times it doesn't even trigger.\n\nOther thoughts:\n- I was spoiled by Super Mario Odyssey. Cappy just makes things too easy and while the Hat Kid's dive technique is helpful, it's not \"stop all momentum and change directions in midair\" like Cappy.

This can be good or bad, depending on how much time you have for games.\n\nAll in all, this game delivers exactly what it sells itself as: A nostalgic platformer.\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1513459985, "timestamp_updated": 1513460051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38357896": {"recommendationid": "38357896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171830001", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1513895231}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a delight!!!!

Voc\u00ea usa um guarda-chuva para bater nos inimigos ou seu pr\u00f3prio mergulho ou um dos chap\u00e9us que possui habilidade de atirar gosmas m\u00e1gicas explosivas.\n\nFalando nos chap\u00e9us, h\u00e1 um n\u00famero pequeno, por\u00e9m rico em mec\u00e2nicas, h\u00e1 um chap\u00e9u que voc\u00ea ganha a habilidade de correr, outro que lhe permite manipular o tempo, outro que permite atacar inimigos e por a\u00ed vai.

Os efeitos sonoros tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o muito bem feitos e bem encaixados, tendo uma \u00f3tima mixagem e edi\u00e7\u00e3o de som.\n\n\n[h1]Conclus\u00e3o e nota:[/h1]\n\nA Hat in Time \u00e9 um dos MELHORES jogos de 2017 e digo mais: Um dos melhores jogos de plataforma j\u00e1 feito em todos os tempos, com seu visual cativante e personagens charmosos, uma trilha sonora digna de aplausos e um majestoso level design.

The game offers a decent challenge in terms of platforming. It welcomes newcomers, while offers an extra layer of challenge for those who want it. Supposedly NewGame+ will be a part of the free DLC coming to this game. There is also Steam-Workshop for community made levels/\n\nThe games story is charming, and the voice-acting is on point.\n\nThe replayability is there, but is up the the player. There is a 100% incentive, but is more a self-accomplishment type of reward.

It feels redundant to have to type out a review when all I'm going to say is a bunch of ways to say \"GET THIS GAME!\", but if you want details... well:\n\nThis is a classic 3D platformer with clear influences from Mario and Banjo Kazooie. You've got bright, colourful worlds with unique and varied designs, even within the same hub; there is an interesting and fun cast of quirky chararacters that all serve well to keep things interesting; and most importantly, Solid gameplay that is fun. That last one is important, at no point did I feel like the game was lazily padding out the runtime for the sake of being called a long game. What's here is focused and beautifully crafted.\n\nThe controls are smooth and tight with the possible exception of the camera. While it is customizable in the options menu(surprizingly more so than most other games), it does have a few hiccups, mostly when trying to figure out what terrain is going to zoom my camera in or take control away from me. \n\nThe way A Hat in Time presents its world is worth mentioning as it really does add to the experience. No area is similar in terms of structure. The level design of the first world is drasically different from any following local and the same goes for the rest.

He was insistent and got me the game for my birthday, and man...am I glad he did. As Super Mario Sunshine is, was, and remains my favorite 3D platformer of all time, this game hearkens back to it, and various other late 90s-mid 2000s 3d platformers, perfectly.\n\nThe game is beautiful, the soundtrack is wonderful and charming, there's lots of cool little rewards to get (as an incentive for careful exploring), the voice acting is enjoyable to listen to (rare in this genre), and the movement (about 95% of the time) feels natural and responsive. There's enough content in here for a super slowpoke completionist like me to get 20 hours out of the game, so if you're not willing to spend $30 for that amount of playtime, steer clear. That's the only reason I'd advise caution in this release; however, the Steam Workshop is in full effect, and allowed me to experience some surprisingly amazing user-created content on top of the \"official\" game.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're into 3D platformers at all, or need a good nostalgia trip from the days of your youth (if you were born in the early-mid 90s at least). With more official content inevitably on the way, even if you're done with the game quickly you probably will still feel like you got your money's worth, due to the amount of heart and character in the game. I can't say for SURE considering I got the game for free, but still, I would have spend the money without a second thought if I knew the game was this enjoyable. And you should too!

This is obviously a project of pure passion by the entire team over at Gears for Breakfast; you couldn't get a game of this calibre otherwise. The internet personality JellyElite said it best when he said 'I've never seen a game with so much life and love tucked into every corner.'\n\nControls like an aboslute dream, couldn't have asked for much more when it comes to the controls and the functions of the character. And the camera was about to be my ONLY complaint about the game, but then I realized that they added an option to change the camera to however you like it!

After some silly shenanagins you are thrusted onto the world to recover your lost Time Pieces that was sucked out ship.  \n\nI won't go too far into the story as it is very simple, but for what story is there it is told very well.  You gain a different hat power up through out each world you visit, changing up the ways you can play the game.  The game also requires you to switch hats during certain situations in order to progress.\n\nHat Power:\nKId's Hat:  Your starting Top Hat.  \nPower of Hat: Points you in the direction of your objective, other than that not much else.\n\nSprint Hat: Increases movement speed and even when combined with the Scooter Badge your movement speed is increased even more.\n\nBrewing Hat: Allows you to throw explosives to blow up crates.\n\nIce Hat: Gives you the ability to ground pound and with certain platforms, be bounced to to new areas or cuts travel time depending on the Ice Platform.\n\nDweller's Mask: Helps you jump on platforms that are intagnible. \n\nTime Stop Hat: While it doesn't necessarily stop time completely, this is probably the most powerful hat in the game as it slows down time so you can catch your breath or catch an enemy off guard easier.  This hat also works on boss fights.\n\nThere are also badges you equip to increase your abilities.  Some are useful, some are not so useful, and one allows you to fire a laser from your umbrella, which is a pretty dang cool thing in my book.\n\nThere are time rifts you have to dive into later on when you find relics hidden throughout the levels.  The style of the time rifts are very reminicent of Super Mario Sunshine, and this is in no way a bad thing since I actually liked the side areas in Mario Sunshine.  There are also one unique time rift connected to each world where you go through a small bit of the past of those areas and collect pictures, which you are then rewarded of why the world you are at is the way it is.\n\nThe only two negative I can say about this game is that the Ice Hat doesn't get much use and other than the ground pound, there is no other practical use for it outside of the ice panels.  It would have been interesting if it wiped away fires nearby but it's not total let down.  The only hat that I think is impractical when you find out how to move fast anyway IS the Sprint Hat.  Even with the badge extension I found myself hardly ever using the Sprint Hat, but it's a good first hat to introduce you to the hat mechanics later on.  \n\nThe only glitch I come acrossed was at the very beginning when you play Patty Cake with one of the Mafia and he hits you after you were done.  I couldn't jump and was hovering in the air for some reason going down a hill.  A restart fixed it and the bug did not happen since the start.\n\nThe pros definitely outweigh any minor con I could give it.  This game was made with so much love and understanding from people who love platformers.  Gears for Breakfast are going places.  A very simple but great story and amazing gameplay with amazing visuals that made me wanting more.  I don't know if there would be A Hat in Time 2 or not, but it's something I would love to see happen.

The answer is: controls. And Hat Kid controls are responsive and allow the player to do a lot of things, while keeping it simple. Casual players won't have any problems with getting used to them, while more advanced players have tools to pull off some insane shortcuts and stunts.\n\nThe sound design is great. Music fits the locations, voices fit the characters and the voice-acting itself is well done.\n\n2D art, special effects and world design is on point, everything is distinct, colorful and pretty. The only thing artstyle-wise I disagree with is how character faces have been implemented (2D texture for eyes and mouth), but eh, I can get used to it.\n\nA Hat in Time is not a very long game, though there's 2 more worlds coming as a free DLC in the future. Also, it supports modding, so the community can provide some new content for the time being.\n\nI absolutely love this game.

I preordered it to play the demo and I thought the game was good then, but this is the best way to play the game. I put in almost a full day of play time over one week because of how well the game held onto my attention. Just as I was starting to get tired with one world I got pulled into a new one. The characters are great and the game is full of personality. The controlls are great and the platforming was never disappointing. There are still some problems with the game. To start it feels short but that is mostly because I binged the game as soon as it came out. FPS was  definetly an issue from time to time. I feel like I have a strong computer but even then in high poly areas slow down was common, but nothing game breaking. The graphics are a two way road. To me, they were charming and they matched the feel of the game, to others, they won't be up to snuff to what they're used to. I understand both sides but its a matter of opinion. The ending feels abrupt and kinda out of place. You can play the final boss before you have even played all of the worlds. On the topic of bosses though, this game has amazing bosses. I won't describe any of them other than that they are a delightful challenge. To anyone that likes platformers, this game is worth it. It is most comparable to Super Mario Sunshine and it is a faithful reimagining of that style.

Every area of the game feels important, and there's very little empty space in each level which helps players not feel overwhelmed by each new level.\nThe story is simple, yet enjoyable. The acting is perfect, and the JonTron cameo brought a huge smile to my face.\nIn fact, this entire game brought a huge smile to my face. The adorable and creative character designs, the fun platforming elements... This is truly a fantastic experience whether you grew up playing classic platforming games or not. \nThe finale of this game is perfect, and combines everything I loved about the game into one level.\n\nThis game is amazing.

So I picked this game up to scratch the itch, and whlie it's not as polished as Odyssey, it's still a heckuva fun game with cute character designs, good level design, and fairly tight control.  I also have to give special props to the voice actors the game company hired for this game   Well done, ladies & gents! The boss fights I'd actually rate above the fights in Odyssey both in presentation and in gameplay.\n\nI have some minor gripes about camera control in certain areas, and certain collectibles that feel like they're in a glitchy area you weren't supposed to be able to get to intstead of something that feels like a secret area more natural to the landscape.  But there's only a handful of such instances.\n\nI have heard some other reviews criticizing the game for its length, but I got about 10-15 hours out of it myself in a single playthrough (and that's with getting the achievements but not exhaustively all the extras).  That seems about right for a game like this to me.  I would love to play more levels, but I think it's generally a plus to leave a game wanting more where it came from.\n\nOn the topic of difficulty, I think I should point out getting some of the achievements are more tedious than difficult.  The majority of the game is pretty easy though, even the bossfights.  It's about on par with a lot of nintendo games aimed at being challenging enough to be fun, but not so difficult as to be aggravating or frustating.  It's usually more about figuring out which abilities to use when and where, rather than pulling off tightly timed jumps in sequence.  Which is all to say I think the game is generally well balanced, but could probably use some more challenging achievements (like a different achievement for each boss beaten while wearing the one-hit death badge, and/or achievements for not using hat powers  on bosses.", "timestamp_created": 1512717589, "timestamp_updated": 1512717589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38144974": {"recommendationid": "38144974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045064545", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510672269}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so good that I was disappointed when I finally played Super Mario Odyssey.

When I finally bought it I kept thinking, \"What if this game is overhyped and is mediocre at best?\" Those doubts were blown away the moment I got to mafia town. This game is a gem amongst so many of the generic/overhyped games out there. I was hooked on the platforming. It was fair, and forgiving even if you messed up a bit. Another thing that made the platforming so satisfying was the amount of control you had over your character. I can't even count how many times I was able to save myself from plummeting off. I loved every stage in the game. Granted I liked some better than others. I feel they all were well designed. My favorites being Subcon Forest, and Battle of the Birds for interesting level design and characters. Mafia town was a starter area done right. It was fun adventuring around and I loved the mafia characters. The fourth/final zone looked great, and I enjoyed the platforming, but it lacked the story and the interesting characters that the other 3 zones had. The story isn't deep or heavy, and you know what? That's what made it stand out to me. I loved the comedy and overall light heartedness of the story. I truly would give this game a 10/10.

A Hat in Time did that for me. I initially thought nothing of this game as nothing more than another \"me too!\" kickstarter game designed to exploit fans of dead genres, in this case the 3D platformer. My cynicism was enhanced by the imminent arrival of Super Mario Odyssey, a game that looked to be shinier, bigger and overall better than this little indie game. However, a friend said the right words and I reluctantly found myself clicking the purchase button, ready to play a few hours and leave it by the wayside.\n\nI got 100% in A Hat in Time long before Odyssey even arrived.\n\nA Hat in Time took my cynicism and replaced it with punching mafia and solving murder mysteries on a western train. It only asks one thing of you: to dive into its world like Hat Girl does into her ballpit, without any reservations And what a world it is. The first world alone involves you fighting cookery themed mafa with hilarious accents on a delfino-styled island town of impressive heights. From there it just gets crazier in the best way possible, as each world offers a unique scenario and overall tone. You'll find yourself leading a marching band on city rooftops in one level while collecting evidence for a thrilling and noir-drenched whodunit murder mystery in the next. Did I mention those two levels are in the same world? \"Mafia doesn't care about consistency, mafia cares about fun!\"- actual quote from the game. All of this is held together by genuinely good writing (unlike my unfortunte example). Every scenario is presented with a wink and smile and even the satire is generally treated with some wit and tact and not just blatant MANDATORY COLLECTIBLES AMIRITE LOL crap. The quirky nature of the game never feels forced, it manages to make all these disparate elements consistent. It even pulls off some genuinely touching moments, including an ending that was both surprising and touching. Think less Yooka Laylee, and more Psychonauts. \n\nOf course, a world can only be as interesting as the people that inhabit it and ohmygod ohmygod you guys I love these people, starting with Hat Girl. Simply put, she's equal parts adorable and badass. She expresses a child-like wonder in her interactions with the world and pluckiness thats also countered by hilarious sarcasm and cynicism (seriously, read her diary entries after completing each level). Yet at the same time she's an intergalactic time traveller who aint afraid to do what should be done to return home. She's the perfect representative of the game: whimsical, quirky and just plain bizarre. The supporting cast equally holds up well and receive the same level of effort and care in how they are characterised, my favorite character being the Devil himself. He steals every scene he is in and you can tell that the voice actor had way too much fun playing this maniacal devil may care figure. It says something that I genuinely came to care for a cast of characters that included: an opportunistic foul mouthed movie director, a terrible mafia cook and the Devil himself.\n\nThat's all good and great, but how are the mechanics? How does it play? To answer both, good. First of all, Hat Girl controls really well. Befitting her small stature, she is quick to the chase with a generous movement speed. She also has a sunshine-styled dive which when combined with a generous double jump can get you to a lot of places. She's a bit floaty compared to Mario, but she still gets the job done. In terms of general structure, its simple. Collect 40 timepieces across 4 worlds, in each world you can collect yarn pieces which are used to make the titular hats, pons (basically coins) to buy badges that change gameplay and relics which unlock bonus levels when assembled. The number of things to collect is remarkably restrained and it never feels like you're being buried under tons of useless busywork. Everything has a purpose and feeds into each other.\n\nThe mission structure matches the diversity and variety of the games tone and story beats. The first world is your typical sandbox, but everything after that deviates from typical 3D platformer structure. The second world is essentially a collection of linear but incredibly varied props set on movie stages while the Third world, Subcon Forest, starts off small but sections are opened up when you complete certain tasks. It's probably my favorite world in terms of sheer exploration. Whats great about these stages is that they're just as fun to play as they are to read. The murder mystery mission for example. It may sound like a mission that is fun to experience the first time around but a drag on later playthroughs because of its emphasis on answering questions and solving a murder but its actually a really fun stealth mission where you avoid agents and even collect key cards to unlock new parts of the train mgs style. The mechanics work perfectly in tandem with the story beats. There are no \"talking section\", both gameplay and story go hand in hand with each other. It's pure gaming flow.\n\nThere are also the titular hats to take into account. Compared to Odyssey's groundbreaking use of hats to fundamentally change Mario's moveset and interaction with the environment, A Hat in Time falls short. Saying that, they are still remarkably useful with special mentions going to the speedster hat which makes a quick character quick...er. One hat in particular, I wrote off as gimmicky and useless only to be surprised when the game utilised it in one of the best levels of the game (think of the lens of truth from ocarina of time but much more fluid). Switching between them is almost instantenuous and the level design encourages their use. They're also really cute.\n\nThere is a lot more I wanted to talk about, like the amazing hubship (corgi simulator needs to be a real game), the boss battles which every other 3D platformer needs to take notes from and the timewarp missions which are out there psychonaut style. But I'm kinda tired so I'll wrap this up. A Hat in Time is a fantastic 3D platformer. It's constantly creative in its writing and design. Sure its a bit too short and easy, the fifth \"world\" was nothing more than a bossfight. But what's there is good. Is it as good as Super Mario Odyssey? I dunno about that, but what I do know is that this game is cute as heck.

Most levels run great, though I admit I'm pushing the hardware. Most folks shouldn't have an issue at 1080p or 1440p.\n(I ran the game at 4K on a setup with a 4790K and a 980ti, ran at 60fps pretty consistantly) \n\n-Overarching plot is somewhat thin, though the individual worlds' stories make up for this.\n-Sound design. Some effects are quite a bit louder than the rest of the soundscape, making volume management occasionally annoying. Mustache Girl occasionally sounds like she's right next to the mic compared with everyone else.\n-Not gonna lie, some levels look a tad like Gmod. However, I'm speaking strictly about texture work. If some stuff was a little more high resolution or slightly higher levels of detail available, this would be fine.\n-Call it a complaint, but I want more! Despite the game being short, it was worth every penny. I'd throw money at my monitor any day for DLC, a full expansion, or (dare I hope) a sequel.\n\nOverall:\nDespite my nags, this game is an A+ home run. I'd argue it's on par with any of the greats of 3D platforming; whether that be Spyro, the genesis Sonics, Crash Bandicoot or even Mario 64. Thank you Gears for Breakfast. This game is an absolute gem, and I'd shake every one of your hands for it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1512519200, "timestamp_updated": 1512519200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38086964": {"recommendationid": "38086964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157807045", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513418636}, "language": "english", "review": "3D platformer done exceptionally well.", "timestamp_created": 1512501673, "timestamp_updated": 1512501673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38086028": {"recommendationid": "38086028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314313373", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513056230}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\uff1a\uff09\u73a9\u5230\u4e86\u7b2c4\u7ae0\u624d\u53d1\u73b0\u539f\u6765\u7b2c1\u7ae0\u7684act.5\u662f\u8981\u7b49\u62ff\u5230\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u9759\u6b62\u5e3d\u518d\u56de\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u66b4\u813e\u6c14\u76f4\u63a5\u9a91\u7740\u5c0f\u6469\u6258\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u597d\u4e45\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u5f3a\u884c\u901a\u5173\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1512498785, "timestamp_updated": 1513056463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602966", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38075897": {"recommendationid": "38075897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155668134", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512469848}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been waiting to finish the game so that I can write a review and say this one thing:\n\nTHIS GAME IS NOT CUTE SOMETIMES!! IT CAN BE PRETTY CREEPY AND UNNERVING!! TOT\n\nPhew, got that off my chest! For real, I went into this game blind expecting a \"cute-as-heck\" 3D platformer inspired by the likes of Super Mario Sunshine, and that's *kinda* what I got, except after the first world there's just SO MUCH CREEPY AND UNFRIENDLINESS GOD.\n\nCUTENESS: Okay, Hat Girl's design is very cute, and knowing that, the game rewards you with cosmetics to dress her up. The first world, Mafia town, is the cutest and brightest level of the game, and at first the game's format will remind you of SMS (each level zooms to the area of interest, you explore a large world and return to it to collect the main objects except with different tasks, bright blue water, etc. The Blue time rifts are also clearly inspired by SMS's \"Secret of ...\" levels.) The characters at first seem silly and friendly, like when you first meet Mustache Girl and the harmless mafia. \n\nDARKNESS: But as you progress to Dead Bird Studio and Subcon Forest, you realize the light colorful cuteness was all just an ACT!! O_O In just the second world, the game throws stealth mechanics at you, dims the lighting, and changes the music to either minor key, ambience, downbeat introspectiveness, or suspense. (As someone who believes in the power of game BGM soundtracks to affect the overall feel of the game, I recommend just listening to most of the tracks online to get a feel for the atmosphere of this game.) Seriously, many of the game's levels are dark and gloomy, including the purple time rift bonus levels, which also throw in an abstract uneasiness. Many of the game's characters turn out to be antagonistic, unfriendly, or straight up rude, and the humor darkens as well. Subcon Forest for example, is darkly foggy and features a talking noose, fire spirits celebrating death, and the selling of your own soul. (Chapter 4 in particular, with Queen Vanessa, is probably the scariest thing I've ever played in a \"cute\" game). The game's worlds just don't feel human; there's almost no consistency to the reality of each setting, and it's as though there's nothing to rely on but yourself.\n\nSo, that's my main actual criticism of the game. I bought A Hat in Time expecting a cute colorful platformer just filled with comfy moments, and the actual game turned out to have fairly little in the way of \"comf\".\n\nGAMEPLAY-wise though, this game deserves a lot of credit. This very much feels like a game designed with classic 3D platforming in mind, as all the platform placements and mechanics seem to mesh very well together. The dive, wall-run, wall-climb, mid-air mobility, and double jump options all make it feel great to just jump around. The different-powered hats are also each very useful, and there are two very quick options to switch between them without going through a menu, so hats are more fun than annoying to use - the collectible placements also really take advantage of the hat powerups well, as does the entirety of the Alpine Skyline world. The Sprint Hat in particular, especially with the scooter badge, is a great way to add speed and mobility to the game. And knowing the history of A Hat in Time, you have to really hand it to the devs for creating a game with not just smooth mechanics, but HUGE worlds.\n\nPOLISH: There are times where the game's camera will follow very closely to you, and there are also certain slippery slopes you can get stuck on, and those moments can get annoying. There's often way too many collectibles than there are uses for, which sucks because this is a collectathon type of game (yarn and pons run out of uses after getting every hat powerup and badge). Otherwise, the game is overall well-polished.\n\nOVERALL the game is a fun 3D collectathon platformer on its gameplay merits, and I enjoyed it, and I would recommend it! However, I can NOT recommend this game if you are looking for a cute, cuddly, comfy sort of experience- the game's aesthetic is just too unnerving, unhuman, unfriendly, and creepy at times for that. (To be fair though, there are elements of cute humor throughout the game, and the game's ending is shows the friendly side of each character.) If you can look past the surprisingly dark and unsettling aesthetic of most of A Hat in Time, I would recommend it just for its gameplay, but I really do wish the game was as light and cute as it seems to be at first.", "timestamp_created": 1512466738, "timestamp_updated": 1512466738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38075887": {"recommendationid": "38075887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042311079", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512463858}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is adorably cute.

AHiT has some technical issues, but most of them are fixed + they do not impact the experience in any major way - sometimes you'll get stuck in a weird place (temporarily, and if anything weird happens the game will respawn you a few meters away) for some reason, but that's everything I have encountered.\n\nI love the music in this game.

For the price, it's a must buy for any fan of plattformers like the 3D-Marios. \n\nIt may be a bit short, but for me it was rather a pro than a con, as it kept things fresh, no world overstayed its welcome, the theming in the music didn't grow old and the 4th world just started to feel a liiiiittle uninspired after some time pieces, but it ended before it fell off the hype train. \n\nPersonally, my favourite time pieces are the two bosses in the 3rd world (no spoilerino about them here) and the chapter called Train Rush, while trying to get the achievment in the first run for the latter.\n\nThe camera was a bit odd and off sometimes, but for a 3D plattformer, it was on the better end.\n\nThe only part I did not enjoy that much were the hats. Sadly, they feel more like a TLoZ approach, a \"you need this power to progress / collect this collectable\", than real powers that are helpful in more situations. \nThe main hat wasn't really needed because I never had problems to find where to go next to advance, the witch hat wasn't really helpful outside of destroying stuff it's needed for as it is easier to hit enemies with the umbrella or a jump than throwing a potion, the ice hat was only needed for it's plattforms too, as was the fox mask, and the time slow hat just made things too easy, so I ended up never using it, because I wanted the original challenge.

This game is worth every penny and you should get it immediatley.\n\nSo, as a child, I grew up playing games like A Dog Island that had a large story behind it. They're just so fun and interesting, I love them still to this day. Platform games just the same, they're a challange and may have made me scream from time to time, but the two together are just amazing.\n\nA Hat in Time combines an interesting story that has you focused and entertained throughout your whole experience. See, the story is amazing and very creative. The art is amazing, it reminds me of a cartoon almost, but better. Everything is so detailed, just look at the crystal-clear sparkly water in the Mafia town. It really is breathtaking, you tend to even stray from your mission just to explore the amazing world before you. \n\nIn my opinion, the voice acting great. A lot of enthusasm and it just makes it fun to sit back and listen to the characters tell their stories, and they all have such amazing personalities that attach you to each and every one, even the villains. I am still obsessed with the Conductor, even though I had to battle him. They're just so well-developed.\n\nSure, the game has its ups and downs when it comes to bugs, but in all, it's amazing. I loved every second of it, even the challanging time rifts that had me ripping my hair out. (I'm talking about you, dumb owl parade time rift!) \n\nSo yes, get this game.

The platforming is good, offering enough wiggle room to allow you to correct any mistakes you may make (if you act quickly enough) and giving you a real sense of wonder as you explore the worlds offered. By no means is this a pixel perfect, difficult platformer. The game feels much more focused on experiencing the world than on creating a difficult and rewarding experience like some other platformers choose to do. The game progresses less linearly than some other platformers with smaller stories contained within the world rather than one larger story that takes you through the game. The game has a great tone, being fun and lighthearted, with a few darker stories that appeal to the adults who grew up with games like these as kids.\n\nThe core gameplay loop:\nYou primarily play levels on a world where you'll earn a timepiece. Most levels you earn the timepiece by exploring and solving small puzzles or platforming challenges until you reach the end. There are a handful of bossbattles in the game that are all unique and fun. And some levels ask you to complete very specific missions to unlock the timepiece. Once you've gotten the timepiece on that level you can go back for collectibles, but I moved quickly from timepiece to timepiece. As you progress, rifts will open on levels you've already completed and you can go back and get another timepiece by finding the rift and completing the short platforming challenge there. As you progress gathering collectibles you can decorate your ship with a handful of relics, decorate your character with new outfits and hat styles, and outfit past levels with new soundtracks. As you progress you also gather yarns which you'll use to stitch new hats, allowing you to interact more and more with the levels you've already completed to unlock collectibles you weren't able to reach when you first went through. You can also purchase badges which affix to your hats giving your character different abilities or gameplay modifications (grappling hook, ability cooldown reducing, changing your sprint mechanic into your character jumping on a solid gold scooter, giving you only one heart, making all words spoken to your character come out as mumbling are just a few).\n\nThe Hats:\nThis games major gimmick is the inclusion of several different hats which each have different functions. You build these up over the course of the game, but I got most of them fairly quickly and easily. The hats are the root of puzzle solving and world exploration and quickly feel like a natural extension of your character. \n\nThe Set Pieces:\nThe game offers 4 world setpieces (with two planned in future DLC) which are varied and unique. Each world has its own set of characters (the NPCs in this game are an absolute blast), enemies, and themes. Each world has a series of levels with different objectives which reward a time piece. Along the way to getting your time piece, you'll pick up various collectible yarns which you'll use to create new hats, rift tokens which you'll use to unlock outfits and music tracks, and relics which are trophies you'll take back to your ship and decorate it with. These worlds are varied experiences. 3 of the worlds are contained within one map; all of the levels/missions on these worlds are different objectives within that map. 1 world takes you through a variety of very small, linear maps which focus more on telling the specific stories of that level. In between these worlds you can wander around Hat Girl's space ship which is a colorful collection of rooms and (as the game progresses) NPCs. There are three rifts per world you can go back to find and complete. One of those rifts is always a pink rift which is longer and tells a story about that world. There also seem to be hidden diary pages in the game that you can unlock.\n\nReplayability and value of time spent:\nLet's face it. This game costs half the price of a AAA title (without a sale it's $30 at time of this review). I bought it at full price and at the time of review I've gotten 10 hours out of it. In these 10 hours I've beaten the entire story and collected all of the time pieces, but not quite all the collectibles or achievements. If I wanted to get the rest of the achievements and collectibles, It'd probably take me another few hours. That's what you're being offered with the core game. However, the developers have enabled in depth modding support allowing you to download from Steam Workshop community levels, new hats, new outfits and characters. I haven't spent too much time wandering around the workshop but I did see a few high quality mods that offer to extend the in game experience significantly. At the time of this review, no additional DLCs have come out and I don't know what their pricing scheme will be, but they also offer to extend the gameplay by about 50%. If you're a person who wants a lot of hours per dollar spent, this game might not be for you (yet! you can always wishlist it and wait for a good sale or wait until there's a lot of high quality workshop content to experience) but if you're a person who's okay with a game offering 10 or 20 fun hours with something like I am, then it's a good option if you like the premise of the game.\n\nFinal Note:\nThis game is fun for what it is. I'd recommend taking the time and money to experience it if you feel like it meets your personal criteria for how much content a game should offer. If you're looking through a lighthearted romp through a series of unique and colorful worlds with hilarious characters to meet along the way, this is the game for you. It's in my opinion, the best so far of the 3D platforming collectathon spiritual successors.", "timestamp_created": 1512164588, "timestamp_updated": 1512164643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37986071": {"recommendationid": "37986071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114075144", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512758729}, "language": "english", "review": "why havent u bought it\nbuy it", "timestamp_created": 1512161750, "timestamp_updated": 1512161750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37985507": {"recommendationid": "37985507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055670932", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 160, "last_played": 1513843712}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game\n\nthe character are amazing\nthe levels are great\nand it getting better with the workshop\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1512160185, "timestamp_updated": 1512160185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37981615": {"recommendationid": "37981615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082877113", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513109151}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I've ever played", "timestamp_created": 1512148884, "timestamp_updated": 1512148884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37980302": {"recommendationid": "37980302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023320993", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512348201}, "language": "english", "review": "Literally everything Yooka-FAILee tried to encapsulate.\n\nTight-as-heck controls, short and sweet story with the similar charm oldschool platformers like Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mayrio Sunshoine (or even Wind Waker) had.

that have really cool mechanics to them (I'm not going to be spoiling how the bosses look or fight)\n\nthe game is funny, has a certain cutesy charm about it, has an open world with 3 free roam worlds

it's fast, fluid and one of the best parts of the game overall.\n\nyou don't need the new abilities for most of the game, you can almost always use the movement mechanics to your advantage to earn Yarn (this unlocks more hats) and reach new parts of each stage to earn extra yarn or Time Tokens to unlock alternate hats or alternate colors for Hat Kid via the slot machine (Time tokens only, no

For example, this game has some severe performance problems in some parts, it's also quite buggy and I got stuck in the world geometry pretty often. All of these things are not really important to me, and excusable with this being an indie title but they show that this game isn't quite a finished product. Another indicator is that you can get much more Yarn Balls than there are hats and there's nothing to trade them for, a very obvious choice would be to just make it so that you can trade Yarn Balls for coins that you can use on the slot machine that gives you cosmetics but the developers chose not to and so you're just stuck with a large amount of Yarn Balls that you can't do anything with because you've already unlocked all of the hats. This game also has a weird ending, it just ends, there's not a whole lot of levels and the story also has no real sense of progression, things just happen, then there's an unexpected bossfight and then it's over. Of course story is pretty much unimportant for a game like this but it still bugged me. It doesn't really have to do something with the games length, Super Mario 64 is also only about 15 hours or so long, but this game just doesn't feel complete or finished when you beat it. I don't regret buying this game and will still recommend it but it just feels like this could've been so much more.

This game not only looks great and has a super cute artstyle, but it also controls amazingly well.\n\nThe platforming in here is one of the best you'll ever find in a game currently, trust me. Controls are super tight and thankfully the camera is very far from being an issue. Not only that but the game is very self-aware and the characters are extremely charismatic.\n\nAn interesting thing to note is that every single chapter of the game (4 as of this review) has a different \"gimmick\" to it. In the first one you basically have an open world to explore and get used to the controls, in the second you're given a choice that changes the outcome of that chapter, in the third you have a series of tasks to do, and in the forth you choose your own objectives.\n\nAnd as implied above, there's still more content on the way. 2 more chapters and multiplayer are great addition to the game, and this isn't even considering that this game supports Steam Workshop mods. Those extra additions, in the long run, essentially make the game more than worth is price.\n\nDo you like platformers and/or collectathons? Get this game. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\nYou don't?

the art style is gorgeous which mixes perfectly with the overall tracklist of themes, as they couldn\u2019t be composed better, and what is more is that most musical themes are adapting on the world, they are so stunningly dynamic.\nBoth, the artstyle as well as the music are vivid and fitting the world\u2019s theme.\n\nSpeaking of world themes: Do you wish to explore a town inhabited by the mafia or will you rather go on a spooky trip through the night, but hold on, you can also be a detective and investigate a murder case\u2026 just to name but a few.\nAbout those worlds it can be said that they are gigantic spaces, some linear, some focused heavily on free platforming and exploration.\nWhereat those linear levels concentrate more at the narrative of the world, thus providing very interesting dialogues and charming levels, the exploration driven worlds on the other hand makes you feel lost in their spacious areas submerged with content.\nInstead of progressing further to the main quest, you can find yourself most of the time trying to climb objects for optional content, as the platforming is so much fun that it distracts you ultimately from your main goal. \nAnd even though those levels might appear bland due to their sheer size, there is yet little to zero lack of consistency, on the contrary every wrinkle of the world is plastered with exhilarating stuff.\nAlmost nothing of that came along to me as padding to artificially enhance the game\u2019s length.\nThe games world even encourages you to explore freely at the very first missions, thus I skipped the tutorial to some degree.\n\nMoreover it can be said that these maps are consisting of refreshing game-design, even though it is supposed to bring back that old nostalgic vibes, it yet feels like something completely new: Nothing feels like it has already been done before in the same way, and even if there are elements that are considerably taken as reference by the developers, they yet invented those principles further and absolutely nailed them.\nIf there is one term I could use to describe the aforementioned, I would simply call it a brisk experience.\n\nHowever there is one more importance to this game, basically it\u2019s charm: There is so much love put inside of those characters and dialogues that I can\u2019t help but say that it feels alive and not like a conversation between two robotic entities.\nFurthermore, those conversations between the characters are really hilarious, but also are some of the jokes inside of the game.\n\nAll that being said, I can recommend this game without any major complaints, since the only complaint that I have is that it was not as long as other games, but fortunately the content that it does have is absolutely worth your time: I rather play a short but good game than a long dragged out game.", "timestamp_created": 1511822759, "timestamp_updated": 1512952200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37829499": {"recommendationid": "37829499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013265505", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512836002}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu est vraiment super.

If you are either a fan of the classic platformers or a generally new face within the genre such as I then prepare for an adorable romp through the wacky world of A Hat in Time! \n\nTLDR: Design is fun and can be really beautiful at times, Characters are a blast and I really wish I saw more of them, Music is great with more than a few stand out tracks, story leaves me wanting more in both good and not so good ways, challenge is well balanced in my opinion with a few areas that felt delightfully rough, and overall I had a good time. I wish I didn't rush through though.\n\nMovement is a blast and the level design is made in a way that isn't too challenging for the gaming novice but rewards those who try to be creative in the way they get around. In many games such as these I always felt that collectibles were not something that I cared too much about as they merely grant maybe an additional life or just a few points to the score, but the different collectibles in this game (aside from the main story-required macguffins) provide you with additional abilities or traits that can make your traversal through the world easier, allow you to accomplish tasks at a faster pace, or just grant you another layer of defense against various threats.\n\nI do enjoy the art style for the most part. Certain aspects like drawn on mouths and the lack of certain facial features were a bit jarring at first, but the design of the world rarely disappointed! This is coming from a poor individual whose computer cannot handle the full graphical settings of this game, but the lower settings still looked really nice and I was able to mind the occasional frame drops. (Wish I had the ability to enjoy the full experience though...) The final world was not my cup of tea since I am not the biggest fan of backtracking giant areas, but it was an isolated incident that really wasn't mandatory unless you are going for the complete experience. You can honestly finish the game rather quickly as you are able to face the final boss well before you have collected all time pieces, but where is the fun in that? \n\nI won't go into detail about certain events that I cared about the most to avoid too many spoilers, but there were many hits and few misses with a lot of the plot points in this game. I would have loved to see more appearances of a lot of my favorite characters while playing through the game! More story would have been neat in general, but there are future worlds being developed so I can wait a bit to see more! Oh also I like a lot of the tracks in this game. Musical delight indeed!\n\nI apologize for the less than organized review, but I hope I was able to separate it enough to highlight and call into question different aspects of the game. I also really like the workshop feature. I saw a few people importing worlds that allow the excellent movement options to flourish in new environments while others provided even more was to get around in an already amazingly fluid game!\n\nOn one last note I miss that cool looking kid from the 2-player announcement from the kickstarter. I heard they were getting rid of that. Kinda makes me sad but it is their decision in the end. \n\nThank you for your time if you decided to read this silly thing.

Stop reading here and buy the game.\n\nA Hat in Time is one of those games with huge levels, that have small missions to obtain an item at the end of the mission before being brought back to the main hub... Personally, I love those as they play the strings of nostalgia in my heart.\n\nGame play: Fun and fast with a good flow feel to it. If you're someone who's like me and likes to dive everywhere you know what I'm talking about. Game is quick to pick up on with controls that aren't too difficult. It can be a bit annoying rotating between hats if you're someone who isn't used to leaving an analog stick tilted until you leave the menu. You grow to get used to it though. The game is somewhat flexible in what you can do and when you can do. If throws in elements from other kind of games like Zelda where you cannot complete a task without finding the item to complete the task. You are not bound to one area and are absolutely encouraged to look through other areas and coming back to finish the one you started... There are some customization options also, with a workshop to come. \n\nStory: The story does make you feel for the antagonist a bit in a very humorous way(?) I mean their reasons are justified, but what they do ends up being a little extra towards the end. Which is fine for plot reasons.\n\nMusic: Great. The music is dream like and wonderful. I cannot applaud the music enough.\n\nFaults: Every game has some faults. For me personally it would be some of the mechanics. I'm usually a player with little patience and tend to try to do stuff as quick as possible, and the game is very good at keeping up, until I miss that one swing because the game didn't register that it was a hook-able spot. Camera might also be your nightmare, but we all remember the camera for Mario 64, so if you managed to master that monstrosity growing up, this is cakewalk.\n\nOverall I recommend this game.

Sonic Mania (DRM issue aside, I had a good time playing it), Cuphead, now this.\n\nNow, this is from the perspective of someone who did not back this game on Kickstarter but backed Yooka-Laylee. Recent years have reintroduced my love of the sorts of platformers as seen on the fifth/sixth generation consoles, especially in the vein of Banjo-Kazooie or Psychonauts. Seeing a group of professionals who worked on Banjo-Kazooie form a new studio to pitch a game had me happily chip in around $12. Putting all drama aside, when I finally received my copy I've put in at least eight hours, and while I contend that reviews were a bit harsh to it, and that there are some positive things going for it (Grant Kirkhope's score being a pretty big one), there were some gameplay gripes I had and I didn't find it that memorable. Not a fan of its voice grunts either, especially when compared to Banjo-Kazooie.\n\nSo why did I bring this up? Well, when I received this game as a gift and played it, I found quite a few things about it that just blows it out of the water. There may be some things that needed polish, and it shows, but the characters are charming and well-acted, the worlds they inhabit grip me, with the sorts of themes that I would see in platformers of the sixth-generation era (especially Psychonauts or the Gamecube titles). I also find myself digging the music, as it does remind me of quite a few games that I have known. Also bearing in mind that this game was made lovingly by fans with a background in modding iirc, while Y-L was made by industry professionals, and the former is $10 cheaper at release. With all this, I just don't have the incentive of going back to playing Yooka-Laylee, while I can see myself playing this more.\n\nThis is just a really charming game that I certainly wouldn't mind 100%ing on more than one playthrough.

It deserves every amount of praise it gets and if you're a fan of 3D platformers or are looking for a first platformer to get into, this is the game to get. Why do I think this way? Glad you asked, I have many reasons!\n\n1. The controls feel SO good, and there is so many options to do things with the amount of control you have over the cute Hat Kid, honestly she feels on par with Mario from Super Mario Sunshine, if not better. \n2. This game has a LOT of charm, every chapter oozes with delight and creativity, and it makes me so happy. Also, Hat Kid is so adorable, her voice actor did a pretty good job making the cute kid be cute.\n3. Speaking of voice acting, 95% of this game is voice acted and it ranges from great to amazing. It makes every character have personality, and I don't think the game would be the same without voice acting.\n4. The game looks beautiful, even with it's take on a cartoon-like artstyle, it just looks so pretty and I want some of the level intro cards as my wallpaper.\n5. The soundtrack, oh my god, this game's soundtrack is equally as amazing as the game's looks itself, goregous tunes, catchy tunes, and it all just blends together with the current situation, I need to buy the OST to just listen to. (Which is more then 5 hours long, dear lord this game is so good)\n6. The one thing that really got me excited for the game was the MOD SUPPORT, and from what I've been seeing from the Beta, almost anything is possible. Yes, as of this review the workshop/mod tools are in beta, but they are shaping up to be really good!\nI might be missing some points here, but there are more if I missed any!\n\nIf there is one thing I don't like, but this is a minor problem, is the game length. I'm not going to spoil how many of the main collectables there are, but the length of this game will make you want more. But there is more on the way with 2 free DLC chapters in the future, AS WELL as a New Game+ mode along the way. But right now, if you want more content, the Workshop beta is the place to get that content, quite a lot of it is already on there!\nThis is my personal GOTY, I've been waiting so long for this game and it is way better then I hoped it would, and I'll surely be a part of this game's modding community, making content for this excellent game.

Wow, that was a long time ago... In any case, the game's a fantastic 3d platformer, brought up to a modern standard -- with a few quirks. \n\nThe control is fantastic. Hat Kid has some of the most fluid control in a 3d platformer ever. The diving and dive-cancel mechanic is tons of fun to pull off, as well as the ground flip you can do to get more speed. They're also very broken, and can be used to skip over a majority of the fun grapple-based platforming segments.\n\nThe scenarios and characters you meet along the way are really fun and memorable. The gameplay never gets stale -- there's always something new to do. All this is accompanied by an great, upbeat soundtrack, with lots of variety and charm.\n\nSome complaints:\nThe badge system is kind of obnoxious. By the end of the game, you only have 3 badge slots you can assign badges to. One of these will usually always be taken up by your grapple. If you want to use your camera, you have to equip it first. This is a minor complaint.\n\nInconsistency in quality. You can kind of tell what parts of the game were modeled and designed first. Some parts of this game, such as models, effects, and environments have an inconsistant look to them. Some animations look absolutely amazing, while some quite literally weren't changed from the beta build of the game. Some characters clip through other objects during their animations. Some dialoug doesn't have voice acting. These inconsistancies got to the point where it was incredibly jarring whenever I noticed them.\nOf course, all of these problems are cosmetic, and don't ruin the game, persay... They just take you out of the experience for a moment.\n\nBut good game anyway. Buy this game. Just do it if you want a fun ol' romp. What have you got to lose?

An unexpected snag hits, and off to journey to 3D platforming worlds you go!\n\nThe story setup is brief but it works. A Hat In Time succeeds because although it advertises itself as cute-as-heck, it\u2019s also fun-as-heck, peck-as-heck, and while there is a time and a place, this is the place. And this place draws you in, because while it\u2019s not the biggest (it\u2019s the first game released by Gears For Breakfast), nor the baddest (a Kickstarter project 4+ years in the making, with a modest budget and a modestly-sized development team), it does exude quality across the board regardless, in many aspects, taking many forms. A Hat In Time\u2019s positives include:\n\n+ FUN FACTOR/FUN. Lots and lots of fun! This game GETS IT. From the moment you wake on your spaceship and are placed to inspect your immediate surroundings, this game invites you. At first it is but a whisper. You go over to the dresser, chuckle, a tiny glimpse of the clever writing that awaits you, you then turn your head, and\u2026 there is a pool of pillows in your bedroom! Well then, dive in!\n\nAnd that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\n\nDiving in.\n\nA Hat In Time wants you to interact. To explore. To dive in, to soak in its unique blend of personality and charm. Here\u2019s your ticket, all aboard, passenger! You\u2019re invited to this vibrant, crazy train! Nostalgic and trailblazing, A Hat In Time pays respect to the old and the new. The little things. The big things. This world is alive, full of details, both large and small, some random, some not, from Roomba rides, to scooter horns, to pattycake with the man in blue, to random posters plastered in various worlds, to talking owls, to curious crows, to picture taking, to jokes, to jokes WITHIN jokes, to clever responses, to humorous interactions, to easter eggs, to random jumps on floating cookies, to scary ledges, to tightrope mechanics, to engrossing music, to the vibrant surroundings and atmosphere, the list goes on. Which all amounts to --\n\nFun. A BIG bundle of fun! The game doesn\u2019t have to tell you to HAVE fun, because the world IS fun. The worlds are a playground for Hat Kid, she herself a world of her own, able to convey, through facial expressions and body animations alike, a wide range of emotions such as joy, sadness, or her unmistakenly unwavering child-like innocence, sarcasm, and hope. Hat Kid\u2019s adorable idle animations, her 'running-in-place\u2019 animation, environmentally specific animations (keep a lookout during cold/mysterious/scary areas), cute voicelines (Her \u201cBye\u201d to the Badge Seller awww <3), her \u201cFireballs,\u201d her \u201cBoo-yahs,\u201d and so on and so forth, as well as her dedicated buttons to \u2018blow kiss/smooch\u2019 and \u2018raspberry\u2019, all come together to make her a ball of recklessly positive inspiration, ready to take on any adventure that comes her way.\n\n+ CONTROLS. This is tight, responsive platforming paradise. Controls are crisp, enabling Hat Kid to move well to your desire. Her moveset includes running, a standard jump, a double jump, a long jump, a parkour-inspired wall jump, a dive, an air dive, a dive cancel, an air dive cancel, umbrella swipes, air homing attacks, etc. not to mention equippable hats and badges that add various skills and abilities to her arsenal. It seems like a basic layout, and it may appear so on the surface, but her runs, jumps, dives, and cancels provide a level of precision and a gateway for advanced play that allows for mid-air error adjustment, correction, and control, allowing her to maneuver platforms with relative ease. \n\nHer toolbox further rewards skillful players who are able to chain these abilities together to make use of speedruns, which are an embraced option in the game. A Hat In Time even goes as far as to include a speedrun timer in the options, for those willing to take on the challenge of going fast, fast, fast!\n\nAnd because Hat Kid controls quite well, particularly resourceful players will be able to discover shortcuts and different ways to finish a stage. This is a mark of a good control scheme, as well as well-planned, well thought-out, and well-executed level design.\n\n+ GENRE-BREAKING ELEMENTS. In a manor of speaking, this game surprises as it transcends its predominant 3D platformer roots and manages to mix genres such as stealth, mystery, and horror into one. I will be brief here because these sections are best experienced by the player itself, but will say that these sections make sense for each specific adventure, and are appropriate for each specific setting. It executes this wonderfully and it comes through beautifully. It does not feel tacked on, or existing just because it can, but is rather interesting and highlight some of the best and most memorable parts of the game.\n\n+ SOUNDTRACK. Clocking in at over 5 hours, A Hat In Time\u2019s soundtrack, almost all of which are composed by Pascal Michael Stiefel, along with a few other notable names (Grant Kirkhope + artists with remixed renditions of specific tracks), is genuinely one of the best parts of A Hat In Time AND (IMO) one of THE MAIN reasons to get the game. One of the most important elements for game immersion, A Hat In Time\u2019s soundtrack is excellent, with memorable, catchy, and ambitious sections, spanning across different genres to create a defining mark and a long-lasting impression. Mindful players will recognize nostalgic sections/references amongst specific tunes (but it\u2019s not a prerequisite, as the soundtrack, as a whole, is fantastic enough to listen to as a standalone, without the coat of nostalgia to cast judgment).\n\nSimply put, this soundtrack is one to hold in high regard, in and outside of the game. I do (and will) play stages JUST to hear certain tracks, they\u2019re that good, and such a joy to listen to! The variety here is astounding, likely offering something to suit the tastes of everyone.\n\n+ OPEN-ENDED DESIGN. The game supports Steam Workshop, which means that it encourages mods/mod support (currently in beta). Options exist for new dyes/costumes, new hats, new abilities, unique levels, recreations of stages from beloved games, added difficulties, and so on and so forth. Intriguing possibilities abound, and we\u2019re just at the tip of the iceberg.\n\n+ HUMOR. A good chunk of the game\u2019s personality and charm can be attributed to the humor and strong writing, clearly inspired by beloved games of old. Most of the humor here is appropriate for kids, although some border on the twisted and the macabre.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Hat Kid\u2019s mannerisms, her interactions with objects/characters, the characters themselves, or a specific activity within a specific stage, A Hat In Time puts a nostalgic, yet distinct style to accompany and enhance these specific worlds, never artificial, and as wacky as the wacky worlds that they are set within. It just\u2026 fits. It\u2019s ok to smile, and to laugh along :).\n\nAs far as negatives go, world 5\u2019s main antagonist needs more screen time, more backstory, more motivation to emphasize why this character set out to become the very character this is in the final act. More fleshing out in this aspect is needed; as is, it ended up being too abrupt.\n\n---FINAL THOUGHTS---\n\nThe game, per Kickstarter achieved stretch goals, will have worlds 6 and 7 arriving as free DLCs, and will have co-op modes available in the near future. There is much to look forward to!\n\nGet this game and transport yourself to an amazing, memorable journey. Support a development team that put obvious love and care into their work! The charm, the precision, the detail \u2013 this is a fine example of gaming bliss. One that should endure \u2013 in time.\n\nMy wish is that Hat Kid becomes recognizable enough to the point that she becomes a classic, iconic, beloved video game character.\n\nA Hat In Time cherishes the past, shapes the present, and has a promising future.\n\nPlay it. Be charmed by it. Enjoy it.\n\nLove it!", "timestamp_created": 1511737218, "timestamp_updated": 1512169609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 225, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.931624", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37725705": {"recommendationid": "37725705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045060231", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513302793}, "language": "english", "review": "Takes me back to my days of childhood playing 3D Platformers, but it doesn't just copy and paste everything from that era, it balances the nostalgia with really good gameplay improvements and also adds mod compatibility, definitely my favorite game of 2017", "timestamp_created": 1511734904, "timestamp_updated": 1511734904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37724146": {"recommendationid": "37724146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058233798", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511990074}, "language": "english", "review": "Hatsmackingly good!", "timestamp_created": 1511733638, "timestamp_updated": 1511994838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37723988": {"recommendationid": "37723988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058371282", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 236, "last_played": 1514743333}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "\"Helyes mint \u00e1llat\" ahogy maguk a fejleszt\u0151k is \u00edrt\u00e1k.\n\nTelis tele van sz\u00f3rakoztat\u00f3  tartalmakkal \u00e9s konnyed kih\u00edv\u00e1sokkal.

Too often there is such a disproportionate focus on high-octane competitive action, or cinematic high-budget storytelling, or even hair-pulling levels of difficulty that many games have left behind what makes this form of entertainment special in the first place. \n\nNothing in this game exists for itself. A Hat in Time is built around the player and only the player. It doesn't stroke its ego to 'enhance' the experience or exploit its brand to sell copies. It just simply presents itself and says \"have fun.\"\n\nEverything about this game is designed to be fun. Every mechanic and feature has been given special attention so that nothing would ruin the experience. My favorite being the secret shortcut avalable to those who don't want to do the horror level, but still want to finish the game. \n\nThe controls are tight and well thought out. Just moving the character around is enough entertainment for hours. Add the incredible soundtrack, the tastefull humor, the refined (albeit simple) artstyle, and a camera that rivals even some of the great 3D mario games and you have something truly special. \n", "timestamp_created": 1511725470, "timestamp_updated": 1511725470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37709401": {"recommendationid": "37709401", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989954194", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508965977}, "language": "german", "review": "A very lovly game", "timestamp_created": 1511724336, "timestamp_updated": 1511724336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37708328": {"recommendationid": "37708328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043887449", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511815101}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those games that is just pure unadulterated fun, I could play the entire game multiple times and still have a great time. :)", "timestamp_created": 1511723747, "timestamp_updated": 1511723747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37708157": {"recommendationid": "37708157", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970507818", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511725203}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a ton of heart and charm to it.", "timestamp_created": 1511723656, "timestamp_updated": 1511723656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37707554": {"recommendationid": "37707554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057336982", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511876314}, "language": "english", "review": "easy 8/10.

This was one of the few select games that I've genuinely been excited for, and followed the development process despite not being a Kickstart backer. Let me tell you despite being a crowdfunded game, it 100% lived up to all my expectations.  Starting from the opening cutscene I just completely fell in love with the game, and for the first hour or so I just tried exploring, and admiring the first world's scenery.  From the lovable cast of characters, to the scenery, the OST (which in itself is amazing, and even includes some work from Grant Kirkhope), the game has managed to turn itself from a crowdfunded callback to a more or less dead genre, to it's own unique entity that stands amongst it's peers.\n\nHowever, not everything was amazing.\n\n* The price to playtime is about 1-2$ per hour, which is really not ideal. \n* There really arnt that many Time Rifts in the game, which are pure platforming areas that are essentially the same as the flood-less levels in Mario Sunshine.\n* The \"last\" world, Alpine Skyline is so bad compared to the rest of the game its just sad. Alpine Skyline is  tiresome, uninteresting, and overall boring as all hell. However, I will give the game credit for  changing up the formula.\n\nOverall A Hat in Time is just a cute, fun loving, feel-good kind of game, which I would reccomend to anyone.\n\nOn a personal note this game very easily could take my vote for GOTY  however, at the least it will be in my top 3 garunteed.

It follows the Nintendo ethos of having multiple, swift movement options but improves it by adding badges to change some techniques slightly and add visual flair. The game looks fantastic and runs pretty consistently with a cute cel-shaded art style and bright vibrant colours. There aren't a billion things to collect, I've 100%'d the game in 10hrs but that's a good thing, each of the levels are so unique and well designed with their own themes both visually and gameplay-wise. But above all, it has the polish, attention to minute details, memorable world designs and fluid controls that Yooka Laylee was somewhat lacking.\n\nThe X-Factor for this game comes in all of the worlds being like Super Mario 64, small and each Time Piece is objective based making it easy to keep track and maintain progress - EXCEPT for one world which uses the free roam style of Banjo Kazooie to great effect and is a nice change of pace. It didn't choose one style or the other exclusively, it gave a taste of both these brilliant formulae for platforming worlds and it works damn well.\n\nPros:\n- Great art style and solid visual presentation\n- Soundtrack is appropriate and very catchy in some places (favourite are Time Rift and Band Song #1)\n- Not too many collectibles, so no DK64 burnout just some good fun exploring and snapping\n- Controls are tight, smooth and very responsive (Hat Kid is the female Mario)\n- Story is ridiculously light-hearted and very tongue-in-cheek (excl. a sad mini-story #Vanessa)\n- Each of the 5 worlds are unique and not at all boring or similar to one another\n- Camera is brilliant for a 3d platformer about 95% of the time\n\nCons:\n- I'm really scraping the barrel, but there was some slowdown during intense changes in scenery such as Lava episode in Mafia Town\n- Camera is a bit funny sometimes, but DON'T let that deter you please. It's simply something that all 3d platformers must bear, the camera will sometimes get stuck in tough spots but it never lead to me dying or losing progress in a platforming challenge\n- No DLC yet (seriously Gears for Breakfast, we need dat dlc rite nouw ;) )", "timestamp_created": 1511702936, "timestamp_updated": 1511702936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37668041": {"recommendationid": "37668041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271882589", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511567889}, "language": "english", "review": "Heckin' cute.", "timestamp_created": 1511702669, "timestamp_updated": 1511702669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37663508": {"recommendationid": "37663508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041313010", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511709764}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cute platformer with resemblance of Super Mario Sunshine elements and other Mario franchises from Nintendo, all in all a well rounded platformer with nice humor, graphics and cute characters.", "timestamp_created": 1511700349, "timestamp_updated": 1511700349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37663019": {"recommendationid": "37663019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122981214", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508190902}, "language": "english", "review": "Just buy it, who wouldn't want to play as a cute as heck little alien who can be friends with everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1511700090, "timestamp_updated": 1511700090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37662900": {"recommendationid": "37662900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330311056", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512407031}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u96be\u5f97\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8df3\u8dc3\u5e73\u53f0\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1511700026, "timestamp_updated": 1511700026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37662199": {"recommendationid": "37662199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059904339", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 254, "last_played": 1514800262}, "language": "english", "review": "Great new 3D Platformer up there with the likes of Games like Super Mario sunshine Banjo Kazooie, Etc.

You shouldn't need anyone else to say what's great about this game at this point because I'm sure between the youtube videos and the hailstorm of positive reviews this game already should look like a solid purchase but let me just say that within this game beats the heart of a true platformer. I never would have imagined such a small company could strive so boldly to earn a place among the Mario franchise titles and come so close to reaching it. The controls are fantastic, the levels all play wildly different from the others, and the characters are so memorable I already get the feeling of dusting off an old cartridge every time I launch this game. It's like couch gaming with an old friend.\n\nIt does need some work still. Mod support is not nearly as robust as I'd like (bugs will happen often), it is fairly easy to glitch the game out in certain places, and overall the game is possible to 100% in a fairly short amount of time. However, nothing has left me wanting. You can play the zones in (almost) any order and they have this nice flow that ends each world just before it starts to feel old. There's endearing characters at every turn, and while overall the game is very easy it has some nice challenges too. I can forgive the game for being short, because every minute is well made.\n\nOverall, anyone who loves platformers will love this.

Review will update with progress]\n\nSo, before we start. I've been looking forward to this game since 2015 and its kickstarter. I didn't back the kickstarter because I was a peniless student without a job at the time, but I was still looking forward to it. \nFlash forward to two years later. I brought the game only yesterday as I was in a busy period, but let me tell you... The long wait for this game was well worth it.\n\nA hat in time is one of those \"Good old 3D-platformers remade\". But unlike Yooka-Laylee, it's actually good! The movement feels good, the camera acts how it should (i.e, you can always see you character), and let's be real, it's pretty much perfect.\nI have a few complaints, but I'll save that for the end.\n\nFrom the first time I loaded up the game, all I could think was \"this looks awesome\". Everything is consist. Everything looks like it's meant to be. The crazy spaceship that you're in... you don't quesiton it because it fits. The first island, \"Mafia Island\" feels natural somehow. There's no need for suspension of disbelief becuase it all feels natural to the game.\nYou can practically fly around the game with the amount of movement you're given, and yet the platforming is still a challenge as it should be... (Sometimes because of the controls and camera, but we'll get to it).\n\nThe characters all look awesome. You can tell that a lot of love went into how everything looks. Especially Hat Girl (Cause I don't know her name haha). It's kinda awesome. Even the small amounts of dialogue she speaks just sounds amazing. It's perfectly done. Then there's the NPCs. They were amazingly done to. I love the Marfia from as far as I've gone. I love talking to the random characters around and just hearing their random voice lines. Oh yeah, all the dialogue is voiced to!!!\n\nThe music of the game... I decided to buy the deluxe edition from the start, but holy cow. I did not realise just how amazing it was going to be. I love the music. I even spent a good 10 minutes in front of the TV in the ship listening to the dog bark remix of the song hahaha...\n\nAnyway, this game is amazing. But let's mention the downsides. \nThe camera doesn't have any elevation control and doesn't give you any options to pan it in order to make sure you stick the jumps (At least by default). This makes platforming a bit annoying at times.\nHat girl feels a bit slipery at times, making platforming a bit hard... She loves to run up walls a lot and screw up some of the more dangerous sections.\nI want to like Mustache Girl because her voice is amazing.\nBefore you get the magnet badge, collectables really love going underwater and being unreachable.\n\nWell, that's what I think about \"A Hat in Time\".\nIt's amazing.

I didn't even lose any progress or anything, I just had to go back to the start of the level.  No more issues.\n\n[*]It took way me way too long to figure out where to assemble relics, but I may have just missed it when they first explained relics to you.  \n\n[*]I wasn't a fan of how restricted Subcon Forest felt with the fire walls all over the place, but I still loved the area regardless.\n\n[*]The camera felt a little weird on controller, with no way to really look up, until I realized I could change it to a traditional third camera in the settings.\n\n[*]I would have liked it to be longer, but that's hardly a bad thing to be wishing for.  Even if it was 50 hours long, I would still want more.\n\n[*]The badge system felt a little bit underwhelming.  The hookshot badge would usually take up one slot, because of how frequently you find spots to use it, and the scooter would usually take up another, just because of how great it is to get around a platformer quickly.  So, you were usually left with one slot, which feels like a missed opportunity.\n[/List]\n\n     And of all of those, only one of them is an actual game-wide criticism, and even then it didn't detract from the overall experience at all really.  Everything else in this game is absolutely amazing, from the controls to the characters and everything inbetween.

From the vibrant level designs of each world to the detail and care put into each character came an amazing experiance I wasn't really expecting at first glance when I first purchased this game. This game would probably be one of the only platformers that I've loved playing in a long time, which shines with everything I hope for in any type of game.\n\nSure, there's a few downsides to the main game : Camera angles being trickey and annoying in some platforming stages in certain areas (especially in Chapter 3 and some Time Rifts), character models showing slight errors when displayed in certain cutscenes with clipping and even though I don't mind this at all, some people would say it'd be too short of a game.\n\nBut with this, the true potential of AHIT shines through and knocks those worries out. The game starts out fun and enjoyable and stays that way until the very moment you exit out. Each stage of every chapter has a ton of replay value with how much space there is to explore with the wide variety of obstacles to parkour through and with the touch of collectables that unlock ability hats, customizable material for Hat Girl to currency that help with buying pins which you can mix and match to your own style and advantage in different areas.\n\nThe main selling point of this game, in my opinion, would be the soundtrack, how it creates this amazing atmosphere throughout the story and the variety and personality put to each individual character you come to face throughout that make each area have more charm and give more reason to venture forth to see what they and the enviroment have in store for you to overcome.\n\nI really do recommend this game to anyone no matter personal taste, you'll love it start to finish.

This is a Kickstarter game that was in a development for 5 years and promised to bring back the memories of classic 3D platformer games... No, come back, please! This one is actually good, I promise!\n\n*Ahem* So. It's surprisingly good. So far all content that the game offered me was great and it's one of the few games that I actually wanted to replay right after I completed it.\n\nIn this game you play as a girl whose name we don't know and is nicknamed Hat Kid. The game starts with you waking up on the spaceship on which you are flying back to your home. It uses hourglass thingies called time pieces as a fuel. On your way home you are flying past a planet from which a person who claimes to be a part of Mafia came to take a toll from you for passing over their town. Instead he manages to break the glass window on your ship and it results in losing all your time pieces as they fall on the planet and now you need to take them back so you could have enough fuel to fly back to your home.\n\nThe controls are good and tight. You have a variety of moves including a wall run, double jump and a dive which are pretty standart for a 3D platformer. You also have a variety of hats that have different abilities that help you to explore the levels. Also also, similar to Psychonauts you can buy and equip badges that add new abilities to your character or improve the abilites of the hats.\n\nThe game features 4 big worlds for you to explore (there are 5 worlds actually but the fifth one is just a bossfight) and they differ greatly in style and atmospere which helps to keep the game fresh and fun. For example, the first world named \"Mafia Town\" is a Mario Sunshine-esque world in which you are given the main objective you need to do but you can freely explore the map. The second world named Dead Bird Studio in which you are caught in battle between two movie directors that managed to get their hands on some time pieces is a more linear experience compared to the first world and so on. Each world also features bonus levels called \"Time Rifts\" which are pure platforming segments similar to Mario Sunshine. \n\nThe art style of this game is very good and cute, can't really say anything else about it.\n\nThe characters in this game are very good and memorable. You have the Mafia with thick russian accent who punch barrels who are dressed as old ladies to keep the town in fear, you have a scottish owl who likes to film western movies on his own train with innocent owls that just want to get to their destination on his train and a sassy penguin who is a former owner of night club who decided to film movies too, and many more.\n\nI also want to point out the voice acting in this game. It's one of the best I've heard in a game and it adds a lot of personality to the characters and makes them much better (you also have an option to turn off the voice acting if you do not like it). Voice actors did a really great job.\n\nThe music in this game is amazing. So far every piece of music the game offered me was a delight to my ears. The game musician really needs to get an extra credit for his work.\nHere's an example:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XUw1NxJS2k\n\nWhile there are a lot of good things in the game, there are some problems too. The game also brought back some cons from old platformers like strangely placed and fixed cameras which can mess with your view and thus it makes navigating the level harder, controls sometimes can be a wee bit wonky, some rough edges when it comes to graphics and animations and a story is a bit shallow in some places.\n\nVerdict.\n\nA Hat in Time is a really good and solid game that managed to bring back the feeling of the classic platformers (and some problems) while mixing in some new stuff. I highly recommend to buy this game and try it out.

To me, it looked just like a standard platformer with a mild charm to its art style. The characters were cute and it was a platformer. That's all you really get from it when just watching casual gameplay. But..\n\nWhen you actually play the game yourself, it's very different. Because you aren't just looking at something cute now. /You/ are the cute. And that makes all the difference, because the way the main character, Hat Girl, controls is very fluid. She moves like you want her to and there are ways to improve your movement even further, just by playing the game. Some through the in-game equipment, such as a badge that makes you not bonk your head if you ram into a wall, but a lot of them are simply learning the gameplay.\n\nThat mixed with the actual platforming being challenging and, in most cases, interesting to figure out without touching anything dangerous makes the game flow even better. As a 3D platformer that has clear influences from top tier platformers such as Mario Sunshine, it does its job well. It may not seem like it at first glance, but it has the same heart in it that Mario Sunshine had and then some... But then you get into the negatives.\n\nThe gameplay is good. No doubt about it, but there are two major aspects that do hold this game back from getting a perfect score anywhere... The story and the level mechanics. \n\nStory wise, it isn't awful. I can't go into too much detail without tossing major spoilers in a review, but a major character doesn't make an appearance after the first ten minutes of the game... And that's bad. A lot of the characters also seem a bit too \"singlular minded\" and it gets really old, really quick when the Mafia guys refer to themselves as \"Mafia\" like three times in one text box. I can't recall how many times I muttered \"Please stop saying Mafia\" to myself. But on the flip side, there are other characters that act nothing alike that still end up being the exact same thing in the end. That's dull. Not a major issue, but dull. Lastly, it has to do with Hat Girl's own connection to everyone. But that's spoilers too.\n\nAs for the level mechanics, the big issue is that there are only a few things you can grab in a level before you have to leave. Even if the level is exactly the same as another chapter, which is an old way of doing it that we saw in Mario 64 or Mario Sunshine. Get the Star/Shine -> Exit Level -> Re-enter level on another chapter -> Repeat. It's an old style that kinda lost its charm awhile ago, but I understand the need of it. Didn't really enjoy dealing with it when the levels were the exact same, however. Only the Finale chapters for each stage felt like it deserved to be a separate level. However; I'll also say that each stage has its own loading screen and that's pretty great. The art style conveys the emotion of each one well enough that I was happy to see them, but playing through the same level three times for three different Time Pieces was pretty... meh. Not weird or bad, just... Meh.\n\nAs a side, it also bothers me there's no way to actively collect all the other vanity items in the game. This is to make it open ended for future levels and modded levels that come out in the future, but... There's a lot of stuff I can't get for a long time now because of that. Which is fine in the long run, but I can see a lot of people getting bothered they can't actually 100% this game for another year.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, I'd still recommend this game to anyone that enjoys platformers. It's a good game with minor faults that mostly lie in its story telling wanting to be episodic, but not including an overarching plot. The plot is there, don't get me wrong, but... It's not really a factor except at the beginning and end. That's bland, but we'll see how the DLC stuff handles that I suppose? Though that doesn't really help the base game, I think...\n\nBut y'know, 8/10. Great game, but it's not perfect.

I'd hear about this game for a while and was fairly excited about it. To be honest I was actually a little more exited for Yooka-Laylee, which wasn't terrible; but wasn't the revival of 3D platformers. THIS, a hat in time, is what we've been waiting for by far. I can't say enough how polished and loved this game is. You can see with every small detail of jump accesability. That might be a strange term to use. What I mean is that if you play platformers and you take away the graphics in your mind, you can see the \"Track\" that the developer wants you to take. I replayed \"Psychonauts\" another one of my favorite games, and I realized that there was definitely a set path they wanted you to take. You can see the world without the graphics and realize in your mind. So after a while you start to feel like you don't have the same freedom. In the 3D Mario games you have set paths, but people who are skilled can overcome them. That might have more to do with it being so long since a lot of them came out. Sometimes using glitches, if you watch speed runners that is. A hat in time says if you see it, there is probably more than one way to reach it. I've watched reviews of people playing it and nobody does it the same way, that's a testiment to the games love and care. It almost looks like how Sonic games perform, where you see people just naturally navigating, as if the game were on rails. However unlike sonic, It's not on rails. \n\nI really can't say enough, I'd have to do a video review to do it justice. I'm making this now because this game needs more good reviews, it has overwelmingly good reviews; however it got overshadowed by cuphead because games journalists suck at playing games. Which is a shame because this game really deserves more attention. I think over time it will become known as a classic, it already has a cult following. Please try this game.

The music in this game is top notch. It's well made and is pretty catchy. Same goes to the remixes. \n-Memorable characters. Everyone you meet from the mafias to the goats are interesting whether it's their characteristics or their appearance. Voices ain't bad for me at least. \n-Good level layout. For the most part, the levels are made well in a sense that going from point A to point B is not boring. Accompanied by the good controls, it's pretty fun to explore the areas of the game. Just don't get lost.\n-The game looks beautiful. It's nice to look at the environment because of how vivid and interesting they look.\n-Mods can be implemented. The good thing about this is that aside from appearance changes, it's possible to play different player made levels with their own unique functions which keeps the game from being stale. But as of now, it's still in beta so keep that in mind.\n\nNegatives:\n-The game feels short. I'm aware that the game isn't finished yet since I heard that there would be 2 more worlds and a co-op mode but as of now, it still managed to entertain but not that long.\n-Bugs and glitches. Though I encountered some, it doesn't make the game unplayable but it doesn't stop it from being annoying. At least the devs are constantly patching things out to remove them.\n-Some hats feel under-powered while some are too good. [spoiler]The final boss is easy because of the time stopping hat.[/spoiler]\n-From what I remember, the lighting has some small issues in a way on how they are placed/implemented.\n\nOverall the game is pretty good.

Children all over the country are subject to physical and sexual abuse, and most of the time it happens a lot closer to home than we would expect. Ninety percent of child sexual abuse victims know the perpetrator, and an astonishing 68% are abused by family members.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, some of the laws surrounding child sexual abuse and child marriage (or lack thereof) actually enable their practice. As a result, more than 200,000 children in the U.S. were married in the past 15 years alone. We often view child marriage as only being an issue in third-world countries, but in reality, it occurs right here in North America, too. Children as young as 10 have been married to far older adults, despite the legal requirement to wed being 18, or legal adulthood, nationwide.\n\nThis is because many states have \u201clegal loopholes\u201d that allow adults to marry children. Not all states are willing to provide statistics on this problem, and many have provided only some details rather than the full scope, so that 200,000 is likely far below the real number of American child brides and grooms.\n\nIn May of this year, the Republican governor of New Jersey declined an offer to sign a law that would have made New Jersey the first state to ban child marriage without exception. Many people probably assume that child marriage is illegal in the U.S., but the sad reality is that these loopholes allow children to get married at a very young age. In New Jersey alone, approximately 3,500 children were married between 1995 and 2012.\n\nThe governor claimed that signing the law would have \u201cconflicted with religious customs.\u201d Some of these loopholes include if the child has gotten pregnant or if the child receives parental consent. Can you imagine your parents arranging a marriage for you, prior to the age of 18? Yes, this is the reality for many people all over the world, but few realize this happens in America too. Alternatively, could you imagine getting pregnant at the young age of 13 and then being forced to wed? This is a terrifying reality for many victims of child marriage.\n\n207,468 minors are known to have been married in the U.S. between 2000 and 2015, but 10 states provided absolutely no data or inaccurate statistics on child marriage, so this number does not reflect the true scope of the issue. Of this number, most of the children were girls who were married to much older men, and many were as young as 13. Eighty-seven percent of these minors were girls, and although the majority were aged 16 or 17, many were much younger.\n\nAmongst the youngest to get married were three 10-year-old girls in Tennessee, who married men between the ages of 24 and 31. Another young boy was married at the age of 11 to a 27-year-old woman in the same state.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Tennessee; children as young as 12 were married in Alaska, Louisiana, and South Carolina, and 11 other states permit 13-year-old children to get married. Keep in mind that, in most of these cases, the minors were marrying older adults, not other minors. Only 14% of these minors were actually marrying other minors, but even still, is it really okay for a 17-year-old to marry a 13-year-old?\n\nAlthough most of them married adults no older than 30, in some cases, children were permitted to marry adults decades older than them. There was one case in Alabama where a 14-year-old girl married a 74-year-old man, and another in Idaho in which a 17-year-old married a 65-year-old man.\n\nLet\u2019s remember that, although most states recognize that sexual consent can be granted by those aged 16 to 18, a person can still be charged with statutory rape for having sex with a minor. Despite this, many states are granting children with marriage licenses, including minors who are much younger than 16.\n\nSenior Counsel for Policy and Strategy at Tahirih Justice Centre Jeanne Smoot explained that most of the children who get married as minors are those living in poverty. She stated: \u201cAlmost all the evidence indicates that girls in cities don\u2019t get married young, that girls from middle class or wealthy families, don\u2019t get married young. This is a rural phenomenon and it is a phenomenon of poverty.\u201d\n\nAn astonishing 27 states don\u2019t even have laws to set an \u201cage floor,\u201d meaning that no laws exist to establish the youngest age a minor can get married. Loopholes like this one are what allow minors to get married in the first place. The irony is that sexual abuse is \u201cillegal,\u201d yet the government is allowing minors to get married as young as 10 years old. What do these judges expect will occur in these marriages? This is not a way to protect these children, as child marriage can enable abuse and pedophilia.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that child marriage isn\u2019t just an issue in third-world countries. If we truly want to become leaders in this world and set the stage for other countries, we need to reflect that both in our laws and in our morals. Children deserve rights and protection, and this desperately needs to be reflected in our judiciary system.\n\nits a good game", "timestamp_created": 1511404409, "timestamp_updated": 1511404409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36902615": {"recommendationid": "36902615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041425968", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511404341}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, 5/7 adortable characters, story is heart warming, controls are exceptional.

Its wonderful both casually and as a speed game, you can easily beat everything in the game with your assortment of hats, your wallkicking, double jump and your dive and dive cancel. However the advanced movement options in this game lend it to also be run incredibly fast, sliding down hills to pick up speed, hitting the small window where you hit the ground and cancel your dive and shoot off with a burst of speed, the sprint hat and the level design, it all leads to wacky tricks and ways to navigate even the most seemingly linear levels. The music is absolutely captivating and has dominated my workout playlists for quite a while now, and most of the tracks in the game have official remixes that are just as excellent as the originals!! The characters are lovable and interesting and memorable, the conductor the snatcher and hat kid herself are very well ingrained in my mind. The graphics are good but not outstanding, they arent next gen crazy super realistic hyper textures, but it has that wonderful cell shaded charm that looks inviting and familiar, which does wonders combined with the games general atmosphere and charm. Howerver after updates there are still minor graphical glitches that can happen, and as said the graphics while they do have that nice appeal to them arent exactly anything new. The games length isnt all too loing in all honesty, I think my rushed playthorugh was maybe about 12 hours or so, but Ive since replayed the game and messed around with the community mods and tried speedrunning sections of the game, its just a genuienly fun time and I dont think Ive ever been happier with waiting for a game.", "timestamp_created": 1511394343, "timestamp_updated": 1511394343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36857561": {"recommendationid": "36857561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026286263", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508142254}, "language": "english", "review": "This game, though very short for what it is, it a heck of a lot of fun. It's a Kickstarter title in case you didn't know, but unlike a lot of the disaster scenarios that website produces, this game is a rousing success in that you can tell the developers were very careful in what they used their fixed budget on. The graphics, for instance, are simplistic, but stylized in a way that makes them vibrant and pleasing.

So much of it oozes charm...from its visuals, music, characters, story and gameplay. The game is from the perspective of a small child and as a result the world is framed in a sense of childhood wonder, everything in the game is so bizarre but it's such a delight to go through that you'll be looking forward to what the next chapter has instore.\n\nThe game controls so well, it'll be a challenge to find 3D platformer outside of Nintendo that controls better. The camera also isn't a problem as you have free control of it, this can make judging the distance between platforms much easier than a lot of others in the genre. There's so much variety to find in this game, it  changes the gameplay style every few missions but it never becomes an irritation, everything in this game is so well thought out and has a purpose. It never feels like it's trying to pad the game out.\n\nAs for performance, the games visuals can look outdated but the artstyle carries the game so well that I doubt many will find it a distraction. As a result even outdated gaming PCs so be able to run it with no problems, the options menu also helps as you can dial back settings for a smoother experience. I only have 2 main problems with the game; due to the age of the engine almost every update is 2GB, this can be quite tiresome after some time. The other is the length of the game, it took me about 10 hours to 100% the game. It's not a long game but thanks to free updates in the future and mod support I doubt the length of the game will be a problem for most people.\n\n3D platformers are now a niche genre so you don't see many being released but I'm glad that this game turned out to be one of the most entertaining platformers I've played in almost a decade.", "timestamp_created": 1511392100, "timestamp_updated": 1511392100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36849390": {"recommendationid": "36849390", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996606399", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512773777}, "language": "english", "review": "This would be where a long winded review would go, but one can only say \"play this game\" so many times in one review.", "timestamp_created": 1511392050, "timestamp_updated": 1511392050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36848462": {"recommendationid": "36848462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006048539", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511391587}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like mario 64  you will love this.

Taking inspiration from famous 3D platformers such as Super Mario Sunshine,  this game is a masterpiece of fun, fluid platforming. This mastery combined with the personality that has been imbued into every aspect of it, creates a game that is fun throughout\n\nBasically, you play as the adorable space faring Hat Kid, who has lost the fuel to her spaceship in a parking toll incident and now has to traverse the world to reacquire her fuel so she can fly home. During her travels she interacts a number of people on the planet, such as helping Moustache Girl in her war against the Mafia of Cooks, participating in a Bird Film Festival and signing contracts with fucking Satan.\n\nLevels are varied in objective, only the secret levels being a simple point A-B adventure. For example, in one level you work for my favourite character, the Conductor, on his Owl Express train to solve a murder mystery, and in a another you play a remastered version of Luigi\u2019s Mansion. The movement Hat Kid can use to traverse these levels is tight and it\u2019s basic to learn, hard to master nature makes for engaging platforming. \n\nAnd then there are the boss fights- Oh boy the boss fights. Never before did I think I would be fighting a TOILET OF DOOM to rock music in order to save the forest (A Hat in Time, sponsored by the National Forest foundation.) However, the bosses overall are teeny little bit too easy for my liking, the only difficulty being in figuring out what to do in certain battles, but the fun of the fights makes up for it. \n\nThe icing on the cake is the music; Pascal Michael Stiefel or Plasma3Music composed an excellent soundtrack that rivals Banjo Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country in amazingness. I don\u2019t really know how to describe the music in a way that does it justice, so go to the A Hat in Time official YouTube channel and have a listen. Just do it, you won\u2019t regret it.\n\nSo with all that in consideration; the characters, the levels, the music, my addiction - do I recommend a Hat in Time?

excuse the poor formating of this post please.\n\nA Hat in Time is one of those few games that come out every once and a great while, and remind me how in our modern world of loot boxes and DLC, we can still have great complete games come out. Hat in Time not only exceeded my expectations, it built new ones for me to use in the future when judging new titles.\n\nA Hat in Time is full of charm and all sorts of heart. This project was definitely a work of great passion from the devs, and for that I applaud them. Every level is bright, colorful, and unique, and the graphics and the wonderful music (props to composer) bring everything together to make this game a lovely jaunt. \n\nThe only thing involving Hat in Time that I didn't like is the length. I feel as if the game was so great that I almost wish the devs do DLC so I can enjoy the game for more time. They have said that there will be content updates as well, adding co-op play and more. I can't wait.\n\nIt's truly ashame that this game released so close to Super Mario Oddysey. If it had been released much earlier, it might have gotten the publicity and praise it deserves. \n\nThank you Gears for Breakfast for helping to bring 3D platformers back into the main stream.

Game. Is. Adorable.\n\nI went in to this game expecting an indie budget title with fairly loose controls, passable graphics, and gameplay just interesting enough for a 4 hour playtime tops. What I got was so much more than that I was blown away. Not only does this game do a great job of capturing that collectathon platformer feel of old, but it does so much to stand above and beyond that. It has its own ideas, its own feel and its own charm that make it shine on its own.\n\nI feel like the most important thing this game has is a great sense of world building. While it's 40 Time Pieces might seem small in comparison to Mario 64's 120 stars, Banjo-Kazooie's 100 Jiggies, or even Spyro 2's 64 Orbs, it's what you go through to collect these Time Pieces that make the game what it is. Every single Time Piece is its own story. Every last mission seems to have a plot connected to it. They'll take you through different sections of the level, introduce entirely new gameplay mechanics, captivate you with new characters, and charm you with all of the unique ideas this game is packed with.\n\nBecause of this the game never feels stale. You never feel like you're running through the same areas, repeating the same tasks, collecting things for the sake of collecting them. Every Time Piece is a joy to collect. From impressing millions of fans as a movie star, breaking into the Mafia's kitchen to fight the head chef, or even crawling your way through a mansion trying to hide from a surprisingly scary ghost, there's so much of this game you'll cherish and remember long after completing it.\n\nThe graphics are very cute overall. Worlds are huge and detailed with no noticible slowdown or struggle. The characters are well designed and memorable and while some corners have been cut in facial detail or animation, none of it ever detracts from the game's vivid, adorable style. The artwork that appears before every stage is another welcome addition to the game, looking stunning while lending even more charm and love to this game.\n\nThe controls are amazingly tight. Hat Kid moves exactly like you want her to. Turns and jumps never feel too floaty, special abilities are easy to cycle through and perform. Upgrades are easily equipped and never seem like a hassle to execute. Jumps and dives can be performed and cancelled out of with amazing percision. Everything from navigating Hat Kid's base to tackling the game's hardest platforming challenges never feel like the controls are holding you back. It's a welcome feeling in a genre full of hard to control indie titles.\n\nThe sound fits perfectly around the game's atmosphere, providing it with all sorts of adorable and fitting sound effects. For the most part, the voice acting is diverse and a great fit for the characters. Sound effects make collecting items, attacking enemies and interacting with the environments even more enjoyable (my favorite is hitting a friendly NPC and getting that squeeky toy sound). The music not only fits in well with the game's stages, but with the feel of the game and genre as a whole. I haven't caught myself humming any of the tunes personally, but certain songs like the beautiful Time Rift music, or the wonderfully Grant Kirkhope main lobby are a joy to listen to.\n\nThis game is oozing with charm and personality, but doesn't lean on it like a crutch. The gameplay, controls and mechanics hold up wonerfully on their own and it's nice to get a game like this that doesn't feel like you're sacrificing one poor aspect of the game to try and appreciate the others. While A Hat in Time isn't completely flawless, I'm struggling to think of any faults the game may have that's taken me out of the experience long enough to question loving this game.\n\nAny 3D Platforming fan should give this game a shot. If you're a fan of the older collectathons like Mario or Banjo, looking for another new experience similar to (and arguably better than) Yooka-Laylee, or just think the game looks adorable and you're sitting on the fence due to gameplay concerns, jump right in and give it a shot. A Hat in Time has clearly put the effort into every aspect, coming together for a solid package that's well worth a playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1511322329, "timestamp_updated": 1511322329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36686044": {"recommendationid": "36686044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272445308", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512937713}, "language": "english", "review": "Mind blowing gameplay and story... this is one of those games for me where i loved almsot every second of it\nalthough Chapter 3 is rather dark for a E10+ title", "timestamp_created": 1511311135, "timestamp_updated": 1511311274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36683721": {"recommendationid": "36683721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369663462", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 49, "last_played": 1514329408}, "language": "english", "review": "A hat in time is a nicely made game it's a great throw back to the nintendo 64 & the game cube as wall the down side to the game is that its a little to short but other then that it's a game that will remind you a lot of mario 64 the wind waker and even alot of mario odyssey hat girl can get new powers with new hats as well as up grades for them too the game is a lot of fun if you still like the old school 64 & game cube days this is your game", "timestamp_created": 1511299423, "timestamp_updated": 1511826978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36683490": {"recommendationid": "36683490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015863547", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510595527}, "language": "english", "review": "Great peckin' game tbqhf", "timestamp_created": 1511298549, "timestamp_updated": 1511298549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36681345": {"recommendationid": "36681345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044889958", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511993819}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you Gears for Breakfast, just thank you.", "timestamp_created": 1511290497, "timestamp_updated": 1511290497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36680516": {"recommendationid": "36680516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176744162", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513462126}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is perfect. amazing gamecube type vibe and gives the \"cute\" meaning to an entirely new level.\n\n\nthough, i wish some of the cut content was still in the game.\nlike the Bookstore, and Moon Jumper.", "timestamp_created": 1511287642, "timestamp_updated": 1511287642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36678266": {"recommendationid": "36678266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327547689", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511266423}, "language": "schinese", "review": "18.8\u5c0f\u65f6\u901a\u5173+\u5168\u65f6\u95f4\u788e\u7247\u6536\u96c6\uff01\n\u5c0f\u59d0\u59d0\u771f\u7684\u662f\u592a\uff01\u53ef\uff01\u7231\uff01\u4e86\uff01\n\u5438\u5c0f\u59d0\u59d0\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u4ec0\u4e48\u7406\u7531\u5417\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u624b\u611f\u4e00\u6d41\uff0c\u5173\u5361\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e5f\u5f88\u6709\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u840c\uff01\n\n\n\n\u8c01\u8981\u662f\u8bf4\u5c0f\u59d0\u59d0\u4e0d\u53ef\u7231\uff0c\u6211\u5c31...\u6211\u5c31......\u6211.........\n[spoiler] PECK NECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I can't exactly put my finger on what it is about it that makes me so happy, but I can try. I don't really leave reviews, but man, this game. While it lacks a bit of polish in some areas (a lot of it being worked on for some updates post-release, some already fixed) it makes up for all of it with the entire rest of the game.\n\nThe game oozes charm (in the least gross way possible) and the controls and platforming are tight and a load of fun. It's fun and responsive. Really just the result of what must amount to years of work and playtesting to get everything feeling good. I'm sure almost all players, be they new to 3D platformers or veterans of the genre, can easily pick up and have fun with the game. It teaches what you need to succeed, and there's plenty to challenge you if you let it.\n\nIn regards to the world and the design, it's [i]superb.[/i] Every character has just that. Character. Everyone's lively, fun, and sometimes chaotic. But it all feels like it belongs. There's never really anything that felt like it shouldn't have been there. While the story isn't extremely fleshed out with a tons of backstory and lore and such, I think the devs realized that, as a whole, it didn't really need to be. The world just needed feel fun and alive as you played. It's a platformer. You don't exactly stop and read hundreds of logs in a game like this. The witty dialogue along with great character and level design conveys all it needs to. The big, goofy, incompetent Mafia of Cooks. The timid Express Owls, snazzy Moon Penguins, and their loud, competitive bosses The Conductor and DJ Grooves. The Snatcher and all things spooky in his Subcon Forest. All of it comes together to give you something that's fun, varied, and interesting but that never really feels out of place.\n\nTo top it off, the developers are extremely friendly and active on forums and their discord and such. They respond to things like bug reports, questions, requests, etc. The game also has modding support (in beta as of this writing) that already has a bunch of neat little levels, custom hats and color schemes, and more. The devs have been helpful to players and modders alike to help keep this game alive, and I adore that. I can only imagine when workshop support fully releases that the surge in people will only mean more great content. This game has reinvigorated my interests in game design that I honestly thought I'd lost.\n\nNow I can't just gloss over the flaws. It has quite a few, however minor they may be. Visually, some character models seem a little off, but it's hard to put your finger on why most of the time, though this is rare. And, while it may be a style choice, the 2D facial expression system isn't super polished in my opinion, as it feels very static and lacks a lot of the expression you get from some of the voice actors. You can also sometimes see eyes or mouths overlapping in certain expressions and cutscenes. There's also voice acting for almost the entire game, but eerily missing from certain sections where you'd expect them most. I believe the devs said they're going to add some of those lines post release, but I'm not certain.\n\nI've also personally had some minor performance issues in certain sections of the game that I wouldn't expect given the seemingly non-demanding nature of the graphics. This on a somewhat more powerful machine sporting a GTX 1080 and plenty RAM. These instances happen rarely, but namely on Alpine Skyline (which seems to make sense given its open nature) and at the beginning of Subcon Forest when the walls of fire are still up. It's mostly fine later on in that level.\n\nRegardless, while these flaws are noticeable, they never truly seemed to detract from what the rest of the game had to offer. I'd notice them and just go, \"eh, oh well\" and continue my game. In times of less than optimal performance, I just dropped the graphics a bit to help stabilize the framerate. Yet the wonderful environments didn't really seem to lose any of their vibrancy and charm. Nothing truly stopped me from wanting the see the rest of the game.\n\nOh, and about my hours, it's not all game time. I have an extremely bad habit of forgetting to exit games when multitasking and leaving them on when I put my computer to sleep. While I've definitely spent more time than the average player in this game (I'm guessing 40 or 50-ish?), I'd say average hours would likely be around 8-14 depending on how much time you spend exploring and doing things, as well as if you decide to 100% the game, which isn't a chore like it may sound in other games.\n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b] An amazing little gem of a 3D platformer that hits a sweet spot that other recent attempts at revivals haven't managed. Cute, fun, witty, and just overall very charming, though with some minor bugs and flaws. You come for the tight, fun platforming and stay for the wonderful little world you've stumbled upon. And also the platforming again because it's still just as fun as when you started.\n\nDamn solid 9/10.

To start, the gameplay: Feels familiar to Super Mario 64 for me, the way the physics in the game along with how nice the controls feel is just something amazing (used a PS4 controller) and everything is very simplistic but you can do insane stuff with this. This is a game where almost everything can be done by sheer skill alone, there are things from the story that make things easier (as well as some that are necessary to progress) but you can get most things just by careful jumps and momentum. \n\nThe atmosphere feels alive, the music is very well done and complimented each area very well along with the remixed versions of the songs. The art style brings everything to life, it can appropriately set the tone with keeping the cutesy art style, the animations look very nice and gets extra points for matching characters so well. There's very small details that this game gets done and I would have definitely missed if I rushed through, this game is one where I actively took my time as it felt rewarding for exploring.\n\nThe story is very captivating as the main arc is there but you still feel intrigued with all the side characters and their stories. I should mention the voice acting in the game is amazing, each actor nailed their character and conveyed the humour very well. \n\nThis game should not be too difficult aside from a few parts for seasoned platformers, it has a fixed difficulty but there's a collectable that can make you die in 1-hit if you want to add more challenge which the game does reward. The bosses in the game suit each area very well with each having their own little gimmicks so each fight doesn't feel repetitive.\n\nThe only real downsides I have with this game is that there was a few areas where the game restricts the movement with certain walls and a few times where a very specific spot didn't work on one or two occasions. The other thing was I experienced 2 game crashes but they were minor and this game has a very good checkpoint system so I didn't really lose that much progress and for me 2 crashes in the time I played is very good.\n\nOverall in combination with the story, the art, animation, voice acting, gameplay, soundtrack, comes together and creates an experience which I won't forget any time soon. This sets a good example of what a 3D platformer should be like and I'm proud to give this game a 10/10, you should definitely buy this game and give it a chance to impress you.", "timestamp_created": 1511044250, "timestamp_updated": 1511044250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36608195": {"recommendationid": "36608195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004666957", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511696086}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is straight up amazing!

You probably don't care about my story, so I'll keep it short.\n\nFlaws :\n- controls take some time to get used to, especially if you're used to Mario. The controls are similar to these, but not identical, so until you have them down, you're going to land in a lava a few times,\n- the voice acting is not that good. Some voices are nice, others are below average. Apparently, people who backed the developpement voiced the game, so it's more an issue of fanservice than hiring professional,\n- a bit too short, and maybe too easy. The former is an issue, the latter is a matter of taste. Just be warned that it's not Super Meat Boy 3D.\n\nNow, for the good parts :\n- once you have the controls figured out, it's a real pleasure to jump around,\n- the levels are memorable, and every one of them is unique,\n- the musics are nice, some of them even good enough to be listened outside of the game,\n- you have numerous interactions that serve no gameplay purpose, but help you get immersed in the game,\n- the characters are charming, the protagonist's movement and poses constantly remind you that she's a kid and that she's (mostly) having fun,\n- the game is quite easy, so it fits for a relaxing afternoon or after a hard day of work.\nAnd finally, what I think is really important in a game like this : you, in most cases, have a way around obstacles. You can decide to go over it, to slide under it, or to go around it. It's something that I really liked. For example, in one time rift, there's a fence in the way. You're supposed to jump under it, and use the double jump to reach the platform. Instead of that, I jumped to the pylon supporting the fence, slided down until I was on the small platform supporting said pylon, then I walked around it, and from here, jumped to my goal.

Now, I know what you're thinking: \"It's a kickstarter game, it can't be good. It's just another example of devs who have half-heartedly made a game just to run away with the money.\" But, as someone who has 100% the game, collecting all Time pieces and unlocking the Steam achievements, I can gladly say that this is not another Yooka-Laylee which tries to sell it to you with obvious nostalgia pandering.

You really need to try it yourself if you wish take my word for it. Hat Girl feels amazing to move around, with very reponsive controls and a variety of movement options to really give you a chance to get creative on how you want to move from Point A to Point B. You're giving a double jump, a dive, wall running, triangle jump, you can cancel the dive, a speed boost when you time your dive on the group giving you extra momentum, a sprint which gives you a long jump. Each and every option beautifully transitioning into the other. Its simply super satisfying to move her around and I would go as far to say it's almost good as Mario. \n\n[b] Creative level design [/b] - Albeit, some more than others. This game has kept my attention through it's immense creativity. It has that Mario 64/Sunshine asthetic for some levels where it's just a world that changes depending on the mission objectives. However each world is a well made playground, every step of the way complimenting how Hat girl moves around. It just fun to just run around the world, sometimes straying off the path of the main goal to grab a few extra collectables or find a couple of secrets. For example: [spoiler] One moment you're playing a pseudo-stealth mission, then a murder mystery, then a speed running challenge to escape a train on the brink of destruction, to brief surival horror section [/spoiler] Each world simply breaths atmosphere, never once the level felt bland. I should also mention there are levels that are similar to the \"secret\" levels in Sunshine, for that standard, but fun platforming challenge for added variety.\n\n[b] Amazing Soundtrack [/b] - The sound track is simply great. Each song feeling wimsical to really bring out the sense of adventure. Also there's a unique track to every world, each being vibrant and lively to fit its surroundings. If you're curious, i'd recommend looking some of the tracks yourself.\n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n\n[b] The game is short [/b] - Just as the subject says, it's fairly short. There's 40 in total time pieces to collect with 25 being enough to reach the finale. In addition, i've 100% it in a mostly leisure pace in around 14 hours. This may break it for some who wish to have a longer expereince for a $30 price. I too wished the game was longer as I wanted to continue playing, however I must say that within those 14 hours, I have yet to met a dull moment. So take it as you will\n\n[b] It's fairly easy [/b] - Again, another deal breaker for some. The game plays pretty easy. There wasn't a moment in which I felt necessarily frustrated as it was mostly smooth sailing. You can make the game harder by equipping a badge that makes it so you have 1 health instead of 4, but that really doesn't excuse how easy this game was in its vanilla form. For those wishing for a challenging platformer, i'm sorry but this may be a bit disappointing for you in that department. However for those who just want a fun and sometimes challenging expereince, this game is for you. \n\n[b] \"The Indie Polish\" [/b] - This part is a bit subjective, so again, take it as you will. The game really has that indie polish in a negative sense. For instance, the faces look like images that weren't properly meshed onto their models and sometimes you can see the eyes clipping out of their head and other technical tidbits. This doesn't hinder gameplay in any sense, but it just leaves more to be desired, and I wish they fixed this.\n\n[h1] The Result [/h1] \n\nThe game, is fun. Not a moment in which I felt bored while playing this. I'd definately recommend to get this game if you are a fan of 3D mario games, or wish to have a fun platforming expereince.

The game's graphics are very pleasant to look at, and its artstyle appears detailess. but as with many games that have proven, they aren't required to have an engine with all the bales and whistles of  advanced physics and a weather system to look good. And it's cartoonish look has a one that can withstand the test of time very well. It's difficulty, which besides it's first world that wasn't on par with the others, I would say brought quite a challenge, with segments incorporating either  precision platforming or fighting to others segments bringing them both in harmony. The pacing in the game is a little inconsistent, with a couple of levels of the same daunting run of the mill tasks of ''go send all these letters to these dead spirits'' or ''go to all these points in the map to close the lava taps'', but otherwise the game doesn't have plenty of these levels. however, there are other levels which you'd feel really engrossed in them, and would give you quite a satisfaction and a challenge for completing them, that would feel more like an adventure. Of all the five chapters, I found the fourth one ''alpine skyline'' to have kept the game at its highs, with a couple of levels with a very good set of spectacle that fascinated me, and still attaining the quite challenging platforming combined with fighting. In addition, The game's also not lacking in its collectables and hidden levels to find with all the time pieces' wonders. Though, I found the hidden time rifts levels a bit easy, considerably for the type of these levels, which are usually not mandatory in many other platformers and serve rather as a bonus for you.  In this game these bonus levels are the hard to find type and not the easy to access ones  (e.g super Mario galaxy, and its bonus levels available through the menu). The controls are responsive and precise, and are of the type I've had hoped of a game of this calibre. I liked the route the game took with its storyline, in the way that it doesn't take itself too seriously, with the good dialogues that gave me a good chuckle.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the game has done a great job at living up to the classics platformers, and could manage to influence other developers, as a proof that the game's genre is still relevant and fun.

The gameplay is outstanding and it reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine mixed with Banjo Kazooie. The different worlds are truly wonderful just to look around. The Time Rift segments are very fun as well and the asthetic to the Time Rift stage is just beautiful. The story is very charming and it almost makes me think of a Disney cartoon. The Hat mechanic is possibly on the best mechanics in a video game. The Hats that you get in the game can either help you run fast, brew some spells and destroy objects that are destructable, see platforms that you can either go through or walk on, and a hat that can turn you into ice that you can use in special platforms that can ricochet you to a spot that you can't reach. Later on in the game as well you get a grappling hook which really does come in handy. The soundtrack is also very outstanding my favorite song being You Contract Has Expired.

It was simply a joy to play, with consistently fun levels that never felt repetitive because of how incredibly distinct each of the four worlds were.  The main character is easy to control - and utterly adorable.\n\nIt's not perfect, of course, but considering the relatively low budget and small team working on it, it's an absolutely amazing feat.

A Hat in Time is a platformer that takes its inspiration from games like Super Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, and Psychonauts, and beats them at their own game.  You play as Hat Kid, a girl on a quest to recover the time-pieces that fuel her ship so she can return to her home.  The game is pretty light on story, but it serves as a good setup to send you to exotic locations and meet charming and funny characters.  The upbeat lightheartedness of the game is a refershing change of pace from what a lot of games have on offer these days.\n\nThe level design is brilliant and varied. Each chapter throws something new at you, so the gamplay never gets repetitive.  For example, in one act, you bounce around the rooftops of a sunny island town collecting tickets to open a safe.  In another, you're solving a murder on a train full of anthropomorphic owls and crows.  Later, you're playing cat and mouse with a spectre in a haunted house.  \n\nI love the artstyle.  It's cheerful and bright, matching the tone of the game perfectly.  The graphics are very well done, with lots of options in the menu, and the game runs great on my modest system.  My PC (Intel 3570k, GTX 770, 8GB RAM, Windows 7) was able to run it in 1080p at a steady 60fps with all settings on high or max.\n\nThe soundtrack is another winner.  I'm no music connoisseur, but I can't think of a single track (and there are many many tracks) that I thought was bad or didn't mesh with the game.  In fact, I've found myself whistling or humming several tracks from the game over the last week or so. \"Picture Perfect,\" \"Train Rush,\"  \"The Big Parade,\" and \"Alpine Skyline\" are a few of my personal favorites.  I went ahead and bought the soundtrack so I could stop burning through my mobile data on YouTube!\n\nAs to be expected in a platformer, the controls are great.  Your jumps, wall jumps, air dashes, etc. all feel precise and in the later levels it's second nature to string them togehter to get where you need to go.  You also receive several hats and hat pins that grant you abilities such as throwing bombs, grappling hooks, sprinting, and stopping time, to name just a few,  These abilities are necessary to progress through the levels and give you access to areas you couldn't reach in previous chapters.  \n\nMy only complaints about the game are fairly minor.  The camera could use some fine tuning, especially in Chapter 3.  90% of the time it's fine, but there were a few instances when I had to wrestle with it to see a jump from the angle I wanted to see it from, making it hard to judge distance / depth.  There were also times I couldn't see my shadow on a dark texture or in low lighting, making it hard to tell where I was going to land.  Some of the hats feel underused.  Particularly the time-stop hat.  You can use it as much as you want, but there are only a few situations where it's absoultely necessary to use it.  The ice hat lets you perform a ground pound, but you really only need it to launch yourself from springboards.  Hopefully these will get more use when the adidtional (free!) DLC chapters are released.\n\nOverall, A Hat in Time is a home run, and even more impressive when you consider that this was the developer's first game.  It's definitely in my top 10 favorite games since 2010, and anyone with even a passing interest in it should check it out.  I bought it shortly after release at full price ($30 USD) and got every cent worth of enjoyment out of it, with more to come, thanks to the Steam Workshop support and aforementioned DLC!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1510725709, "timestamp_updated": 1510725709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36524371": {"recommendationid": "36524371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077516047", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511679515}, "language": "english", "review": "If you haven't bought this game already, you should.

This game has some of the most charming, adorable traits that make you feel like you are not enjoying an adventure FOR a child, but an advanture made BY a child. The music, the level and character design and the many small details in animation that reflect the current situation is simply fantastic. The main character is a lovable bundle of childish energy and smiles that appeal to the natural instinct of humans when seeing a normal child. The enemies and NPCs are well designed and unique with memorable personalities. I loved just watching her express herself throughout her different missions because she feels so genuine.\n\nFinally, the story is so refreshing and authentic I could not help but smile and press on to see what new adventure she will have in the next chapter. In a game industry where grit and Skinner box gameplay allow for only generic and boring stories (Like Destiny 2) it is so wonderful to play a game with a nonsensical story that is just interesting and fun to follow. \n\nAll in all the gameplay is the weakest aspect of the game as it is only well executed. If the game was a bit more challenging and had a few more major characters to flesh out the worlds a bit then this game would easily be a contender for game of the year for me.

The game has charm, colorful vibe, a sense of humor, and outstanding artwork!  A Hat In Time is a game where you play a small girl simply named Hat Kid. You are a being from Space travling the galaxy trying to make your way home, when you are one day interupted by a Mafia Member from Mafia Town. He tries to get into your ship, and you two get caught up in a scuffle, landing you on their planet, losing all of your Time Pieces, and needing to get them all back!  Buckle up friends, because you do not want to miss this game!!\n\nGameplay\nA Hat In Time takes many inspirations from some of the finest platformers around, coming from Super Mario Sunshine, to Banjo Kazooe.  In the game, you have to platform to collect all sorts of Collectables, such as Time Pieces, Pons, Tokens, and more.  You travel to collect Hats and Stickers in the game to gain skills to progress further, and and even colors, so you can customize your look. The game is very open to customizing and trying new things, without faulting the player. You also have the ability to quick change Hats on the spot with LB to keep the pace moving. \n\nGraphics\nUsing the Unreal Engine, A Hat In Time has a very nice clean design that comes off a safe, yet beautiful. The backgrounds look amazing with their own animations running at all times, making them a joy to look at. The game is in 3D with no Cellshading or too much hardcore detail, hence, playing Safe, but it is by far not terrible to look at, and infact will leave you in a very comfy mood to play.\n\nSound\nThis is where it hits home. This is why I can't get enough of it. The sound is A+ material!   This might be one of the best soundtracks I've heard in gaming. Almost every track is well placed, and sounds just right. The boss tracks are fun, and get you pumped, the Time Warp area is soothing and relaxing, and Mafia Island gives you a feel like you are on vacation, and that's just a few to name off. I can't praise the sound department enough for this. You deseve all praise and all credit for your work!  Thank you for such a wonderful creative set!  I should also mention, the voice acting is not to bad either, and some of the characters are fun to listen to, and some, you may even recognize..... I hear you JonTron. ;)\n\nControls. \nControls work very well!  It might take some getting used to for a few moments, because adding to the usual platforming controls, you can climb walls as well.   My ONLY gripe, and I know it's always being updated with fixes, but I must mention, is the camera. The camera works well in a lot of places, but if you get into a small tight spot, it gets to be a pain, and can end of making you die at times. I hope this will be fixed more in the future. \n\nOverall\nOverall, A Hat In Time is the standard many platforms should take note from. It wasn't a heavily promoted title, but came up swinging hard, and to me in my opinion, knocked down titles like Yooka-Laylee, and while didn't kill, did step on the toes of Mario here. Hat Kid needs to become an icon in gaming. This is something that we need more of in platforming, and I can say, has been an outstanding experience!   While, i'm not finished with the game, I have seen enough to say that I want to see more, and want this to become a series and continue to shoot for the moon in quality like it did here.  If you love Platformers, you NEED this game.

Although compared to a lot of other games, 1-2$ an hour for a game is a hefty price. \nTheres a great scale that someone else used and it compares a 1$ taco to that price point. In my opinion, the experience while you're playing this game is well worth the 30 tacos and I doubt you would get nearly the same satisfaction with this amazing platformer as the tacos, although the time of playing the game is short, there will soon:tm: be mods for the game which will allow players to utilize this FANTASTIC game to make AMAZING LEVELS, the community seems to also think devs will make more levels in the future, if this is all true it becomes even more worth it, but as it stands today (Mafia world, Subcon forest, Dead Bird studios, Alpine peaks, final level) it still holds up very well.\n\n[h1] Exactly what is this game? [/h1]\n[b] The Good: [/b][list]\n[*][u]Tight controls.[/u]\n Never have I played a platformer to date where I've [u]felt more in control of the character[/u], the game is so fun to move around in, it would simply be worth it if it was only challenge levels to be quite honest\n[*][u]Cute as (heck).[/u]\n This one might seem like a minor thing to love, but you really have to trust me when I say that this game reaches an all time high of adorableness for the whole game in the best way possible, it gives the world so much flavour and really makes you want to play more than anything. unlike other cute games btw, you can actually beat up the baddies without feeling bad, and the last thing I want is a game judging me for my actions right now, it's so refreshing to just be able to play a game without having to worry about fighting against the game and the game dev to play how I want.\n[*][u]Freedom[/u]\n The game is so open for you to take in. You can complete the game with 25/40 of the hourglasses (comparable to stars in Mario 64) which allows you to mess around and do whatever you want, and play how you want, in fact it's such leeway that [u]you can completely skip levels if you think they're stupid[/u], like whole entire worlds. Theres so many ways to complete everything in the game too, the speedrun strats of this game are a ton of fun, but [u]thats not to even say that everything is mindlessly easy either[/u], in order to do a lot of the cooler things you should be thinking outside of the box and should have a good grasp on how to control your character.\nAll and all just makes for a free experience, you just play.... and you get to experience the game on your own terms.\n[/list]\n[b] The Bad: [/b][list]\n[*][u]Short.[/u]\n\n[*]also bad if you [u]hate cute stuff[/u].\n(monster)\n\n[*]also I'm very worried that this will become the new undertale, such a great game that will [u]likely be corrupted by a terrible fanbase[/u], I certainly hope that this doesnt happen here.\n[/list]\n[h1]So now the standard game rating:[/h1][list]\n[*][b]Story: 10/10[/b] (Full on story thats put into action and keeps you caring the entire time.)\n[*][b]Gameplay: 10/10 + \ud83c\udfae[/b] (induces weak knees due to the sheer pleasure you get from the controls and fluidity of the game)\n[*][b]Presentation: 10/10[/b] (??? does this really need that much explained? just take a look at the video up at the top of the page, and tell me that the game doesn't just look amazing.)\n[*][b]Soundtrack: 9/10[/b] (It's great, and it's amazing at times, but it just doesn't stick with you forever, which isn't bad, just not TOPTIER, you know what I mean?)\n[*][b]Replayability: 9/10[/b] (mods soon? new levels soon? actually anything will make this replayable, the controls and the whole base of the game is rock solid. Getting all the collectables is fun, getting all the achievements is fun, you don't have to grind and it somehow fills out the entire game with meaningful content anyway)\n\n[list][list][i]as a final note, this is the first game in a long time that I've enjoyed playing, it's sparked my flame of loving games again after this whole dull year.\n[list][list] -Zyga", "timestamp_created": 1510421630, "timestamp_updated": 1512404924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758961", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36448488": {"recommendationid": "36448488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146307317", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513011923}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good game, cute, fun with full voice acting and i highly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1510420026, "timestamp_updated": 1510420026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36448120": {"recommendationid": "36448120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301468917", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512762886}, "language": "english", "review": "I do recommend this game for the awesome art style, and the amazing gameplay.

Most likely to be my game of the year, maybe even the decade.\n\nA Hat in Time is a 3D platformer which draws inspiration from games like Super Mario Sunshine and the early Paper Mario titles.  It takes some noticable things from those games like the writing style and the slide move and also adds some things of its own, like the ability to climb up a wall for a short period before sliding down.  As the title would suggest, the game also sports six different hats with their own abilities to help you get around the levels.  On top of the hats, you can also have up to three different badges equipped at once, which all have either a passive or active effect, and are applied no matter what hat youre using.  The game controls are a bit floatier compared to Sunshine, but are ultimately alot smoother in the long run.  The game's level design is great, and offers a fair challenge in every stage.  The soundtrack for the game is very memorable, as each level will have its own tracks unique to it, instead of one theme for a world.  The game isnt that long if you're just trying to beat it (it took me roughly nine hours), but the experience is very enjoyable and memorable, which makes up for its short length.  I give A Hat in Time a 10/10, and I would highly reccomend it to anybody looking for a game that they will remember as fondly as their childhood games.", "timestamp_created": 1510324037, "timestamp_updated": 1510324037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36418804": {"recommendationid": "36418804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045249303", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1514392165}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego [b]imprescindible[/b] para todos los que le guste el g\u00e9nero.

It makes me so happy for so many reasons it's hard to know where to start. It is adorable, enjoyable, interesting, endlessly charming, and extremely nostalgic, in all the right ways.\n\nIt's way too common for developers to attempt to revive a nostalgic genre by exactly emulating the classic titles, qualities and flaws alike. Thankfully, the devs of A Hat in Time were smarter than that: they took the 3D platformer collect-a-thon genre, took away many of the annoying things that were characteristic to it, and delivered a lovable polished piece.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice, as you start the game, is that the music is absolutely awesome. It feels constantly fun and adventurous, with many awesome tunes that fit many different themes with something of a child-like wonder to them. It's awesome how the music changes depending on what part of a level you're in, with some instruments fading in or out, I love this kind of dynamic music. \n\nThe sound effects that accompany the soundtrack are also excellent. Adorable childish interjections, some cute short sentences like \"you're free!\" or \"all mine\" that make you go \"aww <3\", some ambient sounds at times that range from soothing to creepy and, of course, satisfying \"slam\" and explosion sound effects for combat. The voice acting is also awesome, with every character full of this caricaturesque charm and personality that I simply adore. I particularly love Mustache Girl's voice, it's equal parts rebellious and adorable.\n\nWhich brings us to the graphics, and oh boy, this game is teeming with charm in there as well. First of all, there are the characters. Hat Kid is head-exploding levels of adorable, with her silly face, cutesy outfit, precious idle animations, and a fine selection of hats. Every other character is just as cool: you get some awesomely funny mafia thugs, an adorably energetic Mustache Girl, stylish musical penguins, western train riding owls, an evil demonic queen, some cute mountain dwellers, and many other sweet, sweet characters.\n\nThe sceneries are also full of that same charm the characters have. Starting with the adorable spaceship that looks like a mix between a proper spaceship and a child's playground, moving to a very colorful town of mafia thugs, a busy and secretive movie studio, a mysterious train, a happy musical moon city, an awesomely dark and creepy forest full of bizarre things, a haunted mansion, a lovely mountain range full of villages and bushes with a wide variety of landscapes, and the absolutely foreboding final dungeon that is very... foreboding, every level has a cartoony thematic style.\n\nThen, of course, there's the game. The controls are deliciously fluid, it's so fun and satisfying to just run and jump around, and the camera works great as well, which is rare in 3D platformers (in fact, the devs took camera development to a level many AAA games don't take). There's a great variety of special powers you can equip Hat Kid with which apply to many different situations, giving the game a bit of a \"key and keyhole\" aspect while providing the player with a plethora of options on how to solve a problem.\n\nNo collect-a-thon is complete without collectibles, right? The collectibles in this game come in five main types: the yarns, which are used to knit hats, the relics, that unlock certain special stages, the rift tokens that operate this crazy slot machine that gives out pretty cool cosmetic prizes, and, of course, the Time Pieces, this game's main collectible (like puzzle pieces in Banjo-Kazooie or stars in Super Mario 64). There are also badges you can buy (and sometimes find) to give you all kinds of different skills, making pons (the game's currency) worth collecting, and inviting the player to try all kinds of different stuff. I particularly adore the one that gives Hat Kid a little scooter (it's so, so adorable how Hat Kid just dangles her little feet when she's on it).\n\nThen there's the level design. First of all, the platforming in every level is great, making worlds satisfying to jump around and explore, giving the player a selection of different paths to traverse. Even in the more linear levels, there are clever ways to skip sections if you're smart and quick enough. \n\nThis being a 3D collect-a-thon, most levels follow a \"semi-open\" structure where there's a handful of main objectives, but a lot of free range to run around looking for optional tokens and collectibles. Mafia Town is perfectly representative of that, with a ton of things to collect around town right away, even as you're just starting the game, headed towards your first Time Piece through the convoluted landscape of square buildings and giant-meat-rolling streets. Subcon Forest is probably my favorite, due to the amount of optional sections full of stuff to find, combined with the sweet, sweet dark atmosphere that I'm just in love with. Alpine Skyline is an awesome level overall, but it kinda falls short of its main promise: it promises us a free roaming experience, but in practice it's pretty much a glorified hub world, with a decent amount of things to explore, but with every time piece clearly contained in the \"dead ends\" of the paths, in which there are \"tiny levels\" of their own (awesome tiny levels, but tiny levels nonetheless).\n\nIn Battle of the Birds, instead of giving us one large world to explore, the game gives us a series of tinier levels, each with their own themes and objectives. The first level involves infiltrating a movie studio and retrieving some Time Pieces that are being used as props. Then there's Murder in the Owl Express, where you need to gather clues and open up new paths by solving small puzzles to solve a murder mystery, and Train Rush, which is an intense linear race against the clock to get to the end. On the other side of things, there's Picture Perfect, where you have to explore a tiny moon city getting penguin people to become your fans and take pics of you, and The Big Parade, where you run around the same moon city, but this time with a crowd on ground level that hurts you if you touch them, with a band of birds that follow you around playing a very satisfying song (seriously, that song makes me so damn happy). In the end, you get to fight a boss depending on which set of levels you were the best at. Battle of the Birds is a pretty awesome change of style.\n\nThen there's the Time Rift levels, which come in two forms: the \"blue\" form, consisting of fun linear platforming challenges with a surreal atmosphere, and the \"purple\" forms, which have you traverse a sequence of interesting explorable mini-maps collecting \"rift pons\" and a set of pictures that tell a little story.\n\nThe final level is a linear challenge of epic proportions that's as hard as it is tense, culminating in an epic battle against your arch-nemesis. \n\nWhich brings us to bosses: the bosses in this game mostly follow the same formula of \"avoid attacks, wait for an opening, attack\", which is okay in my book. They are mostly fun, throwing deadly attacks and changing patterns as the battle intensifies, but they feel a bit redundant at times, taking way more hits than they should.\n\nFor a game in a genre that was born with consoles in mind, this game controls surprisingly well with keyboard and mouse. Accurately controlling the camera with the mouse while using the keyboard for movement feels so natural I'm impressed there weren't more 3D platformers for the PC back in the day.\n\nSo, to sum it all up, this game is awesome. It's full of heart, charm and enjoyment, bringing 3D platformers back with a cute as heck vengeance. It makes me so happy I can barely fit all my thoughts in this tiny review form. My only complaint is that the game is waaaay too short, unfortunately.

It is, however, the best platformer I've played in quite a long time, and as a veteran of \"ye olde golden age of 3D platformers of yore\", I want to review this game as fairly as I can.\nIf you're on the fence and are looking for the short answer of whether to get the game or not, the answer is yes, get it.\n\nA Hat in Time, as advertised, is indeed cute-as-heck, with Hat Kid being adorable and easy to fall in love with, despite knowing very little about her save that she's some space-faring alien kid trying to get home. The visual stylization is reminiscent of the games long passed that myself and many others are nostalgic of, but still establishes and maintains its own identity (also, despite the recommendation in the options, I suggest turning depth of field off to better view and appreciate the work that went into the scenery). Everything is bright and colorful without overdoing it, and the environments are fun to explore.\n\nThe controls feel tight and responsive, and the mouse and 'board controls feel good, despite not being able to re-map anything to other keys. They're not perfect though, and something as small as not being able to change the direction you're facing mid jump, despite being a minor complaint, can be annoying at times. And very much like the games AHiT pays homage to, some of the platforming in the game can be absolutely frustrating. This, unfortunately, is partly attributed to certain platforming mechanics (wall jumping in particular) being a little wonky at times, and not consistantly working the way you'd like. Despite all this, the controls handle very well, and the game starts to require some level of understanding and mastery of the various nuances moving throughout your environment entails, which is satisfying when you finally have the hang of things.\n\nThe game also requires a bit more skill and mastery over your character than its super-cutesy finish might make one think, with some levels, bosses and encounters being surprisingly difficult to overcome. The pacing feels just right though, and the eneny placement is logical and well established, with no real instances of wondering \"why is this thing even here?\". The hats and badges you acquire throughout the game maintain their usefulness, and nothing you pick up ever feels useless or pointless, with exception maybe to pons (the game's currency) and excess yarn if you go out of your way to get absolutely everything like I happened to do. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, and remains memorable even after putting the game down.\n\nWhile there are bugs in the game, they're few and far between, and none of them are game-breaking. The game is also woefully short, although additional content and a couple more chapters will be made available in the near future. And while I stand behind my statement that this game isn't the greatest platformer ever, I do share the sentiment that it does what it sets out to do and it does it right. It does it really well even. It only took a few hours of play to decide that the game, despite its current length and slight array of bugs and problems, was 100% worth the money, and I'm glad I decided to make the purchase. It really is a lot of fun to play.\n\nIt's an impressive piece of work, especially considering the size of the studio that produced it, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to platformer fans new and old alike.", "timestamp_created": 1510225827, "timestamp_updated": 1510225910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36392891": {"recommendationid": "36392891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040828497", "num_games_owned": 5167, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 242, "last_played": 1514321111}, "language": "english", "review": "My 14 hours of playtime wasn't recorded, but when this game was revealed years ago, I did not expect something to do what it set out to do so well.

Some moments the game just came together perfectly and I couldn't help but have a childish grin overcome my face, something that doesn't normally occur, mind you. Not to mention 2 more Chapters are coming for free to add to the already sweet package that is A Hat in Time.\n\nThe movement is just super slick and smooth and jumping around at speed just feels fine tuned to just be perfect, as you run up a wall and dive towards a platform and hit the landing perfectly to get a speed boost. It takes not too long to learn and feels clunky at first, but once you get it, it's butter smooth and just feels right.\n\nThe music is absolutely amazing, from booming low brass, snappy percussion rhythms, hard hitting metal, and dramatic giant orchestral chords.\n\nThere is a ton of art for loading screens a couple of other things that add that little extra to make it just slightly better bit by bit to an already amazing base.", "timestamp_created": 1510220092, "timestamp_updated": 1510223429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36392497": {"recommendationid": "36392497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192451703", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1514333391}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say?

The game is rich with content, interesting characters, beautiful levels and of course, an extremely fulfilling and satisfying plot/storyline. Combining all these, it's not hard to see why this game had $300K in kickstarter funding, from the original $20K goal.\n\nThe game advertises itself as a \"Cute-as-heck\" platformer, and boy, it sure lived up to it's and ny expectations. Every character is well designed, it is clear that the developers paid extreme attention to each character to the point that it's almost like they were each given human expressions that the players can actually feel.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of platformers, however, A hat in time had certainly caught my eyes, and with modding support, it had guarenteed it's own survival for a long time to come as community content will always be published. It might be selfish to compare this game to classics like super mario sunshine, super mario galaxy, etc, but i can safely put down my verdict, A hat in time has all the elements to withstand the test of time and I wish this game more success in the future as I, will continue being a supporter of this amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1510207210, "timestamp_updated": 1512545783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36387457": {"recommendationid": "36387457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068240127", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511247226}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10\nOne of my favorite games. Moving feels really good. I don't know how to describe it, but it feels intentional, and fluid, but you can stop when you want to. Its just really nice. The game has a multitude of very charming levels. It's the kind of polish and character that goes to an excessive end, where the a player speeding through will miss some details about characters that make the world more inviting. I guess the term I'd use is \"Nintendo Charm,\" which is weird, because it seems to deliver on \"Nintendo\" charm more than Nintendo's own Mario Odyssey. The best analogy is Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. \n\nSo the game controls well, and has a nice aesthetic, which are the only real requirements of a platformer. Some sections are fairly difficult, but most of the game can be skipped to finish it. The biggest complaint I have is that the main game is too short. There are only 40 levels, and most take around 15 minutes to finish and gather the collectibles, which leaves you at around 10 hours of game, assuming youre rushing from objective to objective without doing anything else. Some sections are much more difficult, and there are some places where I was looking for a collectible, and I just missed it in my first glance at an area, so it took me about 16 hours to beat the main game, 100%. The additional 5 hours on my profile are from the community created content made in the first month. I expect more, but I have not searched for them recently. \n\nTL;DR\n\nMovement, aesthetics, and challenge are good.

A Hat in Time gets an 4.5/5 from me.", "timestamp_created": 1510159789, "timestamp_updated": 1510159789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36378944": {"recommendationid": "36378944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043548545", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510155633}, "language": "english", "review": "It's games like this that remind you what \"fun\" really means.\n\nA Hat in Time is a kickstarted retro-revival 3D platformer in a similar vein to Yooka-Laylee. However, unlike that game, AHiT actually delivers on what it set out to acheive, and it does this not by riding on the coattails of its inspirations, but learning from them and creating something new and something very special. The most obvious inspiration here is Super Mario Sunshine, and that's most evident through the game's frankly incredible controls. Hat Kid, the protagonist, has a ridiculous amount of mobility in the form of double jumps, dashes, dives, wall runs, and much more that make simply moving around the levels an enjoyable experience in itself. There are numerous other unlockable abilities in the form of hats and badges, which gives the game a sense of real character progression and allows you to experiment with which powers you find most useful during gameplay. \n\nAnother aspect A Hat in Time has that gives it an edge over other similar platformers is its level/world design. There are only four worlds, but each world is completely unique in story, aesthetic, and mission design. The first world has a lot of verticality, and simple but fun platforming challenges allow you to learn the controls at your own pace. The second world takes a more story-driven approach, with a movie studio intrigue plot that bears similarities to something you might see in a Paper Mario game. The third world, probably the strongest overall, is a horror-themed plot that has you completing contracts to recover your soul from a demon, and contains one chapter so legitimately scary that I panicked and Alt-F4'd out of the game the first time I experienced it. I won't spoil the premise for the fourth world, since it was a pleasant surprise for me and I'd like it to be one for others as well. All these worlds contain interesting missions and subplots, and surprisingly difficult boss fights during the story's climactic moments. Some may complain that the game lacks focus or a central gameplay theme, but I think the variety adds a lot to the fun factor, and it kept me interested in what was in store next.\n\nAnother thing I can't fail to mention is the art and music. A Hat in Time is charming above all else, and the characters and environments certainly bring that home. Everything is very colorful and vibrant, and all the characters are extremely expressive. Hat Kid herself is the poster child (literally) for this, as her design is so adorable that found myself grinning during every scene in which she played a significant role. And as for the music... I would say that I enjoy video game music more than others, and more than should be deemed socially acceptable, and I can say that this game's soundtrack is absolutely stunning, in no small part because it has been touched by the hand of our god Grant Kirkhope.  Plasma3Music, with his help, have crafted perfectly fitting songs for every level and every boss that I find myself listening to even when not playing the game. There are even a bunch of unlockable remixes for songs that I enjoyed very much.\n\nI've completed all 40 levels of the game in just under 10 hours, but I don't regret a single penny of the $30 I spent on this game. It's easily one of the best games of the year, and a must-play for anyone who loves platformers or simply wants a fun, cute experience to get lost in.

I would say it's hard to make a game that accurately captures the spirit of a by-gone era/genre/theme, and successfully convey that to someone who knows the source material.  I had very little reference for how these kinds of games played, and I can say I enjoyed every second of it.  It just kept me going back for more!  I dusted off my old Gamecube and borrowed a friends Super Mario Sunshine just to get some more perspective.  A Hat in Time is just in simplest terms, charming.  To keep myself from rambling further, i'll just go into strengths and weaknesses.\n\nStrengths:\n1. Music- From the first theme, it'll pull you in and have you humming it later when you least expect it.\n2. The platforming- It has a very nice difficulty curve for those unused to actual platformers, like myself, but it can, and will throw complete curveballs at you if you're not paying attention.  And the almost perfect blend of all the different kinds of platforming abilities Hat Kid has to use in the final level is a great way to showcase what you've aquired and to poke at your mastery of the abilities themselves.  It's not without its... quirks, which I'll get into later.\n3. Characters-  I love every single one of these characters, both good guys and bad guys.  I can only recall a couple that I didn't particularly care for, (Looking at you, world 4) but none of them I hated.  \n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Glitches- Not actually its biggest problem, but I'm saving that for last so I can expand upon it.  Nothing game breaking here, unless you fall out of the map which did happen to me once.  It does get bothersome if it happens while you're trying to platform, making the quirks (like the wall jump not always clicking to the right surface) absolutely hilarious, or infuriating.\n2. Characters- Yep, both a strength and a weakness.  I love these characters, but at the same time, they don't feel as fleshed out or get as much screen time as they should, and that's because...\n3. It's a short game-  At 11ish hours in, I have all the Time Pieces, most of the yarn, all the relics, and went back for a couple of acheivements.  There's not really a whole lot here, which is a DAMN shame because what is here is interesting, colorful, and as the game says itself; cute as heck.  I never got a true sense of mastery over the different hats or the platforming until I was pretty much forced to by searching for the last remaining time pieces outside of the immediate story, which is where the real pros can pull off some pretty awesome platforming tricks.  \n\nTL;DR  With a bit more polish, and perhaps a new level or two for each world, you could have something really amazing here.

In that case, definitely get it, if you're even considering it you won't be disappointed.\n\nLong Version:\nThis game is near perfect, I can barely think of any flaws. But I'm gonna go over what makes it so great anyway.\n\nStory:\nThe story is actually surprisingly nice. Each world has it's own self-contained story, and they're all entertaining. Also the writing is hilarious.\n\nMusic:\nMost of the overworld themes are fairly forgettable, (besides Time Rift, which is beautiful) but the boss themes are some of the best I've heard, they really feel intense and fit the bosses perfectly.\n\nMovement:\nThis might control better than any other game I've played. It feels so fluid and satisfying. Hat Kid has a double jump and a mid-air dash (which you can cancel out of by jumping again). The dash really lends itself to some genius platforming. This game is made for speedrunning, and the dash compliments that perfectly. It allows you to completely skip some platforms, making things much quicker, and oh man its so satisfying to pull off.\n\nGraphics:\nThis game looks so good on max settings, I haven't seen what it looks like below that but man it's beautiful. The graphics are colorful and really set the mood for each area. Subcon Forest is dark with mostly dark colors, while Mafia Town is colorful and bright.\n\nBosses:\nI LOVE these bosses, they're all up there with some of my favorite video game bosses. Especially the main boss of Subcon Forest, which just bleeds personality.\n\nOverall, definitely get this game if you have any interest in it, I can only think of one flaw; it's too short, I just want to keep playing because the game is so much fun.

But I backed it on Kickstarter anyway (the only thing I ever have) because of the great art and the devs seemed to have their stuff together. And boy, did that turn out to be a good investment - I love this game!\n\nThe art, music, writing, and voice acting are all incredible, and fit together perfectly. The atmosphere reminds me most of Banjo-Kazooie, but really stands on its own. It's a great feel-good game (with the possible exception of one particularly spooky level) but avoids cliches and remains thoroughly entertaining and funny throughout the whole story.\n\nThe gameplay is just plain fun! The controls feel really tight, and the abilities and challenges are introduced at just the right pace - no mechanic feels overused, any every level has a nice balance of all of the mechanics unlocked so far. Some elements come back in later levels in fun, unexpected ways. Most importantly (in my opinion) for a platformer, it has a perfect difficulty curve. I'm no platforming veteran, yet I rarely found myself retrying something multiple times (mostly the boss fights, and never more than twice) and checkpoints are forgiving.

M\u00eame en ayant mis les configurations au minimal, il m'est souvent arriv\u00e9 d'avoir des baisses de framerates. Et il y a aussi un bug concernant les succ\u00e8s, ils ne se d\u00e9bloquent pas sur Mac. Autre chose, le jeu est un peu trop court: uniquement 4 chapitres, plus le 5\u00e8me qui est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 1 seul niveau, comptez une dizaine d'heures pour terminer le jeu sans chercher \u00e0 faire du 100% et en prenant son temps. Cependant, je ne crache pas compl\u00e8tement sur ce d\u00e9faut puisqu'une mise \u00e0 jour est pr\u00e9vue pour ajouter 2 chapitres suppl\u00e9mentaires et d'autres choses. Et enfin, la cam\u00e9ra, qui bien que correcte la majorit\u00e9 du temps, m'a jou\u00e9 de mauvais tours parfois dans certains moments cruciaux, du genre avant de sauter sur une autre plateforme, o\u00f9 elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de partir dans l'autre sens. \n\n\nMaintenant attaquons-nous \u00e0 la partie la plus importante qui est le jeu en lui-m\u00eame. Vous aimez Super Mario Sunshine ou Psychonauts? Vous serez servi. Les environnements sont tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9ables \u00e0 parcourir et sont vari\u00e9s, l'univers du jeu est attrayant, chaque monde m'a marqu\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente, de la ville des Mafieux cuisiniers \u00e0 la sinistre for\u00eat hant\u00e9e, (qui est de loin mon chapitre pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, l'explorer est un vrai r\u00e9gale) et les personnages sont tous attachants, voire m\u00eame avec un pass\u00e9 assez triste (ceux qui ont fait le jeu savent de qui je parle, je ne dirais pas son nom pour \u00e9viter le spoil). Les contr\u00f4les r\u00e9pondent tr\u00e8s bien, Hat Kid est nerveuse dans ses mouvements, bien que parfois, cela peut aussi conduire \u00e0 de l\u00e9gers soucis de contr\u00f4les; il m'est arriv\u00e9 plusieurs fois de mourir parce que HK n'arrivait pas \u00e0 grimper correctement les murs. Le gameplay reposant sur l'utilisation des chapeaux et de leurs diff\u00e9rentes capacit\u00e9s marchent tr\u00e8s bien, et sont tous tr\u00e8s fun \u00e0 utiliser (mention sp\u00e9ciale au Sprint Hat).\nEnfin, la bande son du jeu est juste excellente, j'ai aim\u00e9 toutes les tracks du jeu, et elles collent tr\u00e8s bien aux niveaux o\u00f9 elles sont entendues. \n\nEn conclusion, malgr\u00e9 les d\u00e9fauts que j'ai cit\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment j'ai ador\u00e9 ce jeu: je me suis amus\u00e9, j'ai ressenti ce fun que je ressentais en jouant aux jeux comme Super Mario Sunshine autrefois.

Gears for Breakfest is my heart and soul's savior right now. It brought back my life for Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Sunshine all in one package game. It took me apparoximately 10 hours, 25 minutes to beat this game while appreciating its beauty and not skipping cutscenes or dialogue. Either way, most of the game is gameplay anyways, cutscenes are short and descriptive, and honestly, some of them are so good, they don't need dialogue typically.\n\nThis is just a fantastic game, is what I'm saying.\n\nThe only thing I wouldn't reccomend doing is playing with a controler. It beats the purpouse of why this game is still currently a PC exclusive. It works far better with a keyboard and mouse if you have vsync turned off, and it will give you a way better experience as there arent that many controls to memorize.\n\nSo, pros and cons time.\n\nPros:\nGraphics are beautiful\nYou don't need a super powerful PC to run this game\nFantastic storyline\nEasy to use mechanics and controls\nIts freaking cute, ok? I admit it.\nBoop\n\nCons:\nOn the Alpine Skyline level, the hat can't track objectives correctly after getting the first two it marks. You need to find and complete pretty much everything else on your own until the last level of the chapter.\nSmall bug issues.\n\nThe cons are no match to the pros. This game is amazing. It also has the perfect amount of difficulty suitable for pretty much any player. I definitely wouldn't mind them adding a difficult change setting so you can have an even harder or easier experience, depending on the type of player you are.\n\nOverall, this is a great game, and I would reccomend upping the price of this game to $60. It's worth that much in my opinion (Please don't, prove that $30 games are good too)\n\nThis game is the easiest 10/10 I've ever given.\n\nThank you, Gears for Breakfest, for successfuly bringing back my childhood to an hd 23 inch monitor on PC.

If the cute style of the game dosn't catch your eye, then the fun and unique gameplay and level design that fits perfectly for an N64 platform game definatly well. While the N64 might not be powerful enough to process a game like this, if this was released during it's lifespan, it would be one the best games on the system.\nYou play as a little girl (she doesn't have a name so we just call her Hat Girl) who lives in outer space on a spaceship trying to get home, while suddenly the fuel for her ship (hourglasses) scatter around on the planet below after a freak accident, an now she has to go and get them back while meeting tons of memerable and wacky characters that happen to come across them. It starts' off weak, but the story get's more into detail the more you dive into it. The main character is super adorable and sweet and makes me want to give her a hug the more I play. She fit's all the criteria of an N64 mascot, and the characters that help her on her journey are suprisingly unforgetable. I just wish their was more information about them, especially Hat Girl. The clever writing and humor makes up for this though.\nWhile their isin't a whole lot of worlds to explore, the game makes up for it by making them huge, filled with collectables, npcs to interact with, and plenty of things to do to keep you busy. Through out the game you can create hats and find badges to help give Hat Girl special abilities and powerups, but most of them aren't necessary to beat the game so the game dosen't force you to keep exploring areas you've already been to. The amount of level verioty does add bits of sprinkles into the game so exploring different worlds isn't the only thing you do through out the whole game. One minute you could be an action movie star, while another you could be jumping around numerous platform sections that test's your skills, or you could be running away and hiding from a ghost while she stalkes and taunts you while your just a defenseless little girl, hiding from the scary monster tracking your every move. They're are also a handfull of bosses to, while they might not be the most challenging type, they may manage to kill you once or twice and they're pretty cool to look at. It's stuff like this that makes A Hat in Time a memerable and fun experience for me. I also loved the cute artwork that show's up during the loading screens it's so cute and makes it perfect for a cartoon show based on the story of the game. At least in my opinion.\nThe game isin't perfect though. Depending on the computer your using, your probably gonna find yourself tinkering with the settings just to get the best performance it could give you, which wouldn't be a bad thing if i hadn't had to do this every time i boot up the game. I also encountered a few screen glitches, but none of them were game breaking.\n\nOverall, this game is a must play for fans of the 3D platforming genre, or for those who has fond memories of Mario and Banjo-Kazooie. While I wish it was a bit longer and did a better job explaining the lore behind the main character. And probably did a better job on the presentation. developer Gears for Breakfast made a very successful example of what 3D platform games should be, and i really hope they make this game into a full fledge series with sequels, merchandise, and more. (Please get to work on that)\n\nPros:\nSuper kawaii.\nLovable main character.\ngreat platforming and level design.\nA simple yet overall enjoyable story.\nCaptures the feel of an N64 platformer perfectly.\nGreat writing and funny family-friendly humor.\nTons of things to do and collect.\n\nCons: \nSome performance issues.\nBugs.\n\noverall score: 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1509835649, "timestamp_updated": 1511732452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36282699": {"recommendationid": "36282699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068238649", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509624304}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic", "timestamp_created": 1509835628, "timestamp_updated": 1509835628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36282210": {"recommendationid": "36282210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063072595", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1514353994}, "language": "english", "review": "isn't it really nice to actually feel like you're controlling the character to do what you want\n\nbest game i've played in a while just buy it", "timestamp_created": 1509834006, "timestamp_updated": 1509834006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500471", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36282162": {"recommendationid": "36282162", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991780406", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509833364}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastically cute game that is inspired by SM64.

This is a Kickstarter game that was in a development for 5 years and promised to bring back the memories of classic 3D platformer games... No, come back, please! This one is actually good, I promise!\n\n*Ahem* So. It's surprisingly good. So far all content that the game offered me was great and it's one of the few games that I actually wanted to replay right after I completed it.\n\nIn this game you play as a girl whose name we don't know and is nicknamed Hat Kid. The game starts with you waking up on the spaceship on which you are flying back to your home. It uses hourglass thingies called time pieces as a fuel. On your way home you are flying past a planet from which a person who claimes to be a part of Mafia came to take a toll from you for passing over their town. Instead he manages to break the glass window on your ship and it results in losing all your time pieces as they fall on the planet and now you need to take them back so you could have enough fuel to fly back to your home.\n\nThe controls are good and tight. You have a variety of moves including a wall run, double jump and a dive which are pretty standart for a 3D platformer. You also have a variety of hats that have different abilities that help you to explore the levels. Also also, similar to Psychonauts you can buy and equip badges that add new abilities to your character or improve the abilites of the hats.\n\nThe game features 4 big worlds for you to explore (there are 5 worlds actually but the fifth one is just a bossfight) and they differ greatly in style and atmospere which helps to keep the game fresh and fun. For example, the first world named \"Mafia Town\" is a Mario Sunshine-esque world in which you are given the main objective you need to do but you can freely explore the map. The second world named Dead Bird Studio in which you are caught in battle between two movie directors that managed to get their hands on some time pieces is a more linear experience compared to the first world and so on. Each world also features bonus levels called \"Time Rifts\" which are pure platforming segments similar to Mario Sunshine. \n\nThe art style of this game is very good and cute, can't really say anything else about it.\n\nThe characters in this game are very good and memorable. You have the Mafia with thick russian accent who punch barrels who are dressed as old ladies to keep the town in fear, you have a scottish owl who likes to film western movies on his own train with innocent owls that just want to get to their destination on his train and a sassy penguin who is a former owner of night club who decided to film movies too, and many more.\n\nI also want to point out the voice acting in this game. It's one of the best I've heard in a game and it adds a lot of personality to the characters and makes them much better (you also have an option to turn off the voice acting if you do not like it). Voice actors did a really great job.\n\nThe music in this game is amazing. So far every piece of music the game offered me was a delight to my ears. The game musician really needs to get an extra credit for his work.\nHere's an example:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XUw1NxJS2k\n\nWhile there are a lot of good things in the game, there are some problems too. The game also brought back some cons from old platformers like strangely placed and fixed cameras which can mess with your view and thus it makes navigating the level harder, controls sometimes can be a wee bit wonky, some rough edges when it comes to graphics and animations and a story is a bit shallow in some places.\n\n[h1]Verdict.[/h1]\n\nA Hat in Time is a really good and solid game that managed to bring back the feeling of the classic platformers (and some problems) while mixing in some new stuff. I highly recommend to buy this game and try it out. For me this game was one the best gaming experiences (if not the best) I had in last couple of years and definitely my favorite game of 2017.", "timestamp_created": 1509795528, "timestamp_updated": 1509808760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631536", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36266807": {"recommendationid": "36266807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127179544", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509791841}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc815\ub9d0 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\uc804\uc5d0 \uc288\ud37c\ub9c8\ub9ac\uc624 64\ud560 \ub54c\uac00 \uc0dd\uac01\ub098\ub124\uc694.\ud2b9\ud788 \ucc55\ud1304\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub108\ubb34\ub098 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub4e4\uc5c8\uc5b4\uc694. \uc544\uc26c\uc6b4 \uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74 \ubd84\ub7c9\uc774\ub124\uc694. \ucc55\ud130 \uc591\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc694\uc18c\ub3c4 \ub9ce\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc544\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc544\uc26c\uc6cc\uc694.", "timestamp_created": 1509794691, "timestamp_updated": 1509794691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36266508": {"recommendationid": "36266508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208831084", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509983697}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u522b\u770b\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e86\u3002\u5feb\u53bb\u4e70\u3002\u987a\u4fbf\u6c42\u54ea\u4f4d\u5927\u4f6c\u5199\u4e2a\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u653b\u7565\u3002\u90fd\u662f\u79bb\u7ebf\u73a9\u7684\u8bf7\u65e0\u89c6\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f4\u3002       \u4e70\u4e86\u539f\u58f0\u5e26dlc\u4ee5\u540e\u97f3\u4e50\u6240\u5728\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u6709\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u7559\u8a00\u8bf4\u5728HatinTimeGame\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u6709\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u6709\u4eba\u77e5\u9053\u90a3\u662f\u5565\u5417\uff0c\u6ca1\u627e\u5230.....", "timestamp_created": 1509793651, "timestamp_updated": 1509805890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549280", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36264461": {"recommendationid": "36264461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003166979", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512035937}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not only a visually stunning game, but an extreme joy to play.

SM64 kicked it all off, Banjo-Kazooie brought the idea of hunting for items with much less linearity, we know the drill. Shame that they seem to be dying out now, replaced with boring old black, grey and brown shooters. A Hat In Time easily captures everything that was good about games like Sunshine, yet bolstered them further with brilliant gameplay and a charming design.\nFirst of all, I freaking love this game's cartoony art style. It fits the game amazingly well, and makes every world a treat to look at. The diverse colour pallette is on par with Nintendo themselves, giving us everything ranging from vibrant Mafia Town to the hilariously old-school Conductor's Train to the gloomy Subcon Forest. The visuals make the game pure eye candy. Calling it 'Cute As Heck' is a massive understatement.\nNext, the game is a blast to play. Hat Kid handles so well that every slip genuinely feels like your fault, and this game has probably the most cooperative camera I've ever seen in a 3D platformer, almost never screwing you over like Lakitu loved to do oh so many times in SM64. Hat Kid's moveset is beautifully diverse, giving you the run-of-the-mill basic platforming abilities like double jumps and Sunshine-esque dives, but they've been spiced with control. Hat Kid can run up walls she jumps onto, letting her pull off much longer jumps, and can cancel out of dives, meaning that you'll never overshoot your targets. Combat is surprisingly fun, giving Hat Kid an umbrella to beat the tar out of enemies with (or unleash huge lasers with if you're a Yuuka Kazami junkie like me and used the projectile badge the whole game) and pairing it with Sonic-style airborne homing attacks. Its hilarious to see a Mafia grunt block your brella swipes, only to recieve a bonk to the head and get all confused. Combine this with the brilliant hat abilities, ranging from the par for the course sprint hat (Bunny Hood flair when) to the useful Brewing Hat for chucking explosive potions at breakables and baddies alike, to the ridiculous Time Stop Hat, which literally slows time to a crawl (unfortunately, you don't get to beat people up with Za Warudo, but that's what Workshop support is for- did I mention Workshop support?) and you have an amazingly varied moveset that lets you deal with anything the game throws at you.\nThe stages themselves are brilliant. Dividing one world into stages is genius, as you can change each stage to fit. One level in Mafia Town, for example, has you covering yourself in mud to scare the bejeebus out of one of the Mafia until he gives you the Time Piece. Another level has you closing taps to curb a lava flow flooding the whole town, meaning you have to think about how to get to areas when your old routes are now full of child-melting lava. Battle Of The Birds has you solving a murder, getting attention from fans, defusing a bomb on a train, all sorts. And Don't even get me started on Subcon Forest. Bring spare underwear. Trust me.\nFinally, the music is incredible. Smaller/Indie game franchises always have good soundtracks, the main examples being Super Meat Boy, Undertale and Touhou. This is no execption. Every track fits the game's current setting like a glove, from the calm yet uneasy Mafia Town, to the old-movie-esque Murder on Owl Express, to the blood-pumping frenzy of [spoiler] Your Contract Has Expired [/spoiler] (go play the game and then come back), this game's soundtrack is utterly beautiful. I'm listening to it right now, in fact. As well as that, they put voice acting in this. And somehow, ITS ACTUALLY GOOD! With The Conductor's irritatingly likeable accent, to the goon voices of the Mafia, to a very welcome cameo of JonTron in the Dead Bird Studio receptionist (also, that doesn't make this game racist, for god's sake. Stop forcing your opinions onto everyone, you whiny SJWs)  it exhumes professional voice acting, and I utterly love it.\nI cannot praise this game enough. Where Yooka-Laylee tried (and failed) to re-imagine the Banjo-Kazooie style of platforming, A Hat In Time makes the perfect balance between exploration and linearity. There's usually one main path to the Time Piece, but you're free to explore the areas at your own pace. With all the hidden goodies scattered around the worlds, it's an explorer's paradise.\nThis game is a love letter to the days of the 3D platformer and I love it. I guarantee that you will too.

It's everything I ever loved about the Banjo games, Spyro, Mario 64, Mario Galaxy, etc. etc. It is an homage to the 3D platformer as a genre and will hopefully become every bit as influential and well known in this genre as Shovel Knight did for the 2D platformer. \n\n-Collectibles are satisfying to grab, meaningful, and never become tedious to find or collect\n-Controls are tight\n-Camera is responsive and helpful\n-Characters are quirky and delightful to interact with\n-Best portrayal of the Mafia I have ever seen\n-Game is neither too long or too short, it ends where it should and leaves you wanting more\n-Cutest game on Steam\n-Has fantastic Steam Workshop support, with fun mods, dyes, and worlds being made by the community\n\nThis game is an absolute delight. 10/10 plan to play again.", "timestamp_created": 1509676450, "timestamp_updated": 1509676450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36231026": {"recommendationid": "36231026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038933893", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509824653}, "language": "english", "review": "A Hat in Time is the perfect example of what good development and crowdfunding can do. \n\nI got seriously nothing negative to say about this game except I wish there were more levels to play on.

What really really amaze me is how well the platforming goes. Double jumping, wall climbing, responsive controlls without any input lag what so ever. Its just perfect if you ask me.\n\nI grew up with a lot of 3D Platformers and wasnt expecting to see a great one in 2017 but I was proven wrong.\nIt took me literally less than 1 Hour to start loving this game and that means something.\nI will never ever regret purchasing at the full price and I was silly enough to think I should grab this game on a Sale. Dont btw, grab it now. Help the devs and give them the credit they deserve for this amazing game.\nSoon they will come around with Free DLCs and perhaps a multiplayer coop experience.

What it offers is tight responsive platforming with different levels around every corner. It\u2019s problems never ruin the experience as the usual feeling of fun is overwhelming. A Hat In Time has challenging bosses and worlds worth exploring in a game you\u2019ll find hard to put down.\n\nIf you hate reading -  [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6FinCPOIRM] Youtube Review[/url]\n\n(Full Review Below)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKickstarted games have a history of not meeting expectations, from Mighty No. 9 to Yooka-Laylee. Thankfully this doesn\u2019t apply to A Hat In Time, a 3D Platformer taking inspiration from the Nintendo 64\u2019s greatest platformers. A Hat In Time differs as worlds share few similarities, feeling like it\u2019s unsure of what it truly wants to be. However, it also makes each world a uniquely different adventure, keeping it fresh and exciting as you never know what's next.\n\nThe game opens as Hat Kid wakes up to another day on her way home in her spaceship. Disaster soon strikes, as a man from the Mafia appears outside her window and demands she pay a toll as her ship is considered a boat. The window soon breaks as Hat Kid, alongside her 40 hourglasses which fuel the ship, falls from space. It\u2019s enough to give you a purpose and sets the tone for the game, an absurd adventure.\n\nA Hat In Time follows the Super Mario 64 formula with a hub world, in this case, a spaceship, connecting each of the game's worlds. It\u2019s a small area that feels too compact and lacking in detail like that of Peach\u2019s Castle or Isle Delfino. Locked worlds require hourglasses to progress, A Hat In Time\u2019s star equivalent.\n\nHats play a key part, as you\u2019d probably expect from a game called A Hat In Time, with each hat offering different abilities. The original hat points you to the level\u2019s objective, while the Witch hat allows you to throw explosive potions. Unlocking hats is done by finding yarn throughout the level then crafting the hat of your choice.\n\nAdditionally, some levels require green orbs to open, acting like notes from Banjo Kazooie. These orbs are easy to collect, are found everywhere, and seem to respawn as you return to a level. The orbs main purpose is to purchase badges. Badges are modifiers and abilities that can change many factors, such as a badge that makes you die in a single hit (for those who seek an additional challenge) or turn your sprint into a scooter.\n\nThe responsive and precise platforming is easily the greatest part of A Hat In Time as you double jump, leap forward, run up a wall and explore. The camera wasn\u2019t ever a focal point, as it adjusted throughout leaving platforming as the focus.\n\nEach world and level is varied, offering many different scenarios. Mafia Town is the first world you visit, which is a coastal village surrounding a volcano which holds up an Italian restaurant in the sky. It's formed from a chaotic combination that often feels like a mess of ideas that never quite fit together.\n\nThe second world is a Movie Studio and is an easy improvement, featuring 3 very distinct types of levels which all have vastly different goals, such as stealth focused level through a studio or a dangerous timed run through an exploding train. The Subcon Forest is a horror-themed world complete with a demon forcing contracts and a haunted mansion providing a sense of dread as you are hunted by a terrifying ghost.\n\nAlpine Skyline is unlike the rest of the game as it\u2019s a large connected world featuring a jaw-dropping opening as you fly through the clouds into the mountains above. Smaller sections found here feel like levels themselves as you ascend a windmill, or climb a lava covered \u201ccake\u201d.\n\nThe varied levels and worlds found in A Hat In Time show a mix of really great ideas and some that don\u2019t hit their mark. Every minute I spent in Alpine Skyline was a blast, feeling like a combination of everything good about 3d platformers. It was an adventure exploring the mountain peaks where each area took advantage of the mechanics and abilities, from riding across the skies using the Hookshot to exploring a mystical temple using a ghostly ability from a hat found in Subcon Forest.\u00a0Some levels had an uninteresting hook, such as in the Subcon forest you deliver mail or in the movie studio where you lead a parade. Luckily there are so many great levels that they don\u2019t take from what the game does well.\n\nBoss encounters are challenging, often requiring precision and patience to conquer. Generous checkpoints help avoid frustration as the fights are never over quickly, offering many phases and attacks to watch out for. Each fight is very different but each is visually identifiable when a boss is damageable by a blue glow, the game even references this fact during a boss fight.\n\nThe game also has hidden time rifts which are very similar to Super Mario Sunshine\u2019s \"secret\" levels, focusing on pure platforming. These are far easier then what Sunshine had, and aren\u2019t a requirement to complete the game. You are given a photo of the location where it's hidden before entering a level to find it. You better hope you remember where it is though, as the only way to see the photo is to go to the level select screen. They are never too hidden but can be frustrating if you simply forget where it was.\n\nA Hat In Time doesn\u2019t attempt to innovate or change the 3D Platformer. What it offers is tight responsive platforming with different levels around every corner. It\u2019s problems never ruin the experience as the usual feeling of fun is overwhelming. A Hat In Time has challenging bosses and worlds worth exploring in a game you\u2019ll find hard to put down.", "timestamp_created": 1509621487, "timestamp_updated": 1509621542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36212894": {"recommendationid": "36212894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106332639", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510585118}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is amazing, but way too damn short and not enough world to explore...", "timestamp_created": 1509615438, "timestamp_updated": 1509615438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36211853": {"recommendationid": "36211853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050672467", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509791020}, "language": "english", "review": "When I played a hat in time The last thing I was expecting was a fucking horror game But when I played queen Vannessa's manor You can forgive me for thinking it will be similar too the boo's mansion from the mario games but instead\nIt turns into a horror game and what's worse it's not mentioned anywhere that's horror game there is no hints that it was suddenly going to turn into a horror game it just happend out of the blue the scariest people you'll meet up until that point was a ghost jack-o-lantern who steals your soul and the guy who sells you badges and that's it no tags that says horror either!", "timestamp_created": 1509611094, "timestamp_updated": 1509611253, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.221063", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36210364": {"recommendationid": "36210364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047987407", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "last_played": 1514795700}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely adore this game, it delivers charm constantly, has amazing controls making it fun to just move around and with the mod support which is still in beta we can already see great stuff coming from the fans!

There is an item in the game that makes you a one hit kill to anything that also puts a dent on the abilities that are available to you, reminding you to always follow Cranky's medical perscription of GET GUD! The only complaint I can serve is while this game is beautiful, well built, and well thought out. I simply wish that it had been longer as to make the experience last, or even making a few more diverse characters as while you gave the illusion to a big world, there was alot of reused character models in this game, so if ever you do decide to make an expansion for this game (be it that you are going to serve it DLC style or just add it in an update) Id perhaps go by making more parts to the world or next world you develope as I feel that had you been given more time there would be so much more for us to experience.

Before I say anything, this is a good game. I liked it. I thought it was quite fun and had such a blast with the platforming mechanics. I definitely want to see more platformers with gameplay similar to this that just make it so fun to just... move. Seriously, it's so fun to just move Hat Kid around and it's so easy to jump from platform to platform. If you ever happen to miss and fall to your death, it's your own fault about 99.9% of the time.\n\nBut the reason I'm not recommending the game... at this time... is because it's just way too short and lacks a lot of... just... something. Like... it has 4 worlds plus one final Bowser level + boss fight. There are 40 collectable hourglasses in total, which are akin to Mario's collectable stars or Banjo-Kazooie's collectable jiggies. And you only need 25 of them in order to take on the final boss. 25 out of 40 hourglasses... that is not a big number. Not when you compare the number of collectable items within early 3D platformers like Super Mario 64's 120 stars... and 15 worlds as opposed to A Hat in Time's measely 4 worlds plus a final boss. Now, I'm not saying that a small indie studio like this should have double that... I'm not even saying that they should have had around the same number. But... I mean... they could have had quite a few more items to collect and levels to explore, even if there weren't 120 items within 15 levels. And it's possibly one of the easiest games I have ever gotten 100%. I usually never 100% games usually because there's just... so much to do in them. It would take ages. This is the opposite where it's just way too easy to 100% it because there's just not enough to do. Even the achievements are pretty easy to obtain... sure, there are some annoying ones to get such as getting through Dead Bird Studio without being seen at all. The point of view of those birds is a little... questionable at some points. HOW THE HECK DID YOU SEE ME FROM OVER THERE?! TIME TO RESTART... AGAIN! But that, aside, super easy to 100%.\n\nGameplay and shortness, aside, I also feel as though the 'story' wasn't fleshed out enough. Yes, yes, I know... it's a platformer. Stories tend to not be the best when it comes to platformers, but I would have still liked a bit more to it, you know? Like, I want to get to know the characters a bit more. Flesh them out a bit more and make them feel like actual people. Get to know them more. Feel for them. Mustache Girl seemed like she had an interesting story just waiting to surface, but it never came. You meet her a few times in Mafia Town and then... that's it. She disappears for the rest of the game until the very end. Wouldn't it have made sense for there to be a few moments in other worlds when Hat Kid and Mustache Girl would cross paths? Maybe some mini boss fights could take place during these moments. Or perhaps they could be, \"race to the hourglass,\" sort of moments where you have to race Mustache Girl to the hourglass or you fail and have to start it over. That could have also lended nicely to some extra worlds and it could have also added some variety to the missions you have to do. Variety was also kind of lacking since a lot of the missions were just, \"get to the end of this place to get an hourglass.\" And some of the missions that did change things up just seemed overly long just for the sake of trying to artificially extend gameplay, such as the parade with DJ Grooves. It just felt like it dragged on for way longer than it should have. At the very least, there should have been perhaps a special stage specifically designed for the parade. Maybe something similar to Conductor's exploding train stage where you have to follow a certain path to get to the end while also performing tricks and stunts on the way to your destination. I don't know. Anything but what was actually done for that particular stage. I will say, though, that I did love that depending on who won the movie award, they would become the villain you would have to fight at the end. That was genius.\n\nThat also kind of extends back to my, \"characters aren't fleshed out enough,\" complaint earlier. DJ Grooves and Conductor were great characters. Really charming. But they, too, weren't really fleshed out quite enough. I want to know more about their rivalry. Okay, yeah, I know that they were once friends and their rivalry started shortly after they both bought the same exact movie studio (how does that even happen?) but what... sparked it? And what sparked such heavy hatred for one or the other to want to steal an hourglass in order to rewind time and earn the rewards that they lost out on? I want to know. All the characters clearly have a lot of personality... they clearly have a lot of baggage that they wish to show us, but don't because... well... the game's super short and only has 4 worlds. I want to know more about Subcon Forest. Was it always so dark, creepy, and depressing? I'd love to know more about the soul taking demon. Was he always like that or did something push him in that direction? I think it was implied that he was Queen Vanessa's prince at one point. And if so, what exactly turned him into what he is now? And how did Queen Vanessa's jealousy and rage turn her into what she is now?\n\nSo many characters who deserve to be fleshed out more...\n\nAnd now, for cut content... now, I know that content tends to always be cut out in games. It doesn't matter what game it is, content will surely be cut out. But there's quite a bit of content that I feel should have definitely been left in that would have just added to the experience. At least I think it would have. Now, I never played the alpha or beta, so I don't know what ALL the cut content was (other than JonTron voicing a penguin that seemed to honestly fit him way more than what he voices in the final game) so I can't really speak for it all. What I have seen, though, seemed really interesting and it just disappoints me so much that it got removed. Such as... being able to dive underwater. It's such a small nitpick, but it's one nonetheless. I would have loved to be able to dive underwater. I know there isn't a water level in the game, so it wouldn't have really been too necessary, but it was still a feature I would have loved to have seen. There could have been collectables hidden in the water in levels that did contain water that could only be gotten if you dove for them. Maybe even make it so that you could only dive with a certain badge equipped.\n\nAnd speaking of badges, there seemed to be a pretty cool cut feature where you had to... craft badges, I believe, after finding the pieces on certain worlds? That seemed awesome and would have added even more to find! I love that. And there was a cut electric badge which seemed like it could have been useful and just added more to Hat Kid's arsenal.\nFinally, that cut Mafia race with you riding on a rocket seemed like a pretty awesome idea. Another way that variety could have been added instead of the race that was in the full game with the Mafia guy on the rocket while you raced him on foot.\nThat cut content may be super minor when compared to other pieces of cut content... I wouldn't know since, again, never played the alpha or beta. But it's still rather interesting cut content, nonetheless, and it's cut content that I would have loved to see in the full game. Definitely would have given more incentive to explore.\n\nBut like I said... the game's good. I like it for what it is. But I feel like it could be much better. And I definitely do not recommend it for its current $30 price tag. Maybe once it drops in price or after the free content DLC is added, my thoughts might change. But until then, I definitely don't recommend it at the current price. I do hope that they make a sequel, though, and possibly improve on everything that was already good in this game as well as adding a butt load of new stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1509598495, "timestamp_updated": 1510876623, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544082", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36206696": {"recommendationid": "36206696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147618307", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512245261}, "language": "english", "review": "This game, is the best game of all TIME, A Hat in Time, takes the movement everyone loves from super mario 64 and sunshine, combines it with fantastic voice acting and character, into one of the best 3D collectathons you will ever see.

Controlling Hat Kid feels great in almost every aspect, and in many cases my mistakes were my own. There is a certain...light jankiness to the game as a whole, as from time to time you see the seams in the level geometry, character models, and textures. But it's actually a well-designed game and it reminds me of Psychonauts in a lot of ways. Powers are implemented well into the core mechanics, and the bosses are all fun to fight, and a couple of them provide a decent challenge. It's all on the easy side of things overall, but it's a game that doesn't treat you like an idiot while also not ever ramping the difficulty to stupid levels. The characters in it are colorful and weird, but they have a sense of originality to them as well. Even each world's level progression behaves a little differently from the other, so there's a nice variety here.\n\nAnd the humor lands well in most cases, too. The second and third worlds in particular do a great job at creating a light-hearted tone. \n\nOh, and the game isn't super short, but it isn't exactly long. I vied for all of the time pieces in the game, and doing so on top of beating the game took me only 12 hours or so. I imagine that rushing through to the end would take only a handful of hours.\n\nAaaaaaaand it operates really well on my aging PC. Unreal Engine doing good work, for sure. You could probably run it easily on a wide range of systems.\n\nBut yeah, it's honestly a really fun game with a cute story.

The graphics are pretty good and the stylish cartoony look of the game is brilliant, the characters you meet on the way are memorable and unique, the voice acting is great overall and absolutely brilliant in chapter 2 and 3, the level design is great and never gets repetive, the gameplay is fast paced and fun to play and the soundtrack is just simply amazing.\n\nThe story isn't anything really advanced but it doesn't need to be, you only really need an excuse to get out there and collect your items needed for the 100% completion. But that doesn't mean that you should just ignore it because what little story there is is kinda cute and interesting and becomes better thanks to the colorful cast of characters you meet on the way. There are even collectibles hidden away in every chapters unique purple time rift that tells a short comic book story about what happened that makes the world in that chapter and the characters in it the way they are.\n\nWhat makes this game so much fun to play though must be the movement. Hat Kid has a big arsenal of movement abilities at her disposal and exploring each level is so much fun thanks to fluid the controls are and how fun it is to combo together moves to reach a certain platform with a collectible on it. What expands this even more is all the hats you can collect to unlock certain abilities that help you in fighting enemies or traverse the enviroment in new fun ways. There's the hat you begin the game with called the Kid's Hat and it gives you the ability to look at where you need to go in the level to progress, there's the Sprint Hat that gives you the ability to run even faster and jump farther to reach platforms you couldn't reach before, there's the Brewing Hat that gives you the ability to pull out an explosive potion that can destroy certain objects or do AOE damage on enemies, there's the Ice Hat that gives you the ability to use certain launch pad labeled with a Snow Flake icon to launch yourself to otherwise unreachable places, there's the Dweller Mask that makes certain transparent platforms solid so you can traverse them and there's the Time Stop Hat that temporarily stops time for you. You can tweak your gameplay experience a tiny bit more too with badges that you can buy that you put on your hat to give you certain abilities you either need to complete the game or just something to suit your fancy.\n\nNow so far it sounds like this game is nothing but perfect and it almost is but there are some few problems here and there that are noticable and can be annoying and the two biggest problems I had where some bugs and the camera. Now I don't know why the developers decided to be so restrictive with the camera because in other platformers I've played you pretty much get free range with what you can do with the camera, if I need to look above me to see what's up there I can in any other platformer but not in A Hat In Time for some reason. Several times I've run into that problem where I needed to look above to see what's up there but just not being able too because of the restrictive camera controls. If they would update the game to give the player more control over the camera I think a lot of people would get happy because that's something I just don't understand why it's not in the game. When it comes to the bugs it has for the most part not been that awful, the biggest one I had was a hardcrash to desktop early on in the game but thankfully that only happened once, other bugs I encountered were that some command prompts did not appear when they should have and resulting in me taking damage, the jumping around could sometimes be a little glitchy too and there are some times where I even ended up outside of the map. Thankfully all this happened rarely and my journey through this game was 99% of the time smooth as butter.\n\nAnother strange thing in this game is that most of the faces on the characters in the game don't have their face modeled on and instead the developers have plastered on a .PNG that hovers slight infront of their face. Now it looks fine most of the time but in certain angles from the side the face disappears and all you have left is a faceless model and sometimes the .PNG even clips through some things on the model. This is just a really minor complaint and really don't impact anything about the game. The last things I want to talk about that could have improved the game slightly more is that the game is really easy, I barely died in this game and when I did it was to either some bug or me just being lazy and seeing how quickly and recklessly I could complete the platforming session, and when you do die you don't even have to restart the level, you only need to retry from the last checkpoint most of the time which is also where you end up when you fall down from the platforming session. The bosses are pretty easy too but that doesn't mean they are bad, all of them have some gimmick you need to figure out to beat them and when you do figure it out it is fun but I think the bosses could still be slightly harder and not so forgiving when it comes to player mistakes. The last boss in the game is especially very easy and I was a bit disappointed with it overall. The other thing that could seriously benefit from a difficulty increase is the collecting in the game, the only thing you need to collect to get a 100% in the game are the Time Pieces which are very easy to get, you get one for every act you do in each chapter and if you complete every act in every chapter plus every time rift in each chapter you will get them all with minimum effort. Now compare this game to another game that I have completed to a 100% like Ty The Tasmanian Tiger 1 then you can see how really easy this game is, in Ty 1 you need to find over 300 hundred picture frames scattered around and hidden on every level, you need to get every Boomerang in the game, find all the Golden Cogs, save all the Bilbies and much much more. There's a lot of stuff to find and collect in that game and it takes some real effort and it feels super rewarding once you do it, a feeling that is sadly not here in A Hat In Time. Also some things in this game feels kinda out of place and that is blood that they decided would be appropriate in a few places and I mean FEW places, there's like two times blood is on the screen which feels weird thank to the games cartoony friendly aesthetic. Plus in one of the purple time warps in a hidden area there is a book that is called something like \"Good ethic reasons for capitalist consumption\" and it's followed by \"All the pages are blank\", now I don't know why there's socialist propaganda in my cartoony platformer collectathon game about a space traveling girl with magical hats but that definitely broke my immersion by reminding me of all the terrible things in this world.\n\nEven though I have some complaints about the game that I think could have improved the experience much more I still think that this game is really really phenomenal and worth your time and money, even on full asking price it's worth every cent and I don't regret my purchase at all. This game is definitely a contender for my game of the year award and I'm sure I'll play it again some day when they've added more content and fixed up the game more.\n\ntl;dr\nPositive:\n+Great gameplay\n+Colorful and nice graphics\n+Great characters\n+Great voice acting\n+Cute as all hell\n+Amazing soundtrack\n\nNegative:\n-Stiff and restrictive camera controls\n-Some unpolished bugs\n-Too easy\n-Could use better faces", "timestamp_created": 1509489535, "timestamp_updated": 1511393946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500428", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36177693": {"recommendationid": "36177693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011799043", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511145704}, "language": "english", "review": "One part mario sunshine, one part psychonauts, one part TTYD, and a whole lot of heart.

I purchased the Deluxe Edition, while it was still available, from the [url=http://hatintime.com/]A Hat in Time website[/url] in the early summer of 2017.  I purchased it early since the game was looking like something I'd really enjoy and to get the bonuses that were part of the Deluxe Edition. \n\n[b]Best played with a controller.[/b]\n\n[h1]The Good, the Bad and the Middle Ground[/h1]\n\n[b]Good[/b][list]\n[*]Story: the story suits the game well and there is enough balance to make it enjoyable.  There are parts and world settings that are more mature, making the game less kid friendly.\n[*]Exploring: exploring the worlds is fun and the worlds are different enough that they are each unique.\n[*]Characters: the characters are each unique and enjoyable. \n[*]Music: the music is great and suits the game and stages well.\n[*]Mature themes: the game has a number of story bits and settings that are more mature.  Nothing too mature, but not kid friendly.\n[*]3D Platforming: the platforming is done really well with the camera cooperating reasonably with your movements.\n[*]Controls: the controls are responsive.\n[*]Graphics: the graphics are enjoyable and suit the story and game well.\n[*]Voice Acting: all the voiced lines are well done.\n[*]Hats: the hats are each unique.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Middle Ground[/b][list]\n[*]Antagonist: the interactions you have with the main antagonist are quite limited.  I would've liked to have had more interactions with the main antagonist throughout the worlds, even if those interactions were small.\n[*]Badges: badges are added to hats to give little bonuses or added powers, in total you get 3 slots when you have the pins to add them.  Some of the powers, like hookshot, should have been added in a different way as to not have them take up a badge slot.  Perhaps the weapon could have had slots as well to power it up in different ways.  Overall, there aren't enough badges and the variety is somewhat limited.\n[*]Hub: the hub is fairly simple, which is great in my opinion (makes for quick navigation), but there is very limited things to do besides going to the different telescopes (world access).  I would've liked to have seen more interactions with the various characters in the hub.\n[*]Rift Tokens: through the game you collect rift tokens might are used to collect cosmetic variations of the hats, colours (change your outfit colour) and remixed soundtracks through a randomized roulette machine.  There are not enough of them in the game, unless you use the developer console, to acquire all the token rewards.  This was intentional as the developers are adding in more tokens through playing Steam Workshop mods (when available) and future DLCs.\n[*]Alpine Skyline: one of the worlds, Alpine Skyline, is a giant 3D platforming section that is divided out into small islands.  The world does have some variety in the platforming and what you're doing, but I would have liked to have seen completely different islands.  Examples could be downhill skiing, caves or a thick snowy forest.\n[*]Camera: the camera can be a little frustrating at times, nothing extremely bad, at least from what I found and put it through.\n[*]Non-voiced lines: there are lines that aren't voiced.  They are mostly fine, but it is somewhat odd when they are next to fully voiced dialogue.\n[/list] \n\nNothing in the Middle Ground is bad, just things I would like to see improved upon in sequels.\n\n[b]Bad[/b]\nNothing stood out as bad. \n\n[h1]Playtime[/h1]\nMy first playthrough is ~20 hours and included 100% completion, minus a handful of collectibles (yawn and rift tokens) that don't show up on the relic map and aren't apart of the completion status.  I'll be going back to do second playthrough soon.\n\n[h1]Rating[/h1]\nHighly recommended and well worth full price. \n\nI'll be picking up any future DLCs that are released and definitely any sequels.  \n\nThank you Gears for Breakfast for creating a great game.

First off, I'd like to say that I recommend this game with no reservations.

The achievements are, arguably, too easy to get. While they were by no means a cakewalk, the majority took half an hour or so of playtime to get. \n\nThe voice acting is somewhat low quality, although I'm putting this as a pro and a con because it adds to the overall experience in an amazing way.\n\nThe pros, unlike the cons, would take a very long time to list. \n-The aesthetic is one of the best I've seen\n-the atmosphere changes perfectly from area to area\n-there is a large amount of variation in environment and gameplay based on context. This is mainly in regards switching from parkour to fighting to swinging, but there is a noticeable amount of change.\n-the difficulty has a very good curve, while leaving potential to find difficulty even in the easy areas... strengthening replayability\n-the controls are very intuitive, and are a very nice mix in between snappy and forgiving. Basically, they're comfortable without handholding you, and you will always go where you tell the game to go.\n\nI had to search for the cons in this game.

[/h1]\n\nThis is without a doubt one of the best platformers I have ever played. Gears for Breakfast really delivered on this game and I can't wait to see what they do in the future! A Hat in Time offers simplistic, Banjo-Kazooie esque combat, smooth platforming, quirky characters, and cartoony, gorgeous worlds to explore and collect in. The game stars a nameless protagonist given the nickname Hat Kid by the devs as she is travelling back home on her weirdly, lined-shaped spaceship. After her spaceship slows down by an interesting-looking planet, either because the ship needs to cool down or plot, a member of the Mafia found on that same planet breaks in to her ship and accidentally releases all of her fuel (Time Pieces) out into space and then scattered on the interesting, Earth-like planet. Hat Kid must then go on a grand adventure to recover her missing Time Pieces and return home. Along the way she meets many interesting characters. From air-headed Mafia members to jazzy Moon Penguins to a soul-taking entity in the woods. They are all quirky and never fail to warm my heart and make me laugh uncontrollably. The areas Hat Kid travels through are all so unique, colorful, and filled with things to collect and places to explore. Collecting things in this game is similar to Banjo Kazooie, but not as grand and more simplified. A Hat In Time feels like Super Mario Galaxy, plays like Super Mario Sunshine and has many of the elements and dark humor of N64 era Rare platformers.

What\u2019s worth mentioning though is that this game is funny, well written, beautiful and it contains pure platforming awesomeness with a thigh,  precise and pixel-prefect controls. \n\nI Highly recommend this game and the grad of 9/10 is easy to hand out. \n", "timestamp_created": 1509286017, "timestamp_updated": 1509286017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36111611": {"recommendationid": "36111611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126352295", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 323, "last_played": 1514133152}, "language": "french", "review": "Malgr\u00e9s quelques glitchs pas tr\u00e9s d\u00e9rangeant (Lancer un niveau et constater que le personnage n'a plus d'animation) et sa courte dur\u00e9e.C'est un jeu chaleureux,parfaitement maniable.D'un level design et d'un gameplay d\u00e9licieux et vari\u00e9 ,tout pleins d'humour et de surprises !", "timestamp_created": 1509284432, "timestamp_updated": 1511784079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36107839": {"recommendationid": "36107839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050749385", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509274494}, "language": "english", "review": "Have your Lava Cake and eat it\n\nis the line that best describes A Hat in Time. It defies the genre that it's in, whilst also being a fantastic entry in it. It manages to give you both big open collectathon levels AND keep the experience linear and guided, tell interesting stories, and provide good boss fights. And when I say \"good boss fights\", I mean the [i]BEST[/i] bossfights the genre has ever seen! The kind you never think about when you hear the words \"3D platformer\".\n\nAnother thing you will notice immediately is that it does not hold back most of its movement abilities behind unlocks. Not by a long shot! The moment you start the first level, you have a double jump, which you can chain into a dive, which resets your double jump. Oh, and you also get parkour on walls, as a cherry on top. This immediate wealth of movement means you do not have to wait for collectables to make the game good. You can zip across rooftops, platforms, and enemies like a ninja mere minutes into the game, to the tune of great music and whimsy of a good sense of humor.\n\nThe only shortcoming that holds it back is that parts of it feel... unfinished. Where's the story and boss of level 4? Why is the last level so short? Why is it that most unlocks hardly ever get used as level mechanics? Oh, and no, there is no replay value in the base game - once you collect everything there's not much else to do.

Thankfully in A Hat in Time, this is not an issue, the game is very cleverly designed to the point that I never found myself lost, even after I went off the path to do my own exploring.\n\nNot only that but via the use of Hat kids\u2026..well\u2026.hat, you can instantly locate your objective at any time to get right back on track if you lose where you are meant to go!\n\nThe controls here are simply magnificent and very free-flowing, it\u2019s very easy to not only make very long and wide jumps easily, you can also do pinpoint precise jumps without ANY issue whatsoever.\n\nThis is only helped through the double jump and dive abilities too which give hat kid an insane level of control, that very few platformers can reach.\n\nOn top of her basic jumping moveset, Hat kid can also pull off a basic 3 hit combo to attack enemies, and perform a Sonic Adventure esque homing attack on nearby foes, though this is a little fiddly to perform correctly I feel.\n\nLittered throughout your adventure too you will usually come across Yarn balls, these will allow you to construct new hats to utilise, that all offer unique abilities and powers, for example you can get an ice cap to perform ground pound abilities, that also allow you to springboard from specific points in the world, or have a dwellers mask that makes transparent objects interactable for a few seconds for platforming challenges.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even getting into the badges you can buy from a very creepy glitchy looking fellow that offer gameplay modifiers such as item magnetism or the ability to fall far without taking damage.\n\nHell you even get a grappling hook later in the game for spider-man style action!\n\nThe presentation here is also absolutely top notch, with some FANTASTIC visuals that are reminiscent of the gamecube era of games, all the games dialogue voice acting, jokes and music are extremely amazing through and through.\n\nThe game clearly has a lot of love put into it here, with every single part simply oozing character, whether from the shady crows that ask for personal details in the Agatha Christie esque murder mystery level(yes you heard me right) or from simple things such as Hat Kid wearing an adorable raincoat in poor weather.\n\nI\u2019m not even going into the boss battles which I think it\u2019s safe to say, I think these are some of the best fights i\u2019ve ever seen in a 3D platformer!\n\nThere\u2019s even a number of Raw platforming challenges in the form or \u201cTime Rifts\u201d littered about that offer challenges very much like the fluddless challenges from Super Mario Sunshine which are all an absolute blast to play!\n\nSadly the game isn\u2019t perfect, there are occasional camera issues to be found here and there (much like most platformers tbh), and sometimes Hat Kids little climbing ability can get stuck on certain objects from time to time, plus the homing attack issue I mentioned earlier in the review...but in the grand scheme of the game, these are very minor niggles at worst and really don\u2019t affect my experience all that much in the grand scheme of things!\n\nUltimately A Hat in Time is without a doubt one of the greatest platforming titles I have ever played, and a game I think that any platforming fan simply owes themselves to play through!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRANK A\n\nPros:\nAdorable\nExtremely fun\nDat Presentation\n\nCons:\nFiddly Homing Attack\nMinor camera hiccups", "timestamp_created": 1509273529, "timestamp_updated": 1509273583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36106494": {"recommendationid": "36106494", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977300652", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509272941}, "language": "german", "review": "Der beste Nachfolger im Sinne von Super Mario 64.

It can be completed in about a day or two if one were to sit down and mainline it, longer if they go after the bonuses. $30 might be a bit much to ask for with its short span, but anything less would be a bargain.\n\n[b]Longer Sumary:[/b] Hat in time is a platformer game that sees its roots from platformers of similar Genre's such as Psychonauts. It follows a young girl often referredd to as just 'kid' who, after a run-in with the mafia; has her fuel scattered across the planet. Time-altering hourglasses, making your journey to recover them and the people you meet along the way. A girl with a mustache, a possessive contract demon. Even two warring 'bird' movie directors.\n\n[b]Bullet Points.[/b]\n------------------------------------\n[b]+[/b] Incredible soundtrack. Boss music sounds energized and upbeat, stages fit their music thematically. And even through challenge stage prizes you can earn remixed versions of songs you can have play instead.\n\n[b]+[/b] Adorable artwork. Each of the stage Act's come with their own splash artwork that portrays Hat kid and her situation in appealing light. This shows up especially in Chapter 2, I'd like to believe.\n\n[b]+[/b] Level Variety. Chapter one gives you the sense that things are going to be open-world hunts similar to how Super Mario Sunshine may have done, but later on the type of game each stage illustrates changes that fact dramatically. Chapter 2 has sidescroller segments, Chapter 3 has a hide-and-seek Clock tower Horror segment. And so on.\n\n[b]+[/b] Extensive mod support. Coming from modded routes, the devs havee every intention to let one create and insert content for just about everything available in the game. Levels, hats, color palettes, you name it.\n\n[b]+[/b] Great subtext humor. \"THIS IS INSULTING! IM GONNA SUE!\" and many other comedic bits exist in things in all stages as well as your ship, providing comedic quirks that'll get a chuckle or two out of most.\n\nHowever, there are a few nitpicks.\n\n[b]-[/b] Performance. While the game does have fantastic settings options - enough to make even people on an awful HD3000 like me - run the game playable, some places can't quite escape the framerate drops. VFX in Chapter's 2 and 3 were especially bad at this, resulting me having to take some serious measures to get playable framerates for important boss fights.\n\n[b]-[/b] Controls. While sharp and responsive, they can also be deemed the most hindering example for when wall climbing/jumping. Numerous times have I died in a challenge run because the wall that I was auto-jumping on top of was instead hurdled over with too much zeal. Unless you can train yourself to stop touching the movement as you're making the hop, you will [b]die[/b] nine out of ten times.\n\n[b]-[/b] Hitboxes. While on the topic, hitboxes for certain things such as tightropes can be a bit nitpicky. Sometimes you land on them from a meter away, and sometimes they'll ignore you entirely screwing up your whole flow. There's also an occasion where people with abyssmal FPS (7-15) will have pickups bugged, making you need to pause and unpause the game to make them valid for picking up.\n\n[b]-[/b] Short. Regrettably, with five chapters and a 25 (of 40) hourglass minimum to complete the game. It won't take you much longer than me (About 6-8 hours) to complete the game if you aren't trying to shoot for absolutely everything everywhere. Atleast more content is planned!\n\n[b]OVERALL:[/b] Hat in Time is definitely worth the money if you can't wait for a sale - if it is on sale, there's literally no reason to not get it if you enjoy platformers such as Psychonauts or Mario Sunshine.", "timestamp_created": 1509221042, "timestamp_updated": 1509221131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36087702": {"recommendationid": "36087702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102024521", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509911093}, "language": "spanish", "review": "(Una review en espa\u00f1ol para variar)\nDespues de 20 hs y haber sacado todos los logros, finalmente puedo hacer una mini review:\nA hat in time es uno de los mejores juegos indies del 2017.\n[u]Historia[/u]\nUsas a esta chica \"hat kid\" (ya que su verdadero nombre nunca se revela) que a pesar de verse como una ni\u00f1a normal, es en realidad una alien, que realizaba un viaje a su hogar, en su nave, cuyo combustible (por alguna razon) son relojes de arena magicos, y por X motivos termina sufriendo un accidente que termina con todos sus relojes perdidos en ese planeta, de ahi en mas comienza toda la aventura recorriendo ese mundo bastante extra\u00f1o.\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nSi tenes mas de 20 a\u00f1os recordaras cualquier juego plataformero 3d de finales de los 90 y comienzos del 2000, basicamente AHIT es eso, como muchos lo comparan con Banjo-Kazooie o hasta los mario 3d de esa epoca (64/sunshine) y no es mala comparacion por que es verdad, los controles son perfectos, ni muy sensibles  ni muy toscos, manejar a hat kid es totalmente comodo, y otro de los puntos principales en la jugabilidad, son los sombreros que vas desbloqueando a medida que avanzas en el juego, que otorgan diferentes habilidades clave para poder avanzar en algunas partes, y tambien a estos sombreros se les equipan parches/insignias que otorgan habilidades extras tanto a algunos sombreros como a hat kid (van desde cosas simples como hacerte correr rapido, lanzar pociones o cosas mas bizarras como convertirte en una estatua de hielo o detener el tiempo), y por ultimo el juego es poco lineal ya que varios capitulos se desarrollan en mundos gigantes, donde se te da la opcion de que hacer primero sin que afecte a los otros capitulos del juego.\n[u]Graficos[/u]\nDecentes (no quiero decir que sean malos pero tampoco son espectaculares), totalmente estilo \"cartoon\" coloridos, con varios efectos que le dan mas vida a todo el ambiente, cada mundo tiene una ambientacion totalmente diferente al anterior, desde una ciudad en una isla con playas y brillante sol, hasta un bosque tetrico lleno de diversos monstruos y fantasmas, cabe resaltar que el juego permite una gran variedad en la configuracion grafica, para ayudar a cualquiera con pc de gama baja.\n[u]Musica[/u]\nMuy buen reportorio de musica, totalmente variada, no puedo juzgar mucho desde este aspecto ya que no tengo gran conocimiento, pero puedo decir que es de esos juegos donde el ost no te aburre, muchas melodias pegajosas, y siempre ayudan para la ambientacion de cada nivel, desde musica totalmente alegre y festiva, hasta musica tetrica sacada de algun juego de horror.\n[b]En resumen[/b],vale la pena 30 dls? no sabria decirlo con seguridad, la duracion del juego reuniendo la mayoria de coleccionables y sacando todos los logros no es mas de 15 o 17 hs, si te gustan los plataformeros 3d bien hechos y con un buen dise\u00f1o de personajes y su mundo en general, vale la pena, pero si con eso no te alcanza o tenes dudas, espera a alguna de las rebajas de steam, puedo decir que por 20 dls el juego es totalmente recomendable.

Also I'm updating the review so that I can get the steam awards stuff.\n\nTl,dr;\nThis game is fun. You should get this game. It's fun, satisfying, and just charming in every aspect of the word. I want more. (This is basically every review out there reworded like you do with a High School  history essay.) \n\nFor Funny Points and so when you actually do play the game you can laugh at this:\n\nI once had a friend. This mafia guy warned me about her, but I thought she was chill. Then time broke. The end. \n\nActual review:\n\nI would buy this game 3 times over if I could, no scratch that 4. \n\nBasic Summary:\n     You play as the adorable Hat Girl (yes that is her name, there's really nothing else to it) going around Super Mario Sunshine/64 style collecting the main collectable of the game, Time Pieces. If you're even considering buying this game you should've known that by now. If you even have seen one review you would know that this game is by far one of the most cutesy/charming 3D platforms out there, and you can tell Gears for Breakfast put so much damn love into this game it almost is like it was their own child. Now onto a basic Pro's and Con's List.\n\nPro:\n- Art Style (and yes that is my own objective opinion)\n- Hat Girl is the most satisfying thing to control ever, it's like a combination of the best parts of 3D Sonic (being the homing attack she has), and the movement control of 64/Sunshine Mario. The moveset is also very forgiving and quick to pick up; you can probably learn the entire control scheme on a controler within minutes of playing the game. \n  - She might even be more satsifying to control than Mario in Super Mario Oddesy (which is a \n    really bold statement but her moveset is simpler so it could just be the symplicity over the \n    variety and motion based commands of Mario)\n- Level Design is fun, and is very clear and consise when it wants to be, or open and free when it lets you. The levels also don't feel copy-pasted, and each protrays it's theme very well so I never get bored going to different areas.\n- Grant Kirkhope and Plasma3Music are wonderful composers and really have brought a lot of life into this world through the sounds, I cannot tell you how much I've just listened to the soundtrack in a level over and over again.\n- Tons of little dialoge and actions that really just bring life to the world. It's so refreshing to find little tiny details everywhere.\n- Speedrunning stuff is accsessable and really satisfying due to the simple control scheme that can be used to do more complex manuvers.\n- Active modding community makes it so that the game, even when you beat it 100%, will never become dull.\n- Did I mention cute characters? I think I did. They're cute, and have good interactions.\n\nNeutral Points:\n- Voice Acting is kinda a mixed bag, you go from annoying girl to really funny and enthusastic soul stealing ghost. But if you don't want Voice Acting you could always buy the plug your ear's badge or just turn off the volume for character voices.\n\nNegative (more like nitpicking) Points:\n- Some animations aren't really that polished as they could be (i.e. theres one scene when Hat Girl closes her eyes and you can still see her eyes in the eyelid).\n- Hats overall feel somewhat gimicky (besides the speed hat, which actually is quite nice) and somewhat hinder fluidity from time to time. Other times it's perfectly fine though because they serve the purpose of blocking off a section until you have propper equipment. [spoiler] The time slow hat is actually suprisingly useful in boss fights if you're trying not to get hit, and can help timed sections along with being able to take certain things with a bit more leisure. [/spoiler]\n- I want more of this game, that's the real nitpick here, I JUST WANT MORE OF THIS STELLAR GAME. \n\nIn conclusion, A Hat in Time is a stellar product that is fun, charming, and just overwelmingly a great game. Gears for Breakfast obviously put love and care into this game and I hope they recieve the goal they wanted when they released this game. Also hopefully they have enough funding to make more games like this or free content updates or DLC for it or SOMETHING.\n\nAlso if someone at Gears for Breakfast is out there can you just tell us if you plan to bring this wonderful game to the Nintendo Switch?

You're given large worlds to poke around in that contain all manner of items and doodads that either make your journey easier by themselves, or can be combined into and traded for powerups. In this case, you can either find yarn to stitch new hats together, or Pons, which act as the universal currency for everything from new passive abilities and game modifiers to a way to unlock new levels. There are also the key items that are not only integral to every act, but also to beating the game itself. They're called Time Pieces here, and they're the driving motivator behind the story. Your ship uses time as fuel, you see, and after an incident, they're scattered all over this mysterious nearby planet. So, Hat Kid needs to postpone her journey home to collect them all back up and continue on her way. With great power comes great responsibility, though, and when the denizens of the planet discover what these little magical hourglasses can do, it leads to all kinds of problems cropping up. Needless to say, they're important. So important that you're sent back to the hub every time you collect one. That way, the next act can be tailored to make the quest for its Time Piece have its own set of events and storylines.\n\nSo yes, it is a collectathon platformer, but it's more akin to a Mario game than Banjo Kazooie. Specifically, World 1 feels very reminiscent of Super Mario Sunshine. And from there on, it revels in doing its own thing. The worlds just keep getting better as they go, literally reaching their peak at the fantastic Alpine Skyline. Because of the previously mentioned yarn and pons, though, it strikes a nice balance between the two styles. You get to have the fantastic setpieces and different mission types that only a customized version of the same area could have, but that doesn't mean you can't just go off the rails at any time and do your own thing. It's up to you what's important at that particular moment: do you advance the game's story, or go make your own? Do you want to add to your vault of time pieces, or hunt down some of those relics that open bonus stages? Yeah, speaking of Mario Sunshine, when you progress far enough in any given world, Time Rifts start showing up, and these come in two flavors.\n\nThe ones that pop up naturally with progression are platforming challenges that test your skills against some really cool 3D obstacle courses. They're just the right amount of difficult; never pushing you to the point of pulling your hair out, but still challenging you to approach the abilities you're used to in clever ways. Meanwhile, the relic rifts result when a time piece lands on someONE, not someTHING, and they're designed around that person's past experiences and memories. These are more like mini-collectathons, asking you to scour relatively small areas for special pons that open the hatch to the next floor, and eventually giving way to another time piece. You'll find pieces of picture books in these rifts that (when put back together), fill in the details of what the story is behind the more important characters in each area. Completing a rift also gives you a spin on a bonus wheel that rewards your skills with new color palettes and variant hats for your character, as well as remixed level tracks that you can swap out in the main hub. You can get more spins by finding rift tokens in the worlds as well, giving you one more reason to poke around in ALL the nooks and crannies.\n\nThe last big collectible item worth mention are the badges. These are equippable items that offer modifiers to either your base abilities or the game itself, such as immunity to fall damage, no bonking when you accidentally dash into a wall, or even fun things like replacing the voice acting with Banjo-Kazooie style mubling. Special mention must go to the free-roam screenshot camera (which is a wonderful addition to what is already an incredibly screenshot-able game). One weird design decision is that a key skill is tied to one of your badges. You get pins that let you equip up to 3 badges at a time eventually, but the added luxury feels a little hollow when one of those slots is always going to be taken up. It feels kinda limiting, especially when a lot of these are quality of life upgrades that make the act of playing much easier, like magnetizing pons and health restoring items to yourself. Oh, and I'm going to say this right now: prepare yourself for glitches. Plural. As in, more than one; at least two more than none. This was an indie game after all, so the coding isn't as air-tight as it could be. And you know what? I don't care.\n\nI'm gonna sound like such an apologist tool for saying this, but I don't actually mind the glitches in this game because they're amusing. They don't corrupt my save file or make the stage unplayable or anything; they're mostly just hiccups in collision that lead to very entertaining results. I found a way to break a sequence in the very first level. I had a moment on stream where I collected a time piece, and Hat Kid fell through the universe. And this one time, Cooking Cat learned how to levitate, so not to be outdone, I sat on a chair while on top of my roomba so I could join her. Remember that camera badge I mentioned earlier? Well, if you put the normal camera between you and a wall, you can actually force the free-roam camera beyond the collision and see the level from the other side.\n\nI mean this in the best possible way: A Hat In Time feels like it was designed by a 7-year old. What I mean by that is everything has this child-like whimsy to it; this magical perspective that comes along with that period in your life where everything is amazing. Even the hub world is a joy to explore. You can dive into a pool of candy-shaped pillows. The walls and floors are covered in bright and wonderful designs that make it look like the world's most awesome clubhouse more than a spaceship. Even the non-playable characters are fantastic and lively. They're genuinely written well, and bursting with so much personality that you could learn a lot about them just from a single box of dialogue. Some are even voiced by my fellow internet personalities. Deserving of particular mention is Yungtown's amazing performance as The Snatcher; a character who's having so much fun being evil that he actually tricks you into liking him at times. It's great! And it all retains that child-like innocence throughout. Most of the random mooks you beat up are Mafia memebers and yucky things like spiders. There's no malice behind it; they're just bad guys. You beat up bad guys; it's what you do. At least, that's what would make sense to somebody that young.\n\nA Hat In time is easily worth the mid-range asking price. There is no doubt in my mind about that. Without any reservations, I can recommend this game to anybody who's even remotely interested in what it's got going on.", "timestamp_created": 1509213295, "timestamp_updated": 1509213295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547950", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36084417": {"recommendationid": "36084417", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999538917", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509139961}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best platformer I have played in the past 10 years, period.

I was not there when they revealed their idea to the world, nor did I donate to the kickstarter, nor did I even know what it was exactly until I saw it on here and watched the trailer. But it struck home, even disregarding me not knowing a thing about it. I had grown to be sick and tired of my grind games, and the barren wasteland that is steam's library as a whole, but as  soon as I saw what was offered, I was immediately hooked. If there was one thing I needed, it was a well polished platformer where you could feel the developers putting their blood, sweat, tears, and love into it. \n\n A Hat in Time follows a silent, but plucky young girl and her hat through an adventure on a large, gorgeous looking planet. You explore this planet using your space ship as the main hub world, with the space ship itself holding many interesting nooks and crannies for you to explore and re-explore as the game goes on. The game itself looks good, the animated style coupled with the top notch platforming who's design allows for play styles of all speeds (I personally started off a little slow but eventually I was zooming through as if I had never stopped playing platformers) all while exploring a world with plenty of NPC's to talk to, hidden things to find, and collectibles ranging from humorous souvenirs of the planet to yarn balls that will let you create more unique hats with their own special powers, all the way to coins to attempt to play a slot machine for various hats skins, song remixes, and alternate costume colors. There are also badges you can buy ingame that also increase utility for the hats, but sadly there are too few for myself, with about 12 or so, but in this case the number is plenty to go through your adventure. \n\nThe story itself is simple enough. You as a plucky hero have lost through certain means the ability to make it back home, and when the going get's tough, you get going. For a platformer, this is perfectly fine, especially as the colorful cast and voice acting really bring the story home. The voice acting makes everything endearing and through the gameplay makes you really want to complete and collect everything. Every level has it's own little story line and, this was a nice touch to me personally, it's own artistic preview of what you're going to be doing for every level. This touch was great to me as it really made me feel like the Devs cared about their game. Add in bonus levels, the ingame backstory goodies to collect in them, the great music and intersting concepts for each level, and an enjoyable final boss fight, and this game easily becomes one of my favorites of this year.\n\nMy only gripes is getting used to certain controls, which honestly was a learn to play issue on my part (certain actions require getting used to, for instance press the jump button when you climb up something will make you vault over it, unless I'm actually wrong, but pressing forward allowed you to climb up just fine) and for any hitting your face into a wall (which actually causes recoil, which I'll get a bit more into in a second but also  has a badge that gets rid of this feature) is quickly overcome and just not getting enough game for myself. The latter part will apparently be answered for with free DLC for two additional chapters, which makes me more than happy to hear.\n\nAs for the praises I can only begin to shower on this game, where do I even start? The music is great, with various remixes to spice things up, the platforming is great, your character has weight, and has trouble hitting things early on (hitting a large enemy will cause you to recoil until you get your actual weapon or use a particular jump atttack). When you hit a wall, you will not just stop in place, your girl will hit the wall, recoil and fall a distance away from said wall, depending on how hard you hit it. The boss fights are great, often done in different styles, the levels are beautiful, each one being more fun than the next, and your character and everyone else in it have their own great personalities, even regular run of the mill npcs.\n\nAnd what sucks is that I know I'm missing more and more praises to give this game. This game is great, heads and shoulders above others, and certainly will get rid of any bad taste Yooka-Laylee might have given you. This is the kind of game that really restores your faith in game developers to deliver fun, quality games without ridiculous pay to win garbage, grind, or subpar, shallow  gameplay under the excuse of, \"People will still buy it, right?\". And like most anything good, it's over far too soon. If you get the chance I highly suggest picking it up, especially with the DLC on the way. \n\nTo the Devs: Thanks for making a game that doesn't suck.

I 100% recommend anyone who loves platformers, or anyone who loves well-made games period, to check this out. I don't buy many games at full price, but I'm glad I did here. There are hundreds of well worded positive reviews out there already (that I totally agree with). I'm not sure what else I could add to the chorus there, so I'm going to do something unexpected for how much I love this game: I'm going to gripe about a couple of minor things. \n\n1- This one is just personal: I genuinely disliked almost all of one world, the Alpine Skyline (except 'The Windmill'. That part was awesome). I found it tedious, stressful, and nausea-inducing. The camera did not work nearly as well in this area as it did in the rest of the game. \n\n2- I wish there were a LOT more of the 'Time Rift' levels, these were by far my favorite part of the game but there's only a few, and they are quite short.\n\n3- The game gets frequent 1.5-2 gigabyte updates, apparently due to the way Unreal Engine 3 updates work (if they update one small thing, an entire large chunk has to be re-downloaded). This is no fault of the devs, but still, if you have slow internet or data caps, watch out. I've gotten 10 gigs of updates in 2 weeks. Additionally, every update resets your in-game settings, potentially leaving you with a lot of adjustments to make every time.\n\n\nThis game is as good as, or possibly better than Super Mario Sunshine, and I think I would label it the BEST 3D Platformer ever (keeping in mind that I haven't played Super Mario Odyssey yet, which of course looks outstanding).

Everything about this game, from the title screen, to the end credits is filled with ridiculous amounts of charm and character. Exploring the worlds this game has to offer is just... Fun. You're going to be finding yourself enjoying the scenery from time to time rather than playing towards the objective. All the different worlds the game has to offer are colorful, and pretty large. Every area in this game is a joy to look at and explore. Not once did I feel like skipping out on an act. Every mission was extremely enjoyable, which is not something I can say for other 3d platformers. Oh, and the music. MY GOODNESS, THE MUSIC! The soundtrack for each level perfectly fits in with the theme of the world, and most exhibit such a great sense of wonder and adventure. \n\nWhile A Hat in Time takes a lot of inspiration from games like Mario 64, Sunshine, and Banjo kazooie, none of the characters or levels will make you think of those games, aside from maybe the time rift levels. Every character you meet has such a distinct personality, great designs, and (mostly) great voice acting. Which, if you dislike, you can buy a badge that will change the regular voice acting to mumbles. It's a completely separate thing, something they didn't need to add at all, but it's a nice homage to some older games of the genre, and very welcome in my eyes. Also unlike some older games, the camera and controls are easy to understand, and make the gameplay very enjoyable. There were very few times that the camera was a hassle to deal with, and when it was, it generally only lasted a few seconds before returning to normal. Every move you can make in this game, be it the double jump, or the mid air dash feels great, and it adds a lot of depth to the gameplay. Canceling your dash makes for easy placement correction, wall climbing and wall jumps are easy to pull off, with a very generous timing. A Hat in Time simply plays like a dream.\n\nOh, and if you're a speedrunner, this game has you covered. The main story is relatively short, only requiring a little over half of the total amount of time pieces there are to collect. Not to mention, the full controller support and in-game speedrun timer, making it easy for anyone to just hop in and start running without having to download any other programs. Even if you don't have the top time, it can still be great fun to just casually seeing how fast you can complete a certain level or even the whole game.\n\nIf you love 3D platformers, and you want to feel nostalgic while also enjoying a new, fresh experience, do yourself a favor and buy this game. Seriously. This is not a game you want to pass up if you're a fan of platformers.

It has been one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time.  It takes about an hour or so to really figure out some of the game mechanics, but once you do the game just sort of opens up in what it offers.  The puzzles aren't overly challenging but some of them are, so the game is the right balance of difficult, but the joy of the game is just in running around wherever you want to go on a level and exploring while finding yarn, etc.  \n\nThe humor in the game is amazing, honestly, I've laughed so many times throughout the game and keep doing so!  The voice acting is really wonderful, the music is superb.  I have never wanted to buy the soundtrack to a game but I think I would here this one!  \n\nThe only real CON I can come up with is the camera has some flaws at times.  You can fix this by changing the distance, and turning off the camera assist option, but other times you need it on.  It just kind of depends, but I mostly keep it off and keep the distance at 'very far'.  The other thing that would be an improvement is having Hat Kid have a darker shadow allowing you to judge some distances better when coming down from a jump, but again, it's nothing that takes away from the game.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10 I give the game a 9.5, with the only real problem being the camera at times and difficulty in judging distances that could benefit from a darker shadow.  Plus I would like to see an option to 'lock' the camera in place at different times.  These negatives hardly take away from the game though, it has been of the absolute best gaming experiences I've ever had.  Buy this game, buy this game!  I even stream and record some of my playthroughs so look up Offlawnn on youtube and you can see the game more.  Did I mention...

By and large, yes. There are a few parts that could be criticized, though, mostly that the game lacks a bit of polish here and there in the actual platforming that makes up most of the levels. The game sometimes doesn't want to grab ledges, a few jumps are punishingly pixel-perfect(though really only a few) and the game sometimes helps you, sometimes ignores you and lets you plummet to your doom. Conversely, the boss fights are all amazingly well-done.\n\nIt's like someone inverted Shantae, which has tons of mood and good writing and art, well-polished actual levels, and then kind of hits its head and waddles around in confusion when you say \"boss fight.\" Hat In Time, on the other hand, could've done with about another 500 boss fights without boring me, while I could see a few places to tighten up the levels themselves.\n\nIt's also a bit short on content, about 12 hours of play for me, which involved just toodling around Mafia Town for about an hour because I was enjoying jumping on things, wearing hats and listening to the music. But supposedly we're getting another two acts in the start of 2018, so I think that's a bit of a minor thing to pick on. Besides, 12 hours of very solid entertainment is good value for money considering that it's a game with essentially no random generation at all, everything about it being hand-crafted.\n\nI'd say that the SubCon Forest and Dead Bird Studio both feel like they could've had another couple of stages in there, though. But if I had to choose, I'd rather that they stopped while I wanted more and felt like they could've done more, rather than another eight stages down the road where I groaned every time I saw the Conductor or DJ Grooves(not the Snatcher, though, good luck ever making me tired of him, nerds.).\n\nUltimately I'd give it a 9 out of 10. It would've been 11 out of 10, but I have to subtract two points for the ending.

Like survival horror games, there seemed to be no real catalyst \u2013 right up until the end of the PS2\u2019s life cycle they were still relatively popular, and then they just disappeared overnight, destroyed by a digital meteorite or possibly evolving into the feathered grey sludge that is the modern AAA game.\n\nResurrected with some fossilised code found in amber, A Hat in Time is a pure bred, exploratory 3D platformer and almost by default is the best of its kind made in the last decade. I say almost, as A Hat in Time is not the first game this year to try to put the paddles to the unbeating heart of the 3D platformer \u2013 Yooka Laylie launched in March to rapturous shrugs, and while it wasn\u2019t horrible it was somehow worse than the 20 year game it was slavishly imitating.\n\nThankfully a Hat in Time is very much its own man, and it is far better for it \u2013 while it obviously takes inspiration from earlier games (notably Mario Sunshine), it also appreciates what DIDN\u2019T work, especially in those later bloated Rare titles. Banjo Tooie, Donkey Kong 64 and by extension Yooka Laylee all suffered from enormous, empty worlds that were frankly a chore to navigate. A Hat in Time is much closer to the smaller, tightly designed levels of Banjo Kazooie and Mario 64, and the fluid controls and carefully calibrated difficulty curve make those worlds a joy to play around in.\n\nThe four worlds themselves are largely very well designed and have an admirable degree of variety, though the quality of individual missions and challenges can be variable. There\u2019s definite improvement as the game goes on \u2013 the 3rd world, the obligatory Haunted House level is definitely a high point as it\u2019s here that the exploration, challenges and humour all come together perfectly \u2013 whoever played Snatcher, the fabulous soul stealing tsundere ghost just sells the shit out of it. The early game as well as being less interesting to play also suffers from some dubious acting and writing, and the whole \u201cMafia island resort\u201d gag just doesn\u2019t land with any conviction.\n\nIn addition to the main areas, there are also \u201cblocks in space\u201d levels that are inspired by those in Mario Sunshine, in the same way that Chinese toy factories are inspired by the moulds that mysteriously go missing. Those were notable high points in the otherwise lukewarmly received Mario Sunshine and they\u2019re just as welcome here, pure linear platforming challenges that are a nice counterpoint to the broader exploration in the main levels.\n\nIt should be pretty evident that I kind of loved a Hat in Time \u2013thanks to its amazing controls it\u2019s just a joy to play, despite its flaws. Really the biggest concern is that it\u2019s possibly a little pricey \u2013 I personally found the 23 quid asking price to be very fair for the 12 or so hours I got out of it, but if you put a bigger priority than I do on hour/dollar it might be worth waiting for a sale. If that\u2019s not a concern for you, then I totally recommend pulling the trigger, if just to support an incredibly promising and talented dev team.

Pero vayamos por partes:\n\nJugabilidad: Es una mezcla entre Super Mario Sunshine, Crash Bandicoot y otros juegos del g\u00e9nero. Tambi\u00e9n le veo tintes a The Legend of Zelda Wind Waker en algunos puntos. Es un juego de plataformeo, de modo que es importante que los controles respondan bien, la c\u00e1mara sea manejable y no interfiera y no haya puntos imposibles de alcanzar. En este aspecto todo est\u00e1 bien pulido, pudiendo incluso llegar a escalar a zonas a las que quiz\u00e1 no deber\u00edas llegar porque son s\u00f3lo de adorno. Por otro lado el combate no tiene demasiada profundidad, siendo los bosses quiz\u00e1 la piedra angular de este aspecto y aunque no son super f\u00e1ciles, todos se pueden superar sin morir demasiado. Sobre todo si consigues el \u00faltimo sombrero.\n\nPuedes ir consiguiendo sombreros, que te dan poderes para poder seguir avanzando, y excepto en puntos espec\u00edficos, le dar\u00e1s prioridad al primero y al \u00faltimo que desbloqueas. Adicionalmente puedes ponerles parches para potenciar, adquirir o dificultar tus habilidades.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos: Tiene esos gr\u00e1ficos cartoon que tanto molan en este tipo de juegos. Los personajes est\u00e1n dise\u00f1ados de forma muy carism\u00e1tica. Tampoco me parar\u00e9 mucho en este punto ya que hay fotos, videos y de todo en steam.\n\nSonido: La banda sonora es muy agradable, en algunos puntos como en bosses se vuelve bastante ca\u00f1era cosa que aporta tension y es de agradecer.\n\nHistoria: La historia no es nada del otro mundo, pero es una buena excusa para desarrollar todo el juego y encaja perfectamente en el tono desenfadado del juego.\n\nDuraci\u00f3n: El juego puede completarse en unas 6 horas si juegas a tu ritmo, pero cuenta  con much\u00edsimos desbloqueables, niveles secretos, y en el futuro contar\u00e1 (he leido por ah\u00ed) con split screen lo que usar\u00e9 como pretesto para rejugarlo con alguien.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n: Yo he pagado los 28\u20ac que cuesta el juego, y me los he gastado a gusto. No suelo gastarme el dinero en juegos tan caros, pero yo creo que es un juego que vas a disfrutar de punta a punta.

I give it a solid 9.9/10, where that .1 is controls. While the controls are very tight and offer extremely fluid movement around the world, there were times where Hat Girl could definitely had made that jump or grabbed that ledge, but simply refused.\n\nElements of the Game:\n\nStory - A highly creative story. You can really feel the spirit of older platformer collect-a-thons that inspired this gem. Personally, I felt immersed in Hat Girl's universe and thoroughly enjoyed the original characters.\n\nArt - I loved the stylized, anime-inspired graphic direction that the game went with. The characters were chibi in stature, which added to the game's adorable charm. Personally, I would love to see a graphic novel in the spirit of A Hat in Time.\n\nSound/Music - Very tight sound direction. The composers did an excellent job of creating music which only added to the fast-paced fun of A Hat in Time's game world. The title song is easily my favorite piece.\n\nMechanics - As stated before, there were a few -- albeit small -- issues I had with the game's mechanics. Sometimes Hat Girl would not climb ledges she clearly could reach. Sometimes, Hat Girl would get stuck in the floor of some ledges (the game was very quick to eject her and reposition her to where she was supposed to be, however). Other than these issues, the mechanics are very tight and responsive and extremely easy to pick up and master. Anyone can become a pro speed-runner of A Hat in Time! \n\nAll in all, I highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend this game to any fans of the platformer genre, fans of anime/chibi style art, or those looking for a charming story in to which to get immersed. It's a very short game (I beat the game in around 10 hours, and that was on and off running errands) and you can definitely beat it in a single sitting.

Sorry in advance.\n\nThis game is the perfect old-style collectibles centered platformer. It's essentially a perfect mix of what made Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy such great games.\n\nThe level design is charming and even when you get lost in the levels, you don't care because there's always something new to discover. New NPCs, more Yarn for your new hats, new little puzzles for you to solve. Every level is unique and an absolute blast to be in.\n\nThe soundtrack and the voice acting (managed by Chris 'Kirbopher' Niosi, one of my old favorite content creators from Newgrounds) are phenomenal and wholely entertaining. The fact that you have the option to listen to voice acted lines or equip a Badge to make the voice lines sound like classic Banjo-Kazooie mumbling is the perfect mix of modern game style and nod-off to the legendary classic that essentially defined the genre.\n\nEvery single collectible FEELS good to get and FEELS like you're making progress towards something. It's not like in Banjo-Kazooie where you collect the Jinjos and you only find out what they do for you at the VERY end of the game, so they feel like a chore to collect all the way until the end.\n\nThe controls and the mechanics of the powers you get (which come in the form of cute hats) all feel tight and well designed. You never find yourself blaming the power you're using for why something bad happened to you (unlike Yooka-Laylee where some of the move mechanics feel like they're fighting against you). The powers are all easy to understand and to use and change the dynamics of the game appropriately. None of them feel useless or broken (the Time Stop Hat is arguably the only exception, when used in tandem with the Fast Hatter Badge). The controls never get muddled up by having to hold one button and press another to use a given power. Instead, you can quickly swap through your powers by quick swapping hats with either the radial menu (set to the Left Bumper) or by scrolling through with the D-Pad. \n\nBadges give you access to cool little perks that allow you to customize your Hat Kid and play your way. \n\nThere are so many options for aesthetics in this game that you will always look forward to the next style of your Sprint Hat or the next Color Palette you get from the Rift Coin Machine.\n\nOverall, this game is filled to the brim with personality and charm. If you or someone you know abandoned this game because of the Jontron cameo (literally only two lines, by the way and completely missable if you don't talk to everyone), please reconsider. This game redefined the Collectible Platformer genre in my opinion and is exactly what people wanted out of Yooka-Laylee (no disrespect to that game either), and more. \n\nGive it a shot. I've shown this game to friends of mine that don't even enjoy games 98% of the time and now I have trouble getting them out of my house because all they want to do is borrow my laptop to play A Hat in Time (seriously, send help, they won't leave).", "timestamp_created": 1508793375, "timestamp_updated": 1508793375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35953801": {"recommendationid": "35953801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025514109", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509590063}, "language": "english", "review": "3-4 years in the making and I do not regret my decision to back this game all those years ago.

Whilst it would be nice for some that there was more to collect it shouldnt be too big of a problem with the previously stated DLC whch will hopefully add some more hats.\n\nMusic in the game as well is a joy to listen too, very fitting and when needed very atmospheric which further engrosses you in the game.\n\nIn conclusion, if Yooka Laylee didn't scratch that nostalgic platformer itch, buy this game because it may be exactly what you wanted.", "timestamp_created": 1508777511, "timestamp_updated": 1508777511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516266", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35948959": {"recommendationid": "35948959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130430172", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 311, "last_played": 1513997779}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome Game!

The game borrows heavily from a lot of 1996-2005 3D Platformer games era, you'll draw comparisons from the obvious Super Mario 64 and Sunshine (main suspects) to the more obscure Sly Cooper and Pyschonauts games. Every chapter is structured completely different from one another, which eases the feel of repetition but might throw others in for a loop. One Chapter you'll be on an little happy greek-esque sunny island, and few dairy entries later you'll be in a surreal spooky forest under a dark and gloomy moonlit sky with somber melancholy undertones. A lot of the characters you'll encounter are brimming with personality with a few particular characters standing out more than others but with an overall a very humble and tight knit cast of creatures and friends for you meet and play with. And this soundtrack is one for the ages... You get a vast arrangement styles of music. Did anyone mention the Grandpapa of Whimsical Adventure OSTs Grant Kirkhope makes an appearance in some of these tracks?\n\nOverall A Hat in Time is an awesome game that restores faith to the 3D platformer genre and draws faithful and quirky twists to old classic games from the yesteryear.

It's nice to see a great new game like those. The controls aren't quite *perfectly* tight in this game, so I sometimes felt out of control, though it was still very good. It feels good to be able to go very far and fast by applying skill; in fact, I wish that there were more racing maps. The game is fairly easy overall, but there are challenging bits. It does a good job at avoiding being *frustratingly* difficult.\n\nThe maps are highly varied and interesting. Some are very large. The collect-a-thon was a bit weak, though. You'd almost have to go out of your way *not* to get the required yarn, and there aren't enough relics to pose much of a challenege. I 100%ed the game in about 18 hours. The hat mechanic was fine, but it seems underused; I didn't change hats or badges all that often. I kinda feel like they could've doubled the length of the game just by exploiting existing content/features more, without reducing overall quality. Maybe the upcoming user-created maps feature will sort of provide this.\n\nThe story and models are super cute. I love the different hats flairs and colors. The story is interesting, with lively and memorable characters. I like how Hat Girl comes across as devious, if benevolent -- it's a bit different than usual.\n\nThe music is excellent, and perfectly complements what's going on in the game. I love how as you advance in a level, often the music will flow into a different flavor of the same general song.\n\n9.5/10, highly recommended to anyone who likes old-school 3D platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1508734440, "timestamp_updated": 1508734440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35937254": {"recommendationid": "35937254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059445255", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508478967}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best 3D platformers in recent memory.

Shortcuts, secrets, hidden goodies.\n+ Humor is definitely there, the character dialogues made me smile a couple of times.\n+ Excellent soundtrack and voice acting. Clear, easy to understand voice acting and catchy tunes.\n\n- Design wise, it is an intense platformer, perhaps due to heavy influence of successful platformers the dev-team was following closely. I wouldn't recommend it to people who did not play a 3D-platformer before. If some mechanics were explained a bit more properly and the player was given a chance to practice the newly acquired knowledge with some easy challenges beforehand, that could have made the game more newby-friendly. Although, that is also quite hard to accomplish in a free-roam 3D-platformer as well.\n- There are a handful visual glitches and bugs within the game. It is understandable, with the manpower the development team had there were no dedicated teams to finding and fixing glitches. They also do not impair the overall experience thus when you see them you just start to ignore them.\n\nIn conclusion, game is fun, visually appealing, humorous and successfuly delivers a good 3D-platforming experience.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1508664727, "timestamp_updated": 1508664727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35915102": {"recommendationid": "35915102", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999737286", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509249294}, "language": "english", "review": "This game genuinely makes me happy when playing it.

As of writing this review, I've 100%'d it twice, and never once felt bored or annoyed (besides moments where I was just being stupid and failed to solve a puzzle that was actually really simple). I'll go over my thoughts on each area a game is typically judged on, but the TL;DR is that this game is awesome, and if you can ignore a couple minor issues that don't impact the gameplay whatsoever and are to be expected of an indie game (for example, there are some places where you can turn the camera in such a way that the platform you're on becomes invisible) then this game is, in my opinion, absolutely flawless.\n\nSTORY\nThe story of the game is rather light, but it manages to avoid being bland. You're given a genuine reason for your quest, and each individual world has its own story arc that you follow along, not to mention the backstory and lore of the worlds and characters. It doesn't constantly bombard you with plot twists or drama, but it also isn't dull enough that you completely ignore it.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe standard gameplay is 3D platforming, and it's done very well, and the game never forgets that's what it's meant to be. But it also isn't tiring with it. Just when you feel like every level is going to be platform-to-platform jumping and avoiding pits, hey look, this one's spiced up with a bit of stealth! This one's got puzzles! This one's platforming based around a new item! It never stays samey, and while some people may find the sudden additions jarring, they tend to be small enough that they add new flavor but don't completely detract from why we're here in the first place.\n\nWRITING\nThis game's humor is probably one of its best parts for me, if not THE best part. Just about every NPC you can talk to has something funny or interesting to say, and you'll find yourself wanting to go out of your way to talk to them all. Just one example, and my absolute favorite bit of writing in the whole game, comes when you examine Hat Kid's microwave in her kitchen: \"It's a microwave! You use it to punish food that has been bad.\" Even the non-dialogue parts are incredible, such as when a stare-off between Hat Kid and a Mafia man is suddenly interrupted by Hat Kid blowing a raspberry. \"This awkward for Mafia!\" indeed.\n\nBOSS FIGHTS\nDoes \"dodge the same two attacks, get a hit in, repeat two more times to win\" sound familiar? Probably does. Mostly because so many games rely on that for their boss fights. Not this game! Each boss and miniboss has its own unique way of being fought, and they have a TON of attacks that require quick reflexes to get around. They're not too easy or too hard, and they always throw something in that makes each fight different from the last.\n\nCONTROLS\nThe controls are very responsive. And... okay, let's face it: I have nothing else to add in this section. Because the controls function exactly like you expect and want them to. So I really don't have much to add in this department!\n\nGRAPHICS\nOh. My. God. This game looks AMAZING. The environments are so diverse and well-made, and I frequently just stopped to admire how beautiful it looked. (Or how creepy it looked, if that was what they were going for.) The attention to detail is absolutely staggering; just as an example, a singular wall in a singular area that can be easily ignored has unique signs on it that you have to stop and look at to actually notice, and those signs aren't anywhere else. If that isn't attention to detail, what is? And nothing in the game looks out-of-place, either (unless it's supposed to). And, well, as the developers already said, the game is CUTE AS HECK, and the graphics certainly help!\n\nSOUND\nThe music. The music. THE. MUSIC. Every single composer (NOT just Grant Kirkhope, for the record - Pascal Michael Stiefel did most of the composing, but other people, Kirkhope included, contributed) forged masterpieces. It's not often I actually buy the game's soundtrack, but I did it without a second thought here and I don't regret it. Whether you want to listen to something epic that gets your blood pumping, or something calm to help you relax, this game has it. And their associated areas in the game fit the music so well, you won't be able to listen to the music by itself without imagining the area or fight it's from.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nOnce again, in my opinion: flawless game. Besides the parts that aren't actually a problem, but just spots where you can notice a missed slight graphical issue. You could easily go through the whole game without even encountering one of those. Basically, if the description for this game at all interested you: buy it.

The five different worlds are all each unique, including a \"traditional\" world, a movie studio (which then forks into 2 other level types), a horror/ghost world (with one of the more terrifying levels I have seen, which REALLY changed the tone of the game), a free-roam world, and then the final world which felt somewhat like a Bowser level from the Mario series.\n\nUnlike Yooka-Laylee, each \"act\" in a world provides a basic idea of what the theme of each time piece is (such as \"train rush\", indicating that there will be a timed event on a train level).  With Yooka-Laylee, I felt as if I was just thrown into a large level, and somehow had to go around and find each pagie, which felt tedious, especially when you may have not had everything required to accomplish the goal. This was not the case in A Hat in Time.\n\nThere is a vast soundtrack to the game (78 tracks), proving a unique audio experience to each level and event that fits the level's atmosphere well.  If you appreciate the music as well as I did, buying the soundtrack DLC is a no-brainer; having the MP3s to listen to whenever is a nice touch to have.\n\nThe main issue I had in the end was the length of the game.  There are only 40 time pieces in the entire game (only 25 needed to complete the full story), and I was able to complete the game with 100% completion in about 17 hours.

After the terrible disappointment that Yooka-Laylee was, I, well, I never even thought of this game. I found about its existence back in 2014 from a video from YouTuber brutalmoose, who was reviewing a very early build of the game. Looked cool but there wasn't much to go off of. Then, it sort of vanished as far as I was aware, and I NEVER heard any news or anything about it. But fast forward to early 2017, and suddenly the game has a presence again, with astoundingly good social media PR that did wonders at spreading the game, and here we are.\n\nA Hat in Time is easily my favorite game this year, with BOTW in second place now... though I admit that Super Mario Odyssey will likely take AHiT's place, don't take that the wrong way! A Hat in Time is an amazing 3D platformer that everyone, fans of the genre or not, should give a try! I'm not much of an in-depth reviewer, but I can say this: It's just... amazingly well crafted, with great dialogue and voice acting to boot; and 4 intricate worlds that Yooka-Laylee wishes it could have. The difference here is that they're worlds that you WANT to explore. Every part of them has a purpose and things to collect, things to do in them. Not just extra world space for the sake of making it bigger; huge worlds does not instantly = good. And the game is also getting TWO more worlds as free DLC later down the line! Like, I really don't even WANT to go more in depth, honestly... 30 dollars is a crime for this game. I would drop the full $60 *easily* for A Hat in Time. \n\nPlease do yourself a favor.

It's a Gamecube loveletter nobody asked for, but it somehow achieves at grasping the nostalgia of great titles like Super Mario Sunshine. In some cases, this actually better represents Banjo-Kazooie better than Yooka-Laylee in some perspectives.\n\nA Hat in Time started out as a one-man project. It soon evolved into a small team that wanted $30k to make the game (at one point, they doubted themselves and lowered it to $20k). After their initial goal, they soon raised over $250k to make the game with tons of bonuses coming in the future.\n\nThe music is also fantastic. I feel like every track fits in with each level and objective perfectly. I was blown away just by the sheer loading screen, and it just got better from there on out.\n\nMy only complaint would be the short-ish length (there's even a speedrun timer built into the game). If you really wanted to complete this game quickly, it's possible, but since it's had so much support on Kickstarter, the devs have promised more content: 2 new worlds, online multiplayer co-op, and they even put mod support despite being very busy with the game's recent launch (I'm very thankful I'm able to mod-play Trucy Wright).\n\nI've heard nothing but great things about this game; the only \"\"\"legit\"\"\" complaint I've heard from Gamespot is that it has \"too much voice-acting\" which 1.) you can turn off and 2.) there's an upgrade where you can make the characters mumble in a nonsense fashion like in the original Banjo-Kazooie.\n\nI can tell the devs were very supportive of users that purchased this game.

Thematically, it is a breath of fresh air. The protagonist and all the characters you meet along the way are cute as heck. The writing is enjoyable and often makes me chuckle and the game's visuals are awesomely cartoony. The stages are akin to Mario 64's or Banjo Kazooie's in that they are wide, open, have many points of interest, and are incredibly fun to explore. The controls aren't as tight as some 3d platformers you may have played in the past, but the lighthearted nature of the atmosphere that it sets leads me to forgive it for anything like that. Despite this, the game gives you plenty of opportunities to play skillfully and even has several accomodations for speedrunners. In some spaces, it lacks a bit of polish, a small bug here or there. I hope that the few that I've encountered might be patched, but even if they weren't, they were only minor bumps in the road and were certainly nothing that would disuade me from my purchase. In another sense, one of this game's biggest appeals is in the polish of its more cinematic moments. I don't mean its cutsenes per say, but the direction for every level's 'setup' and 'payoff.' Lastly, the amazing soundtrack of this game is used to its fullest. Moments are punctuated with music that will leave a lasting impression. I expect I'll remember the highlights of this game long after its over because of those implimentations.

Walking passed a discarded can? Hat Kid kicks it. See a mafia goon? Hat Kid will stick her tongue out at him. Step in a mud puddle?

The game is spread across just four main levels, but each of these is split into numerous lengthy acts and shorter side challenges. The focus of the game is very much old-school platforming, with little emphasis on combat or overarching plot (though each level has its own contained story to contextualise the platforming challenges).\n\n[h1]Good things[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]Hat kid controls beautifully. She is really responsive, and landing on small platforms is easier in this game than any other platformer I've played. Because I feel so confient moving around, I am able to play much faster and more fluidly than most other platformers.\n[*]Every inch of the game is filled with cute details and shows obvious passion from the devs. Hat Kid is easily the most adorable video game character ever - no contest.\n[*]It looks gorgeous! The final main level felt like a 3D Rayman Origins - and I can offer no greater praise when it comes to visuals.\n[*]The music is consistently excellent. The main theme is a stand-out leitmotif.\n[*]Each level has its own unique gimmicks (even on the act-select screen), which keeps things constantly fresh.\n[*]Speaking of which, the game does a great job of avoiding platformer level tropes - like 'The Ice Level','The Desert Level'. The first level is an island fishing town populated by Mafia goons who are bad at cooking!\n[*]The writing is Undertale-tier excellent, somethimes invoking the likes of Douglas Adams.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Things that could be improved[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]You can sometimes see the rough around the edges. The odd texture that's not as detailed as the ones around it. The occasional camera clipping through solid objects and breaking the illusion of solid space. Seriously, these aren't things worth worrying about though.\n[*]I feel like most of the levels are just a little bit too big. There's generally stuff to collect everywhere, but you don't need all of it to get 100%. In particular, I think the forest level could do with the areas between the landmarks being removed, to make navigation faster and easier.\n[*]Final boss spoilers: [spoiler]While the battle was fun, I feel like the whole heartfelt 'everyone pitches in to help you win' was kinda undeserved. With the exception of Cooking Cat, I don't think any named character hasn't tried to kill Hat Kid. So it feels kinda insincere for everyone to suddenly grow some morals, when they've shown themselves to be completely nasty people (without remorse) just hours before. Maybe give them redemption arcs in their chapters if you want to do this.[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Things that you may like or hate[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]The voice acting...isn't the best. You might find this really distracting, but it reminded me of the cheap UK children's shows I watched when I was younger, and I [i]loved[/i] that feeling.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Closing thoughts[/h1]\n\nI think that A Hat in Time is a charming, wonderful game that absolutely deserves to be considered alongside the greats like Mario and Spyro (PS1-era spyro, anyway :P). If you have any interest in platformers, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try. No problems I have with the game are significant enough to actually impact my enjoyment of it, and when it is good, it is simply excellent.", "timestamp_created": 1508585663, "timestamp_updated": 1513264139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35888347": {"recommendationid": "35888347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032205819", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509993436}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic game that I would highly recommend to practically everyone; I was smiling through many parts of this game thanks to its designs, music, and varying gameplay.

While the graphics aren't the greatest, they don't need to be; this game does very well with its designs to the point that I'd say they might even be timeless and hold up years later, which in my opinion is much better than trying to display thousands of different shades of brown. The game has five worlds, but each one plays very differently from the last, quality over quantity. The story is also quite good, never bothering to sit the player down and explain everything to you, rather you are left to your own devices and can figure stuff out on your own, it left me with a sense of wonder about the locations in the game.

The music makes all bossfights epic and makes you want to try again and again even after you defeated the boss. Also this game has awesome atmosphere.

A Hat in Time isn't ashamed of its roots as you'll probably see some direct inspirations. That being said, this game isn't a Frankenstein monster of Nintendo games and has its own original ideas that provide a whole experience for those who aren't nostalgic for the GameCube. \n\nWith Super Mario Sunshine's creative platforming, LOZ: Windwaker's energetic art style and Paper Mario TYD's charming comedic tone, A Hat in Time is a joy to play through. \n\nIt's not without its drawbacks though. The difficulty is usually interesting but safe. The platforming is never really challenging and the bosses can be annoying at times. The structure of the worlds can feel a bit restrictive at times as you can only collect a timepiece (star/jiggy equivalent) in its respective level. Disappointedly, the level design, for the most part, is linear. Also, the $30 price tag for 10-20 hours might be asking too much for some.\n\nHowever, the positives absolutely steal the spotlight from the negatives.  While the difficulty of the platforming may not reach the height of classicly difficult games, it's never boring. Hat Kid is flat out fun to control. Double jumping, wall climbing, and diving to land tight jumps is satisfying. The different hats also grant unique ways tackle both platforming and combat. The worlds can be restrictive but they're always fun and diverse. The cartoonish colorful art style makes the worlds pop and compliment their unique gameplay arcs. While the experience is short, you can tell that the developers put a lot of effort and a world of heart into this game. It is rare to see that much endearing charm put into a game.\n\nI'd recommend this game to people who love the GameCube or Colectathons. Even anyone who wants a charming experience might want to give it a look.

The controls are very concise and most issues with platforming have to do with your own abilities. There are many hats which give special powers and abilities that shake things up in gameplay, though I will say there are some hats *cough* ice hat *cough* that are really underutilized. There is one hat that really opens up the game and it can create (kind of, they already exist so it kind is like phasing) platforms. It is a really cutesy game with delightful visuals and colorful dialogue. It can be pretty funny, I would say my favorite character would be the owl train conductor who speaks with a really exagerated scottish accent and is pretty self centered. Everything is either about his \"beautiful train\" or the bird movie awards with him.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely love is the way hatgirl can be customized. She can have the colors of her clothes and hair changed to your liking (you have to unlock them though) and can utilize badges which further your own abilities. Hatgirl you can change the way hatgirl plays and I think that it is pretty neat!\n\nThere are some negatives and in particular I have some issues with the glitches in the game. Sometimes you fall off a ledge and teleport or things don't seem to quite match up. Fortunately it isn't as bad as it seems and is still definitely playable. From what I understand this game is the developer's (Gears for Breakfast) first one so these glitches are to be expected. It is also rather short and can be finished within a couple hours. Replayability is expanded with a few hidden collectibles, secret levels, and \"relics\".\n\nI hear there may be dlc and steam workshop support so I can only expect the game to improve over time!

The pacing of the game works well to never let you get bored.\n\nI mostly enjoyed the overall style of the game. How the main character is happy and care-free most of the time, and like-wise there are few actually negative consequences for your actions. There will be several times where someone says, \"Hey, do this thing\" and you can decide \"Nah, I don't feel like it.\" Then the game will let you choose that. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't and you come right back to do it again. At the end, no one keeps track of how many times you killed some enemies, or if you caused some major issue. It just felt it was fun to explore, find collectables, and sometimes help the characters in the game.\n\nAlso, there were a few jokes where I laughed quite a bit.

Where do I begin with this one...\nI LOVE this game! (Yeah thats a good start XP) \nThis game is an amazing nood to games like Super Mario Sunshine, Banjo and Kazooie, and Mario 64. With WindWaker style graphics, an AMAZING soundtrack, cute charactors (Most of the time *shudders*) and wonderful level design. This game is one that makes me remember why I loved platformers in the first place. This game is packed FULL of charm. I havent felt this attacted to a game in a long time. In fact I felt like I needed to get everything in this game to experience all I could because I love the world and charactors soo much. It takes alot to make me want to complete a game but this one pulled me in and wouldnt let go. People that say platformers are dead (especially after some recent additions to the genre) NEED to play this game. The controls while they were a bit wonky for me at first are easy to pick up and fun to master. You'll be jumping, sliding, and swinging around with ease in no time. The hats add more variety to the game with offering different ways to get around the environment and deal with hazards. The levels are well designed and full of style, but aren't too big that you will find yourself lost in them. But now for some problems that some may have with the game.\n\nThe game in my opinion isnt short... But its not very long either. I completed everything in the game in about eleven and a half hours. Of course you can play any level you previously completed again if you wish. But I feel like there could have been a bit more each level. So I can see $30 being a bit to high a price for some. But I think its well worth it for the effort and charm in the game alone. So if its too much in your opinion I would wait for a sale to pick it up. Maybe at $25 or $20.\n\nThe game while it is wonderful and full of things to do at first, leave you with little end game content to play. It has replay value sure, but it leaves me wanting more. Tho that is coming with 2 more worlds as DLC and Co-op down the line.\n\nAnother thing I heard people complain about is the voice acting being \"cringy\" or \"horrible\". I LOVED the voice acting in this game. It has that cheesy charm that I love from games of the past. Im glad this game has voice acting. It makes the world feel more alive. And if you cant stand it there is a option in the form of a button that turns the games voices into mumbles ala Banjo and Kazooie.\n\nAlittle nit-pik of mine is the main rival of the game. While I love her (and her stache) I feel like they could have done more with her. I guess I was expecting a \"Shadow Mario\" type of rival where once a world she comes in messing with things and you have to try and stop her. Other than her being in the first hour of the game, after she truley becomes your rival she disappears only being mentioned in one other mission. Only to show up at the end game like she was the big master mind behind everything, but the moment I saw her I could only think \"What was she doing all this time?\". Like I said I love her and her being a rival is set up well enough. But I feel like she could be a more prominent role in the game other than \"that one girl that turned into a badguy near the beginning of the game\".\n\nAll in all tho I feel like I spent my money well with this game. I love it and cant wait to see what DLC brings. Not to mention Split screen/Online Co-op with a friend!~ *girly screams* This game is so charming and full of effort and love that if you like platformers you NEED to play this game. Pick it up whenever you can. Its worth a play I assure you. ^-^", "timestamp_created": 1508516080, "timestamp_updated": 1508516080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35867254": {"recommendationid": "35867254", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980087710", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1514572343}, "language": "english", "review": "It's mechanically one of the best controlling 3d platformers in years.

Some will leave you stumped, others will be a breeze.\n- A right blend of open exploration and linear platforming. \n- If you liked Sunshine's blend of linear and open exploration you'll find this hits home.\nCons\n- There are very few moments where the camera is locked. This removes most of the depth perception.

It's that simple.\n\nThere are a lot of games of steam, some of which are good but I'll never get around to buying. There are a lot of games I own on steam, some of which are good but I'll never get around to playing (Witcher 3 for example). There are a lot of game I play on steam for awhile, but I'll never get around to completing even though I really enjoy them. There are a few game I play on steam and I just play until I've beaten the main story, but I'll never get around to beating all the sidequests and unlocking everything even though I really enjoy those games. There are some games on steam that I own all DLC expansions but never got around to interacting with them despite playing the game enough to beat the main story, and I'll never get around to playing those parts despite how easy going back would be.\n\nThen, there is A Hat in Time. As soon as the game was released I played it for every hour I could spare. All the time I spent away from Hat in Time was time I wished I could play more Hat in Time. I beat the final level in around 15 horus. As soon as I finished watching the credits roll I leapt right back in to get a 100% clear of the game, which took about 4 more hours.\n\nA Hat in Time does everything right, and I mean that. Movement is tight and responsive, the music fits levels perfectly, all the characters have fun things to hear, the levels have enough room for you to explore but not so much that parts of levels feel empty or making the trek between areas a chore. Platforming finds a sweet spot where a novice doesn't have to worry about making continous, insane, pixel perfect jumps but the movement lets veterens question how much of a level they can skillfully avoid. A Hat in Time has no low points to the game, and this almost brings me to tears. This is a game that decided to only give you the it's very best instead of add boring, samey, uninspired content just to pad the game out. There is content that was in the beta but isn't in the full release, the example of this was a part of Mafia Town where Hat Kid had to jump and swing across the ocean and if she ever touched water a robo shark would eat her. This isn't in the full game because it wasn't good enough.\n\nVisually, I'd say that this game looks better than most AAA games despite the fact that A Hat in Time looks like a gamecube game. The reason for this is because Hat in Time didn't have the money, manpower, or time to given every object in the game a million polygons, so instead of doing something stupid like that it filled the game with environments that are interesting to look at and visually distinct from each other. Instead of making something highly detailed but boring to look at, an artist put their soul into every nook and crany of the game.\n\nNow, why did I say earlier that the game makes me tear up? Because A Hat in Time release a week after Cuphead, and gaming communities were still busy exploding over Cuphead, and two weeks before the launch of Super Mario Odyssy. A Hat in Time has two weeks before Mario obliterates it. Now, Hat in Time has full steam workshop support and DLC on the way, but nothing Hat Kid does will let it beat the giant that is Mario, who has a history of quality, a strong advertising campaign, and an enormous fanbase who already love Mario. What makes me tear up is that I'm afraid that A Hat in Time will become a hidden gem of gaming and that the world that barely took notice will soon forget Hat Kid every existed.", "timestamp_created": 1508472810, "timestamp_updated": 1508472810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35854732": {"recommendationid": "35854732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031492347", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508469143}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: Great platformwer, reminicent of Super mario Sunshine and Pyschonauts, good level design with only one that felt out of place.

Also reminds me a lot of Physchonauts in that it has good, funny writing and is voice acted, thugh I would say it is a lot better then Physchnauts. . \nThis game nails the movement, every jump you feel in control and if you make a mistake you know it was your fault. \nVery few glitches and the game runs very smooth. \nI wish this game had more levels, but all of the ones it does has feel well developed and fun, the only one I didnt like was a specific mission in the spooky level that was oddly dark for such a fun, silly game. I don't want to spoil anything but it just felt out of place, especially in a game that is mostly kid freindly. \nThe game is decently long, taking me about 8 hours to beat with at least another couple hours of content so I think it's definitely worth the money.", "timestamp_created": 1508469812, "timestamp_updated": 1508469851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35853375": {"recommendationid": "35853375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130083268", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513197277}, "language": "english", "review": "A Hat In Time is honesty a work of art.

It's been a while since I've seen a game this creative and fun. A Hat in Time is a collect-a-ton that actually does the job well (different from some chamelleon and bat around there), It consists on trying to find these time pieces so the little girl you control can go back home, these time pieces are all scattered around 5 different chapters that have each a little story of their own, I found these little stories to be a cool thing to add in the game, because it's nothing that you need to pain much attention to, but it's fun and it gives more life to the world, for example, the whole story on chapter 3 goes like having to do some obligations for the devil, because you signed some contracts and he's got your soul. The game is not that repetitive either, normally, these kind of games tend to be fun but to also get boring and repetitive fast, but that's not the case with A Hat in Time, because this game constantly give new things to you like new power ups, and the levels are very different from each other too (I mean, there's a level that literally turns into a puzzle horror game, that's not that spooky but still a thing I didn't expect from the game, and I absolutelly loved it), the boss fights are all very fun and intuitive too.

The colorful visuals, the orgasmic soundtrack, the return to the almost non-existent 3D collect-a-thon. I was ready to sink my teeth into this adorable game and suck everything it had to offer, but then I played it.\n\nI realize I am going to get a lot of negativity because of my review, but I really feel like I should warn people like myself who are in love with old-school platformers and collect-a-thons. Beware, this game, while deceptively cute has many problems. \n\nThe game isn't bad. At times it's great even. Most of the times, however, the flaws almost ruin the experience.\n\nThe game has beautiful visuals. The cute main character is adorable and the game never stops placing her in cute situations. The same can be said for the rest of the games visuals. The enemies and the levels look great as well. The graphics were one of the things that made me buy this game so hastily. I guess I am a sucker for cartoony visuals.\n\nThe soundtrack. Oh my god, the soundtrack. It's just divine. I absolutely love every single track I have heard ever since I frist launched the game. The tunes are catchy and fit in perfectly with whichever scenario the game throws at you.\n\nThe voice acting is also nice. The cast consists of great voice actors who really try their best to stay memorable. It's great that many of the characters also have different accents.\n\nThe game also doesn't lack in the creativity department. One mintue you will be leaping from rooftops in Mafia town and the next you will be running throug a train on a movie set. The game never seems to stop surprising us with it's colorful and interesting locations. \n\nUnfortunately, this is where the pros end and the cons begin.\n\nThe controls are OK, they are not perfect but they work as best as they could considering the engine the game was made in. Unreal Engine just isn't a great choice to make such a game but, to the developers' credit, they did make it as best as they could, which I can respect.\n\nHowever, this brings us to my biggest problem with the game. When I saw the trailer, I immediately thought of Banjo Kazooie, Yooka Laylee and Super Mario 64. A 3D collect-a-thon. And sure enough, that is what the game wants you to belive it is. \n\nThe main goal of the game is to collect 40 collectables. As I mentioned before, I love games where the main objective is to collect things, so I was very surprised that the very first world, Mafia Town, was so big, vast, beautiful and yet, there was little point in exploring it.\n\n The case is the same with all other levels. They are begging to be filled with collectables, things to do, side-quests and activities, yet they all have one goal, which can sometimes be completed in less than 5 minutes. \n\nYou have hourglasses, which are your main objectives and once you collect one, the level ends. Scattered around the level are marbles, which act as a currency. You use these marbles to buy badges. Scattered around are also yarn balls which are used to make hats.\n\n While it seems like a lot, only the hourglasses are important. The rest of the things are just kinda, there. For instance, the yarn balls are needed to make hats which give you powers, that you need. I never counted but I would say that there are about 20-30 yarn balls on each level. The sad thing is, you only need about 3-5 of them to build most of your hats and collecting the rest just gives you extra yarn, which feels a bit dissapointing.\n\n During my first few hours, I was collecting everything and in the end, I felt like I had only wasted time because only the Hourglasses mattered. So, quite honestly, this game isn't really a collecta-a-thon, but a 3D platformer and there is nothing wrong with a 3D platformer, provided it's done well, and it isn't, at least in my opinion.\n\nLike I said before, the controls are as best as they could be on the engine the game was based on. This makes the controls great for exploring but not so great for platforming. The main character moves like her feet are made of butter. She zips everywhere really fast and the jumping controls are sometimes too... jumpy. Often at times, I was able to find an easier, chepear way to get to my destination just by exploiting the flowyness of the controls. There were sections that required me to use power-ups I din't have to get over long gaps, but I was able to do it with a well timed running jump followed with a dash. It doesn't sound so bad, but when you notice that the game wants to be restrictive and yet you find a way around it, your immersion starts to fade. \n\nThis is especially noticable during the middle of the game, where the game becomes much more linear and the platforming takes a bigger focus. There are sections made much harder than they look simply because of the controls. \nClimbing a large three in word 3 was much harder than it should have been because of the controls. \n\nI want to mention that the controls work the same way as they do in Yooka Laylee. In Yooka Laylee, such controls weren't the problem because the majority of the game didn't have tight platforming like A Hat in Time has, thus I couldn't complain about them, even if they were flowy just like they are here.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me more than it should have were the boss fights. The bosses aren't hard. They all have predicatble patterns just like in most games of this type. They are memorable and fun to do, but they take way too long. One boss fight can go on for around 10 minutes because of how much hits they can take.Seriously, it's ridiculous. I found myself shouting at the screen going \"How is this boss still not dead?\" after hitting several bosses over 20 times and yet they just kept getting up and getting more powerful. \n\nThe badges you collect range from useless to essential. The hook-shot badge, for example, is essential for progressing through the game while the one-hit-death badge just makes the game harder. Unfortunately, most of them fall in the latter category and feel like a wasted opportunity. \n\nThe game, only has a couple of power ups, which seems dissapointing. I really thought that the game would have more. The power ups come in form of hats, which look cute and are an interesting way of showing which power up you currently have equiped. Out of all of them, I only ever seemed to use the speed power up, just to get through the levels faster. The rest of them were just context sensitive.\n\nAs far game optimization is concerned I don't have too many complaints. I experienced some frame-rate dips (one time, the character wentinto an elevator and the game froze and continued to run at 2 fps, but it continued running fine afterwards) and there were no game crashes. I am surprised that the game has a bunch of graphical options but not an option to redifine keys (still, nothing a patch can't fix).\n\nThe game is also short. With only 40 levels (some of which can be done in less than 10 minutes) and only 4 words, it feels very short. Especially when you consider the price.\n\nMy biggest issue with this game is the praise it is getting. While this game does deserve some of the praise it is getting, nobody should be able to say that it's better than Yooka Laylee, beacause it simply isn't. Don't get me wrong, Yooka-Laylee wasn't perfect and it had problems but so does this game. Let's at least be fair and acknowledge that \"A hat in time\" has just as many, if not more, problms just like Yooka-Laylee. \n\nThat's my review of this game. It's not bad, but it's not great either. Honestly, if you are in the mood for a 3D platformer, you could do so much worse than this one. If you can handle the loose controls and aren't too bothered by collecatbles (or their lack off) you might just find a somewhat exciting adventure. \n\nBut for the price I paid (28 euros), this game is simply NOT WORTH IT. For HALF that price, the game is worth it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1508458876, "timestamp_updated": 1508458876, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530679", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35852025": {"recommendationid": "35852025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195063154", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509759310}, "language": "english", "review": "A hat in time may be one of the best games ever created.

Hat girl just controls incredibly, and it all flows to gether well. This is complimented by good and uniqe level design. The boss fights are memorable and amzing like everything else. The game took me 15 hrs to 100% and i instantly wanted to replay it. On top of  this Co-op comes soon, 2 new entire worlds, and mod support is in beta, not to mention the unbelivable amount of customization and unlocks. The games little extra challenge levels are a nice simple little chalenge and break from the gameplay, but every world has one thats themed for that world. Within that level, which is split into small parts, you can find little pictures, and at the end, forms a little mini slideshow that reveals the story of that area and its main characters and boss. Some really hit you in feels, and they remind me of that awesome mechanic from The Cave, another one of my favorite games. Although these slide are EXTREMELY hidden and hard to find.

The game follows the aptly named Hat Kid as she searches for her ship's lost power supply on an alien planet so that she can return home from... somewhere to...somewhere. It isn't ever actually explained. The game's gimmicks are hats that grant different abilities when worn, offering things like increased movement speed and different attacks, along with badges that add new abilites or enhance old ones.\n\nI'll list the game's pros first, then cons.\n\nFirst off, the graphics. The game is beautifully stylized, especially when running on uncapped frames, really making you feel as if you've travelled back to the gamecube days. From haunted forests to seaside cities, the game offers the perfect mix of old and new. The level of care that went into the visuals can be truly impressive sometimes, even to the point where nearly every mission has its own unique artwork on the loading screen before it. The sound design is excellent too, with punchy, fitting effects for everything from smacking an enemy to simply running around. \n\nEach Level is completely distinct, standing in stark contrast to one another and adding amazing variety to a somewhat shorter game. You'll traipse through movie sets, coastal towns, haunted woods and more to retrieve the time pieces, which then extend the areas by adding bonus levels whose entrances are hidden somewhere in the overworld to find. Even more interestingly, during certain bonus levels you can hunt for pictures during each stage. Collecting every one unlocks an expositional slideshow a la psychonauts, telling the stories of certain charcters you meet on your journey. \n(A godsend for a game with such a thin plotline) (also, prepare for feels)\n\nThe voice acting is (for the most part) really good for an indie game, with some characters sounding better than some characters in big AAA games. (Looking at you, Mass Effect: Andromeda.) And since a good 90% of all dialogue in the game is spoken, having bad acting could have crippled its humor by forcing players to skip through it.\n\nThe game has a ton of wit sewn into everything, with self aware humor and tongue-in-cheek laughs galour, with some simple stuff mixed in as well to keep everyone giggling all throughout with very few jokes that fall flat. Also kudos to the devs for making a horror sequence in a cute 3D platformer that actually manages to be quite terrifying. \n\nAnd the MUSIC. Amazing, one of the best game soundtracks I've ever heard. Every song fits the situation perfectly and occasionally had me standing still for a few minutes or replaying missions just to hear every note.\n\nNow for The gameplay.\n\nSimply put, this game is DAMN fun to play.\n\nThe controls for every facet of gameplay are near flawless, while feeling familiar to anyone who have played the 3D mario games. (Especially with the dive move that looks and feels eerily similar to that of a certain plumber.) Platforming also has the the right amount of weight, striking a perfect balance for every precarious platform you'll jump accross. \n\nNext, the main character is friggin' adorable. Whether making faces at the mafia or running around posing for pictures, to skipping along as she leads a parade, Hat Kid is sure to make you smile whenever she's on screen from her sheer cuteness. (So no false advertising in that regard) She even shows a more sarcastic and jaded side in some of her musings and character interactions, which makes her all the more endearing. You know you've designed a good character when they can scream \"Down with the mafia!\" and start beating people to death with an umbrella and still have it be adorable.\n\nNow the cons.\n\nIf you're looking for a gripping story, you won't find one here. Like the games before it, this game doesn't just put narrative in the back seat to gameplay, it hits narrative with a shovel, ties it up and stuffs it in the trunk, having very little story other than \"You see that shiny thing? Go grab it!\" While this does keep it in ranks with games like mario in this regard, it's a shame that the story wasn't more flushed out, as not only did it have potential, but let's be honest, thin narrative gets old after 30 years. Also, if you peer between the cracks, you can see they were trying a bit too hard to be the next undertale, [spoiler] which is made more apparent when the game culminates into an incredibly corny ending that smells a bit too similar to be coincidence. But since the characters are only seen in a max of 6 short levels, their supposed sacrifices lose any weight they could have had and instead just come accross as forced and clich\u00e9d [/spoiler]\n\n The side characters are flat and simple, but they do their purpose well and have good acting, so I can give them a pass in that regard. (Except for mustache girl, whose teeth marks you can see all over the scenery) But unfortunately, Hat Kid is a kind of character that I cannot excuse after they've been around this long: A silent protagonist. That means that her only communication during cutscenes are nods and facial expressions and in normal conversations, she just stands there with a dumb look on her face, robbing her of a ton of potential character. And the thing is, she speaks full sentences during gameplay, has a journal you can read, and even narrates the game's steam trading cards, so there's no excuse for this trope to be continuing in a non-rpg game.\n\nSome animations in places look awful, with such notable examples as characters that open their mouths to speak during cutscenes, keeping them open all throughout, and then flail around like they're having a stroke, as well as Hat Kid's facial features looking like stickers stuck to a blank face. I know it's supposed to be stylized, but at one point she stuck her tongue out in a cutscene and it looked as if she just slapped some red tape down her face.\n\nWhile the gameplay is near flawless, there are some poor desisions that keep it from being so. Games that take staple abilities such as a magnet effect for picking up drops or negating fall damage in a game about jumping and falling and making them unlockable abilites that take up slots to equip are unneccesarily complicating things. At the very least, if you're going to make the abilites unlockable, make it so you can equip them all rather than a maximum of 3 at a time. Also, while the platforming itself is tight and fluid, wall jumping can be tedious. When wall jumping, your movement is locked in place with you being unable to jump away in any direction other than dead straight, which can lead to some frustrating deaths and time-consuming falls. \n\nAlso, bugs. obviously with indie games the devs can't spend nearly as much on playtesting as larger companies, but that being said, the game is still full of game breaking stuck-spots, especially in Mafia Town. Spots in the environment you can end up in accidentally that stick you in place are frustrating to deal with, and while most of these spots can be escaped by wiggling and button mashing, some lock you in for good, forcing you to quit back to the hub and abandon all your progress on your current mission and start over.\n\nAlright, time to recap, (puns intended)\nThe Pros:\n+tight, fun, responsive gameplay\n+amazing level design\n+good amount of content for the price\n+near perfect soundtrack\n+quirky side chars\n+adorable main char\n+stylized graphics\n+constant nostalgia rush\n\nCons:\n-gameplay needlessly complicated at times\n-mustache girl's scenery chewing\n-silent protagonist\n-some ugly animations\n-thin, cheesy story\n\nI give A Hat In Time a 9/10, as it sets the bar high for modern 3D platformers and indie games in general with very few significant slip ups.

Its a genre thats very picky to have a good experience in.\n\nA hat in times' biggest secret is its length and overall presentation. By the time the game was starting to feel too long and wearing out its welcome I was at the end of the game facing the final boss with all time pieces in tow. My first play through lasted 13 hours and I am likely one of the slower ones. Instead of having a million collectables  and padding out the middle, aHiT focuses on a formula closer to mario 64 with its core collectable, Time pieces being the \"stars\" of this game and only two other collectables, gems and yarn.\n\nLets talk about the yarn and gems, because this is another thing kind of unique that makes this a more casual fun 3d platformer. gems are needed to do most basic unlocking tasks, but as long as you're pretty much collecting them as you see them, you should almost never have to farm these as I just collected them as I saw them and had bought everything out plus having about 2400 extra by the end of the game. \n\nYarn is another aspect, they are used to make hats which are your powers in this game, the powers overall are fun to use but one complaint I have is most of them are a one trick horse, which results in you switching hats constantly to get to places, I'll chalk it up to this being the best way they could do the powers in hats but it would have been neat to have some combined hats later, overall this is a minor complaint. To unlock a hat you need to locate atleast one of its hat type's yarn.\n\nWhich brings us to the most interesting thing about these collectables, in most collectathons any collectable is finite and you clear the map looking for these reasources, but in this game gems respawn infinitely everytime a world is loaded and yarn only needs atleast one of the hat type, the rest can be made up of all other kinds of yarn with the game having finite but almost double the amount of yarn in the game it takes to make all the hats. This allows a very leisurely approach to the power-up and collection system which is not a perfect solution to the collectathon woes but its definitely not a bad idea either.\n\nThe game only currently boasts 4 worlds with more planned as kick starter stretch goals are finished, right around the 4th world is were I was getting a little tired of the game, but it also wasn't my favorite world to be honest also lacking a great boss fight. The other 3 worlds have interesting things going on with very fun boss fights and music tracks to go with them, I don't want to underplay the bosses so I'll say it twice, the boss fights are awesome.\n\nWith Yooka and now this coming out being excellent, are we in a 3d platforming renaissance?

The game starts you off in a hub world and you use time pieces you collect throughout the various levels to unlock new areas. A Hat In Time has 5 worlds: mafia town, battle of the birds, subcon forest, alpine skyline, and time's end. These worlds have multiple acts that take place in the same stages but with slight alterations. This design choice reminds me of super mario sunshine and mario sunshine is a very apt comparison to A Hat In Time.\n\nThe most important aspect of a collect-a-thon platformer is by far good controls and a good camera. A Hat In Time has wicked slick and tight controls. Precise jumps are easy to land and when you get accustomed to your jump distances the game rewards fast, technical movement. Each of the levels feel like they have super clean movement flow when you run, jump, dive, dive-cancel, and wall jump through them. The camera is also stellar for the most part and the options menu even has camera distance preferences you can set. I never changed the camera settings because I thought they were fine but you may get more enjoyment out of tweaking the camera. A hat in time nails it's controls and it feels great to play.\n\nThe levels in a hat in time are generally really good. I think battle of the birds is the weakest segment platforming wise because the levels are too linear and too boxed in. This setup works great in one level of battle of the birds but the rest of the act is pretty underwhelming. Boss fights are hit and miss. None of the boss fights are hard or even challenging, but some are definitely more fun than others.\n\nThe sound is great. the music is pretty good.\n\nOn to the bad,\nthe game has some technical issues. I experienced a crash right before I landed the final hit on the first boss(Chef Mafia.) I noticed the water in mafia town would sometimes just freak out for no reason. Also I got stuck inside one of chef mafia's attacks and I couldn't take damage and I couldn't get out so I had to restart the whole level. luckily boss levels are usually short so at least it didn't take awhile to get back but it was annoying.\n\nOverall, A Hat In Time is an 8.5/10 game. the experience is great and I 100%-ed the game but I can't gelp but feel like the design of battle of the birds was a little underwhelming and the technical issues dampened the experience for me a little.

If you enjoy oldschool 3D platformer collectathons, this is the game for you. Very sweet, endearing and polished as heck.\n\nThis is probably my favourite game of 2017.\n\nThe addition of the badges goes a long way to making each playstyle matter but I did find myself only ever using the same three. \n\nThe voice-over babble badge should have been an option in the settings menu. It's silly to have to forego a badge slot just for that. I do understand the developer wanted to value the voice-actors they've paid to have but options should always be \"free\", so to speak. There is no sense in having mechanical implications in this case.\n\nWhile I do miss the Mario triple jump -- which I think should have been added -- I still think the freedom of movement and diversity of approaches to all situations make this game immensely fun to replay and speedrun. \n\nI think some Rifts / Artifacts could use a little bit of polishing in regards to conveyance: The purple rift in Subcon Forest stumped me for quite a while and for no good reason, in my opinion.\n\nThe game is wonderfully well optimized, running incredibly well even on my mid-low-end laptop. It plays awesome at minimum settings and it looks absolutely beautiful at max.\n\nThe only thing I should say that I didn't like is that Moustache Girl doesn't really pop up very often in the story at all. If she had more speaking roles or showed up to be a nuissance more often, it would really go a long way toward making her a cool little rival. As it stands, it kinda feels like she just shows up, is implied to be important to the plot, and then shows up again at the end for no reason. Of course, this game's story is not very important since its mechanics, visuals, polish and overall fun factor really do carry it, but regardless of that, if Moustache Girl had seen some more involvement, the game would be that little bit more superior.\n\nIf you like cute as heck characters and if you enjoy enthralling platformers and miss the old days of Mario Sunshine, Banjo Kazooie, Super Mario 64 and even a little bit of Spyro, grab this pronto. You really don't need to question that anymore.\n\n---\n\nI do feel compelled to state that the developer was recently implicated in some drama regarding theft of artistic property as well as doxxing of a fellow developer.

I never had an instance where I felt that I messed up because of crappy controls.  \n\nUnlike what people have said about Yooka Laylee and how souless and bland that game seemed to be (I have not yet played Yooka Laylee when I wrote this, I'm going off the general consensus on that game) this game has plenty of diversity and soul.  Each chapter in the game has unique gameplay aspects to keep each chapter feeling fresh.  The collectables are well placed and actually have a point.  \n\nHat kid is extremely expressive and adorable.  Despite being the pilot of a space ship and from what I can tell, advanced intellect based on the stuff in her ships Machine Room, she still has the childish attitude that you would expect from her.  \n\n The voice acting is very well done.  Yes, unimportant characters share the same voice actor, but in a way, it kinda adds more charm to the game.  The unique characters you meet in the game are voiced fantastically.  (if you would rather have the blabbering from Banjo Kazooie, there is an item in the game that makes everyone talk like that, and if you hate voice acting, then turn it off!)  \n\nYes, some people are saying the game is a bit light on content, but keep in mind that there will be 2 free expansions that will come later that will add a few hours on to the game.  And in addition to that, there is also Workshop support now, so provided that the modding community stays active, you will have plenty of content to play around with.  \n\nI can understand why people arent happy with the 30 dollar price tag on the game.

Both to be enjoyed on its own merits, and so that when I complain about Yooka-Laylee and people retort with \"well, what did you expect\", I can point to [b]THIS.[/b] Playtonic's lukewarm showing was enough to make people start questioning whether the 3D collectathon platformer genre really was so fundamentally overwrought in design that it could only truly have been successful in the 90's, but thanks to this we finally have proof positive to the contrary.\n\nThe worlds are actually populated with well written characters who feel like they belong in their respective environments. There's a reasonable population of fodder enemies who aren't a chore to engage with, and pickups that draw your eye to unexplored areas. There are unique setpieces all over the place that flow naturally with the game design rather than sticking out like a sore thumb. Worlds are large without feeling barren. The platforming is quite snappy and precise (even while sprinting, and you don't need to worry about a dumb stamina meter). It's just plain [i]fun.[/i] On top of this, there's a crazy amount of modding support, and the promise of co-op and two MORE worlds in free future updates!\n\nThere are minor issues like lack of control remapping, a better-yet-imperfect camera system, and getting stuck on odd bits of geometry. Some of the voice acting grates a little bit. I can sympathize with the people who followed this through its alpha stages and lament the content that ended up on the cutting room floor; some of that stuff sounded pretty awesome. Perhaps most gratingly, objective markers will lead you by the nose to some places that you'll want to find for yourself.

The game has a sort of childish innocence about it, looking at the world without cynicism. You could plop your kid in front of this game and they'd LOVE it, BUT it still has jokes for adults. My favorites are about \"ethical consumption under capitalism\" and some wanna-be writer's failing marriage.\n\nThe game is fun, I beat it in about 14 hours with a controller (39 hourglasses), though on the whole it's pretty easy. The hardest parts are where the game locks the camera and it disorients and works against you. The camera angles aren't janky and are manageable, which put me off of Pyschonauts. There are a couple camera issues, and most of the difficulty actually comes from the jarring difference between locked and unlocked camera. \n\nThe game controls and performs pretty smoothly most of the time, though there was some stuttering and buggy hitboxes during some of the boss battles, especially the Mafia don. Also there are times when it's hard to tell the trajectory of a jump due to weird depth perception. This is most apparent in the Forest level (AND THAT FUCKING BIG TREE).\n\nTh.e level design is decent, each of the worlds you can access from the hub have their own \"thing\" so each level doesn't get repetitive. The later levels start to get really large and spread-out, like the forest and Alpine Heights get pretty confusing to navigate.\n\nThe soundtrack by Grant Kirkhope is AMAZING.

When I lost in the game it was completely on me.\n The movement, as well as the platforming is very satisfying as well, a lot of the game I couldn't help but use the sprint hat a lot of the time because it was enjoyable to get through the levels at high speed while climbing and leaping everywhere. \n\nThe general art style for the game is very nice as well. A Hat in Time is a very good example that shows that a game doens't need to have AAA graphics to be a fun game. It has pretty low requirements so anyone with a computer from 2015 and after can enjoy it without any framedrops. The general art style for the game is very nice as well. It's a cute style that is really nice to look at, and nothing in the game really looks out of place. \n\nAlthough, the story may not make a whole lot of sense, especially towards the last half of the game. \nSPOILER WARNING\n[spoiler] The last level is kind of just thrown at you out of no where and its really surprising that only need 25 hourglasses to get there out of the short 40 there are in the game total.

When I first heard about the game I saw a few gameplay videos but it was still in beta. I decided to wait until the game officially released and forgot about it. When the game finally came out it was time to try it out.\n\nFirst off, the overall look and feel of the game is amazing. Aesthetically the graphics are nothing short of gorgeous, gameplay wise everything feels responsive and the controls are tight. It feels really satisfying to play.\nThe game features different worlds which all have different chapters and themes. You'll find there is a good mixture of visual/audio design going on which can create a breathtaking atmosphere in some cases.\n\nThe story isn't particularly complex, but it has a few very nice moments. For this type of game I don't think a deep story is needed anyway. Again, the atmosphere in the game does a nice job of setting the stage for those moments to shine through.\n\nAs far as the actual gameplay goes, I can't stress enough how good it is. It borrows elements from other classic games and mashes them together in a good way. You'll never feel stuff is just in for nostalgic reasons because it works really well. But it also brings in a bunch of new gameplay mechanics. What I'm trying to say here is that this game doesn't try too hard to be Retro, it just takes all the right things from older games and builds upon that. The chapters are all unique enough and it never gets repetitive. Really great game design.\n\nAll in all, there is plenty of fun to be had in A Hat In Time and there's still more coming at the time of writing. 2 new worlds will be added next year and online + local co-op is planned as well. This game also welcomes mods, so I assume we're going to see a lot of cool custom levels in the future.\nAt the price it's selling for it's an absolute steal. If you love the oldschool platformers from the N64 you will most definitely enjoy A Hat In Time.\n\ntl;dr: Get it.

This game is well made and crafted with a stromg love of 3D platformers. The environemnts are fun to explore, there are plenty of collectibles and the story is well told and funny. That's the positive.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that the camera is pretty awful, it rarely allowed me look where I wanted and was a large struggle. This should not be a problem with plaformers, If I need to look down the camera should allow it without too much fuss. Yooka-Laylee defintely did not have as large of a problem here on release. I hope they come back and patch the camera to operate with more of a free view than a wonky limited camera. A few other things worth noting; as a collect-a-thon the game has no way to track what you've collected in levels. A bit of an oversigjht, I believe, especially for a game where you're running around collecting a variety of stuff in each level. My last point is that there is no mini-map aside from one badge you can get, which is crazily cryptic. I still managed my way around most levels fine. The map would only really be useful in a couple of the larger worlds like the first and fourth, which are more open world and less linear. \n\nOverall, there isn't a whole lot more to say. The game for the most part is well made. The controls are fairly tight aside from the camera issues, the music blends seemlessly with the every level, the npc's are a blast to interact with, the environments are fun to explore for collecables, and the game ran fantastically. I was easily getting well over 300fps in every level. The game is also shorter with less variety than Yooka-Laylee. I was expecting a little more considering its development time, but what is there is a lot of fun.

Had there been 1-2 extra worlds it would've had a perfect length, but with only 4 present it seems like you finish just as you've gotten the hang of it. Knowing that there are plans to release extra worlds as free DLC, it seems to me that this was the initial intention of the developer, but they ran out of time (and/or money).\n\n[*]The controls aren't as responsive as I would've liked. They're certainly not the worst I've ever experienced, however they do feel rather \"floaty\".\n\n[*]There is no real difficulty in the game, everything is fairly easy. This is extended to boss fights too, as health is constantly dished out without any further thought.\n\n[*]The design of some of the time rifts (A sort of 'bonus' level) is rather repetitive, and the recycled aesthetic quickly becomes boring.\n\n[*]There are plently of collectable yarn balls, with a variety of small challenges to go with them. But there's seemingly no way of tracking how many are left in the level, and there's no reward for collecting them. They appear to be solely for making hats, which is really disappointing. Similarly, not all rift tokens show up on the map, and there seems to be no way of tracking how many are in a level.\n\n[*]The message \"You're missing a key item\" is used before some levels. This is incredibly unhelpful, as it provides no indicator of what the item is, where to get it, or when you will get it. Thus, players are left wondering whether they missed something, or when they will even be able to play that level to complete the world.\n\n[*]There seems to be a few minor polish issues. When playing the game at 4K I noticed artifacts on the main logo shown during loading screens, and in-game some icons had white borders as if they were dodgy photoshop cutouts. Towards the later parts of the game, dialogue seems to be missing at random points. I am unsure whether or not this is a bug, or because the developers ran out of time. Lastly, in the final level a collectable fell out of a breakable crate into the lava and was seemingly unrecoverable after that, even when quitting and re-entering the level.\n\n[/list]\n\nNow for the good:\n\n[list]\n\n[*]The music is pretty spot-on, and fits in well with each location. It could be argued that perhaps it's a tad generic at times, but that's better than not fitting at all.\n\n[*]Though somewhat spoiled by providing too much health, the boss fights are creative and well-designed.\n\n[*]The levels are very well thought out. Nothing is placed haphazardly, and paths are clearly defined. The theme of the fourth world was particularly creative, and visually impressive. Worlds are sized very well;  they're large enough to encourage exploration, but small enough to prevent getting lost.\n\n[*]There was restraint in terms of the number of and types of hats. Some games seem to go completely over the top with different abilities, but I think A Hat in Time struck a very good balance in the selection provided.\n\n[*]A hub world was included with plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. An absolute must for any good platformer.\n\n[/list]\n\nSo to sum up, for those who buy this game expecting a modern-day platformer markedly better than Yooka-Laylee, I'm afraid you've set yourself up for disappointment. Both games have flaws, just as they have their high points. For some it may be easy to look past these issues, simply because of their love for platforming games.

It has been years since I have been so engrossed in a game that I beat it in one sitting like I did this one (minus having to stop to go to work).\n\nThe good:\n*each level is big and DENSE, somthing most games miss. Open levels/worlds are worthless if there isnt alot to do in them. you dont spend 90% of the game walking to your goal and instead are actually playing the game!\n*the art style is one of the most adorable things I have seen in a long time. everything is cute, and huggable, even in the spooky forest chapter... with one exception but thats a surprise.\n*the detail work is perfect. there are so many little details in gameplay, graphics, design, and more. the second chapter is movie studio themed, and when you beat a level in it there is a small credit crawl with an audiance cheering, only in this chapter. in her bedroom there is a mountan of pillows with a diving board that you litteraly swim in.\n*some of the best bosses in a long time. bosses are open often, and the trick is less staying alive until they are, but avoiding their attacks AND getting your hit in as well.\n*level design is amazing. each chapter is beautiful and diffrent from one another, wheither you are running around on a mafia run island, scaling a mountain peak above the clouds, or solving a mystery on a train.\n*controls are invisible. this is one of those games where the control is so spot on there is no longer a controler in your hand, you just do.\n\nThe bad:\n*(X)This is one of those games where there is never enough. everything was so good while it was satisfying once you beat it you want more, even though this is already longer than most games out there. (EDIT) there is mod support... and it includes levels... this point is now moot\n\n*minor glitches. None game breaking and its a refreshing change of pace to see so few. most were caused by me trying to explore a corner that the devs didnt think anyone could get too, and one that makes the final boss stuck under the floor. but they come back after a bit and the fight continues.\n\noverall I payed 30 for this game but I would still be happy if I had played a full 60, infact this is a game i would have bought an entire console just to play.", "timestamp_created": 1508221257, "timestamp_updated": 1508221595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460583", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35787736": {"recommendationid": "35787736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019330350", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508464840}, "language": "english", "review": "Best of the genre since Mario Sunshine,", "timestamp_created": 1508219057, "timestamp_updated": 1508219057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35787278": {"recommendationid": "35787278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046970544", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508215602}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: Buy this game. Seriously. If you've ever loved 3D platformers, you will love this game.\n\n\nThe long review:\nI can't remember when the last time a game made me feel like a kid again. I seriously got a punch of nostalgia, like I was sitting in front of my gamecube booting up super mario sunshine for the first time. This game was worth every cent, and I will buy /ANY/ DLC that comes out in a heartbeat.   \n\nThe four worlds mix up gameplay in such creative formulas- If you think every level is just hopping around trying to collect items, you will be pleasantly surprised to find out there is so much more than that. From popularity contests, murder mysteries, boss fights, and a god DAMN stealth horror level (seriously, that was terrifying), this game mixes up the classic \"hop and collect\" formula in so many delightful ways. The level design is creative and the artistic direction is beautiful, seriously, the first time you go into Alpine Skyline your breath will be taken away- And it's not just for show, hopping through the gorgeous level is just as delightful. \n\nThe music suits each and every level perfectly, and the way the music's instruments smoothly transition as you switch areas without changing the tune is delightful. Some of the most impactful audio moments for me was in the memory-rift levels, where every time you complete a section a new instrument is added to the tune. It actually made me feel nostalgic for the level, even though I had just been in it minutes ago. \n\nAnd jesus christ, this game is funny. The voice actors all have unique tinges to their voice to carry out their hilarious lines. The characters are all super lovable, the one that stands out to me is the Ghost... Guy, you'll know him when you see him, and all the Mafia men. Applause to the VAs, you guys did a wonderful job. \n\nThere were quite a few small issues, such as the quality of the character models of the two girls being a little awkward, some bugs here and there (a few frustrated me such as my hits not registering to bosses, but it's nothing unplayable), and those GOD DAMN BAND OWLS THAT FOLLOW YOU AND SMACK INTO YOU FHJDSLFS, but they don't impact the experience in any severe way (but you will notice them.)\n\nAnyway, consider me a new huge fan of Gears for Breakfast. I've seriously already begged my friends to buy this game, and if you've made it this far in my review, please pretend I'm begging you to buy it too. Support this studio. This indie game proves to be just as fun as 3D platformers produced by massive companies like Nintendo- And that's amazing.

I will update this review as I play the game, leaving old things I've said in. Anyways, here we go. \n\nA Hat in Time is a 3-D collectathon platformer. It is highly reminescent of the N-64/PS1 era of videogames. I've never actually played Banjo Kazooie or it's sequels, but I do get some serious Mario-64 vibes from this game. The plot is pretty simple, you play as the Hat Girl, who's spaceship has lost it's power source over a strange planet. You have to go through various levels, earning magic hourglasses. \nThe levels are very well designed, and don't feel tedious in the respect of finding collectibles. The only thing you NEED to complete it is the hourglass at the end. However, levels are worth exploring, as  you can buy new abilities, craft new hats, and open safes to find treasure. There are also relics you can find, they unlock stuff on your ship. If you don't explore, you'll breeze through the levels, but that's sort of missing the point. \nAs for gameplay, the devs pretty much nailed it. The controls are easy to learn and feel really fluid, but I can't seem to find a way to change them for keyboard and mouse. Anyways, hat girl controls super well, in and out of combat. The parkour elements are actually fun, not an N64 nightmare. Combat is pretty basic, focusing on using your umbrella to smack foes, and finishing them by jump attacking. This element of the game gets a little old, but isn't frequent enough to matter. \nTo wrap this review up, I'd like to talk style. This game has it. It feels like an honest homage to an earlier generation of games, not a forced emulation of it like some other newer games *cough* Yooka Laylee *cough*. The levels are appealing on the eyes, characters are all entertaining, there's a good sense of humor at work. Also they're actually voiced, not annoying mumbling over text. \nIn conclusion (for now) A Hat in Time is fun, colorful, and genuinely charming. If you enjoyed the \"wild west\" of gaming, than you will enjoy this. Whether you're old or young, this game is easily the second best (at least) game to have goombas as the first enemy on screen. \n\nUpdate 1: I have now played through two whole chapters. There isn't much else to say, besides that the soundtrack for bosses is pretty rad. The snatcher's music is easily best part of his fight.", "timestamp_created": 1508199981, "timestamp_updated": 1509299660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35783604": {"recommendationid": "35783604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053855881", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 219, "last_played": 1514759662}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly, HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone\n\n-The controls are tight\n-The level design is delicious\n-The characters are interesting and enjoyable\n-The scooter is the best badge\n-Is the only game I actually wanted to finish completely\n-Hat Girl is adorable\n\n10/10 great game would and probably will play again.", "timestamp_created": 1508199537, "timestamp_updated": 1508199537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35783518": {"recommendationid": "35783518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081764317", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513289522}, "language": "english", "review": "For a while ive been craving a really good 3D platformer.

[/b]\n\n\nMy experience with gaming on the Mac is that usually, developers take some extra time to release for the Mac or even let other companies like Feral Interactive port it for them to make sure that everything works without issues. Here, it's clear that the developers wanted the product out of the door too quickly and didn't have time to do proper quality control, which unfortunately leaves a number of technical issues open that really make it hard to enjoy at this stage:\n\n[list]\n[*] Menu doesn't work properly: Forward and Back buttons are invisible most of the time and don't work. I had to find out by trial and error that a right click will take you back one menu. This makes me wonder if there has been [i] any [/i] testing done before release?!\n\n[*] Completely broken controller support: Although advertised as having controller support, this game failed to recognise both my Sony brand PS4 controller and non-Microsoft XBox 360 type controller, both of which work perfectly fine in other games. For a 3D platformer controller support should be nothing less than flawless. I still played for a few minutes with mouse and keyboard just to see at least something, which brings me to a minor point...\n\n[*] Mouse sensitivity and control issues: I can't get the sensitivity down to a well playable level, even with my variable DPI mouse set to slowest level. It doesn't help that sometimes the game drops a couple frames just as you try to move, making slick movement impossible.\n\n[*] Graphics glitch: When setting graphics to \"high performance\", the screen gets littered with pixely, green stains, as if a Space Invader just sneezed on your monitor.\n\n[*] Excessively long loading times: I have yet to play a game that was this bad with loading times. Good grief. My SSD reading speed clocks in at 1.8 GB/s, so what the hell are you doing? Even worse, the game is completely frozen when it's loading, with loading screen music cutting out randomly. Even quitting the game takes forever, at some point I just force-quit the sucker because I wasn't sure if it was frozen for good or not.\n\n[/list]\n\nThat's just what I observed during a first couple of minutes of play.

I can honestly say that A Hat in Time has paved its way to nest itself up in the category of what I consider to be legendary platformers - that of the Super Mario series, Crash Bandicoot, and parts from The Legend of Zelda. A Hat in Time is both a visual and audible pleasure to play with its minimalistic depth, intricate and interesting level design, and dynamic atmosphere. I'll be going through most of its strong and weak points to give the game a fair review. In short, the game is a great addition to your platformer library whether you're a newcomer or a veteran to games like this.\n\n\n[h1][b]Graphics: ( 4.5 / 5 )[/b][/h1]\n\nA visual pleasure to go through. From the cool, sky blue skies of Mafia Town to the spooky Fire Spirits of the Subcon Forest, to the flashy stages of Dead Bird Studios to the endless artscapes of the many Time Rifts you'll explore throughout the game, A Hat in Time understands its own identity when it comes to graphics. While some characters feel truly eye-boggling in their own power respect, all of them feel like they truly \"belong there.\" Explosions release simple particle effects, sprinting has its own nice cloud of dust left behind, and water effects are reminiscent of that of an upgraded Zelda's \"Windwaker\" vibe. It's amazingly well done that players may feel a sense of visual overload at times, trying to register all of the events happening at once. I'm having no issue playing the game at a consistent 60 frames. Overall, it looks really damn good.\n\n\n[h1][b]Sound: ( 5 / 5 )[/b][/h1]\n\nAbsolutely top-notch sound quality and design. The voice acting is well-done, though nothing jutted out as being absolutely amazing. Your character has very little dialogue, albeit to simple grunts and the occasional \"hey!\" or \"give it back!\" Moustache girl's voice is piercingly arrogant, and the Snatcher of the Sub-con forest has a nice whimsical tone to shatter his menacing design. Queen Vanessa's voice has the fitting misty, scary screech many of us fear. Combat noises are also incredibly impactful. Punches and umbrella hits have a satisfying \"thud\" noise when hitting enemies. Explosions have a toonish quality to them.\n\nAnd then we come to the music. Oh, the adoring music of the game. Breezy tracks of Mafia Town to the serene pianoscape of the Time Rift. The game never hesitates to establish its atmosphere with music. I can honestly say that the soundtrack is one of its saving graces. The synths in Vanessa's Manor give the game a soothing, yet ominous vibe. The strings in Mafia Town give the game a nice \"oasis-like\" quality. The developers have amassed sounds that resonate quality and quantity of both serene and frightening atmospheres that should be appreciated. \n\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay: ( 5 / 5 )[/b][/h1]\n\nThe game follows the great formula of level-design. It isn't difficult to the point you need to drop your controller frustratingly and take some time off away from it. It doesn't hold your hand through every nook and cranny and give you a railing to lean on every time you're in danger of falling. It \"teaches\" you how the level is supposed to work. The beginning of the level always has a catalyst or key that lays out the rest of the level for you, albeit the difficulty of the level scaling in conjunction with what you're expecting. For example, in the beginning of one level, the game teaches you to hit a certain plant to make certain platforms disappear and others appear. The player learns from that experience and understands, \"ah, so that's how it works.\"\n\nIt's high praise for the game; I personally don't like games that have you choose from three scales of difficulty - easy, normal, and hard. It becomes too strict and only allows for scaling to reach a minimum of certain values, rather than formulates a universal difficulty system where platformer veterans have some adequate challenge to them, while newcomers to the genre don't feel too challenged. No one feels as though the game is too hard. \n\nEvery single level has its own gimmick and idea. Nothing feels repetitive at any time. You could be sneaking through a studio of security guards, or scaring off macho Mafia men. You could be trying to disarm an explosive at the front of a train or running from a ghastly queen. You could be trying to solve a murder mystery in twenty minutes or leading a parade of owls through the rooftops of town. It's an assortment of things to that keep the game feeling fresh and new. I have great respect for the level design and how much fun and depth there is. It's simple, cute, and a blast to play.\n\nI will give the game some critique in its boss fights however. Most of them feel drawn out. There are moments in which I feel as though I've defeated a boss, only to have him continue fighting for another three minutes. While it does provide adequate levels of challenge for the player, it feels more dragged out than it does \"just right.\" There have been multiple times in which I've hit the boss a number of times, and exclaimed \"He's STILL alive?!\" after thinking the fight was pretty much over. \n\nPlatforming, climbing, and jumping controls are smooth, though not always perfect. Rarely do the controls get a bit wonky when navigating a wall or a path, but the \"flow\" of movement is extremely well-done. The game doesn't make mistakes when you're navigating a path. At times you'll even be amazed with how well it flows and how well you perform in doing some interesting stunts with a \"wow, that was pretty cool, did I really do that?\" when controlling Hat Kid.\n\n\n[h1][b]Overall: ( 14.5 / 15 ) = 96%.[/b][/h1]\n\nDefinitely a must-buy. I'd like to even take a step further and say this game is quite possibly a contender for one of my top 5 favorite games of 2017. There's so much depth, fun, and atmosphere with the characters, sounds, and level design. It easily is worth the money it is asking for. The music and movement is a great pleasure to experience, and for the time the game took to develop, it was worth it for the fervent response it is getting today. \n\nThumbs up to the developers and their patience.

Another thing, the characters are just wonderful and cool to be around. yeah they may want to kill you but that's what makes the game even more fun, that you don't realize they want to kill you until they say it, and even then they don't just say \"i want to kill you\" (with the exception of one boss) they usually say it in really witty lines and amazing voice acting. i give this game a very serious 4.4/5 for its reimagination of what 3d platformers are. the ending could've been a little better, but other than that gears for breakfast, you've made a masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1508185418, "timestamp_updated": 1508185418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35780300": {"recommendationid": "35780300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040880081", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1514074211}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply put if it wasn't for Hollow Knight this would be my favorite game of the year.\nIt's got such tight controls, incredible level design and so much charm that I couldn't stop smiling well playing it.

This is a game that needs to be played to understand why so many people like it.\nI'm not going to say this is the best platformer in a long time, but it is certainly a lot more fun than some others I have played this year. It's full of personality, and doesn't feel like a knock-off - instead it finds its own identity through use of unique mechanics and characters.\n\nThe controls are tight, and the level design is, for the most part, solid. The difficulty feels just right for this kind of game. The graphics and presentation are well done - it's not going to \"wow\" anyone, but it has a cute exterior that is pleasing to the eyes. The music is fun and delightful, along with some fairly good voice acting - albeit a bit over-the-top.\n\nHowever, it's not without its faults. I don't feel the hat-switching mechanic is very well thought out - I wish the hats that you stitch were more of an added extension of your abilities that you retain at all times, instead of having to switch between them. Similar to how the hookshot works - even though it's required to have that equipped as well (as a \"badge\" upgrade). It's not a huge problem, but it's something I feel would've helped the flow at times. \n\nIn terms of badges, I'm not a fan of their inclusion either. It doesn't really feel like it belongs, and felt more like a way to pad out the game with more features, or to make it unique. Many of the badges feel rather pointless, making the gems that you collect to buy them lose their value somewhat. You may as well have a spot reserved just for the hookshot, considering how often you need it once you acquire it. Again, not a huge problem, but something I feel is worth noting. There are also only 4 major worlds to visit, which may as a disappointment to some. I wasn't too bothered by it, seeing as this is a fairly ambitious indie game, but it's worth putting out there.\n\nOverall, I don't have a whole lot of problems with the game. There are very clear design choices that were made to evoke memories of past 3D platformers (Mario Sunshine especially), so every now and then it feels a little like something I've already done before. But the game isn't plagued by it, and it's more unique than it is a clone of any sort. I wouldn't say I loved the game, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to the cooperative play to see how that works.\n\nIt's a cute and fun game, and I'd definitely recommend it to any fan of 3D platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1508135962, "timestamp_updated": 1508135962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35766109": {"recommendationid": "35766109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026395239", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "last_played": 1514036202}, "language": "english", "review": "great game easily my #1 of 2017", "timestamp_created": 1508134121, "timestamp_updated": 1508134121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35765675": {"recommendationid": "35765675", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978199491", "num_games_owned": 338, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508131952}, "language": "english", "review": "The only real issue with this game is that there could be more of it.", "timestamp_created": 1508131991, "timestamp_updated": 1508131991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35765638": {"recommendationid": "35765638", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994176164", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511828469}, "language": "english", "review": "Gears For Breakfast, Bolts for Lunch and Bearings for Dinner!\n\nThis game is soo much fun right now and Once the workshop is off the ground and out of beta it sounds like there may be no end in site!\n\nIf you own a steam controller Thats what I used but any xbox pad would serve just as well.", "timestamp_created": 1508131828, "timestamp_updated": 1508131828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35765194": {"recommendationid": "35765194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074438385", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512461711}, "language": "english", "review": "This game... is truly amazing\nFrom the story, to the music, to the gameplay, this game is a work of art\nif you have the money, i reccomend getting it\n\nAlso, bonus points for keeping Jontron (the counter clerk at Dead Bird Studios)", "timestamp_created": 1508129684, "timestamp_updated": 1508649066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35765179": {"recommendationid": "35765179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044510010", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508198986}, "language": "english", "review": "I never knew video games could control so good.

Music is good.\n\nIt suffers from bad design and lack of polish in a worse way than Yooka did (presentation, camera, controls, boss fights) yet for some reason I don't see people talking about this because 'omg, hat kid is so cute.' Cute graphics do not a good game make. The whole thing feels janky and unfished. Story wise; very boring to me and poorly written. On top of this, there isn't really any challenge to this game, and I felt myself getting bored with it very early on. Sometimes the platforming works, sometimes it doesn't, leaving me very frustrated. Smooth platforming is incredibly vital to a 3D platformer as we should all know. Many, many parts of this game were an excersize in frustration.\n\nIt can also get confusing to find where to go next, especially in Subcon Forest and the sky world. At one point in the sky world, I used the hat to find my next time piece, and I went through all the trouble to get it (despite the fact that it looked like the exact route I used to find a previous piece) and after finally getting there, I find that it is indeed a time piece I had already gotten but blacked out. I had no idea that this game would send me to a piece I had already gotten as there was no clear indication. This just makes no sense to me because the \"Finale\" level for the world still isn't accessible and yet the game is sending me to collect time pieces I already have. I have no idea what to do at this point. This is an example of just bad design and confusion that is so pervasive in this game.\n\nThe boss fights were poorly designed as well, especially one which seemed straight up broken to me. It was the second fight in Mafia town, with the cook. There are certain points where you are meant to jump over his head and then press X to dive into it and hurt him. Most of the time this trigger just didn't work, and I ended up having to just touch his hat with my body and also take damage in the process. During the ball rolling phase, I was doing the right thing by climbing up the little crater to get to him and would still take random damage for seemingly no reason. The whole experience felt poorly designed and untested and served to be an incredibly frustrating experience. The other bosses in the game, while not quite as broken as this one, were not well designed either. \n\nIt wasn't all bad, however. There were some fun parts too. Some of the levels looked great, especially the sky world, but many of them (especially world one) felt cluttered and confusing. The game's music is its strongest point. Even if you decide not to play the game, it would be worth it just to give the soundtrack a listen. Really, it's very rare for games these days to have a soundtrack this good. The character design is pretty good overall as well. Some of the voice acting was good, but it was also painful to hear them read the many poorly worded lines.\n\nOverall, I really do not recommend this game and didn't find it worth the frustration or the price tag. If you are a fan of old school platformers, I would recommend getting Yooka-Laylee instead because I found that game much more enjoyable. Very flawed as well, yes, but when it was fun it was a lot more fun than this game. To the general gaming public, I wouldn't recommend either of these games. Save your money for something with better quality.\n\nIt really feels like there's something missing when I'm playing this game knowing it has 98% positive; every time I start it up I get frustrated. It honestly feels like I am playing a different game than the rest of you. I understand that they had little funding and are an indie studio, but they also spent 5 years on this, and that price does NOT reflect the quality.

Hat Girl is too cute. Movement feels /so/ good. The 3d jumping just feels /natural/ and flows so well, it works how your mind just assumes it should work.

There's a forgivingness to the controls that make it so you don't accidentally run off platforms - or you can catch yourself and recover even if you do. At the same time it gives you great precision while also not being punishing for little mistakes like holding forwards a little too long after landing from a jump.\n\nThe game is also charming as heck and looks beautiful. I felt compelled to collect every time piece and go after every ball of yarn, just because it was fun to do so.\n\nI would highly recommend this game, especially if you remember the good ol' days of 3d platformers like Mario 64/Sunshine and Banjo Kazooie, or if you'd like to see a modern take on 'that kind of game'.\nAnd if you don't have experience with previous-gen 3d platformers, playing A Hat in Time may give you a good insight into what the fuss was all about!\n\nThis game is filled with heart and I love it.", "timestamp_created": 1508112244, "timestamp_updated": 1508112488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35761142": {"recommendationid": "35761142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028550457", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508461343}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is extremely well polished.

Throwback to times when 3D platformers were good. Huge interesting levels with a unique artstyle and imaginative gameplay besides just collecting things. In a lot of places it's giving me a lot of Psychonauts vibes. It also runs super smooth, looks pretty as heck (and too damn cute :P) and it's fast and fluid to control. Overall just very refreshing and fun to play. Doesn't cease to run out of steam and amaze with all the new worlds it's thrown at me.\n\nEDIT: Since I beat the game and I'm still playing it, thought this review deserved a re-write:\n\nFor a small indie team and a kickstarter game this is amazing. Best platformer I've played in a very long time, and it rekindled my interest in 3D platforming all over again, probably since Psychonauts.\nArt direction and soundtrack are fantastic and the controls are very fluid, bouncy and never managed to annoy me through the course of the game. There's some learning curve to get used to the sliding and such but it feels rewarding to master.\nI think the real highlights of the game are its creative worlds however, no world plays the same and you're really missing out if you only play through the first one. While the core gameplay stays the same, level design varies massively from open-ended, exploration focused levels with a single goal to more scripted puzzle-like interiors, mysterious forests to even horror sequences, or complete free roam in a massive mountain. For a super cutesy game there's quite a lot of dark humour in it as well, and the game never fails to make you smile. And the Hat Kid is just the best, I love her personality how she's just going around doing whatever she wants and doesn't even let such things as (spoiler?) losing her soul get in her way :P  \n\nYou even get some choices in places which was surprising (I don't recall a platformer where I questioned 'if I did the right thing'), and you are free to progress the game in whatever pace you like. I was never bored and if I felt like switching to a different world, I could do so anytime.\nI got a lot of Psychonauts vibes from the game in places and that's even intended with \"memory vaults\" at the end of certain time rifts unlocking additional backstory to the worlds and overall the level design felt similar, the time rifts might as well be mental worlds, not to mention the crow agents in various levels.\nThere's just something about the game that hooked me into playing it, and very few games have managed that. I wanted to 100% it immediately on my first playthrough and may even start a second just to see what I missed. It's just fun and refreshing to play for the heck of it and made with love, as games should be.\n\nWorkshop support for the game already looks solid and there's quite a few very nice user created levels.

Hat kid controls like a dream. Soon I discovered how satisfying it was to jump around the world and explore every nook and cranny. First I was jumping on suprisingly funny mafia members, and in the next moment sneaking around in a bird movie studio. As I was going on my merry way and the following part https://youtu.be/YQy9_J-9F7o?t=1m12s (1:12) of the bird studio song hit my ears, I knew this game was going to be very memorable.\n\nIt took me back to the days I explored Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, Banjo and Kazooie, Wind Waker,  Spyro, even jack and dexter to some extent, for the first time again. All while being something new, not a copy cat, nor a nostalgic cashgrab. A Hat in Time is very much it's own game, and builds on all the good characteristics of the games I adore.  \n\nThe game features some puzzles akin to those one might see in good nintendo games by being very creative and adding layers of complexity as you progress. The third chapter was my favourite. It had great atmosphere, platforming, missions, dialouge and polish. I'll not spoil anything, but trust me it's great.\n\nAs of the time of writing, it has some minor flaws in form the form of some small bugs and minor polish at the later sections of the game, but the team is currently patching that stuff it seems. Having said that, the team is also working on adding in the strech goals from their kickstarter campaign, which includes free updates with co-op. They're even going to add two extra worlds later on, which makes me happy as I'm now severly hungry for more.\n\nI highly recommend this game. It was entertaining, cute, and embodies all the good parts of past 3d-platformers and \"collect-a-thons\". The music is great, the controls are tight and excellent when combined with the many diffrent moves you can execute. The visuals are also nice. \n\nThanks for the experience Gears for Breakfast, I really hope this game does well for you, and that you are able to iron out the bugs!", "timestamp_created": 1508101534, "timestamp_updated": 1508102418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35758429": {"recommendationid": "35758429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043895356", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509590592}, "language": "english", "review": "A Hat In Time is one of the best 3D platformer games I've ever played.

However, there are just so many, in my opinion, downsides to this game:\n\nFirst of, the controls and movement\n[list]\n    [*]The developer recognized how important a good [b]camera[/b] is in a 3D platformer, so they decided to dedicate a lot of resources into making one. It is supposed to predict your movement and adapt to fit it as best as it could. Whether it does it or not, I never noticed. I did noticed how at times, it just zooms in when you are in tight spaces and close to a higher ground ledge, so it becomes impossible to traverse without opportunity to look at your surroundings. Furthermore, you can't look up or down, so forget about wanting to see what is below you when jumping or what would be a good way up unless you get really far away. \n\n    [*]Hat kid will automatically run up a wall if you give the slightest nodge in that direction. And then, pressing the jump button will only make her jump in the opposite direction, which makes you lose a lot of control unless you take your time moving around. This leads more often than not, to many cheap deaths especially in the Time Rift levels.\n\n    [*]One of the greates challenges in 3D platformers is guessing how much deep you are moving into the camera plane, Mario 64 did a good try at solving this by making your shadow perfectly visible in every surface beneath him. Needless to say, in A Hat In Time, it is extremely hard to do so when the ground or platform you are aiming at is of any dark color or shade. You will notice this when trying to bounce from ballons. \n\n[/list]\n\nEven though it is not officially advertised as a \"collect-a-thon\" game, many people categorized it like such. I fail to understand why, however\n\n[list]\n\n    [*]The game breaks the most important convention for a  \"collect-a-thon\": it doesn't allow you to just go into a level and collect stuff. You have to select a mission and deviate from it if you want to see the entire level, hoping the story doesn't make sections innacessible (For example, at some point the Mafia island floods with lava, leaving all the lowest part innaccesible).\n\n    [*]There isn't really much to collect, just yarn. The game does try to add other stuff to grab, but even at that it fails to make it worthwhile. The tickets for vaults won't save between sessions, so you have to pick them in one go. Not that it is hard, given that if you touch the vault, it will lead you to all the ticket locations. Sadly, there is nothing especial inside them. The green stuff that is used as currency just respawns, so you can't collect it entirely from one level. You can grind it easily, so there is no need to run around looking for it. \n\n[/list]\n\nStory and handholding\n[list]\n    \n    [*]The game wants to push its story telling far, which is nice. Some beats are enjoyable, even if all are extremely short. This however, is done in a manner that makes an open world useless, given that you have to pick a story act/mission to get into the level. The open world can't even be used as a way to get to the objective as you get dropped right in front of it anyway.\n\n    [*]Speaking of objectives, reaching them is not satisfying at all, because you have your hat that just shows you where it is, there is a huge icon always visible indicating the same information, and characters also tell what you have to do. You will be following this like a zombie that gets handholded by the developers throught the tiny beats of story. \n  \n[/list]\n\nThe price tag isn't really justifiable for me, I never really had much fun and became frustrated after a couple hours. Levels (unlike what is said in the store description) are not big...at all. And there is only 5 of them. Wait for a sale if you are really a fan of the genre.

True, it's not as big as, say, Super Mario Galaxy, but each of the current four chapters (and the final one, Time's End) feels unique just as the developers intended.

After a breach in her ship, she must scout the planet below in search of 'Time Pieces' that fuel her ship. Along the way she meets a hilarious cast fo colorful characters, that etheir aid her, try to stop her, or both at times!\n\nAs said before, the game is remarkably charming and simple, and breaks the mold of Kickstarter games being bad or the developers not delievering on what they promised. As for who it plays, the game is incredibly fun, and plays very smoothly, never once did I notice any dips in the quality or performance!\n\nIn the end, \"A Hat in Time\" is a fantastic game!

From the moment I started playing until the moment I completed the final level I've had nothing but good ol' fun with this game.\n\nAll levels are different and clearly a lot of thought and passion went into creating them. And when I say \"different\", I really do mean many of the levels will make you think you stepped into a different game. Gameplay, Music, Enemies, Atmosphere. Gears for Breakfast nailed every aspect of the game.\n\n\nA Hat in Time doesn't try to be anything except fun. But when it tries to be a scary game, it's scarier than most. When it tries to be \"stealthy\", the mechanics are more fun than most stealth games. And when the game tries to be funny, it's funnier than most.\n\nAlthough the game isn't particularly long (it took me 10 hours to get to 100% completion), it's more than worth it. If the developers had priced the game at 60 dollars and I knew what I was buying, I would be more than happy to pay that amount.\n\n\n\nDefinitely one of my favourite games and probably one of the only games I'll bother getting the Steam achievements for.\n\nNot a very constructive review, but I wanted to give this amazing game its due credit.", "timestamp_created": 1508083149, "timestamp_updated": 1508083333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35751188": {"recommendationid": "35751188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078317925", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508680040}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good 3d platformer.

The fact that the developers are not spineless cowards, letting themselves being bullied by an overemotional minority of crybabies earns them my respect!\n\nNow to the game itself:\nI started playing it with absolutely no expectations whatsoever, but I knew that I enjoyed Rayman 2 and 3 in the past and A Hat in Time reminded me very much of these games as I watched the clips in the shop. After playing it for 20 minutes, I was immediately fond of the cute characters and the crazy setting and I soon found myself rushing through the levels.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay of A Hat in Time is very smooth and I had almost no problems with it. I played through the whole game with an Xbox One controller, without experiencing any frustration, which was often the case with other jump and run titles. The only part in the game, where I had some problems, was with some platforming in the Great Windmill level. I tried to jump on a moving wall piece, where I slipped off and ended up reactivating a checkpoint way below me and I had to replay that whole part again. Other than that, I had absolutely no issues. \n\nLike the title of the game suggests, you must use a variety of different hats to advance. These hats can then be upgraded by buying pins which give you unique powers. As you proceed through the game, you will get more hats and the game will get more complex.\n\nBoss Battles: \nThere is combat in this game, but fighting against regular enemies, is smoothly combined with the rest of the gameplay so I won\u2019t address this any further. \n\nThe real deal when it comes to combat though, are the Boss Battles in this game. When I encountered the first Boss, I was completely surprised. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but whatever I thought it would be, it was like 20 times better! THE MUSIC! THE FAST PACE! THE SETTING! This is where this game is shining the brightest. \n\nI have 1 complaint about the last boss of the game though: The time slowing hat is kind of OP\u2026 I was using it throughout the whole boss fight and it ended up being way too easy. I\u2019ll have to try it another time without the hat I guess.\n \nArt & Music:\nAs I already hinted at in the Boss Battle part of this review, I absolutely love the Music! I am pretty sure that if you would remove the music from this game, it wouldn\u2019t even be half as good. No matter where you go, you will always be followed by a catchy tune to hum along.\n\nThen there is the colorful & warm art style, which gives the game a powerful atmosphere. I can\u2019t really say much about it though, since I think everyone has his own taste when it comes to graphics \ud83d\ude0a\n\nStory:\nThe story is very simple: You are traveling home in your spaceship and are flying over a strange planet. An unfortunate event happens and you lose all your \u201cfuel\u201d, which you then have to regain in order to get home. On your way of regaining all your \u201cfuel\u201d, you will encounter a lot of funny, diverse and interesting characters that accompany you throughout numerous adventures.\n\nLength/Content:\nI took 13-14 hours to finish the game with 97%. For my taste, the length of this game is just right, as I rather replay the game a bunch of times instead of playing an eternity to finish it once. But I think this is up to debate, as some people would enjoy it to be a bit longer.\n\nConclusion:\nPositives:\n- MUSIC!\n- Smooth Gameplay\n- Boss Battles\n- Gadgets & Customization\n\nNegatives:\n- Maybe the length for some people???\n\nThe game was more than worth it\u2019s price and I will probably try to get myself some merch. I really hope that there will be a sequel to this game. \nPlease? \nPretty Please???", "timestamp_created": 1508076803, "timestamp_updated": 1508076803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525853", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35748468": {"recommendationid": "35748468", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977541712", "num_games_owned": 668, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508498606}, "language": "english", "review": "I am at bliss.", "timestamp_created": 1508076170, "timestamp_updated": 1508076170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35748336": {"recommendationid": "35748336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105661657", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513452888}, "language": "italian", "review": "Esattamente quello che un platform 3d dovrebbe essere.

The voice acting is there, but the character's mouths don't move, most of the platforming puzzles can be outright skipped by spamming the scooter hat and double jump and the overall level desing is most of the time lazily executed.\n\nSurely this is something the devs want kids to play, right? Well then why do we first of all have a way too spooky level for any 10-year olds with a spooky red eyed shadow figure searching for the player while trying to hide, amnesia style?\nAnd the plot? Seems to be promoting violence to me. Overly gory jokes and even a guy getting literally turn into mush and put into a can. And then in the final boss the characters down right kill each other.

Besides a few notable details, this game is very finely polished.  Hat Kid moves like a dream, and the entirety of Gears for Breakfast's final product is just filled with charm.  This is a game I could come back to time and again just to get a piece of the platforming action.\n\n\n*SPOILERS*\nIf you do not want to be spoiled, you have been warned.\n*SPOILERS*\n\n\nThe Things I Liked:\n-CONTROLS: Playing this game is just divine.  Hat Kid looks floaty from gameplay footage but she controls with great precision.  Her base moveset is simple but versitile, allowing for some really rewarding challenges throughout the game (i.e. beating Train Rush without time bonuses).  Controls are one of those things that can completely ruin a game, but let it be known that A Hat in Time has them down pat.\n\n-STYLE: Hat Kid is freaking adorable and I would buy a plush of her as soon as I could.  From playing patty cake with the mafia before getting her headlights punched out to signing her soul away with a cute smiley face at the end, this child is wonderful to behold.  This is also helped by the fact that our protagonist, over the course of the game, will become friends with the mafia, competitive movie directors, a demon who coaxes souls from his victims, and enlightened goat people.  That is just hilarious on so many levels it cannot even be described.\n\n-VARIETY: There is quite a bit of variety in the game in many aspects.  Hats obtained all have unique effects, and with only one exception I found myself using all of them rather regularly.  Badges also have variety, while not stepping on the toes of whatever hats there are but rather just changing how the game works.  Even the missions are unique; one minute Hat Kid will be hanging around the islandic Mafia Town, then the next said island is surrounded and drenched in lava.  The boss of Chapter 2 differs depending on the ending the player gets, and world layouts per chapter are all uniquely tailored to said chapter.\n\n-CHAPTER STRUCTURE: This is by far the one thing that worried me most and impressed me incredibly upon getting my hands on this copy.  Chapter 1 gives you a rather large world tailored to beginners that holds rather specific objectives. Chapter 2 has unique settings and objectives for each mission that have a big impact on the chapter's finale.  Chapter 3 also has specific missions, but most of these have to be found via contracts in the world, and because said world is so enigmatic and vast there is tons and tons to explore even after having found all the contracts.  Chapter 4 completely forgoes mission predictions and relies on the player to explore and find each time piece themselves.  This variety in chapters is incredibly inspiring, and completely justifies to me why they took so long to make only a 4.2 world game.  When each world is so unique and each chapter has such a unique impact on the player, it really does show the love and care the developers put into this title.\n\n\nThe Things I Didn't Like\n-GENERAL POLISH: About the only gripe I have with the game is that there are a few really iffy areas in which the quality falters a bit.  Most notably- and I noticed this immediately- the characters in Chapter 1 do not have lip syncing.  It doesn't have to be much!  It could just be like Snatcher, where it is just the mouth moving out of sync with their lines as they say it.  Anything is better than the muscular mafia talking to me without any mouth movement at all\nAlso, I noticed several people say the game is fully voiced.  No it is not.  It is mostly voiced, yes, especially in the parts that count, but in the finale- that is, the last chapter- a good deal of characters have no voices at all.  In fact, there's this nice cat lady who cooks with the stove on Hat Kid's spaceship who has a sweet southern accent, but while she has lines in the final battle, talk to her before then and all you get is a text bubble.\nThese may seem like nitpicks, but I do feel like they take away from the experience a tad.  It does not ruin the game at all, but I feel this would have helped all the more to really solidify A Hat in Time's quality.  After all, it's the small details that really count.", "timestamp_created": 1508038225, "timestamp_updated": 1508038225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35735248": {"recommendationid": "35735248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019214271", "num_games_owned": 590, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508085728}, "language": "english", "review": "Background: I have played this game for over 20 hours found all the collectables and have all the achivements.\n\nPROS:\n+great soundtrack\n+smooth controls \n+cute design\n+has great humor \n\nCONS:\n-occasonal glitch\n-very little replayability unless you plan on speedrunning \n\nOVERALL: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1508036149, "timestamp_updated": 1508036149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35735038": {"recommendationid": "35735038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051440197", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514008523}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy shit this is for sure the best game i've played this year.

No wait that does pretty much describe it.... Anyway.\n\nLong story short, it controls relatively well (a few issues when you want to aim at specific things) on both kb/m and a controller, it runs fairly well, there are a few drops on max settings on my system but nothing too bad, and you exist in an extremely adorable creative world.\n\nBUT, to elaborate... A [strike]Cat in a Hat[/strike] Hat in Time does enough things right to be a very fun game and feel cutely unique.\n\nLet's start world building! Your spaceship was attacked by the Mafia ... in space.. without a suit... and because of that all your time traveling fuel is scattered around the planet. Mild inconvenience as the main character thinks. So, using your hat powers and I guess also your time traveling powers, but who needs that, right? You are on your way to fix your ship and... do whatever you are going to do after that.\n\nFrom there you go in many different sets, all being incredibly imaginative but still down to Earth at the same time. You never get to feel alienated or confused. And a lot of light-hearted darkish humour, if that even makes sense.\n\nTONS of unlockables. Apart from your main hats and whatnot, you also get to, via certain side missions (that are not so side but whatever), you get to unlock randomly different customization for your character, be it colours for your outfit or different skins for your hats, and many other things like different BGM for the stages. Really adds to the repliability, even if I doubt many people will be interested enough to play that much.\n\nGraphically the game really sets the mood regarding the situation. A fairly simplistic cartoony environment with many details in the world for you to have 5 seconds of fun every time you go past them, not even realising it. Oooone minor issue that I have there is that a few character models after the first stage are not that well made. And certain animations from NPCs. It's not too bad, but noticeable.\n\nAudio... Yeah they pretty much nailed that part. I have no complaints for the most part, the design of the sound effects, music, whatever. It all works really damn well! I'd even go as far as to recommend buying the soundtrack.\n\nControlling your character might seem a bit frustrating at the start. You are actually ... well.. a child in a way. If you slide on a wall you will be dazed for a second. If you fall from a bit too high height you will again be dazed for a moment. But then comes the fun part, cause there's ways in the controls to avoid all those things. It does add a lot of character in the game however. BUT with all that said, if you want to target your ranged attacks, or sometimes even the melee attacks, it tends to be a bit too precise, attacking exactly where your character is looking, so you can miss stuff by a small distance. It's possible to get used to it but still an inconvenience. Except the wallrunning mechanic. That takes a while to get used to and it can still be annoying afterwards in some places.\n\nWORKSHOP! For some reason the game has this, so if you like mods... Unreal Engine so easy to make stuff for it. I am not sure how much they allow through the workshop, but a lot of customization is already in place.\n\nEven if this game, as any game, has flaws, I really do recommend it.

It was originally shown to the public on Kickstarter (as many indie games these days are), and it raised $296,360, destroying it's original goal. That was 4 years ago, and now the game is out, and it is truly something special.\n\nAs stated before, it's a 3D platformer: unlike Yooka-Laylee, which was clearly trying to replicate the magic of Banjo-Kazooie, A Hat in Time borrows the best elements of many 3D platformers from yester-year, and mashes them together to create a short but sweet adventure.\n\nFirstly, there's movement. Hat Kid (the main protagonist) is a joy to control, and her moves are very simple: jump, double jump, a mid-air dive and the ability that your hat provides. There are a handful of hats to enjoy, and each offer a very useful ability. There wasn't a single hat that I didn't find useful.\n\nThe story is also very simple: your spaceship is flying by a planet, when one of the residents pops by, who destroys your ship and scattering the fuel (Time Pieces) across the world. It's pretty simple, but the characters all have charming personalities and voice acting that's actually pretty good (and you can turn it off if it's not your fancy).\n\nThe presentation is also top-notch: even when playing on the lowest settings (I have a pretty bad computer), the game looked great and sounded better. The soundtrack is exquisite also, and prefectly compliments each scenario.\n\nThe only problems are that the game can occasionally hiccup, I had a lot of technical issues (frame drops, clipping, etc.) and the game is pretty short (about 10 hours) but the game is so good I can really overlook all these things. \n\nI really can't sing this game's praises enough: I loved it so much I went and got every achievement.

It captures the exact feel of the old great 3D platformers you grew up with (or maybe didn't, if you're a young'n). Its music is superb, sometimes almost choking me up on how good it is. The art style is charming, the sound design is lovely, the controls are airtight and an absolute joy to play, the humor had me genuinely laughing so many times, and Hat Kid is so precious that it ought to be criminal. I could go on and on, but it's easier to just say that A Hat in Time is simply fantastic.\n\nIt is however, unpolished. As much as I'd love to say the game is perfect, there are occasional bugs here and there that aren't exactly hard to replicate. Ledges that you feel like you really, REALLY should have reached from wall-running from what seemed like the \"intended\" jumping point (lookin' at you, Alpine Skyline), and invisible geometry sprinkled throughout. A certain bell in a certain dreamscape refused to activate as I relentlessly swung at it. A lot of characters that aren't Hat Kid or a Mafia goon are animated as though they belong in a bargain bin game, and ones that aren't simply don't have many animations to begin with.\n\nThat sounds like a lot of complaining compiled into that one paragraph, but only because I didn't subject you to 10 paragraphs singing the game's praise, which I could have easily done and I have to physically restrain myself from doing. Most problems that have any affect on gameplay are honestly minor, USUALLY don't end up with you falling in a pit, and only give brief \"what the-? oh well\" moments that you'll likely forget within half a second, and the complaints with character animations are just that. They don't hurt the game as a GAME, it's just something you notice and think \"eh, that looks kinda janky, doesn't it?\"\n\nThat said, some things like the invisible geometry (some of which is harder to avoid than to accidentally bump into) or Hat Kid just plummeting to her (non-gameplay affecting) death during a cutscene feel like things that just shouldn't be happening. They're problems I have no trouble replicating every single time, and have seen other people experiencing every single time in the same places, so it comes across as strange to me that such flaws would make it through development.\n\nDespite the gears needing a little oil, A Hat in Time is still one of the best platformers to be made in recent memory. It honestly stands up to the classics in terms of gameplay, and may even surpass them in terms of technical gameplay, and definitely dwarfs them in terms of adorableness. I'd never tell anyone to not get this game due to the small issues. In the 12 hours I was messing around getting all 40 time pieces, and for all the extra hours I've spent just dorking around because it's genuinely fun enough just to play for FUN (what a concept!), I recall maybe two instances that I was honestly frustrated by those minor flaws. If updates in the future were to smooth out those bumps, then as a game, A Hat in Time would be very near perfect, held back only by some \"meh\" NPC animations.\n\nGet this game.

The goal also being similar to mario games in that you're looking for timepieces that are essentially stars (with 40 in the game). There are 4 \"worlds\" though some are less of areas and more like linear levels. Even the world that is labeled \"freeroam\" is one of the most linear areas. Each area also comes with bonus \"rift\" levels where you find the rift in the world and try to complete the level. As for gameplay, you have a rediculous range of motion and can get from one place to a fairly far away place without touching the ground. You have a double jump, a mario 64 style dive/cancel, a homing attack, short vertical wall run and wall jump, as well as a \"wind waker\" grapple (and crawl) along with other utilities. The only thing is that with such a wide range of movement and the game being a 3D platformer, you're expected to make full use out of it which (along with the less then perfect camera) can sometime make it difficult to figure out which way you're expected to go (a few times, your best way to counter this is just not to underestimate the jumps you can make). The camera could definately use some work and if I had one peice of advice to give, it would be to turn off \"camera assist\" otherwise, once it starts turning on its own, you'll be forced to match it's movement with your jump angle which got me killed more times than I can count before checking to see if I could turn it off. It can also be a little hard to determine depth which can make certain jumps difficult. That all being said, once you grasp all the movement mechanics, the levels are fun and interesting with little puzzles here and there and some really interesting platforming mechanics with new things being introduced at a good pace. \n\nOutside of the mechanical aspects, the game advertises as being cute as heck but heck doesn't even begin to describe the level of cuteness in the game. Similar to how you might this of \"Nintendo polish\", this game has little bits and peices to add to the cuteness to the character and the world. There were too many moments to count where the game just made me feel happy. The story it also very entertaining and funny (albiet a bit weird towards the end) and there are many levels that do different and neat things. The only thing is that the same levels after played, won't have the same effect after being experienced the first time thought that in no way means they won't still be fun, just not the same. Boss battles are also fun and interesting and can also be played over and over without losing their touch. The graphics are beautiful making exploring and looking for collectables just an overall enjoyable experience. The soundtrack is amazing and enhances the experience even more. I was sitting on the title screen like \"I want to hit A but Ill just wait for the title music to finish it's loop\". The area music perfectly suits the setting and the boss themes are epic and so fun to listen to. There are also a number of customization items that you can unlock with said collectables.

Gotta know when to seperate the product from the person sometimes.\n\nI enjoyed it. It reminds me of those old N64 Platformers without being massive collectathons. In that sense it leans toward Mario 64/Sunshine rather than any of the Rareware ones thankfully.\n\nIt's charming, it's cute, it's quicky and has a lot of character. Each world differs nicely from each other with lovely variety and creativity. There's really only one level/act I don't like (I dislike the parade) and the rest were all a treat to play, and the bosses are pretty neat too.\n\nAnd most importantly, it controls extremely well. Very responsive, jumping feels good and the movement options are great and the game doesn't keep any of that a secret from you either.\n\nThere can be some performance issues but there's a plethora of graphical options to get the game running smooth like butter.\n\nOnly downsides I'd give is that jumps can feel \"leap-of-faith\"y sometimes; nothing that can't be fixed with tweaking the drop shadows. Wall clinging can feel a bit \"sticky\" and it might be a tad short (which suits me cause so many games, so little time) but overall I say it's worth the purchase.\n\nIf you're on the fence, wait for a sale. $30 might be a bit much, but I think $20 is more fair.", "timestamp_created": 1507957147, "timestamp_updated": 1508033653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35708351": {"recommendationid": "35708351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019594192", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507668572}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr A Hat in Time is a flawed first outting for an indie platformer that makes up for its numerous small deficits with a boatload of character, heart, nostalgia, and most importantly, fun.\n\nA Hat in Time is short but sweet and can be completed 100% with all achievements in about fifteen hours. That said, that fifteen hours manages to encompass most if not all of the positive aspects of the collectathon games of yore without any of the bloat or filler that those games could often be bogged down by. This game most closely resembles games like Mario 64 and Mario Sunshine in that each level typically houses 8-10 Hourglass Pieces that you can obtain, while unlocking new levels requires that you hit a certain threshold before they're unlocked.\n\nThe platforming and movement feel incredibly crisp, mixing double jumping, a dash, and wall climbing to create easily controlled speediness that meshes well with the design of the environments. Three of the four worlds are fairly open in design and afford areas that are large enough to explore but not large enough to illicit boredom or undue traveling times. Time Rifts, which are self-contained levels that can be found throughout the worlds, provide some of the most engaging platforming challenges in the game while showing off some really great linear level design that provides a break from exploration.\n\nThe music is phenomenal and ranges from cheery tunes for exploration, frantic melodies for more intense moments, and especially memorable boss music that brings the action of each world to a satisfying and energetic climax. The voice acting does just enough to set the tone of the game. Hat Kid doesn't talk much, but her face is occasionally quite expressive during cutscenes. A Hat in Time chooses its voiced characters well, though, and really hammers in a lot of character for the fairly small amount of voiceover work. \n\nOverall, A Hat in Time has a metric ton of character, but it's riddled with small issues that could potentially inhibit the experience:\n\n-- Unlike Mario games, each chapter in a world is tied to a specific hourglass. The level typically changes in some way to encompass this, but A Hat in Time is lacking the free roam feeling of exploration and the excitement of finding secrets that older collectathons are famous for because hourglasses can't be find by exploration.\n-- Most of the platforming surprises or secrets outside of Time Rifts either afford you thread for creating hats or coins for getting music remixes and cosmetic changes, so the sense of accomplishment from roaming an area can quickly dwindle.\n-- Hats afford special abilities, but only two feel like they have any real impact on the game or platforming. Even then, their impact is fairly minimal. There's not a lot of back tracking or using hats to unlock secrets. As a counter-point, this does make the game feel more focused and less bloated by filler despite lacking the joy of discovering new ways to use hats.\n-- I encountered several collision issues throughout the game, particularly when it came to rounded objects. The game's way of fixing these issues is to teleport you to your last safe spot, which can be jarring.\n-- The last third of the game feels rushed and the main antagonist feels underbaked. \n\nThese might seem like a lot of negatives for a game, but these were things that I felt compelled to nitpick after my stellar experience. I can't stress enough how much fun this game was to play through despite its flaws and length; I haven't been this enthralled by a collectathon since the N64 era. A Hat in Time captures all the best aspects of those games without falling into the pitfall of being iterative or boring, allowing you to spend just enough time with its characters and worlds before pushing you onto the next experience. While there are issues with the polish, none of those problems threatened to ruin my enchantment with A Hat in Time while I was playing. The sheer amount of heart this game has is incredible, and I was enthralled throughout.\n\nA final important note is that the developers are planning on releasing two new FREE DLC worlds in the future. A modding toolkit will also be readily available to players in due time. It's very clear that the devs have a strong commitment to community, and that means a lot for the game's longevity.

This game also features time rift levels which are extremely similiar to these bonus levels from Super Mario Sunshinel\n- Artstyle very reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, which simply adds to the charme of this game.\n- Environmental Design is perfect for this type of 3d plattformer, it offers a lot of variety and each chapter/world has its own, clear identity.\n- A+ Soundtrack, it's really good, especially the boss-themes.\n- Speaking of boss-fights: These are somewhat more intense than I expected from a 3d-plattformer, they're as silly as they are flashy and fun, making them very memorable and fun to replay while trying to go for a no-hit run with the 1-Hit Hero Badge.\n- Featurres a murder, a spooky mansion, the mafia, a girl with a moustache and a kid with a hat.\n- Quests for hourglasses are very different from one another. While they are fewer in number (40 total) the ones that are part of a chapter have a clear identity.\n\n\n\nCons:\n- The game feels a little short. \nThe worst part about this game is that it ends. I collected almost everything in-game and got all the steam-achievements, clocking in at only 20 hours now. \nHowever, we will see two additional chapters during updates and hopefully more due to steamworks and maybe other updates the developers have planned, who knows.\n- A bit too easy sometimes, only an item that makes you get oneshot to increase difficulty. Nitpick, but I'd like anything that could increase difficulty so I could replay it in its entirety in that difficulty :)\n- minor camera annoyances. Nothing on the main-path to an hourglass and nothing major, it's something I noticed in a few sections in the upper part of subcon forest, usually when there is an object in the way.\n- Timestop hat with fast hatter badge is overpowered.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nIs water wet? Is hat kid absolutely adorable?\nWhy are you still down here instead of buying the game and playing it? If enjoy oldschool 3d-plattformers a la Mario 64 or Banjoy Kazooie or 3d-plattformers in general, then this game is certainly something you'd enjoy playing. Maybe watch a video featuring the first world if you have doubts.\nI played this for 20 hours and those were twenty extremely fun and satisfying hours that left me very happy. There are few games that I'd consider to complete to 100%, or even near-100%, this is one of them because I love it and therefore I rate it cute-as-heck/10, it's a must-buy.", "timestamp_created": 1507949402, "timestamp_updated": 1507950333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35706445": {"recommendationid": "35706445", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995482261", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511419577}, "language": "english", "review": "named my sister in law \"butt\", wore two pairs of glasses at once, helped a crow solve a captcha\n\n10/10 goty", "timestamp_created": 1507949209, "timestamp_updated": 1507949209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35706373": {"recommendationid": "35706373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125019458", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509400193}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the \"dark souls\" of absolutely nothing.\n\n\n\n\nBut actually this game is 11/7 would play again and again.", "timestamp_created": 1507949024, "timestamp_updated": 1507949024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35706280": {"recommendationid": "35706280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010135729", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511417917}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1507948685, "timestamp_updated": 1507948685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35705919": {"recommendationid": "35705919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077105313", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514118809}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool Beans", "timestamp_created": 1507947185, "timestamp_updated": 1507947185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35705381": {"recommendationid": "35705381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030291655", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508006280}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing 3D platformer.

And yet there was someone that was still pushing for more, that wanted to recapture that feeling that we all had when we played games such as mario, banjo or psyconauts. \n\nThe absolute mad men did it, Gears for Breakfast created one of the most charming, tight and lovable platformer in the last decade.\n\nThe fantastic movement mechanics that inch you to experiment and break sequences, finding alternate routes and exploting Hat Kid's abilities coupled with pin point perfect camera controls make for what might be the best platforming ever made since mario 64.\nThe witty and clever writing mixed with the cute charm of the lovable characters form a brilliant world that will make you want to explore every inch of it and talk to everyone, just to see what funny thing they'll say next.\nThe genius soundtrack composed by Pascal Michael Stiefel perfectly frames the adventure and tone of each chapter and stage with a dynamic music that will always set the mood for the scene with masterful precision.\nThe level design shifts and churns every chapter, always stimulating with new ideas and crazy settings that keep throwing you off balance changing the rules and keeping it engaging and interesting.\nA Hat in Time succeeds because it expands on old formulas. It mixes an repackages tried and true mechanics and then combines them while giving a coat of polish that makes the game its own unique thing, able to stand on its two legs against the ancient platformer giants of yore.\n\nLike a thunderstorm on a sunny day A Hat in Time invaded our world after seemingly going off the radars for years.\nA quiet, solitary release by a small team of humble yet surprisingly inventive bunch that I'm sure we'll hear a lot more from in the future.\nIt is a brilliant game and an instant classic.\n\n\n*The modder background of the development team ensures the game will have full modding support and a level editor. I hunger for more Hat Kid adventures and can't wait to see what the community and GfB will cook up next.*\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507944202, "timestamp_updated": 1507944202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35704892": {"recommendationid": "35704892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070712973", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508353015}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderfully polished 3D platformer that oozes charm.

This game is a breath of fresh air which executes incredibly well on the promise of being a 3D platformer of the highest quality.\n\nFor starters, no non-Steam DRM or microtransactions here. Unlike many AAA publishers known for evading taxes and nickel-diming their customers at every opportunity, Gears for Breakfast decided that you get what you pay for and chose not to inconvenience paying customers with DRM or shove microtransactions down the players' throat in an attempt to milk every customer's pennies. That alone is deserving of praise, but there's a lot more to this game than reasonably consumer-friendly business practices.\n\nIt's a title dripping with charm and character. Many of the character moments left a goofy grin on my face and the writing style and palpable atmosphere present in each mission really add to that. Several levels have whole areas of the map designed for just one or two missions, and a couple even change up the mechanics just enough to make each new mission feel like a different adventure.\n\nThe controls feel amazing, and Hat Kid's unique hat abilities add a lot to the platforming. Your character feels incredibly light, yet the game's controls never reach \"floaty\" territory or become too loose. Everything feels consistently tight here, and your character has just the right kit to make what is probably the most \"acrobatic\" platformer on the market. The wall running particularly makes you feel like the environment is your playground. The well put together levels and challenge stages(called Time Rifts) do a great job at accentuating the characters' absolutely joyous moveset.\n\nI could see why some would think the game lacks in length - There are 40 time pieces, and as of writing this review I've collected 26 of them and beaten the final boss in just seven hours of gameplay, and I like to take my time. Compared to the 120 star standard of the Mario games, it may sound a bit lacking at first, but each individual mission has more \"meat\" than your average 3D Mario mission, and with Workshop support and rumors that the game will allow mod stages through said workshop in the future, I predict this game will feel more than satisfying for buyers now, and only grow in content over time.\n\nWhile the characters *could* be fleshed out more, and there *could've* been some more hat abilities in the game, and while the game is *sometimes* lacking in visual polish(despite maintaining an immaculate art style), these things rarely detract actively from your experience with the game.\n\n\nIn the end, I would recommend this game to anyone, especially those who are feeling more and more jaded with regards to the industry today. It is absolutely worth the $30 asking price and more. I would encourage anyone who wants the game and has the spare cash to pick this game up at its advertised price rather than waiting for a sale, as these developers absolutely deserve every penny in my opinion, but I will, of course, not chide anybody for waiting, as I tried to, for a sale.\n\nThis is a quality experience, and may just lead the charge into a new wave of platforming games to come. I cannot sing this game's praises highly enough and have nothing but excitement for the next adventure that might be delivered to us by Gears for Breakfast.", "timestamp_created": 1507912466, "timestamp_updated": 1507912466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35695380": {"recommendationid": "35695380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295867515", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512080150}, "language": "english", "review": "The most satisfying 3D platformer in a long time.", "timestamp_created": 1507911219, "timestamp_updated": 1507911219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35695130": {"recommendationid": "35695130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004311243", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508770174}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the most fun games I have played this year, and I can not recommend it enough.\nThis game brought me back to loving collectathons and playing them for the rest of the day after coming home from school.

Despite the flaws that it has now, It's very enjoyable like a sixth generation nintendo game and I hope Gears for Breakfast can serve us better quality and performance for lunch as well as outstanding replay value for dinner. \n\nThree meals a day are all we fans of 3D platformers need to get through the day.", "timestamp_created": 1507854148, "timestamp_updated": 1507854148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35680614": {"recommendationid": "35680614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021087752", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508259382}, "language": "english", "review": "Get this game, now.\nIt's fantastic.", "timestamp_created": 1507853864, "timestamp_updated": 1507853864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35680388": {"recommendationid": "35680388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074747907", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508136567}, "language": "english", "review": "A very charming 3d platformer", "timestamp_created": 1507852799, "timestamp_updated": 1507852799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35680294": {"recommendationid": "35680294", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988156895", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508389526}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything Yooka-Layee should have been", "timestamp_created": 1507852413, "timestamp_updated": 1507852413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35680196": {"recommendationid": "35680196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065553345", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508996421}, "language": "english", "review": "Good platformer.

I'll update my review if/when I 100% the game.\n\nI played the game using a Steam Controller.\n\nEdit: Review Updated now that i've collected all 40 Time pieces.\n\n\n[*][b] Gameplay: [/b]\n\nWhile inspired by various 3D platformers of the past, A Hat in Time first a formost plays like Super Mario Sunshine.\nHat Kid has a comparable moveset to Mario (sans Flood) with a handful of extra tricks up her sleave and several unlockable new moves tied to swapable Hats and Badges.\n\nHat Kid is pulled towards context important objects (like tightrope or grabable walls) slightly more than Mario.\nThis means the game's platforming is more forgiving that Super Mario Sunshine, but can also be less responsive.\n(But never to the point of becoming an Assasins Creed-esque issue)\n\nThe game is intended to be speed-running friendly and encourages sequence breaking (even giving an achievement in one isntance), but punishes players several times for doing so- bypassing certain objectives resulting in invisible walls, broken NPCs and  the like.\n\nControlling Hat Kid is ultimatly fun; as is sending her through the game's varried levels.\nThe game contains a hub-world, 4 worlds to explore (with various objectives), and a final boss stage; the quality of which are inconstent but tend to remain atleast \"okay\" when not \"fantastic\".\n\n\n[*][b] Audio and Visuals: [/b]\n\nA Hat in Time's soundtrack is not enough that I would listen to it outside the game, but serves it's purpose to a T: complimenting the varied environments players will explore. Each track nails it's setting perfectly, and never fualters or distracts.\n\nVisuals are more hit or miss. Certain locations, escpecially the first world, are much less apealling when compared to some of the fanstastic environments experience further into the game. While never eyesores, the improvement in the developer's skills as development progressed is apperant.\n\nVoice acting also an issue. Once again in the first world, the voice acting can quickly becoming grating and distracting with its poor quality. I made it one of my first goals in the game to unlock the (unnecessarily dificult to obtain) Unlock that replaces voice acting with Banjo-Kazooie-esque mumbling.\nAnd yet, by the time I could use the Unlock I had descovered that the voice acting improves immensly! By the half way point nearly all voice acting gripes were forgotten, with roles being extremely well done (even featuring youtube tallents like JonTron and YoungTown), and their acompanying dialogue being both smart and humorous.\n\n\n[*][b] Story: [/b]\n\nA Hat in Time's overarching narrative is probably its largest missstep. Without spoiling any plot, the game awkwardly introduces both the Hat Kid and the game's villian in the first world. A compasionate backstory is attemtped for the villian, but it falls flat- worse, even painting Hat Kid in a slightly sinister light.\n\nFor the next 3 worlds absolutely NO advances are made to the main-plot, which is thrown to the background to give lime-light to smaller side stories. (and to the game's credit these side stories are for the most part both funny and well executed).\n\nWe don't encounter or even hear word of the main villian again until unlocking the final boss stage. Here an emotional story arc is attempted, but fails since the primary motivations of several characters were either poorly explained or skipped entirely- making it feel like the second act of the game is missing in its entirety...\n\n\n[*][b]Closing remarks: [/b]\n\n...and in the final cinematic I encountered a gamebreaking bug resulting in a PC crash.\nHaving to watch the game's final moments on youtube rather than experiencing it myself certainly sours the my final thoughts with the game.\n\nTo the developers credit, they have been deploying patches that address the game's various (mostly minor) issues every few days since the game's launch.\n\nThe game is also noticibly short, requiring less than 10 hours to complete the campaign- even while taking levels at a slow and exploratory pace. 100%ing the game requires a little over 15 hours. While certainly not an issue in and of it's self, it's worth mentioning when added with the game's price. While AHiT may ensure it doesn't overstay its welcome- it probably could have explored its potential over a few more stages.\n\n\nUltimatley I still genuinly recommend A Hat in Time. At it's core its a spiritual successor to Mario Sunshine that kept me extremly entertained during it's brief run. Unlike Yooka-Laylee, a game I feel had more stumbles and pratfalls than even the mediocre platformers of old, A Hat in Time succeeds in reminding players what a good 3D platform game looks like and has me eager to keep playing, regardless of a subpar story.\n\n\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1507851943, "timestamp_updated": 1510085587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35680124": {"recommendationid": "35680124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208339828", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509311691}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey! A playable demo of Super Mario Odyssey before it comes out! Seems to include a big portion of the game. Few complaints about this demo. First, Mario doesn't really look like Mario. Also, what happened to Cappy? It's just replaced with other hats to cover it up. I was excited for the mechanic of Capturing! Why did they remove it?\n\nAlthough, I must say I am intrigued by all of the new characters it brings. This demo makes it seem like a completely different aesthetic! Adding a Mafia that are just a bunch of bad cooks? Ingenious! This game also features full voice acting, even for Mario! And most of it seems to give you a general idea on who a character is, which is needed considering the ton of new characters like DJ Grooves and the Snatcher. Not to mention the plethora of cosmetics that Mario can wear. The sound is also a great feature, and it goes the full mile to be great.\n\nAll in all, I think this Odyssey demo is definitely what the fans want. It expands greatly upon the Mario Universe, with a new planet in play. This game DOES have a few graphical errors, though. Not what I expected from a triple-a Mario title. but I'll live.

Nowadays I usually have a hard time getting excited to play any kind of game, but I really really liked Yooka-Laylee, which is also a new nostalgic like 3d platformer. Many people spoke badly of that game and while I can understand the flaws, I really enjoed it.\n\nAnyway, now my good friend told me about this and even gave his second steam code he had for free. Thanks so much again! I will probably support later myself and buy the PS4 version eventually!\nSo I heard it was also a traditional platformer, but a bit more modern.\nAnd that's just what this is! Very much feels like games in the old days, but more modern when it comes to objectvies and less collectables! Not that I hate collecting things in these games.\n\nSo what aspects stand out in this game? One important aspect that will have a lot of influence in the enjoyment of a game like this, the controls! And they are perfect! They just feel natural and you are just in control. Nothing more to add, turned out very good. Even the dreaded camera for games like these is very solid at least! Rarely and problems at all!\n\nThen, the artstyle! Very cute, by the way I really liked the main character, so adorable and with a lot of charm. The colors just pop and...you just feel at home in the worlds. Great atmosphere. The music is very fitting too!\n\nThe missions in the game are for the most part very creative and the concepts change all the time! Some have you exlpre mainly, others mix things up a lot by having you confronted with creepy characters that even claim your soul, or a murder mystery! Funny writing too!\n\nThe challenges this game offers are enjoyable and very fair, in fact I could say one of the slightly negative aspects is that this game is a bit too easy. Other than some of the bosses, but I really am not good at them, they stress me out and in general I hate bosses in video games, I rarely had any issues. I even went for all achievements which offered some nice challenges!\nAlso, the game is unfortunately a bit on the short side, a few more worlds would have been nice, but apparently DLC is coming! Same as a Co-Op mode? Can't wait to play this again together with my friend! \n\nSo yeah, amazing game with a lot of charme, I am so glad this was recommended to me, so well here you go, I do the same by sharing my opinion in this review.\nThanks for reading! Please go try out this game!\nRating: 9.5/10\nThe most fun I had with a game for a long time!

Cuando este sali\u00f3 levant\u00f3 cr\u00edticas positivas y negativas. Yo pienso que es un juego poco pulido en casi todos sus apartados, y con un dise\u00f1o un tanto anticuado. Esto \u00faltimo sirvi\u00f3 a muchos para enterrar el g\u00e9nero de los plataformas 3D collectathon como un g\u00e9nero \"de otra \u00e9poca\" y de \"dise\u00f1os arcaicos\".\n\nNada de esto es cierto si sabes dise\u00f1ar tu juego como debes, y lo arcaico era un problema de Yooka-Laylee, no del g\u00e9nero en s\u00ed. Ah\u00ed tenemos a Mario, sosteniendo el g\u00e9nero pr\u00e1cticamente \u00e9l solito.\n\nEl Kickstarter de A Hat In Time comenz\u00f3 en 2013. Ha llovido much\u00edsimo desde entonces. El juego se retras\u00f3 en varias ocasiones debido a querer mejorarlo y pulirlo para sacar al mercado un producto digno. Y vaya si lo han hecho...\n\n\u00bfLes ha pasado factura todo este tiempo? No lo s\u00e9, tampoco es que hiciera mucho ruido durante su Kickstarter, simplemente, aunque no est\u00e9 oyendo hablar nada de \u00e9l, espero que venda muy bien.\n\nPaso a dar mi opini\u00f3n.\n\nA Hat in Time es un juego que rebosa calidad y personalidad por todos lados. Cada di\u00e1logo, cada personaje, cada situaci\u00f3n nos sacar\u00e1 siempre una sonrisa y nos invitar\u00e1 a seguir jugando para ver con qu\u00e9 nos encontraremos la pr\u00f3xima vez. La protagonista, sin ir m\u00e1s lejos, a parte de ser jodidamente adorable, tiene muchos puntos de humor, y mucho carisma.\n\nLa variedad de situaciones que nos presenta el videojuego a cada misi\u00f3n que realizamos es brillante. As\u00ed, encontramos desde una investigaci\u00f3n de asesinato en un tren, pasando por una criatura fantasmag\u00f3rica (mi personaje favorito) que nos obliga a firmar un contrato a cambio de nuestra alma para ir desbloqueando misiones, hasta una infiltraci\u00f3n en una mansi\u00f3n encantada... y todo esto sin desprenderse ni un solo momento de su identidad como plataformas. No es que de repente el juego deje de ser un plataformas y se convierta en un juego de infiltraci\u00f3n, como ya ha pasado en otras ocasiones. No, nada de eso. La jugabilidad se mezcla de maravilla con las diferentes situaciones que nos presentan.\n\nCada mundo al que viajamos trata de contarnos una peque\u00f1a historia y en muchas ocasiones me ha recordado al storytelling de Paper Mario o Psychonauts. Las interacciones que tiene Hat Kid con los personajes y el mundo y como esta se involucra en sus historias est\u00e1 muy bien llevado y nos ofrece algunos de los mejores villanos que he podido disfrutar en este tipo de videojuegos.\n\nHablando de villanos... los jefes finales son de lo mejor que he jugado en todo el g\u00e9nero. Magn\u00edficos todos y cada uno de ellos. Todos explotan al 100% las diferentes habilidades de Hat Kid. Que, por cierto, hablando de sus habilidades... creo sin dudarlo que lo mejor de A Hat in Time es el movimiento.\n\nEn este juego tenemos un salto y un doble salto, un \"dive jump\" (a lo Super Mario Sunshine) y un salto de pared, con la posibilidad de escalarlas un breve periodo de tiempo, pudiendo as\u00ed agarrarnos a bordes a los que no llegar\u00edamos de otra forma. Lo mejor del control de Hat Kid es poder moverse por el mundo con la velocidad y la libertad que ofrecen estos movimientos. Tremendamente intuitivos y divertidos de utilizar. Me he encontrado en muchas ocasiones ignorando el objetivo principal de la misi\u00f3n para dar vueltas por el mundo encontrando coleccionables, simplemente por el gusto de hacerlo, por lo f\u00e1cil y divertido que es moverse por el mundo.\n\nHablando de coleccionables, en este juego tienen todos y cada uno de ellos una o varias funciones y es bastante satisfactorio encontrarlos. Adem\u00e1s, aqu\u00ed no est\u00e1 el t\u00edpico \"premio\" por conseguir las t\u00edpicas 100 monedas de un nivel, las cuales est\u00e1n siempre escondidas en los rincones m\u00e1s rid\u00edculos. Aqu\u00ed los coleccionables \"moneda\" sirven para guiarte por el nivel (basicamente como en casi todos los plataformas) y para desbloquear nuevas habilidades. Recolectar objetos no es un dolor en este juego y creo que es la primera vez que me planteo conseguir todos los coleccionables de un juego de este tipo, cuando por lo general, conseguirlos todos no merece la pena y muchos son horribles de obtener. No es el caso en este juego. Coleccionar es divertido y \u00fatil aqu\u00ed.\n\nNo todo son elogios, tengo 2 quejas. La primera es que es demasiado corto (aunque vienen de camino 2 mundos m\u00e1s, la historia principal ya est\u00e1 acabada). La segunda es el nivel t\u00e9cnico del juego. Si bien la mayor parte del tiempo se ve bien, y cosas como la c\u00e1mara, los dise\u00f1os o la banda sonora son sobresalientes, no puedo pasar algunos errores en los modelos y que los gr\u00e1ficos a veces no terminan de convencerme. A\u00fan as\u00ed son errores puntuales y no me han molestado, precisamente por la calidad general que tiene el videojuego.\n\nEn general, desde el momento que lo empec\u00e9 a jugar, me he hallado francamente sorprendido en todo momento por lo bien dise\u00f1ado que est\u00e1 el juego. Y podr\u00eda tirarme aqu\u00ed escribiendo horas, pero simplemente dir\u00e9: COMPRADLO.

It is one of the rare occurances of a Kickstarter game succeeding. It might even be the best Kickstarted game ever. \n\nThere was never a point in this game where I wasnt compeled or bored. There are things in every act that you didn't see before, or didn't explore a certain way and things will leave you having eureka moments constantly. The controls are to the point and feel amazing with an Xbox One controller. Any time I messed up a jump or missed a ledge, it was my own fault and not the game. When you made a hard jump you felt rewarded and usually were rewarded. The difficulty progressed with you, and the game opened up to multiple acts, allowing you to tackle harder objectives early if you wanted. Each boss took about 2-3 tries for me, mainly due to not paying attention or not knowing the mechanics the first time. The boss battles can be a little long. \n\nThe story is cute and the characters are fun, unique and engaging. The acts all differ and have their own stories, charm and mechanics. Subcon forest is one that I think back to a lot. It's impressive. This game is everything Super Mario Sunshine is and could ever be. I dare say that A Hat in Time could rival Super Mario Odyssey (a game im looking forward to) as the best collectathon platformer this year.\n\n10/10\n\nPros:\n-Amazing fluid controls\n-Cute fulfilling story\n-Awesome memorable characters\n-Replayability out the @$$\n-Price:Gameplay value +++++\n-Great game changing hats and useful hat pins\n-Difficulty is fair\n-JonTron voices a penguin\n\nCons:\n-The camera HATES roofs and tight spaces\n-A little short, took under 10 hours to get all 40 time pieces\n-The Time Rift with the owls that follow you is GARBAGE\n-Elvis Bird+Exploding Egg is a bad time", "timestamp_created": 1507835606, "timestamp_updated": 1507835606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35665441": {"recommendationid": "35665441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035203537", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "last_played": 1514669396}, "language": "english", "review": "I can say without a doubt I love this game.

Mild spoilers, although there isn't much to spoil at all.\n\nAlso, TLDR; Feels like a Super Mario Sunshine sequel, movement is the best part, music is great, felt like it was too short and there wasn't much to do besides completing the game and getting 100%, questionable level designs, overall solid game but needs a few tweaks + more content (plz give me DLC I will give you all my money). 8/10\n\nThe Pros:\n- this game is so fucking cute. 'nuff said.\n- the music is very well put together. The songs are catchy and well orchastrated and fit the theme of whatever level you are on.\n- speedrunning is something I love watching, but I haven't really got myself into it. This game, I would say, has actually peaked my interest in speedrunning because of the amount of options that can help you with a speedrun, such as timers, auto-skip cutscenes, etc.\n- the movement is a solid 10/10. So incredibly satisfying and definitely the best part of this game. I could very easily waste a few hours doing parkour around a level on my cute little moped.\n- the subtle references to pop culture and other games is an incredibly nice touch. For example, in one instance, you have to collect a few gems in a certain amount of time. If you do, a flight of stairs raises from the ground that is very similar to how it is done in SMS (Super Mario Sunshine). It even had a red X on it! (one that you could spray with FLUDD in SMS). On the same note, I'm pretty sure this game is SMS 2 with how similar it is, which is very nostalgic for me.\n- the levels have so much variety and are very thematic. Each level is also extremely different from one another and sticks to that theme throughout.\n- lootboxes contain really cool rewards, like appearences and mask variations. Any customisation for such a cute protagonist should be mandatory.\n- on the point of lootboxes, it's always refreshing to have a game reasonably cheap and have no microtransactions. I absolutely despise the lootbox systems other games have *cough* Shadow of War *cough* and I feel like if I support games like this (which I feel genuinely care about their consumers and don't try to milk as much money out of them as possible), I am promoting this type of business practice, and I hope more publishers are like this.\n- some decisions in the game, which feel minor at first, will come up again in the future. For example, giving the bird detectives your pet's name, in which your pet will be mentioned later on, or drawing on your face and have that be used as your save file picture. They're very minor details, but they are nice details nevertheless.\n\nUnfortunately, I have a few Cons:\n- a lot (nearly all of them) of the mechanics/hats in this game were very short lived. You'd use them when you first got them and then used them again once or twice in the same way with hardly any variation on how you use them. I felt like all the hats (except the dweller/fox hat, some very good puzzles with this hat) were not very well utilised and I felt like they should have had more a spotlight. For example, maybe puzzles similar to shrines in Breath of the Wild would've been good.\n- this is probably due to personal preference (or maybe I'm just a wimp), but the mansion level was scary for the wrong reasons. I hate jumpscares, and the game adds this intense, loud tune whenever you aggrovate the monster. The tune appears so suddenly and is so loud that I eventually got annoyed whenever I got jumped. Couple it with the questionable AI and bad decisions the monster made (you would expect the monster to do something, and it didn't, and it ended up feeling weird), and the level was by far the worst and was so glad it was over.\n- the yarn is pretty much useless to my knowledge, besides 100%ing the game and crafting hats, in which you only need one or a few. The rest are useless.\n- I feel the Banjo voice badge should be default. To me, I think the voice acting is bad, but bearable. However, for those who absolutely despise it, I feel like a Banjo style voice acting route would work much better. It is nice to have full voice acting, though.\n- the game was very short. 3 story based planets, 1 free-roam/story planet and a finale, plus secret levels. I felt like there should've been so much more. \n- I'm a perfectionist, so I like to finish an area before I move on to the next. I felt like when I completed a level, there were so many more secrets I hadn't discovered yet. However, I only had to do one secret level (purely because I couldn't find it) to 100% the game after the final level. There is only the main story and the secret levels. I don't feel like there's anything else apart from that.\n- the game just is easy. The only challenging parts for me were the purple secret levels and the boss battles. The levels felt unchallenging and puzzles are generally obvious. Would've definitely liked more challenging blue secret levels and harder/more complex puzzles\n- the characters were forgettable. You'd banter with them for a few seconds at a time and after you'd completed that planet, the only time you'd see them again is at the end of the game. \n\nOverall, I liked this game alot. I don't usually like ratings, but I'd probably give it a solid 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1507833780, "timestamp_updated": 1507833780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35664828": {"recommendationid": "35664828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023663345", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508875758}, "language": "english", "review": "-Awesome gameplay and soundtrack\n-Good Story\n-Loli with hat\n-mods\n\nI love the game and i hope the developers make more.

You can tell the developers really put a lot of love into this game. Every level is different and always brings something new to the table. It does a fantastic job at keeping things fresh by giving you new abilities and introducing new mechanics at the right time. The gameplay is perfect, the controls feel tight and responsive and for the most part Hat Girl did exactly what I wanted. (I only played with a Xbox One controller) The art design is great and most of all super cute! It reminded me of Costume Quest mixed with a Nintendo game. Speaking of Nintendo games A Hat in Time is clearly inspired by games like Super Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie which for me is a good thing because I love old school 3d platforms. You will be going back to previous levels frequently to find things you missed or couldn't access becouse you didnt have the right ability yet. The writing is good for the most part but isn't quite as good near the end. The whole ending seems a little rushed. I was able to beat it in about 10 hours and I was taking my time. I was able to 100% it in nearly 13 hours. It is not the most challenging game so if you're looking for a hard 3d platformer this definitely isn't it. It should also be noted that coop should be coming soon. As for performance I had a issue with stuttering until I forced SLI off. After that it ran impressively smooth. It's also nice to see a game explain what the graphics options actually do and there's plenty to tweak.\n\nPros:\n- Gameplay is superb and feels great\n- Writing is good for the most part\n- Lots of level variety\n- Good unlocking pace\n- Great soundtrack\n- Good performance on my machine\n- Super Cute! \n- No microtransactions\n\nCons:\n- Short and left me wanting more\n- Very easy\n- Seems rushed towards the end\n\nOverall this is one of the best games I have played in a long time and definitely the best current 3d platformer. I just wish there was more of it and that the ending didn't feel so rushed. If you enjoy old 3d platformers I would definitely recommend this! If you don't I would still recommend this because it is an amazing game and you can tell the developers really put a lot of passion into it. If I had to rate this I would give it a 9.5/10!

Not to mention the design of everything is so adorable I can't take my eyes off of them for a second. \n\nA few gripes, I can't customize controls. My only gripe is that I wish I could switch RMB with Ctrl. I'd rather have right click be dive. It's easier to contort my fingers around. I'd also like the right thumb stick's camera contorl to be better. Attempting to look up ends up zooming me in and I can't move around while pressing Y. Also, on lower graphics settings, Subcon Forest looks really bad. Stumps don't have tops, polygons from the fire spirits' trail things to the paintings stretch across huge parts of the map. And when you turn the settings down, textures have a tendency to get corrupted.\n\nI know my critical paragraph was a little longer than the praise, but the fact that I'm a grown man who has a job and responsibilities and I still managed to already 100% the time pieces and start a new file is a sign that I am truely in love and only want the game to be better.

It's not without a few missteps, but none of those are enough to stop it from being one of my favorite games of the last few years.\n\n[b]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605, Great Game[/b][/quote]\n\n[b]A Hat in Time[/b] is a wonderful 3D platformer, but I wouldn't call it a \"collect-a-thon\" as others seem apt to because there isn't [i]that[/i] much to collect. It is basically a love-letter to Gamecube-era Nintendo; the game structure is like Mario 64/Sunshine and the art style is very Windwaker.\n\n[h1]Story / Theme:[/h1]\n\nThe overall story of A Hat in Time is simple: Hat Girl lost all her magical hourglass Time Pieces and she needs to explore and do missions to get them back. Getting them back opens up new worlds to do more missions, and eventually you fight the final boss. It's short, sweet, and (importantly) gets you into the action really fast. The only qualm I have with the overarching story is that it introduces the big villain early in a largely linear selection of missions, and forgets about them entirely until you're ready to fight them in the end.\n\nIndividual Chapter / Act (World / Level) themes are an incredibly strong point in this game. Each Chapter is unique and imaginative so you never know what's around the next corner. Starting in a very Mario Sunshine-esque island town, you move to another chapter where you complete meta goals to settle a dispute between two bird producers, anoter is a horror romp complete with a straight horror-game level, to a large sandbox level that almost completely abandons the Chapter / Act structure of the rest of the game. Each of these chapters is filled with top-notch humor that had me laughing out loud on many, many occasions as well. I highly recommend checking every interactable object you can.\n\nOverall, the story, world, and humor are probably the game's strongest assets but the gameplay's no slouch either.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nA Hat in Time is a shockingly solid platformer. Hat Girl has all sorts of tricks like running up walls, double jumps, dashes, and dives and it is a treat to control her. Extra care is put into a lot of little things, too: Hat Girl has a small hop when she lands from a jump, giving her a nice bouncy weight, and she's got a dedicated \"make a :steammocking: face\" and can blow kisses, to boot. \n\nControl-wise I only have a few wishes that, while they don't break the great feeling, would've still been nice. I wish she at least had an animation for chaining jumps on the ground, they don't need to be a Mario-style triple jump or anything, but connecting jumps like that is always great. Otherwise, I don't really see a reason sliding to a stop in a dive means you cannot move until you hop out of it, it'd be nice if input on the stick caused her to auto-hop out of it. Neither of these things are deal-breakers and are very nitpicky, but I think they'd help more than they'd hurt.\n\nThe \"Hat\" part of A Hat in Time comes in the Hat system where, throughout the game, Hat Girl collects new hats that give her new powers while wearing [b]that[/b] hat like simple sprinting, turning into a block of ice, and momentarily slowing down time. This is an incredibly cute theme, but breaks the breakneck pacing of the gameplay with the constant need to switch between them. In addition, some of the hats are so specific in their use that oftentimes the game needs to put in that hat's specific obstacle just to remind you that you have it. The Ice Hat is the chief offender here, where its obstacle is just a springboard that will launch Hat Girl a place she could otherwise not reach, no platforming involved, just a check to make sure you didn't somehow lose that hat.\n\nBadges are another thing Hat Girl collects that give her varying passive powers, up to three different slots. These powers range from the entirely-non-optional hookshot that lets you grapple from grapple points, to other useful abilities like not colliding with and being knocked back by platforms if you jump-dive into them, to a magnet that attracts nearby pickups. This system suffers from a few issues similar to the hat system where, because you can change them anytime you want, it occasionally slows down gameplay just to have to put on one badge for a specific type of obstacle and then change back when you complete it. It's incredibly irritating that the grapple ability is a badge you basically have to always have equipped as well, if only because changing back and forth between it and another badge whenever you see a grapple point is so tedious.\n\n[h1]Technical:[/h1]\n\nA Hat in Time is, unsurprisingly, not without bugs. Most of these are small and handled well-enough in game. For example, if the engine doesn't ever know exactly what's happening after a jump, it simply returns Hat Girl to where she started it. This is definitely preferable to getting stuck, falling out of bounds, or crashing and I commend the simple way it was handled.\n\nOther bugs are a little less graceful and there's one cannon in particular that can never seem to shoot me facing the right direction to then grapple from the intended grapple hook. It takes a bit of finnagling to try and get Hat Girl turned around so it works.\n\nOtherwise, the game ran at a smooth 1080p60 with no noticeable hitches. I hear there are strange issues at ~144Hz when using a controller, but I am unable to confirm nor deny that as I only play at 60.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nA Hat in Time is one of those games that had me questioning my cliched 5 star rating system. It's incredibly fun and I really enjoyed every minute of playing it, but it's definitely neither perfect or a genre redefining piece of innovation. In the end, though, I still consider it a great game, making it 5/5 Stars. If it where a 1-10 rating, however, it'd probably be a high 8 to 9.\n\nEither way, I fully recommend A Hat in Time to anyone, it is truly a great game. Especially give it a look if you like 3D platformers, or things that are way too cute for this world.", "timestamp_created": 1507827335, "timestamp_updated": 1507827468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35662914": {"recommendationid": "35662914", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979764663", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510949914}, "language": "english", "review": "Mafia see good game, Mafia must play", "timestamp_created": 1507827067, "timestamp_updated": 1507827067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35662684": {"recommendationid": "35662684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037513425", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508781243}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really good.", "timestamp_created": 1507826413, "timestamp_updated": 1507826413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35662562": {"recommendationid": "35662562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295471396", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508602753}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un plataformero bastante completo y divertido, con una historia sensilla de seguir pero muy absorvente.\nLo mejor del juego son sus personajes carismaticos.", "timestamp_created": 1507826038, "timestamp_updated": 1507826038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35662260": {"recommendationid": "35662260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001491362", "num_games_owned": 601, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507875430}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, ending is a bit abrupt.

Built in the Unreal Engine 3, you take control of the cute as heck Hat Kid, which got all of her Time Pieces lost from an incident when crossing a planet. The Mafia has broken a window and created a vacuum, which sprayed all 40 Time Pieces over the planet. She needs all to get home. This is already a good explanation on why you need Time Pieces, since they belong to you. \n\nYou will find different yarn to make new hats which give new abilities to play with. A ground pound with the ice hat, a sprint hat, time slow down... You get the idea. A simple, yet efficient mechanic. \n\nThe game covers all around 5 chapters, with plenty to explore and goodies for the progress of the game. I don't want to say too much about what they are all about, because... \n\nPros: \nThis game is incredibly charming and just bursting out with character. From the very first start you open up this software, you get bombarded with an explosion, and a whole showcase on what you can expect from the world. This sets the mark for the game already quite high without making a button press and tells you, this is a hell of a ride! When you see Hat Kid the first time, the opening animation already was adorable. This just makes you care for these things, and this image gets strong uphold for the entire adventure. \n\nA Platformer that should work need tight controls that should work and oh boy, do they work. Tight controls with homing attacks, grapple hooks, dashing and even more. It's so well done and I very rarely got the feeling that one jump was not manage-able or was unfair. Gears for Breakfast really understood what they were doing. Level Design is super creative. In the first chapter there are so many possibilities to explore. Everything is tied together and let's you have a good sense of the game mechanics. It's just perfect. All abilities get very well used, for the exception maybe of the Time Hat which slows time down and you only need pretty much for one Act. \n\nThis game in general just gets me super excited and happy throughout the entire experience. It has so many unique ideas and doesn't shy away from changing a setting completely. It's sometimes incredibly disturbing, referencing murder, torture, and all alike. The voice acting is just giving more charm than ever to it and I love it. \n\nCons:\nA game comes without it's cons. It's pretty buggy from what I could gather. Sometimes grappling didn't work as intended, climbing up aswell, tiny animation errors, clipping through some objects. You will definitely notice them, but they are so tiny and minor it won't break the the flow at all. \n\nThis is more of a personal taste, but I would have wished if we were able to complete one Chapter fully and then move on to the next. While I can understand the vision of the developers, I thought it was kind of annoying having to start the next first. \n\nA cute as heck platformer, with incredible charm and love put in it. \n89/100", "timestamp_created": 1507820588, "timestamp_updated": 1507980312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35660696": {"recommendationid": "35660696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054963635", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507991750}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

I can't give it justice in a review, but playing the game feels so smooth and fluid, you're meant to keep moving and jumping and platforming in one smooth motion, and every area in the game is packed with things to explore with these mechanics. Some games try to blend gameplay and visual direction, where movement can become sluggish to make way for proper momentum or animation- This game, it's alll about the gameplay. Sure, Hat Kid might move a little stiff or janky, but she's simply an avatar for you to move around and have fun with, and it excels at that.\n\nThe music is phenominal, and sets the tone for the entire game. There isn't one song even close to \"average\". The worlds are so pleasing to the eye, from the jam-packed Mafia Town island, to the dark and sinister woods of Subcon. Each world is uniquely different, and the cast is full of interesting and humorously dark characters.\n\nLet's also be frank. The game isn't made by some giant studio with professionals and a giant budget. The animations aren't perfect, there's clipping, there's bugs- But nothing game breaking from what I've seen. For what they have to work with, Gears for Breakfast made a very polished game that's filled to the brim with content. And any small visual glitches add to the charm, I feel. Gears for Breakfast are very interactive and open with players, having a public discord where they interact with their fans, and are very active with supporting people with any issues they may have.\n\nThere are a few issues I had with the game, a lot of people point out the awkwardness of Hat Kid's model face, and the faces in Mafia Town in general, and I can agree- But don't let that hinder your enjoyment (you rarely see human faces after the first Chapter anyway). The worst part for me was probably the tightrope platforming found in a few stages, otherwise the game excels at platforming. Voice acting is a mixed bag, but honestly I was pretty impressed overall, and a lot if not all of the major characters have great performances. Some minor characters do sound awkward though- Not BAD, but definitely an odd choice for their character design. But hey, you could even turn voices off if you wanted, or set them to a mumble with an unlockable joke badge.\n\nI managed to hundred percent the game in just shy of 24 hours, having prior experience with the Alpha and Beta (for a total of 35.5 hours as of this review). It's the kind of game you can easily go back to, with no objective, and just wander around and explore all the details the world has to offer. I can't stress enough that the game is an exploration game that feels fantastic mechanically, visually, and audibly to explore. A 3D equivalent to a Metroidvania, almost. It has a lot of influences from the GameCube era, it gives people a very N64 feel in terms of how the worlds are laid out and the focus on gameplay, and it has a timeless feel. Don't let the N64-comparisons overshadow it though- It definitely stands on it's own for being very original.\n\nMost importantly, this game is just fun. It's the most fun I've had with a video game in years.

It's really nostalgic, bringing to mind old action/platformer/collect-a-thon games like Banjo-Kazooie or Spyro. Even more so, this game is fun. It's far too rare these days to find games designed purely for fun. I spent time just exploring all of the worlds because there were so many ways to get around that it was consistently enjoyable. \n\nGranted, I did notice a few flaws. For starters, the camera is really intrusive at times. It either zooms too far into the character that you cannot be aware of hazards, or it gets stuck on walls and jolts which makes you lose your sense of direction. This makes platforming incredibly difficult when it occurs, but thankfully that isn't too often. Speaking of platforming, there was one other issue I noticed whilst platforming. This may just be me, as I haven't read any other reviews mentioning it. There were instances when I had trouble performing jumps because the camera wasn't really displaying any sense of depth. I would think I was dead-centered on a platform and realize far too late that I had drastically over-shot it. I checked this on multiple graphics settings, and didn't really notice any change. Again, this may have just been me. \nOne other minor grievance is that the game is a little short. If you just play through the chapters without getting any bonuses save for the hats, this game could feasibly be finished in as little as 5 hours, perhaps less. Granted, what is here is great. I just wish there were a little more.\n\nThat all being said, I absolutely adore this game. No matter what I was doing while playing, I was having fun. \n...

Its not perfect, but its ridiculously fun.  I've been itching for a proper 3d platformer for a while, and this is right up there with my favorite ever.  Its absolutely adorable and one of the most cheerful games I've ever played.  There are 40 total time pieces to collect(Think Mario stars) spread across 4.5 worlds.  That's 81 less than Mario 64, so this isn't going to be as long a game.  If you don't go for 100% (in-game, not achievements) then you can get out much sooner.  I was having so much fun I went for everything.  I'd say my playtime is at the upper-end of what you could expect, because I tooled around with the camera and just explored a bunch.\n\nThe level design is spectacular, with a ton of variety.  The first and third world feel the most like your classic Mario/Banjo game, while the second plays more like a series of challenges and the fourth is more like an open-world game.  Likewise, the control feels just right.  They've opted for a smaller number of normal moves, pretty much only a double jump, lungs, and wall jumps/slides, but they combine in interesting ways.  Example: You get an extra jump after a lunge.  Also, if you jump up a half-second or so after landing in a slide from a lunge, you get a speed boost.\n\nOutside of the core move set, you have hats which do different things.  Most aren't that novel outside presentation, but they are put to good use.  There's also badges, which further mix up gameplay.  I found myself using the grappling hook one with a treasure hunting map and one that kept me from taking damage from falls.\n\nThis game also features reasonable to good voice acting in a lot of roles.  If you don't like that, you can muffle them with a badge.\n\nYou really should play this game.  There's a ton of content in it, and its all extremely unique.  The  game camera isn't perfect, but its a major step up from the games of yore.  The platforming is tighter too, and I actually felt like I had good control over my character.

Heres some bullet points because I could gush for hours about what I just witnessed.\n\nThe Surprising:\n-Control is fluid and allows for a lot of variability for completing objectives. Very similar to Mario 64 and Sunshine.\n-All of the level missions feel like completely unique tasks, rather than 'do platforming challenge and recieve reward'\n-Every single mission has its own beautiful title card and some missions even change the whole level on some way.\n-The bosses are surprisingly high energy compared to the usual 3d platformer. Makes the most of Hat Kid's movement kit.\n-Camera is very good for a 3d platformer and rarely gets in the way. Has various quality of life settings for the camera too.\n-Soundtrack is baller and changes dynamically like banjo kazooie\n-A lot of graphical settings to fine tune the game to run even on toasters.\n-My horrible direct input gamepad worked immediately with it, though that might be because of steam big picture. Still cool.\n-Ability hats can be changed on the fly (even mid-platforming) and all stay useful through the whole game.\n-A lot of TECHNOLOGY. Hat Kid wears a raincoat when its raining, she blows raspberries at close by enemies, she lays belly down on the floor after landing from a dive, she kicks cans when you walk over them.\n-Low/medium difficulty, but with a very very very high skill ceiling. Custom workshop levels will be insane.\n-Tricks like jumping right as you land from a dive for a speed boost and chaining jumps into wall climbing and jumping into dives are treated as something the player learns naturally through playing rather than something that requires a tutorial to teach.\n-Loads of secret areas and things to find in each level.\n-Dangerously cute and charming. Hat Kid and the various NPCs you meet are oozing with character.\n\nThe Disappointing:\n-Maybe one or two of the bosses use the same or very similar attacks to other bosses.\n-Visually noisy at times. It doesn't really hurt knowing what you can and cant jump on, however.\n-Too Shoooooort. 40 hourglasses aren't nearly enough, even if the levels are very big.\n-Yarn becomes useless after getting all of the hats. I'm sitting on 20 extra balls of yarn at end game and still finding more.\n-Would be nice to keep the mission specific cosmetic hats as a reward for fully clearing areas\n-The last two worlds are veeeery large and hard to keep track of progress in. A map item might help.\n-Rift tokens and yarn balls aren't trackable, making it a little sad for completionists.\n-Not many badges to play with and one is absolutely required to have on at all times.\n-The inventory is largely unused\n-There is a weapon slot but only one weapon in the game (Two, if you count when you're holding a key)\n-A lot of content from alpha footage is missing. Understandable that the developers would want to put out something that feels like a complete package rather than an incomplete forever early access type thing but it would be very cool to see these things return as official dlc or free updates.\n\nConsidering the dev team listens quite closely to their fanbase, I wouldn't be surprised if some of these things were fixed or added to in the not too distant future. Its obvious to me that A Hat in Time is a passion project with a lot of heart poured into it and I wish I backed it when the kickstarter was running.

And it pulls it off magnificently.\n\nThe story is what you'd expect from a 3D Platformer, plain and simple. You play as a girl named Hat Girl who is trying to get home but when she passes over a planet, a Mafia man stops her and causes all her fuel (time pieces) to fly out and it's your job to get them back. \n\nThe gameplay is extremely fun. Hat girl is fun to control and extremely responsive. She can do the dive from Super Mario Sunshine which is very fun to do. Throughout the game you can collect hats with different abilities that help you with certain platforming challenges. You can collect tokens to spin a wheel to get items to customize Hat Girl. It can be from music remixes to color palette swaps to different hat variations. \n\nThe music is absolutely amazing. It's so catchy you'll find yourself humming the tune of some of them. Every track in this game is phenomenal and I can't stop listening to it.\n\nOverall this game is a must buy if you like 3D platformers.

Admittedly I haven't finished the game yet [spoiler] too busy tryharding to go through with a fine toothed comb to get all the rifts [/spoiler] but I'm an impatient bastard and what I have played so far is well worth the recommendation.\n\nGameplay is refined, controls are fine tuned, and I truly appreciate the hat system that was implemented. You can switch from several hats you stitch from yarn pickups, each with their own special abilities. While the abilities aren't jaw-dropping unique, their presentation is, and each one has their use (though honestly, if you're like me, you'll find yourself with Sprint the vast majority of the time). There's also 'skins' for each hat you get through a slot machine (no microtransactions, just in gameplay) as well as remixes of the music and colors. Adds a bit more character to the game, and its fun.\n\nComplementing these abilities and hats are badges sold by a mysterious vendor. These are very varied, from badges that give you a 'hookshot' to sling around, to giving you a scooter, to making everyone 'mumble' during their dialogue (in the same vein as Banjo) to even giving you a 1-hit-death challenge. They're very fun to play with, and definitely do spruce up the game.\n\nBut above all in the gameplay is the [b] variety [/b]. Holy fuck, the variety. You are virtually never doing the same thing. Granted, all of the stages revolve around platforming, but the devs [b] really [/b] gave it their all into you never being bored, and you never are. A murder mystery? A parade? A stealth/horror mission that actually makes me shit my pants a bit because I'm that much a puss? All are in there, and each one is really enjoyable. The game does such a swell job at keeping varied, but don't worry, there's still some free roam in there too. Debatably the best looking area in the game is completely free roam, and even then it's large and is varied enough in and of itself. It hits all its marks, and does so with a straight As.\n\nNot only is this game an excellent throwback to collectathons and platformers of yore (SM Sunshine, SM Galaxy, and Banjo in particular) in terms of the flawless controls and platforming in general, but it has the atmosphere to boot. Excellent music to each stage and level, and the soundtrack in its entirety is swell and nostalgic of previously mentioned upbeat platformer/collectathons. Along with games like Hotline Miami, Redout, and Undertale this has to be one of my favorite soundtracks in a game to date.\n\nAesthetically it keeps a beautifully styled, colorful world on each of its areas, and all of them are chock full of stuff to see and collect. Atmosphere on each world, and even parts of them, are unique and blissfully pretty to look at. The world doesn't feel empty in the slightest, as there's a multitude of secrets and jokes to find, as well as bonus worlds that are very reminiscent of Super Mario Sunshine's bonus levels. The jokes in this game, atleast for me, really land their mark. I really enjoy the wit and comedy of this game. [spoiler] One such example, as I'm sure you've seen on the Community Hub, is the drawings of the Protagonist, that actually stick with your save file in a certain level. Another would be playing pattycake with a mafia member only to be socked in the face for it. [/spoiler] I'm no comedian, but for whatever reason this game really tickles my funnybone.\n\nLastly I'd like to talk about the characters. They are [b] memorable [/b]. Bosses and side characters, while many are tropes youve seen before, are very memorable and loveable. Especially the Snatcher, who gives such a hilarious performance I can't stand but to not love him. Certainly the fully voice acted dialogue is a huge part of that, and it really helps the characters shine. The voice acting is very well done, which is why I personally would abstain from the previously mentioned 'mumble' badge. The game is drenched in the witty dialogue and the voices only help to add to it.\n\nSo yeah, my one flaw I could even begin to fathom mentioning is that it's probably a bit on the shorter side, but it is still well worth 30. This game is a blast to play and I hope it gets the attention it deserves. There's so much heart and charm put into this thing it'd be a shame to not buy it if you're even the slightest fan of 3D platformers or collectathons. Good humor, amazing variety, and a beautiful, nostalgic presentation.\n\ntl;dr\n\nBuy this thing.", "timestamp_created": 1507752388, "timestamp_updated": 1507752388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35645894": {"recommendationid": "35645894", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995578381", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509658675}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like a good dog\n\nit's good", "timestamp_created": 1507752377, "timestamp_updated": 1507752377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35645876": {"recommendationid": "35645876", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998851273", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509905303}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing much I can say except this game is pretty fun.

When I heard it was finally coming out a was gleefully hoping for my pre-order key to be ready to use.  I'm glad I waited so long for this game to be done. I think Gears for Breakfast certainly did a fantastic job creating their first game. \n\nFirst the cons: \n\n-This game isn't perfect, there are some technical aspects that aren't 100% (lucky they're very small details). But the charm, polish and the amount of love that went into this game is more than obvious. \n-The game is short (But the Gears for Breakfast announced there will be FREE DLC to expand the game. Can you believe that?!)\n-There is no more mumble option in the menu, it's now a badge. (I know it's minor but it takes up a slot for something that was an important feature).\n\nNow the pros:\n\n-The game is SOLID. The movement works, no part of the game is broken, it's very responsive. Something I can't say from the recent big budget games I've played. Every time I've missed a platform or failed to get to an area, it was my OWN fault, unlike other games I've played where I clip through the platform.\n-It's quirky, charming, funny, adorable and most of all FUN.\n-Somewhat challenging but forgiving.\n-The boss fights actually require skill and everything you learned from the game to beat them.\n-Tries to follow the convention of platformers but doesn't copy the problems platformer usually have (like tricky camera controls).\n-Good camera controls.\n-They actually try to form their own identity than trying to be a carbon copy of another game.\n-The game rewards exploration, creative thinking and you can always go back once you get new upgrades.", "timestamp_created": 1507751200, "timestamp_updated": 1507751264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35643540": {"recommendationid": "35643540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063755683", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508520607}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games I have ever played.\nBuy this shit right now. \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\udc4c", "timestamp_created": 1507744463, "timestamp_updated": 1507744463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35643353": {"recommendationid": "35643353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121873800", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508885869}, "language": "french", "review": "J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien avanc\u00e9 dans le jeu, et tout ce que j'ai envie de dire, c'est ; waow ! ca faisait longtemps que je n'avais plus pris autant de plaisir dans un jeu  :) Vous pouvez y aller les yeux ferm\u00e9s !", "timestamp_created": 1507743855, "timestamp_updated": 1507743855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35643076": {"recommendationid": "35643076", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972277291", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507930782}, "language": "english", "review": "If you even remotely like 3d platformers I strongly recommend A Hat In Time!\n10 metric tons of charm, super good level design, some of the most fitting music to a game ever and probably one of the best adventures overall in a while!", "timestamp_created": 1507742916, "timestamp_updated": 1507742916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35642781": {"recommendationid": "35642781", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992954702", "num_games_owned": 737, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508285725}, "language": "english", "review": "what are you doing looking at reviews dummy buy this game support the devs and enjoy this wonderful adoreable masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1507742079, "timestamp_updated": 1507742079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546454", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35642410": {"recommendationid": "35642410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076569769", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507740682}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1507740808, "timestamp_updated": 1507740808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35642261": {"recommendationid": "35642261", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997591704", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508773962}, "language": "english", "review": "Reminded me of Super Mario Sunshine.

Yooka Laylee stole the spotlight with regard to that market but here comes A Hat in Time to show us all how it's done. This game is a delight from start to finish and polished to a perfect sheen. This is really astonishing given this game raised about a tenth of the money that Yooka Laylee did.\n\nI've seen the game labelled as a \"Collect-a-thon\" game but I don't think that's quite accurate so don't get scared off if you're not a fan of those games. I think a better comparison would be the more evolved platformers we got during the Gamecube/PS2 days like the Jak Trilogy, Sly Cooper, and Mario Sunshine more than anything else. I've never felt the 3D Mario titles (64, Sunshine, Galaxy) were true collect-a-thons, as they emphasized missions rather than collecting trinkets and a Hat in Time follows suit with this. Each star (they're hourglasses in this one...) has a lot of story packed in and most of them wildly change the nature of the level. \n\nLike in the Mario games, you have a couple different missions you can pick from that will task you with a fun challenge in the level. Most of it is platforming but there's a ton of variety as well: stealth missions, surprisingly good boss fights, a detective mission, etc. This game achieves better variety than Mario Sunshine with only half the levels! Each and every star feels worthwhile here and the game never asks you to scour a level looking for every last shiny object. There are other collectibles but most of them serve as currency to buy upgrades. There are also a couple abilities you acquire during certain missions so there's some \"come back later when you get this power-up\" but it's never too bad. The game also yoinks Mario Sunshine's secret stars and actually does them far better than Sunshine (that music, OMG!). \n\nIf I had a complaint, it would be that I wish the game encouraged exploration more. I wrongfully assumed the game would be a collect-a-thon based on the previews that showed the very open Mafia town level. Though I quickly grew to like the more mission-based approach, I still wished the game had encouraged me to explore these beautiful worlds more. Aside from locking you into the mission you select, the second level has almost no exploration with 3 disconnected linear maps. The 3rd and 4th levels allow you to explore and do things out of order but it's still fairly limited. The 4th proudly touts itself as a \"free-roam\" level but I found that aspect underwhelming. You start at the center of the level and just choose one of four paths that quickly become linear platforming levels. That, to me, is not free-roam. Thankfully, the secret stars pick up the slack quite a bit with giving the game some more exploration.\n\nAside from that, I really have no complaints with this game, it is polished to a sheen. The visuals are always slick and stylish, I encountered no bugs at all, the game controls like a dream and has more depth than I thought, and even the camera works really well. It's just a delight from start to finish, and I relished every single star.

That said, was pleasantly surprised at how creative and challenging the game was overall, as while some sections would undoubtedly be pretty easy with said controller, there are things like diving under a glass wall and jumping immediately upon getting under it, or you fall. How a 3D game managed to accurately convey the type of jump normally seen in a Mega Man game, I don't know, but kudos. \nMusic: varied and always fitting of the settings, from the chill Mafia Town to the epic *spoiler final level*, but special mention goes to boss music, which leads into: \nBosses: Honestly my favorite aspect of the game, there is all of one boss that could be considered average, that being the first against some mooks and an elite mook throwing barrels. Likely intentional, as it is the first boss. Every single subsequent boss is honestly the best selection I have ever seen in a \"collectathon\" platformer, each with something unique to them, and amazing music that really captures the nature of the fight, particularly the fever-pitch MIDI number used in the super frantic final boss fight. \nGraphics: cute, cel-shaded look ensures this game's appearance won't likely age anytime soon, and as a special note really emphasizes the stark contrast the absolutely terrifying manor mission has with the rest of the game. Adorable, cartoony protagonist alone with a psychotist demon-ghost...thing... in a less-cartoony-than-normal location, complete with \"music\" that won't let you calm down. Props for that one, guys. \nPersonal thoughts: I notice people attempting to compare this game and Yooka-Laylee quite a bit lately. Honestly, having played and finished both, I don't see a lot of similarities between the two. YL was trying to continue the Banjo-Kazooie legacy, and only really did that. Whether that's good or bad is up to you. A Hat in Time, on the other hand, has far more in common with Super Mario Sunshine, while having Wind Waker-esque cel-shading and movement options reminiscent of Psychonauts, and still managed to develop an identity separate from its inspirations. Honestly, I feel if you liked these games, you'll love this one. I know I did (and am kinda sad it had to end, wouldn't mind seeing further adventures with Hat Kid somewhere down the line, DLC notwithstanding.)\n\n10/27/2017 Update: figured out how to set up an XBox 360 controller.

This makes the game very short, a good ride that ends up with you wanting more.\n-A lot of stages have great ideas to them and how you can use your hats to complete the level but most of the good ideas aren't used throughout the game and are only on little bits.\n-The enemy variety is very poor and I can see it isn't because of lack of ideas, they have everything they want and they've proven it. Unfortunately, the game falls short on this.\n-Towards the end of the act 3, right on the final seconds of the boss, the game shows a laziness it didn't show on all of the other stages. Almost if they decided to cut short the game from there on out. The chapter 4 is underwhelming and easily one of the worst chapters on the game and then they give you the chapter 5 which is actually only one level so I don't count it as a world.\n-The game doesn't reward or at least it doesn't have enough incentive for you to explore the world. I did it so it's why I've played 53hours of it and I can say the game doesn't reward you to explore it on its entirely. Because of this the game feels like a linear level almost every time.\n-I think there's not enough hats for you to enjoy. For a game called A Hat in Time, this could've been fixed. Also having only so many tries on the slot machine was a mistake.\n\nDespite all of its flaws, the game still stands up but I think it'd be better to talk about his flaws more than why it is so good, everyone is talking about how good it is but they don't find any flaws.\n\nAs for the pros for this game, it has too much to count so I'll simply make a tiny list.\n+Charming atmosphere.\n+Level design.\n+Boss battles and their difficulty. Not too easy and not too hard.\n+The music is outstanding.\n+Sounds effects are well done and every one is satisfying.\n+Our control over the character is over the top, the best platformer controllers I've had the pleasure to play on the last couple of years.\n+The writing of the characters are so good, the jokes are on point and they don't use memes every five seconds. They have their own identity and raise it proud.\n+Full voice acting to inject more life to the game. While it can't be good for every character, it's worth to mention for a couple of them.\n\nWith everything and all I think this game stands out against the huge behemoths of the genre but it needs to work on its flaws if there's a sequel.

You better believe it!\n\nThe game plays a bit like a mix between Super Mario Sunshine with it's world design and Galaxy with it's mission system, but the game goes well beyond being a Mario 64-wannabe. Each world feels very distinct from one another. Not only because of the different themes, but because each world is structured different just enough in it's narrative to keep it fresh. Exploring these worlds is made better with the buttery smooth controls. Hat Girl's air dive technique feels incredibly fluid and is an absolute joy to use and works as a great reward to skip certain platforming challenges with well timed execution. Her hat gimmick is also pretty easy to understand as well, with one button being used to control the actions of each hat. Combine that with two methods to quickly access your hats during gameplay, and the action is pretty much constant.\n\nNot only does the game have a pretty solid core, but it's oozing with charm and has a surprisingly good soundtrack from a composer I haven't really heard of before (most of the boss tracks and 'Mafia Town Is Asleep' being my personal favorites). My only real negatives are the game's somewhat short length and a slightly odd-feeling ending.\n\nFor the asking price, you really can't go wrong here.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507695231, "timestamp_updated": 1507695231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35631196": {"recommendationid": "35631196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060817043", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508078356}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a beautiful game that oozes charm every step of the way.

The bosses are challenging enough to keep you on your toes, yet as you die they do make the phases you've completed more forgiving. They throw in something new every world that kept me both happy and guessing as to what would happen next. It is all around a fantastic collectathon that can stand on its own and thrive, and I adore it for doing pretty much everything right when it could have easily played on nostalgia and gone the route of Yooka Laylee, the devs knew what made a good game and they implemented it rather then half assing it.

Followed it briefly, quickly allowed it to fall to the back of my mind - after all, it was likely to take a few years. The game seemed charming enough - they wanted to make a game to harken back to the days of old, a new Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64 type game. It's been a very long wait. Has it been worth it?\n\nI believe this to be a resounding yes. The game does resemble games of old - resembling closer to Super Mario Sunshine or Super Mario Galaxy than the N64 classics - however it does this without feeling overly derivative. While the game is clearly inspired by these older games, it brings a completely fresh experience to the table that feels like its own game. Inspired, but not quite a true successor - A Hat in Time is its own game.\n\nWhat a game it is too. It took me 10 hours to complete the game - albeit there are still achievements and a few other unlockables left to go back and get - but it feels like far longer. The game is very charming and the sound direction ties everything together, the sound effects and especially the soundtrack being fantastic. On that note, I do recommend buying the soundtrack along with the game.\n\nDifficulty felt about right. There were some challenges I ran into, but everything was fully beatable. You will not be fighting with the controls in this game outside of occasionally sliding along a wall you don't want to, and even that very rarely. It controls well and is very responsive. The boss fights are satisfying and end before they get old. Checkpoints are very forgiving throughout the game, and will keep you from getting too frustrated if you are struggling. A feature I found amazing was that if you fall in certain vertical areas of the game, it will treat you as having voided out rather than you having to climb all the way back up - a definitely welcome choice.\n\nI have 2 relatively minor issues - the Final Boss has an attack with a very wonky hitbox. This probably will not impact your experience at all unless you feel like playing through with the option that becomes available to reduce your health to 1. The other issue is that the whole way the final boss's stage is introduced feels fairly sudden. This isn't really a real issue and the final stage and boss are very satisfying, but is worth mentioning.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a modern age 3D platformer.

While shorter than I thought it would be (I never kept *that* much up the devs, just general time windows to the launch), the good news is that what's there feels *great*. I cannot emphasize enough how nice it is to jump around as Hat Kid, with the sort of responsiveness that I haven't felt from a non-Nintendo platformer in a long while. With all your abilities unlocked at the end, you're a high flying, hat swapping machine. The little touch of the dive cancelling and mild wall climbing/jumping opens the exploration up to a level close to SM64/SMS, and I'm the kind of person who really likes taking the oddball way to my goals when possible. A few camera hiccups aside (and that's next to impossible to avoid having in this genre), I always had confidence my jumps were going to land where I intended, and wasn't proven wrong.\n\nBeyond a control standpoint, the presentation is smile-inducing. The voice acting that's here is surprsingly memorable, which almost all character types having something distinct to their voices to accomadate their physical appearance. My besty description is that I'd see some shady crows, have one talk to me, and I'd go \"Yeah, that's how I thought they'd sound!\" It's very fitting, and in a few cases, surprisingly earnest during the sparse moments that are more serious/sincere. I really liked the tweaks to the HUD on particular missions, and the screen effects used during key moments or challenges were right on point. The humor is well done too, and in two instances a really comedic combination of grim and honest.\n\nI wish there was more at launch and am aware there's more coming, but I also don't feel gipped out of a quality game, either. It's a very concise game without padding/fluff, and what is there is very memorable. (By the way, the boss fight songs get stupendous.) If you want to itch that SM64/SMS vibe and can't get/wait for Odyssey, you should give the devs here some credit and buy this game.

The game does have a nice homing attack and clipping feature to help you stick the landing, but more often than not you'll plummet to your death when you're trying to land on that next high-wire the first time.\n\nControls VS Platforming Segments:  With the double jump, long jump and wall jump, you can pretty much reach any surface with ease, which can sometimes make it easy to get lost when you're trying to get from point A to point B.  Try to follow the gems exactly to see where you're INTENDED to go rather than making up your own path.\n\nCut Content:  With all games a lot of intended ideas end up on the cutting room floor.  Here you have ideas that were cut, but just enough of the intended design remains for you to look at, sigh, and say \"I bet that would've been pretty cool\".  Personally I'd rather the whole thing just get cut.\n\nWriting:  Inconsistencies in characters is really a small complaint but it stuck with me so I mentioned it.

The mechanics for getting around the worlds you'll be visiting have clearly been tested and refined to near perfection, being perfectly functional while also being designed so that there's always more than one way to tackle an obstacle in your way.\n\nThis is both a strength and a weakness, however. Through the course of the game you'll unlock multiple hats, and I was surprised early on to realize that, while I thought I'd be getting tons of hats for tons of different abilities, I'd actually be getting less than ten.\n\nThroughout the entire game, I almost entirely used two hats - the sprint hat, and the default tophat which points you in the direction of clues and mission objectives. The sprint hat doesn't do much else other than allowing you to move much faster and jump further, but that's all it needs to make many of the games' obstacle courses throughout most of it's worlds' sublevels completely trivial and possibly to complete in a way that probably wasn't intended.\n\nThe other hats consist of a hat that allows you to throw potions specifically for the purpose of blowing up otherwise undamagable objects, a hat that allows you to freeze yourself and pound the ground, a mask that allows you to bring in objects and so on from another reality, and a hat that presumably stops time.\n\nThe problems with the hats that aren't for sprinting or clue-finding is that they're too overspecialized in what they do, having one specific use that clearly caused the developers to shoehorn in situations in where you have no choice to use them. In short - a possible lack of playtesting and foresight means that you will rarely if ever be using these hats for anything other than the situations where they are utterly needed to get an item. \n\nThe Ice Hat's only use seems to be activating jump pads to new locations, most of which are extremely easy to reach with the platformer mechanics alone and, usually, the sprint hat. \n\nThe potion brewing hat and it's projectiles serve only to destroy certain objects that you can't destroy otherwise, and nothing else. It's capable of damaging enemies, but combat is fairly trivial and easy anyway.\n\nThe hat that brings in objects from other realities is the one out of the three that the game gets the most use out of, but it was still clearly created with a specific purpose in mind, and again many situations that were designed with it in mind can be bypassed with relative ease without it. \n\nDespite the variety and uniqueness of these hats being a clear selling point for the game, I did not actually unlock the Time Stop hat before the game ended, and the game never stopped me from playing a level to tell me that it was required, meaning one of the possibly cooler ideas for a hat - again, one of the main selling points of the game - is not only completely optional, but you also discover it's existence when you're practically done with the game anyway.\n\nAs for the worlds and the sublevels in those worlds, the game starts of good, becomes briefly brilliant, and then slowly loses steam over the course of a few hours, ending in an exciting but genuinely abrupt way that feels as if it was rushed.\n\nMafia Town is the first world, one that's generally open with a lot of good design in it, clearly made with multiple types of players in mind. New players won't have much trouble with it at all thanks to it's pacing, while those more experienced with platformers will enjoy how Mafia Town allows you to tackle different problems in different ways. \n\nSadly, Mafia Town is the first hint that the game was either rushed, or the time that the game had, enough or not, was misused. Even in the very first world, you can find various obstacles that the designers made with the hats you recieve later in mind - even the reality changing hat, which you'll receive most likely several hours later, at what I can only describe as halfway through the game, if not later.\n\nThe need to include uses for all of the hats you can find in the game, with only their specific uses, means that Mafia Town is a bit of a general mess when it really should have been the part of the game that focuses mostly on the platforming mechanics themselves at first, and later introduces the mechanics of hats to organically open the world up for the player to explore. As it stands now, Mafia Town can be completely beaten with nothing but the sprint hat, and will likely later be revisited for yarn - the item you must collect to create hats - and relics, which serve as nothing but ways to open up small obstacle courses you can find in any of the world sublevels, mostly for completionists.\n\nIt's worth mentioning at this point that there are 4 worlds, and each one has 5 or so levels for you to play. The length of these missions vary, but my final playtime clocked in at 8.5 hours. I didn't go for 100%, but I did finish all of the worlds and their missions.\n\nThe game is at it's best when it's sublevels change the game in a way that, while being unique and interesting, still meshes well with the platforming mechanics. Mafia Town is good with this, having sublevels that are a fairly good example of what's to come - changing the level with different types of objectives that, of course, will require different approaches depending on the sublevel you're playing. You may be chasing a character in a rainstorm in one sublevel, and traversing a lava filled mafia town in the next.\n\nThe second world is, in my opinion, the best part of the game. Not only does it contain the most charming writing and characters in the game - as well as having the most dialogue out of any other world - but every sublevel is unique, and the game is at it's best when it's trying to BE unique.\n\nWithout wishing to spoil anything, World 2 takes the form of a kind of contest between two different characters and you can take a side to get a different result at the end of the world, though that isn't too important. Regardless of which side you like, the world starts off with a single level to introduce you to these characters, and the mechanics you'll later find and use in both of their levels - quick, open area platforming, and slower stealth segments. From there, even though both of the characters sublevels will take place in their same area, the mission will be completely unique every time. \n\nCompare this to level 3 - it's a fairly large open area, but it's one that was clearly made with finally getting some use out of the hats that all have specific uses. Rather than meshing together with the hat and platforming mechanics to make one smoothly playing cohesive level, World 3 and all of it's sublevels, with the exception of one stealth level, are little more than larger areas with small obstacle courses scattered around the world that exist for the sake of existing.\n\nWorld 4 is my personal least favorite part of the game, only having one sublevel that is called \"free roam\", aka a small hub point that takes you to four massive obstacle courses that are all incredibly generic and forgetable, without a single notable character or interesting event. \n\nThe final world is level 5. It's a massively abrupt, fairly easy long obstacle course that tries and fails to be a \"final exam\" with all of the hats you've collected so far, culminating with in a final battle with your so called \"rival\", who failed to make a single apperance other than said boss battle from the moment she became your \"rival!\"\n\nThe game feels incredibly rushed, but not just because of the length. It started off excellent, but the hats that serve specific purposes that don't smoothly mesh with the rest of the game's design and the lackluster design and thought put into later levels lets it down towards the end.\n\nHopefully, this game will one day get a sequel where the devs not only learn from their mistake, but either have more time or - in the case of having enough time - learn to use the time that they have properly.\n\n8/10 - Great..at first.", "timestamp_created": 1507643453, "timestamp_updated": 1507643453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35617650": {"recommendationid": "35617650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079090905", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507774586}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1507643340, "timestamp_updated": 1507643340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35617634": {"recommendationid": "35617634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064196487", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513120594}, "language": "english", "review": "it's sooooo gooooooood jfc it's so cute and it's just so fun bless this game", "timestamp_created": 1507643264, "timestamp_updated": 1507643264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35617571": {"recommendationid": "35617571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001605349", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507732136}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh wow so first review time I guess?\nI have to say A Hat in Time is one of my most anticipated games this year.

I'm hyped for explorative, but action-packed collectathons like Super Mario Odyssey, and I was indeed hyped for A Hat in Time.\n\nSo did it live up to the hype? Was it less so? The answer probably won't surprise you.\n\nA Hat in Time caters exactly to the type of gamer that I am. I love cutesy stuff. I like a story that attempts to be genuine and heartfelt. And I sincerely enjoy a game that is packaged with different visuals and themes. Yes, this game has all of it, and it is an incredibly solid platformer to boot.\n\nThe main thing that we are told by the devs of this game when it comes to the moveset of Hat Kid, is that she was deliberately designed to be as versatile as possible, yet still within the realms of not being considered overpowered. Her versatility allows many players to make up for inaccuracies with their jumps, because of the combination of double jumps, dives, and divecancels, as well as the wallrunning move and walljumps.\n\nYou will be surprised just how far you'll be able to go with Hat Girl. Some jumps seem impossible, but you just might make them regardless. Some walls may seem just about too high, but you can do just the right maneuvre to climb them and make rapid progress.\n\nThe game's content is pretty much divided in 2 different styles of worlds. The traditional open-ended collectathon type, and the more narratively focused linear type. There are 3 of the former, 2 of the latter, and all feature super varied setups, characters, missions, and stories. Some may make you laugh, others may make you cover in fear.\n\nI like to connect this type of game with the selfsame principle that Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door went for. It makes sure that every mission and world feels distinct and interesting. With the exception of the time rifts, you don't quite see much of the same here, and you can always count on being pleasantly surprised.\n\nAs for the collectibles? Most are used beyond the sole promise of story progression. You can collect gem pons to buy badges, you can buy badges to gain several abilities, and you can collect yarn to make different hats, which also grant you prominent abilities. There are also custom palettes for Hat Kid, as well as unlockable remixes for ingame music tracks, and different types of the hats that you already have.\nAll of this, and yet the Time Pieces are the only collectibles that count towards your completion percentage and bonuses.\n\nIt's kind of nifty I'd say.\n\nSo would I recommend it? By all means yes. As a guy who loves the genre and enjoyed the Gamecube era's take on it, I feel that I would say it's worth at least it's basic asking price. I myself spent about 11-12 hours getting all Time Pieces. People on average say that they took 13 hours just to beat the game. So you'll get your bang for the buck regardless of whether you are a veteran in the genre or not.\n\nAre there shortcomings? Yes, but I would be spoiling the game if I listed them. Just know that my issues are entirely about some of the story, and you may disagree in that regard. Nevertheless, I loved this game, and I am looking forward to see what kind of modding we'll see in the future, because I will for sure come back to it when that workshop is open.", "timestamp_created": 1507640835, "timestamp_updated": 1507640835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35616486": {"recommendationid": "35616486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034786842", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510750444}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally found a proper game to binge on!

Combining tight, reflex-intensive gameplay with sprawling, diverse levels is a recipe for excellence in my book, although in recent years the genre has somewhat fallen into neglect. There have been a handful of games in the past year that attempted to breathe some life back into it, though, with different approaches. Yooka-Laylee vied to bring back the Collectathon genre. Clustertruck is a different sort of 3D platformer, based around fast, constantly-moving autoscroller levels. Super Mario Odyssey, out in just under three weeks, looks to be a love letter to Super Mario Sunshine and 64, my two favorite 3D platformers ever.\nWhen I Kickstarted A Hat in Time, I expected to get a game that aped Sunshine and 64, had a handful of great ideas, played well, and was a fun game in a genre that was woefully underserved, especially on PC. Instead, Hat took its lengthy development time in order to polish, expand, and perfect its core concepts, and the result is a fantastic game that doesn't pay homage to its predecessors so much as graduates from them with flying colors.\n\nYou start the game in your novelty-shaped spaceship, on your way home from adventures unknown. You're passing by a small planet with a load of strange, unique regions, when you're hailed by a Mafia member who tells you that you need a permit, or can't fly by the planet for free, or some such nonsense. Hat Kid has no time for any of this nonsense, and attempts to break free, which results in the fuel for her spaceship, Time Pieces, being scattered all over the planet below. Now marooned, she heads to the planet's surface in order to get these hourglasses back by any means necessary.\nThis sets a tone that you'll see for the rest of the game: Hat Kid will help people with their issues, but her main goal is absolutely to get the heck back home. True Neutral.  This encounter with the Mafia also shows you the kinds of characters you'll be encountering: goofy, bumbling grumps with writing that I expected to grow old quickly, but which kept me chuckling until the end. \n\nThe first world is Mafia Town, a bustling seaside city where bald, broken English strongmen who all look the same rule with iron fists. You quickly team up with Mustache Girl, a character with just as much spunk as you, but who is decidedly more good-aligned. She helps you get your first couple Time Pieces in levels designed to teach you many of the mechanics of A Hat in Time: the double jump, the dive, the dive cancel, and hat powers. \nAlmost immediately, you'll see just how much effort has been put into making every single part of this game feel exceptional. 3D Platformers have long been bemoaned for their attempts at camera control, whether they opt for an automatic camera or user-controlled. I can safely say that there was not a single time in this entire game that I felt like I was fighting the camera. In almost every scenario, the camera is smart enough to adjust automatically, letting you focus on the platforming. When you feel you need to take control, you can make minute adjustments that don't autosnap back, letting you control the camera as you run, jump, and dive your way around tricky platforming sections.\nMafia Town is an incredible vertical slice of A Hat in Time for multiple other reasons besides showing you the ropes, though. Not only does the world offer a good amount of quirky characters, both in the mafiosos and the hapless townspeople, it also has a decent amount of collectibles to find, including Yarn which allows you to knit new Hats (which grant powers that can often open up sections of prior levels to find new items, including Yarn, and so on), Relics that allow you to play a slot machine where you'll unlock cosmetic items, and one of my favorite features: Time Rifts. These small glowing orbs are unlocked after certain Acts, and show up in the world screen as photos of locations in the world. You have to study the photo and then pick an Act, then hunt down the orb. Once you touch it, you're transported to one of two level types. The first is a love letter to Super Mario Sunshine's F.L.U.D.D.-less levels, great abstract blocks in space with incredibly tight platforming that's often a lot more challenging than in the core Acts. The second are strange, memory-hunting collection levels where you must find relics and pieces of a journal in order to progress, which will let you view a short picture book at the end with the memories you collected. The former are some of my favorite levels in the game, but the latter are fun in their own way, especially as a cooldown from some of the difficult levels of the core Acts.\n\nThere's one other core Hat in Time concept that Mafia Town introduces, and that's the stunningly fun boss fights. There's a miniboss that is played on a purely horizontal plane, where you must jump over barrels and dodge them, and that core dodging mechanic carries through to every other boss fight in the game. Boss fights in A Hat in Time feel akin to Donkey Kong Country boss battles in 3D, which is not something I would have anticipated working (or being fun) but they are some of the highlight encounters in the game. Each boss has multiple phases and attack patterns, and often has in-match cutscenes and dialogue (which is skipped if you retry the boss - one more excellent Quality of Life feature). These are not your 3-hit Mario bosses or 5-hit DKC bosses, though -- often, each boss takes 20-30 hits to defeat, meaning each boss battle is a test of stamina, reflexes, and patience. I'm not usually a boss guy in platformers, because I find them to often be trite or unnecessary, but Hat's bosses shine with the same polish as everything else in the game.\n\nThe boss encounters also have some of the best music in the game, with bombastic tracks that call to mind everything from Mario to Undertale. These are far from the only standout songs, though: the entire soundtrack is a delight, with each track suited perfectly for its area. Sound design in general in this game is fantastic, whether it's the Link-style groans and oofs when you bash into something or the thousands of voice-acted, well-written lines. \n\nI don't want to talk too much about the other three worlds in A Hat in Time, to avoid spoiling some of the best levels in what is unfortunately a pretty short game (I finished in just under six hours, with over half of the total Time Pieces, although from looking around I was on the short side), but rest assured: each world introduces new concepts, enemy types, and even entirely different gameplay mechanics. There's a murder mystery, a parade, and a sneak-and-hide horror level (which is genuinely scary!) as well as levels that are nothing but good old-fashioned platformer fun.\n\nA Hat in Time is one of the best games I've played all year, and one of the best 3D Platformers ever. With two worlds coming as free DLC, as well as co-op in an upcoming patch, mod support, and more, it looks like this instant classic is going to stick around for some time. I hope that anyone who likes the genre, great writing, fantastic music, and genuinely perfect controls picks this up, because they will not be disappointed.\n\n5/5", "timestamp_created": 1507624986, "timestamp_updated": 1511631818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684130", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35612932": {"recommendationid": "35612932", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995621419", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508365929}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the new golden standard of Collect-A-Thon platforming.\nLet me get it out of the way: A Hat in Time was worth the wait, and your time.\nHave a poem:\n\nSeething charm and polish\nthe gameplay does astonish\nthe test of time this game will last\nhats off to Gears for Breakfast", "timestamp_created": 1507624474, "timestamp_updated": 1508068097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35612861": {"recommendationid": "35612861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084793093", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510933121}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fantastic!

If that sounds interesting, get it now, it's really well-done.\n\n[b]Note:[/b] I played using an XBox360 controller as an input device. If you're going to use keyboard and mouse, YMMV in regards to controls. I think controller is the preferred input method, so I will hazard a guess that kb&m controls aren't as natural.\n\nThis review contains no hard spoilers, but slightly-sensitive examples and comments are under spoiler tags. Don't read if you want to go in blind.\n\n[b]Slightly longer version:[/b]\n\nPros:\n+ Cutesy designs and animations, bright colors, overall nice to look at\n+ Nostalgia trip for those who remember mid-to-late 90's in gaming\n+ A lot of variety in gameplay and presentation -- a lot more than I would expect going off from genre alone\n+ Usually very fluid and satisfying controls, but see below\n+ A reasonable amount of stuff to collect/unlock. Not too much. Could be a negative for some.\n+ Runs beautifully, not a single crash, no slowdowns, no graphical glitches or any other problems during almost 10-hour continuous session.\n\nNeutral:\n* Game length: 8-10 hours of casual play, probably closer to 15-18 if going for 100%-completion.\n* Story is nothing more than an excuse for doing stuff. Sometimes nonsensical stuff. Sometimes story is nonsensical as well. Latter might be a positive depending on your sense of humor.\n* No new grounds broken graphically, but it fits very well with overall style, so there's nothing to complain about\n* Characters have about enough personality to carry you through completely nonsensical bits of the story, but that's about it. While not necessarily one-dimensional, there's not much depth to speak of either.\n* Ending [spoiler]is pure cheese, which[/spoiler] is fine by me.\n\nCons:\n- Camera can be difficult and frustrating at times. Developers deserve much praise for making it work well most of the time, but when it doesn't, it really doesn't. A way to temporarily lock camera in manual mode would solve this completely, but as the time of writing, there is no such option.\n- There are a few precision-platforming sections, and those can be extremely frustrating due to slippery and imprecise controls. Usually, precision of controls is not an issue, it's precise enough. Not for these sections though. Expect accidental wallruns of death and plummeting into bottomless pits of doom after missing tightropes by a hair. Somewhat offset by generous checkpoints, but can be rage-inducing nonetheless.\n- Excluded from Steam's Family Sharing. I have no idea why, and find this decision rather baffling on part of developers. Personally I have no problem just firing up my account to let someone else play. But it's rather inconvenient, and for no good reason, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, while A Hat in Time isn't without some problems, it's very enjoyable overall, and I can easily ignore some of the frustrations I had with it. So it gets a wholehearted \"thumbs up\" from me.\n\n[b]A really long version:[/b]\n\nA Hat in Time is a great callback to good-old days of 3D collectathon platformers. Also if it's not obvious from promo videos, it's dangerously cute, both visually and thematically.\n\nIt's not just that though. A Hat in Time innovates on the genre a bit, making it more of a variety show, varying not only visual design between \"worlds\", but also changing up gameplay and underlying theme, which helps keep the experience fresh for all 8 to 10 hours of casual play (not completing 100%, but definitely not speedrunning either). Some levels actually throw platformer conventions out of the window for something entirely different. [spoiler]At one point, for example, it turns into something resembling a survival horror game, at another it becomes a stealth game, etc.[/spoiler] That variety is very much welcome, since many older platformers could get a bit repetitive down the line.\n\nGraphically speaking, there is no new ground broken, but it's very nice to look at, with bright colors, cute and imaginative designs, and adorable cartoony facial expressions. It's nothing really unexpected, but very well done.\n\nStory is... Well, rather simplistic. I won't get into spoiler territory, but it's rather obvious that story wasn't the focus. It's perfectly serviceable for what it is, if completely nonsensical at times, but it's about as deep as a kiddie pool, and not terribly engaging either. Most of the time, story serves as an excuse to get you do stuff. It doesn't take itself seriously, so neither will I.\n\nCharacters have about enough personality to carry the nonsensical story forward. While not necessarily one-dimensional, they don't have much depth either.\n\nEnding is [spoiler]as cheesy as you would expect from a Saturday morning cartoon. It's basically pure cheese, but it's[/spoiler] entirely consistent with the rest of the game, so it gets a pass.\n\nThe game isn't without its problems though, none of which are game-breaking, but some are extremely frustrating to deal with.\n\nFirst problem is inherent of all 3D platformers and that is the camera. While considerably better than your typical camera from late 90's, it's sometimes too smart for its own good, either locking or stubbornly shifting into a particularly awkward angle that makes judging distance unnecessarily hard. It is usually adjustable, but I had to fight with it a number of times in precision-platforming sections. A way to temporarily lock the camera into a manual angle relative to the level would solve this complaint entirely, but at the time of writing, there is no such option.\n\nWhile on topic of precision platforming, I have to say that while the game forces you into it a few times, it doesn't handle that all that gracefully. Don't get me wrong, most of the time controls are very good and satisfying, but it's much better suited for moving though a relatively open stage fast, rather than precisely landing on a tightrope after a hookshot swing. Landing on tightropes is particularly frustrating, especially in dimly-lit areas where everything's grey and judging distances is a pain in it's own right.\n\nI've also had problems with character locking into a wall-run, then jumping away from the platform I was trying to land on, and towards inevitable doom, if I as much as bumped the wall. And it's nigh impossible to avoid bumping walls when trying to jump through series of small ledges.\n\nI should also point out that some platforming sections are timed, and while you can get a few upgrades to make those much easier, without those upgrades they offer very little room for error, requiring nearly frame-perfect movement in some cases -- and while some of the more difficult ones are entirely optional, some aren't, which can be a source of frustration -- and hand-cramps.\n\nDifficulty of some platforming sections is offset by the game's generous checkpoints and infinite \"lives\", as would be expected from a modern game, that isn't positioning itself as \"NES hard\". But playing through a segment 10x times only to be tripped up repeatedly by imprecise controls or camera acting up can be very frustrating. Expect that resisting sudden urges to break your controller/keyboard is a part of the challenge.\n\nThat said, the cases where I really had to re-do a section more than thrice, where I felt it wasn't my fault, are few and far in-between, so overall the game controls very nicely.\n\nI should probably mention that I finished the game in one go, in about 10 hours or so, which itself speaks volumes of how much I enjoyed it. But I bring that up to say that I didn't experience any technical problems whatsoever, the game is wonderfully stable and runs beautifully.\n\nAs stated earlier, I find this is a great game, and it's faults are not game-breaking, and can be easily forgiven, so it gets a wholehearted recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1507622152, "timestamp_updated": 1507622727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35611599": {"recommendationid": "35611599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028319431", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511057864}, "language": "english", "review": "yo this game is lit lmao", "timestamp_created": 1507617472, "timestamp_updated": 1507617472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35611256": {"recommendationid": "35611256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088926017", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508907021}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, but also a bit disappointing.\nI helped kickstart this game back in 2013 and loved the constant supply of develop updates.\nAfter playing through the game, it was saddening to not see some concept characters like the Moon Jumper come to fruition (and Adult Hat Kid).\nHopefully we'll see a return of some of the cut-characters in future DLC.\nRegardless, this game was incredibly enjoyable from start to finish, and I'm not done playing yet.\nThe controls feel great and boss fights were fun (maybe the final fight could have been more drawn out though).\nWhen multiplayer arrives I plan to give it a go!\nOverall, a solid game which will become even better with the planned future updates.", "timestamp_created": 1507615721, "timestamp_updated": 1507615721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35611216": {"recommendationid": "35611216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174349287", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509123023}, "language": "english", "review": "cute game\ni love it", "timestamp_created": 1507615508, "timestamp_updated": 1507615508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35611129": {"recommendationid": "35611129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024623426", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507934983}, "language": "english", "review": "I did as much of Mafia Town as I think is possible, so I'll be starting the second world next time.

While calling back to games of the Nintendo 64 and GameCube eras, 'A Hat in Time' isn't afraid to mix things up and get out of the conventional 3D platformer's comfort zone.\n\nThough the story as a narrative isn't much to write home about, it is more than made up for by the game's quirky, lovable, and especially humorously-written cast of characters.\n\nThe presentation is fantastic, with sickeningly adorable character design, expressive and alluring worlds, both silly and awesome visual flairs, and a top-notch soundtrack to boot. The voice actors/actresses chosen varied on quality of their performances, but the cast as a whole fits the game near-perfectly.\n\nPerhaps the greatest quality of 'A Hat in Time' is its gameplay. The game's lead, Hat Kid, controls similarly of Mario back in Sunshine, though she has many a trick up her sleeve. Jumps, dives, and short wall dashes, in conjunction with an assortment of various, wacky hats, make Hat Kid one of the most versatile platforming characters that I've ever seen, yet much of the game's controls feel very natural and easy to pick up. Each of the worlds Hat Kid explores are filled with goodies to collect and obstacles to face. In terms of difficulty, the game makes a steady incline in progression, with perhaps a few exceptions.\n\nAll this said, there are a few noticeable issues, one being that completion may be impossible, at least in regards as to the game's \"Rift Tokens\", used to unlock cosmetic bonuses and soundtrack remixes, as after searching high and low through every world (with the game's dedicated item hunting skill equipped), I found myself short of two final goodies. Secondly, the game has its share of noticeable bugs here and there, mostly a handful of segments simply lacking the spit and polish of others. Of course, it's only been a matter of days since the game has released, so these issues are subject to a possible patch.\n\nAt its core, 'A Hat in Time', is practically a masterpiece, despite some issues/nitpicks every once in a while. I binged this game over three days, playing from 11 in the evening to 3 in the morning, and I don't regret it. I can easily see myself replaying this gem over and over again, much like 'Banjo-Kazooie'. 'A Hat in Time' not only honors the 3D-platformers of the past, but breathes new life into the genre, making the genre's revival seem much more hopeful than previously. Do yourself a favor and play 'A Hat in Time'.\n\ntl;dr: This game is an excellent successor to 'Super Mario Sunshine', 'Banjo-Kazooie', and the like.

For a game that was crowdfunded and in development for around 4 years, by golly is it impressive how good this game is.\n\nTHE GOOD\n- The controls are fluent and jumping around and climbing is quick and feels natural. A controller is highly recommended.\n- The music, graphics are exceptional and create unforgettable worlds and levels. The game's 'cute-as-heck' slogan is 100% accurate.\n- The amount of care put into making this IP feel original is clear, unlike many other crowdfunded games which market themselves for nostalgia value far too much.\n- Most, if not, all levels are fresh and unique. They rarely ever feel like busy-work and are engaging to play and complete.\n- Chapter 1 is the first world (duh) and is the best world in the game. It has the most to do and see and is very beautiful and simply fun to explore.\n- Pons (the coins of this game) are common and easy to collect, and it is not required to collect them all in a level, so it is not made a chore to gather them.\n\nIN THE MIDDLE\n- The story is simple to understand not very complex, there is little dialogue and few named characters.\n- Customizing Hat Girl is random, done through use of a slot machine following a special, mini stage. Customization is the only use of Tokens you find throughout the game's levels.\n-  There is only one weapon, and although this game is not combat focused, the lack of customization is somewhat dissapointing, but not problematic.\n- Chapter 2 is extremely linear, Chapter 3 is more open but lacks verticality or interesting features, and Chapter 4 is way too open and feels like many tiny levels that are glued together and lack congruency. Chapter 1 is by far the most polished for a game about exploring and collecting things. \n- A certain achievement requires you to make a crude joke. Your mileage may vary.\n\nTHE BAD\n- I beat this entire game in 17 hours to 100% completion. This game is short, if you are proficient at these kinds of games.\n- There are three annoying enemy types: Crows, Cats, and Headless Statues. The crows are small and weak, but a certain variant moves quickly and can push the player very far without warning. The Cats can turn invisible and invulnerable, and only reveal themselves to quickly attack. Headless Statues are fast, indestructible, and pursue relentlessly. I do not know what you are meant to do if one starts chasing you and can catch you off guard since they don't move right away.\n- As of now (a few days following release), the camera has a tendency to get stuck on ceilings and jitter around. Many walls cannot be climbed up due to the top of the wall ending in a lip that you get caught on.\n- Some achievements are difficult to attain due to some frustrating mechanics (STEALTH).\n\n\"Short, but sweet\" is how I would describe this game. If you asked me to give it number out of 10 I'd give it an 8. The biggest problem is just how short this game is.

The last time I remember 100% completing a good 3D platformer was over a decade ago. But for some reason, this game is the most addicting 3D platformer I have ever played. It is to the point where I 100% completed the game within a matter of days. \n\nI like the variety in the missions where each mission has its own distinct feel to it that makes it recognizable just by looking at a screenshot. The controls were very well done, and the camera is surprisingly good. In 3D platformers, the camera is usually the worst part of the game. Here, I\u2019ve rarely had a moment where the camera got in the way of the gameplay.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn\u2019t like about this game, it\u2019s the use of urgency in some levels. Aside from the infamous manor level, there is the train bomb level and the stealth sections. Levels like these are fun to talk about, but playing them is a different story. \n\nOverall, this game needs more love.

I bought this back in the stone ages, before time existed itself for like 20 bucks. Was it worth the wait and the money? Uhhh, probably I guess, it's hard to tell after so much time was taken. I came back into this game with zero expectations and had forgotten it existed, so I guess it was a nice surprise. \n\nIt's really light on content though. As you can see, less than 20 hours and I even got all the time pieces (AKA STARS.) \n\nIt's a nice game, if you can ignore that. The gameplay feels really good. Music is pretty decent. Animations can go from pretty good to reaaaaally stiff and ugly, but it's nothing that I feel harms the game that much. The zones themselves are really pretty and fun to explore. \n\nYou get a sprint hat, and that's pretty much the only useful hat. I feel it's kind of strange to tie sprint to a hat and grapple to a badge when you kind of need both, or at least would want them on at all times. You do have to switch hats to use different abilities which is mildly annoying, but they're barely used that it's a non issue, at least to me. I can see how some might not like it, but eh, minor flaw, just leaves a very light meh feeling in there. \n\nIt's got a few glitches, but nothing game breaking. Some walls are a little goofy, but mostly a solid game. \n\nVery similar to Mario 64/Sunshine/Galaxy. I figured it'd be more like Banjo Kazooie, but MUCH much closer to 3D Mario games. I think it takes after Galaxy most in terms of it being a bit more linear than 64 and Sunshine, but it likes to mesh the line a lot.  Some levels are a lot more open, some are not. \n\nBosses are very uhh... inoffensive is probably the best way to put it. They're not bad by any means, but probably nothing I'd feel the urge to replay again. They tried to make it pretty fast paced, and look exciting though, so I give em credit. They're all right. \n\nVoice acting can vary. it feels really strange at times. I guess I got used to it as time went on. EVERYONE is voice acted, for EVERYTHING except until later when.... they're not?? So it's a little weird. You can get a badge to make it be mumbling, but honestly, even the mumbling feels a little off. Not a huge flaw, still.\n\nCamera can be a little annoying at times, but this seems to just be the way of 3D platformers and something you'll have to get used to. \n\nOverall though, the gameplay feels good. You have a ton of movement options, and it feels good to abuse them. Also, very easy game, but still felt rewarding.\n\nIt's a decent game, and I hope we can see more indie devs follow this game's way of doing 3D platformers. Pretty high quality, and pretty fun. It's not going to blow your socks off and be GOTY, but it's a good stepping stone for bringing back 3D platformers for sure. \n\nI think if you're interested in an INDIE 3D Mario-like game, you should give it a shot. 30 dollars might be on the expensive side for a 15 hour game, so maybe wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1507583290, "timestamp_updated": 1507583290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35604371": {"recommendationid": "35604371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195599785", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508590568}, "language": "english", "review": "Have to say this game is incredible.

The level design itself is amazing - the environments that you explore are unique and varied, and are open to explore and search for collectibles and secrets. The collectibles themselves never feel like a chore to find, as they help unlock both upgrades for Hat Kid to improve her arsenal, and cosmetic changes to allow for you to customise Hat Kid.\n\nCharm oozes from this game, between the world and characters that inhabit it. Hat Kid is simply a very adorable protagonist, shown mostly through her animations in the game and the few small lines of dialogue that she speaks. Most of the characters are memorable and have genuinely funny dialogue, which is backed up by good voice acting. The places you visit are all unique, vibrant and full of things to look at and explore, which backs up its already great level design. The soundtrack is fantastic, Pascal Michael Stiefel, Grant Kirkhope, and the rest of the composers outdid themselves, with every track being great to listen to, which really helps you get immersed into the experience that this game provides.\n\nOverall, you should definitely give this game a look, and possibly even try it.

Definitely worth the three year wait.\n\nThe game plays solidly - it's a 3D collect-a-thon platformer in the same vein as Banjo Kazooie (which I've never played) and games like the old Spyro trilogy (which I've played a ton of.) It certainly plays smoothly, even on a mouse and keyboard. There were a few spots where I struggled to get timing right, mainly with stuff involving the Dweller's Mask, but overall nothing would really frustrate you for bad handling.\n\nGraphically, the game is a beauty. The characters are absolutely charming, and the environments are lush and beautiful. The game even gets a lil creepy at certain parts, and works it out really well! The levels are varied and carry a unique feel to each one.\n\nThe music and sound design is fantastic - the voice acting is great, although I'm pretty sure they ripped out a certain NPCs voices due to dumb backlash - which is a huge shame, in my opinion. Each level has really great music, with a few getting remixes as well due to the Kickstarter stretch goals. You can also opt to go for garbled dialogue by getting a badge, if you want it to feel more like Kazooie.\n\nEverything about this game is great - really, the only thing that's bad is that it's pretty darned short, so hopefully Gears for Breakfast will find a way to give more content some time!\n\nAbsolutely recommend this game if you love platformers or if you loved old platformer games like Spyro and such, it carries a lot of the charm that those older games had in a nice, modern package!\n\nReally good to see this be such a success!", "timestamp_created": 1507570185, "timestamp_updated": 1511854528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35600772": {"recommendationid": "35600772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038096837", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511423750}, "language": "english", "review": "The level design is fantastic. \n\nThere's a lot of games where after a while you're just rushing to the end, and it gets repetitive.

It delivers what YK failed to do, captivate the audience and innovate about what made platformers so fun and special. A Hat in Time didn't reel me in during the demo because it seemed like a buggy mess with horrible colors and contrast. However, after a month of not touching it and opening up the game upon release, it was nothing like Beta! The game has wonderful and vibrant colors! The game reeled me in quickly when I noticed how quirky and hilarious the characters were. Hat Kid is very adorable, and the gameplay feels extremely rewarding unlike Yooka-Laylee. It actually means something to get equipments (different hats and hat-badges), as opposed to just \"unlocking\" a new movie like in Yooka-Laylee. I'm only barely a few hours into the game, and I already love many aspects about it. It's not a perfect game by any means, but the quirky characters, vibrant colors, and rewarding gameplay hooked me in ASAP.

If you've played Psychonauts or Paper Mario: TTYD, a lot of characters and beats will feel uncomfortably familiar. It's a shame because the game is quite capable of witty one-liners and inventive characters, but bits like these make the game feel unconfident in its ability to be original.

At this point in time I haven't progressed very far into it,heck, I'm only on the second stage, but everything about this game is just fun, the controls are fluid, the humor is spot on, the level design is easy to memorize and a fun to blast through, and this is one of 3 games I have bought the sountrack to, and I only had to listen to a handful of songs before I made that decision. It's very well optimized for pcs as well, I have a gtx970 and an i74790k, and while playing this game at some of the highest settings possible, I have yet to see it drop one fram below 60, and my dualshock 4 controller works from the start without having to instal 3rd party software (take that dark souls). This is one of those rare cases where I honestly reccomend buying it whilst at full price because the developers deserve every penny of it for the amount of love and hardwork put into this game. I'd say my only issues with the game are that the dash doesn't go in which way you're pointing your analog stick, but rather where your character is currently facing, which has led to  a few deaths, and the game seems to have a philosphy of \"Come back when you have the proper power up so you can get this collectible\" ie: banjo-tooie (I'm just not a big fan of this kind of design, I much prefer being able to get everything in one go if I can), but these hardly detract from everything else this game has to offer.

A Hat in Time is a game that obviously draws inspiration from certain N64/GCN titles, but it does so subtly and even improves on their formulas in both fun and interesting ways. I don't intend to provide an in-depth review, but I hope to convince a few 90's gamers to try it out! Without further ado...\n\nWorlds/Graphics:\nA Hat in Time will throw you into a delightful selection of worlds, each with their own unique style of both graphics and gameplay. I can honestly say that each of the worlds almost feels like its own game -- everything from the stage selection screen to the NPCs and flavor text contribute to the thematic style of each area. Graphically, the game is wonderfully cartoonish, and I think best described as a blend of Wind Waker's bright colors alongside Super Mario Galaxy's alien environments. I experienced the game Maxed out at 2560x1440 and can honestly say it's one of the most beautiful games I've played. It also looks gorgeous at higher framerates if your monitor supports it.\n\nMusic/Soundtrack:\nMany indie games fall flat when it comes to their soundtrack, given that their development team usually isn't large and doesn't contain a dedicated composer. With \"A Hat in Time,\" this could not be further from the truth. The game's soundtrack immediately grabs you with its unique space-y sound and happy-go-lucky attitude, and the experience only gets better from there. Each world has its own \"theme,\" but the music undergoes subtle changes as events take place and you progress throughout each mission. Everything from the area themes to the boss music is a home-run. Simply a phenomenal job. If you're a fan of VGM soundtracks, you'll be coming back for it later, I promise.\n\nGameplay/Mechanics:\nWith any platformer (especially 3D platformers) it's important that the controls function well. Given that \"A Hat in Time\" does require precision platforming in some of its areas, it is clear that the developers spent a lot of time tuning the physics and controls to ensure tight, responsive movement. Hat Kid generally goes where I expect her to go, and keeping her aligned to platforms/tightropes/etc. usually works as expected. Not everything works perfectly, however-- wall kicking is more difficult than it should be and it often causes the camera to jitter if done incorrectly. This is something that could easily be addressed with a patch, so I expect this won't remain an issue forever.\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough this might seem a bit clich\u00e9, the biggest problem with \"A Hat in Time\" is that it's too short. Not for the price, mind you -- $30 is completely reasonable for a game of this complexity and length. It's too short because it leaves you wanting more. You want to take Hat Kid on more adventures. You want to hear more of the entralling soundtrack. You want to stand in awe of the next enormous environment, precisely crafted to its own style. In theory, two additional worlds will be arriving at some point as free DLC. If so, that's fantastic news -- I just hope the Developers take their time and put just as much effort into the DLC worlds as the originals. Don't rush them; just make them fun. \n\nIn a way, that's the whole theme of \"A Hat in Time.\" It wasn't rushed, but rather carefully crafted over many years of hard work. The result of that work, however, is an experience brimming with such a pure, genuine fun that I haven't felt since playing Super Mario Galaxy nearly 10 years ago.", "timestamp_created": 1507532823, "timestamp_updated": 1507532823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35590803": {"recommendationid": "35590803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198430934258", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 394, "last_played": 1514805219}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc2a4\ud300 \ucc98\uc74c \uc0ac\ub294\uac70\ub77c \uace0\uc2ec\ud574\uc11c \uc0c0\ub294\ub370 \uc9c4\uc9dc \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub2e4.\ub178\ud2b8\ubd81\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc870\uae08 \ud654\uba74\uc774 \uc5b4\uc9c0\ub7ec\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4 \ub809 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0\ub418\uae34 \ub41c\ub2e4.\uc870\uc791\ud0a4\ub97c \uc54c\uace0 \ud558\uba74 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub2e4 \uac19\uc740 \ub9f5\uc5d0\uc11c \uba87\ubc88 \ub3cc\uc544\ub2e4\ub2c8\uba74 \ubab0\ub790\ub358 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc54c\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4 \u314b\u314b\uc601\uc5b4\ub77c\uc11c \ub0b4\uac00 \uc774\uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc54c\uace0\ud558\ub294\uac74\uc9c0\ub294 \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc ..\ub9c8\ud53c\uc544\uac00 \ucc29\ud55c\uc564\uc9c0 \uc54c\uc558\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc0b0\uc5c6\uc5c8\uc744\ub54c \u314b\u314b\u314b  \uc810\ud504 \uacf5\uaca9\ub3c4 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uace0 \uc885\uc774 \uc218\uc9d1\ub3c4 \uc7ac\ubc0b\ub2e4 .. \uc0c1\uc810\uc544\uc800\uc528 \ub108\ubb34 \ubb34\uc12d\ub2e4..\ub9f5\uc758 \ucc45\ud45c\uc2dc\ub294 \ubb50\uace0 \ud574\uace8 \ud45c\uc2dc\ub294 \ubb54\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\ub2e4 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub2e4 . \ucca0\ud68c\uc548\ud560\uac83 \uac19\ub2e4 .\uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc798\uac04\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1507532676, "timestamp_updated": 1507532676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35590726": {"recommendationid": "35590726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064913087", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508718633}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is beautiful, rich in personality and details, challenging, simple, funny and much more.

If a cute, fun, solid 3D platformer is what you\u2019re looking for this is the game for you! Now on with the review!\n\nI'll start with the pros and cons. Cons first, so let\u2019s get these bad boys out of the way.\n\nCons\n- The length \n- Visual glitches \n- The lack of voice acting near endgame \n\nThe worst thing about this game would be its length... Well if you do the bare minimum; which is getting 25 time pieces and not going out of your way to grab collectables. In which the game is about 10-15 hours. If you however, collect everything, the game is much longer and more enjoyable in my opinion. This also negates the length problem; however even after finishing everything I could, I was still left craving more.\n\nThis game is definitely beautiful, but one thing that happened a decent bit were visual glitches, mainly shadows on some  characters being off and clipping on models, a lot of clipping. An example is a cut scene after the first boss. Where hat girl closes her eyes and shakes her head, her eyes clip through. Though that only happens in that cut scene.  Distracting but that's about it.\n\nAnother thing that is merely distracting is the lack of voice acting near the end of the game. Some characters were voiced while some were not. Note that these same characters were fully voiced earlier in game. That\u2019s the reason why this is distracting, IS because it is fully voice acted other than those handful of lines. \n\nPros \n- The visuals \n- The camera\n-The voice acting \n-How hat kid controls \n-The Characters  \n\nTo start right off the bat you\u2019ll notice this game looks good, but not really detailed, most textures are relatively simple. However what makes this game\u2019s visuals mostly simple but down right gorgeous, are the visual effects. From sand and snow sparkling, to partials and butterflies in the air. The wind blowing, dust and fog hanging just above the ground, and ambers floating in the air around fire and lava. And probably more that I\u2019m missing. That alone makes this game so beautiful to look at; really it\u2019s just a treat for your eyes.\n\nThey defiantly took a lot care with the camera; it feels like an extension of yourself. It never got in my way, nor did I have to fight it. To the point that hardly noticed it. The only two problems I had with it. Were that sometimes I couldn\u2019t make a sharp turn fast enough; likely do to my settings. And that you can clip the camera through a lot of thing ever so slightly.  \n\nI\u2019ve got to say the voice acting is wonderful, some of the best I\u2019ve heard! Not much to say, the character\u2019s voices are distinct, and fit perfectly with each character. Lastly the lines were read with so much character and emotion.\n\n Hat kid controls beautifully, every move can flow into each other. You\u2019re given so much control over how you move. Not to mention how fast you can move, do to being able to have each move go from one to the next. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever played a platformer that allows for such movement. To go from one side of an area to the next with lighting fast speed and simple but accurate controls; well one just has to feel for themselves, to truly appreciate it.\n\nLast but not least the characters, oh the characters. Every character has an distinct and quirky personality. They also play off one another beautifully. From two characters fighting for a trophy, by all means possible, do to believing the other will cheat to win. To one that your obligated to do, let\u2019s say \u201cchores\u201d for. And not to spoil anything ends up in a disagreement that goes back and forth in a humorous way. I\u2019ll leave the rest for you to see for yourself. \n\nAnd that\u2019s A Hat in Time.

Wer h\u00e4tte damals gedacht, dass ich so lange warten m\u00fcsste? Nun, eins steht fest: Ich werde nie wieder ein Spiel \u00fcber Kickstarter mitfinanzieren. Um schon eine Sache vorweg zu nehmen: Ich finde \"A Hat in Time\" besser als aktuelle 3D-Marios und hoffe auf einen Nachfolger. Leider scheint dieses Spiel bisher auf Steam unterzugehen. Im weiteren Verlauf dieser Review werde ich auf das Gameplay, den Umfang, den Sound und Sonstiges eingehen.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nMan h\u00fcpft, rennt, klettert und sammelt Items ein. Dies beschreibt schon ganz gut die T\u00e4tigkeiten im Spiel. Das h\u00fcpfen macht Spa\u00df, da es sich pr\u00e4zise anf\u00fchlt. Das Repertoire beinhaltet Doppelspr\u00fcnge, Weitspr\u00fcnge, Wandspr\u00fcnge und mehr.\nIm Spiel gibt es eine Anzahl von H\u00fcten, die alle ihre besonderen F\u00e4higkeiten mit sich bringen. Zum Beispiel sorgt der eine Hut daf\u00fcr, dass man sehr weit springen kann und der andere Hut sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass die Zeit verlangsamt wird. Durch \"Badges\", die sich auf den Hut befestigen lassen, werden weitere F\u00e4higkeiten hinzugef\u00fcgt z.B. einen Greifhaken, damit man \u00fcber gr\u00f6\u00dfere Abgr\u00fcnde sich schwingen kann. Ein schnelles Moped, damit man nicht mehr schnell laufen muss. Eine Badge, die die Abklingzeit von F\u00e4higkeiten stark verk\u00fcrzt.\nZiel ist es genug Sanduhren zu sammeln, vergleichbar mit den Power-Sternen aus Mario 64. Des Weiteren gibt es noch Sammelzeug wie Wollkn\u00e4ule, M\u00fcnzen und W\u00e4hrung, die man f\u00fcr alles m\u00f6gliche braucht.\n\n[h1]Umfang[/h1]\n\nDas Spiel ist an sich jetzt schon komplett, es wird jedoch in Zukunft noch kostenlos erweitert.\nInsgesamt gibt es 40 Sanduhren zu sammeln, die auf 5 Welten (Chapters) verteilt sind.\n\nJede Welt hat ihre Besonderheiten, die am Ende mit einem lustigen und spektakul\u00e4ren Bosskampf enden.\nWelten k\u00f6nnen offen sein mit viel Erkundung oder eher linear.\nJe nach Spielart dauert das Spiel 6-15 Stunden (Nur schnell durchlaufen und Bosse besiegen vs. Sachen sammeln und umschauen).\n\nF\u00fcr die Zukunft ist ein Coop-Modus geplant und weitere 2 Welten(Chapters). Die \"Story\" ist bereits jetzt schon abgeschlossen.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nDer Sound ist sowas von genial und abwechslungsreich, echt der Hammer! Das liegt wohl auch daran, dass der ber\u00fchmte Komponist von den Banjo Kazooie-Spielen auch Musik f\u00fcr dieses Spiel komponiert hat(Grant Kirkhope). Die Stimmung im Spiel, ob fr\u00f6hlich oder traurig, wird perfekt mit Musik untermalt.\n\n[h1]Sonstiges[/h1]\n\nDes Weiteren ist es m\u00f6glich, die Spielfigur optisch anzupassen. Es gibt verschiedene Skins f\u00fcr H\u00fcte und verschiedene Farben f\u00fcr die Kleidung und Haare.\nDie Story, oder besser gesagt die Rahmenhandlung, ist ganz nett. \"Hat-Girl\" verliert ihren Treibstoff(Sanduhren) und muss den wieder einsammeln, um nach Hause gelangen zu k\u00f6nnen. Generell ist die Story und das komplette Spiel sehr witzig. Die Charaktere sind fast alle liebenswert und liebevoll gestaltet. Die \"Grafik\" sieht ganz gut aus, was auch dem zeitlosen Cartoon-Look geschuldet ist.\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\n\nWie man schon im Vorwort lesen konnte, bin ich sehr begeistert von dem Spiel. Selten wird wirklich ein so liebevoll gestaltetes Spiel ver\u00f6ffentlich. Es braucht sich nicht vor den Marios und Banjos zu verstecken. Wer Jump 'n Runs mag oder das Collect-A-Thon Genre, wird sehr viel Spa\u00df mit dem Spiel haben. Die 30\u20ac f\u00fcr das Spiel sind auf jeden Fall gerechtfertigt, obwohl dies f\u00fcr Steam Indie Verh\u00e4ltnisse viel ist!

Hell this is the only game I took the time to 100% with all achievements! \nA Hat in time is hecking cute 3D platformer that oozes polish and charm in every nook and cranny. Hell they hand coded the physics of the Cans! OF THE CANS THAT YOU CAN KICK.

Well now ill talk about the gameplay and stop nerding over the polish and coding. Sorry it\u2019s the Dev in me\u2026. I ASPIRE TO BE THIS GOOD\n\n\nAhhemm.. well this game is said to be a love letter to all the old 64 and gamecube collectathons. However, I feel that it did indeed take some aspects of the old games and mesh it into theirs. And I would agree with that, however it did it SO DAMM WELL. You can\u2019t just take an old formula and repeat with slight differences we will notice. This game took thoughts and truly used them to change the 3D platformer genre. They made them their own and implemented them in the modern scene of gaming to perfectly.  The devs know what makes a game fun and I find that not a lot of devs nowadays know what that truly means\nThe movement of hat kid is enjoyable, the characters are adorable and loveable and ooze personality, the level design is actually a full level with something to do around mostly every corner. The missions are fun, and have replayability. The bosses are fun and enjoyable. The game is just a really well done, thought out beautiful game that I think everyone should play.\n\n[h1]TLDR:[/h1]\nSo, for $30 it\u2019s worth it.

I wouldn\u2019t call it cute-as-heck, but instead lively-as-heck. There\u2019s a lot to say, so let\u2019s get to it!\nAs far as the size of the game, I would say it was shorter than expected. It took me 10 hours to beat (while looking around for stuff), 12 hours to get the achievements after that, and 14 hours to get all of the pins on the Collectibles Map. HOWEVER, this isn\u2019t actually really a bad thing! Every 1/40th of the game is very sizable and unique in its own way, and it also means the game doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome with padding.\nThe main selling point of this game is Hat Kid\u2019s movement. With a double jump, a far dive, a jump after that, and a wall climb, her horizontal movement is insane. There are a lot of moments in the game where you see a platform far away that you MIGHT be able to make, jump and dive to it to see if you can make it (since failing a jump isn\u2019t much of a penalty thankfully), and ACTUALLY DO. It makes you feel like a gosh darn GENIUS, especially when you skip other platforms. The fact that there are very few enemies in the game is telling that the focus went into the platforming level design, and it compliments your movement options extremely well so that every moment of the game is \u201cCan I get to that ledge?\u201d Hat Kid\u2019s vertical movement being very limiting is a smart way to \u201cbalance\u201d this out. She can only run up the wall for a second and her wall kick only goes outwards, so you need to be crafty to get UP to places. Finally, Hat Kid\u2019s dive is really fast if you get the timing right , which makes navigating any more open areas more fun and satisfying than, say, spamming a long jump.\nAs for the bulk of the game, the missions, the thing that stood out to me the most was how most of them felt like they told a part of a story and were distinct in their own right. Your objectives never really felt random or misguided, and this makes it feel like much more than a game about Hat Kid\u2019s ability to platform. The dialogue\u2019s a part of this. The thing is that there\u2019s a lot of dialogue, and even with the Hold A to Skip mechanic in parts, feels like it could be obnoxious for repeat playthroughs, but it\u2019s important for worldbuilding. As for the worlds, they\u2019re pretty bulky and fun to run around in sometimes (except for Chapter 2, which is more \u201cindividual missions), but thankfully getting to each mission isn\u2019t a struggle. For example, my favorite Chapter is Chapter 3 because the world\u2019s big and relatively flat, so it\u2019s easy to see a new point of interest, check it out, then repeat a la open world games. There are three Time Rifts per world, and they show up anywhere in the area with only a picture of its location to go on. With how big the worlds are, I figured this would be tedious and awful\u2026but the worlds are designed with enough distinct areas that I actually ended up enjoying the little scavenger hunts. The Time Rift levels are pretty short and a series of floating platforms that are \u201cpure platforming,\u201d and they\u2019re really fun. And a little tidbit that goes a LONG way is the game telling you if you don\u2019t have an item to complete a mission instead of leaving you to flounder and find out for yourself.\nNow, with the base parts of the game out of the way, we can talk about my favorite part of it: just how alive and real each world feels. Like I mentioned before, every platform is there for a reason because it\u2019s a part of an environment. Buildings, leaves, piles of crates, etc. all feel like a part of the environment first and a platforming challenge second. And, of course, the game uses colors that are appealing to look at and aren\u2019t samey in both light and dark areas. The game gives you a camera for a reason! The most obvious part of the game feeling lively are all of the characters, and not just all of the ones represented in the logo of the game itself. Everyone either is doing something or has something helpful or witty to say, even if they use the same model as another character in the area. A lot of characters have motivations, some silly and some understandable (like in some boss battles, for example). I\u2019ve heard people knock the voice acting, but I think the full voice acting is excellent and helps the \u201calive\u201d feel exceedingly well, as even the minor \u201cset piece\u201d characters talk and are a joy to listen to instead of having to read a bunch (since this game has a lot of writing for what it is). In fact, only the forest minions, the foxes, and the Chapter 4 people had voices that I didn\u2019t like. And of course the music ties the environment feel up perfectly. Each song is fitting, and even the more subdued and ambient songs are interesting to listen to. The subtle dynamic music per area also helps make each sub-area on a stage feel more unique. Not to mention, the unique title cards for every mission are nice.\nThis game has collectibles, but it\u2019s not labeled as a collectathon for a reason. To me, the collectibles were really fun platforming challenges to get them, fitting the game\u2019s excellent platforming and giving you more to do in certain areas. You can see most of them since they are surrounded by light (with others being findable with a map badge), so it really does become a matter of \u201cHow do I get over/up there?\u201d A little cheat is that the camera badge is helpful for looking around areas, whether they intended that or not. You could get yarn for making new hats, coins to get different clothes colors/hat skins/stage remixes (customization options I love in any game), and relics to unlock Time Rifts. I never needed to stop progress to get yarn for a hat I needed or to unlock a Time Rift, so putting those behind collectibles isn\u2019t a nuisance thankfully. There are badges that you can buy with little orbs strewn around the stage called Pons, but none of them are really NECESSARY and are just nice boosts to have. Another extra are the achievements. Their simplicity makes them fun to go back and do post-game.\nThe game\u2019s not without flaws, though. They\u2019re all minor, but let\u2019s list my bigger gripes. The Golden Safe mission didn\u2019t make it obvious you could touch it for trails. I never struggled with Pons unlocking some levels, but it seems arbitrary and pauses the fun. If you mess up in a subarea, there\u2019s no Restart Area option and you have to start the WHOLE MISSION over. Getting everything is kinda a nuisance when the game says you have 100% when you get just the Time Pieces, the Relic Badge only shows an arbitrary amount of things, and some things like yarn are inside blow-upable things. The X counter thing felt kinda weird and finicky sometimes. I also feel like the grappling hook is too important to be a badge, even with three badge slots. Smaller complaints include the camera freaking out sometimes and Hat Kid clipping into things, but bugs are bugs. I feel like gold tape around objects didn\u2019t quite scream \u201cYou blow this up!\u201d The Ice Hat is criminally underutilized and should\u2019ve been available for Mafia Town where the ice platforms are beautifully placed (but it\u2019s great for bosses). The stealth section lights are shorter than the actual hitbox. \nBut despite all this, none of it REALLY got in the way of my enjoyment of the game. Just minor nuisances with some collectibles I can\u2019t be bothered to get for a true 100% completion. Each Time Piece is packed to the brim with fun platforming, environments/characters/music with personality, and little collectibles to go for along the way. I\u2019d say it\u2019s one of the richest games an indie group has put out and makes a name for itself among bigger developers with its charm. I\u2019d say that the full $30 is a great price\u2026but if the low play time makes the price seem not worth it somehow, then definitely pick it up in a sale. It\u2019s an enjoyable experience front to back.", "timestamp_created": 1507522606, "timestamp_updated": 1508767344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35588858": {"recommendationid": "35588858", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994183048", "num_games_owned": 1068, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509513182}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely one of my favorite games ever.

And honestly, it was like a gift from my past self to my present self.\n\nThis game made me feel like a kid again. The absolute joy of taking control of Hat Kid for the first time, discovering what kind of jumps and leaps you can do onto platforms. The controls are just so tight and responsive, and everything just works together so well. The worlds are all so incredibly unique, and no mission is like any other. The characters you interact with are well voice-acted and full of character. The bosses you fight are unique and memorable. The music is STELLAR! There is not a single song in the game that I don't love! \n\nOne issue is that the game does not keep track of your progress on certain collectables such as the pages in Time Rifts (unless you're currently in said Time Rift), yarn, or tokens. It's very difficult to tell if you've completely cleaned out a world of its things to do when there's no stats on the menus to tell you. This is pretty minor, as it doesn't really detract of the general experience. It'd just be icing on the cake if they fixed it.\n\nThis game is getting workshop soon! Which will involve custom hats as well as custom made levels with modding tools! Meaning that when you're done with the game, you won't truly be done. Even after I 100%'d this game I still want to play more. Hopefully we can get some level ports of Super Mario 64 so we can play through them as Hat Kid!\n\nOverall, the entire game is fantastic. It's unforgettable to me. It made me genuinely feel like I was playing Mario Sunshine for the first time again.

Not only this game easy to pick up and play but it offers so much variety and stuck together platforming segments that the fun never ends from start to finish. This game has everything you could ever want out of a platformer. The character design and voice acting is second to none. The platforming is never ending, and the polish is amazing.

This game spent a grueling 5 years in development, and the undying passion throughout those 5 years from the Gears For Breakfast team really shows. Every chapter a with it's own unique personality, and no two acts feel the same despite the fact that you're usually playing on the same map.\n\nThis game is a love letter to 3D platforming from the N64/Gamecube era, right down to having Gamecube controller support (seriously, the number of different controllers I can run on this game without configuration is nutty). In many ways I could imagine being a kid and playing this on an oldschool Nintendo system. The controls are really tight and everything feels great. You start off with a whole bunch of movement options and abilities right off the bat. Wall jumps, double jumps, slides, so I don't see repeat playthroughs being frustrating.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay mechanics and options, I'd like to give special attention to how much tech there is in this game's movement. The fact that the devs left in an achievement for sequence breaking should tell you everything you need to know. Whenever I wanted to move fast and freely but needed a certain hat for something, I found myself chaining slides to keep my speed up and the levels, although having linier objectives, are designed in such a way where you're rewarded for finding unique ways around them and exploring. You have one primary objective per act but there are loads of small side objectives you can do, such as finding collectables, secrets, or just fun little easter eggs.\n\nPersonality wise, this game oozes with it. The dialogue is always spot on and the voice acting is insanely good. I found myself sitting and listening to all the voice acting, even if it meant slowing down the gameplay to enjoy it. The atmosphere in the levels is always perfect, with the music dynamically changing through a lot of the different environments (oh, by the way the soundtrack to this game is phenominal) to just the game generally creating the atmosphere through the gameplay.\n\nA few downsides I will mention, just because I find myself wanting to look at this game critically so it can be improved upon in later patches. First off, I'm two timepieces away from finishing the game. The current build of the game only has 40 timepieces. By the time I finish the game (which unless something supernatural happens will be tomorrow), I will have only gotten four days worth of gameplay out of it. That's not to say that there isn't more I can do. I have the option of grinding out for the rest of the cosmetic items and remixes, and possibly trying the game again with One Hit Hero mode enabled, but for now, that's it. The devs did say they're planning on adding two bonus chapters later down the line in a free update which should hopefully bring our timepiece total to a cool 60 or so, but for now, this is what we have.\n\nThere are quite a few bugs left over in this game. Most of them are minor bugs such as small visual glitches, caused as a result of sequence breaking, or just minor things that got overlooked, but there were a couple of times I got stunlocked, or took several consecutive hits from an enemy all within the same few frames, and one time where I straight up got softlocked. Having said that, since the devs have already promised continued development for this game for a little longer, I expect many of these issues will be patched.\n\nAll in all though, I will make a couple of bold claims about this game:\n\n1) It's easily in my top 10 favourite games of all time\n2) This game is hands down one of the best single player gaming experiences available on Steam, if not one of the best games on Steam period.\n\nI was a slacker backer for this game and do not regret it for a second. You've red the novel which is this review.

No. God no. Far from it, it takes much more than a decent game to do that. With hype abound for Mario Odyssey (Myself included on that hype train), we're all excited for any high quality platforming game. So, ill be very straightforward in this review.\n\nA Hat in Time is a wonderfully made 3D platformer, it nails each aspect of a 3D platformer and does it in spades with seemingly minimal effort! This game is simply a joy to play, it recaptured a part of my heart that was lost long ago. Here are the scores.\n\nGameplay 11/10\nSimply a joy to play. The most important part of literally any game is the Gameplay, and the most important aspect of a 3D platformer is the movement. This game nails gameplay with flying colours!! The movement is fluid and becomes second nature! Each time I play this damn game i cant stop running around in circles or finding new areas to explore and find, this game has a few secrets too! It encourages explorative nature, but it also discourages it in a sense (Ill move into that a bit later). You have a group of worlds to explore, this game is HIGHLY derivitive of Mario Sunshine and BanjoKazooie, so much so to its detriment! This game has a severe loss of identity, as it tries too hard in the opening worlds to be like Super Mario Sunshine 2! It tries waaay to hard to be Mario Sunshine, and it really hurts because this game can stand on its own two adorable legs. When you unlock more worlds, you see the identity in this game, this quirky and really fucking funny game is a marvel at times!\n\nMusic 8/10\nNot the worst soundtrack ever, but definitely not the best. Some tracks drone on in the background, while others dont match the mood of the overall world at all. The music is servicable and, in some cases, beautiful, but its nothing stellar. Dont buy THIS games soundtrack unless you really want some upbeat drone to listen to, and NO thats not a bad thing! The music is upbeat and is always pleasant, but it just drones all the time and rarely changes. When it does change, its jarring and not fluid at all in some cases, and fluid and welcome in others! Its hit or miss for me, but when it comes to the quality of the music? Thats where it gets its points from. Each track is good on its own in an isolated environment, but if you listen to it while youre playing the game, it can deliver mixed feelings.\n\nAesthetic 10/10\nPositively marvellous, the careful symbiosis between Graphical style and Gameplay style is struck immediately in this game! No point in the game is odd, even the one actually creepy level i played made wonderful use of the graphical style, making it a very creepy game even with its absolutely adorable art style! Hat Girl is one of the cutest characters made in gaming to date, I say that in full body and mind, me and my friend marathon'd this game over the course of 8 hours (My internet was down during the first 3) and we simply couldnt stop saying \"This game is adorable\" and where it isnt adorable its just plain pleasant! The mobsters are so damn cute I cant hate them! The ghosts had me saying \"awww\" al the time! You cant go wrong with this games cartoony and colourful artstyle!\n\nSound 9/10\nFor the most part, the nail is hit on the head with voice acting and sound clips, but there is one instance where it feels a bit weird. The primary antagonist in the game, Mustache Girl, her voice is a bit weird to hear coming out of the character. Accents are also something that is a bit weird, but I can easily look passed that. The voice acting is absolutely top notch, one level is set in a spooky forest, and the primary enemy in it is a sinister large ghost who's voice actor has the PERFECT EVIL LAUGH!! And his voice is actually intimidating, so to hear him say all these adorable things and throwing out small cute quips here and there, it successfully makes an endearing character! This game nails that aspect again with flying colours, minus a few characters here and there. Two in particular are a bit annoying, Mustache Girl herself and the Owl in the second world. Other than that, marvellous.\n\nPerformance 9/10\nI have an Intel Core i-5 2500k processor and an NVIDIA Quadro 1000m graphics processor, its not a bad PC and it gets me by with Indie titles. I had a lot of chug on higher settings but when i bumped all settings aside from character detail down to the lowest itll go, I was perfectly fine throughout the game. Now, depending on your PC, I would say stave off till the console releases, but if you truly cant wait and are sure you can deal with some frame drops here and there, youre fine. It runs very well in most cases, and only struggles during highly taxing scenes. This is MY pc too, I had my Girlfriend test it on hers (She's got a magnificent PC with an i-7 6700k and NVIDIA GTX 1080i on hers), and she had absolutely NO issues throughout the game, only dropping to 30 on some parts and it was only for a second or two.\n\nVerdict 9/10 - 10/10\nThis game is an absolute marvel, get it on PC and its about a 9/10 but get it on Console and im positive itll be a 10/10. And with updates coming along that add modding support and coop, you will NOT regret your 30 dollar purchase of this game. I didnt go over everything, mainly because I wanted to stave off a few details, but there are a few Ill mention before we wrap things up.\n This games primary gimmick is the acquisition of hats, which give special abilities. Hats are limited to each stage you find them in, as in you wont find like the Time-Stop hat in world 2 or anything like that, but you do find yarn to create hats in each and every single world. Now this is cool in concept but I personally have issues with that, as finding Yarn can be difficult at times and piss-easy at others. It makes you reconsider grabbing on piece of yarn over another because that piece is on a tree branch that takes 5 minutes to get to, or you can go get the one frozen in ice with an explosive literally right next to it. Its annoying how hard it is to get 1 single piece of yarn while you can get 5 perfectly fine with NO effort whatsoever in other worlds. \nAnother small issue is Boss Fights. Some are imaginative and interesting while others are so damn boring. My least favorite thus far was the fight with the primary Ghost Boss. Its visually impressive, yes, but its also incredibly tedious. I dont like how long these boss fights are either, you have 2-3 phases, and well thats good but also thats bad. You'd think 3 hits to get into the next phase, but one boss was like 5 hits while another felt like fucking 20! its infuriating to say the least. But, the boss figths arent BORING in any sense of the word, they are all fun and impressive visually, absolutely wonderful on most occasions. \nAll in All buy this game if youre confident in your PC, if not, I would say wait until you're certain or await its arrival on PS4 and XBONE.

And yeah, it did.\n\nI think the one thing that makes or breaks any platformer is controls, camera, and movement. If any of those are bad, then the game immediately falls apart, no matter how good the level design, art, or music is. And A Hat in Time controls like a dream. There wasn't ever a single time that I got frustrated while moving Hat Kid around the levels. Every jump, dive, and attack felt incredibly smooth and natural.\n\nAnd yeah, what you've heard is true.

You\u2019d be surprised how varied the tasks you do are, considering the genre: One minute you\u2019re ziplining through a vast mountain range above the clouds, and the next you\u2019re solving a murder mystery or hiding from horrors in a creepy manor. The only other example of this kind of variety I can think of is Psychonauts.\n\nThe movement is precise and fluid. Hat Kid is so much fun to control. This aspect is very reminiscent of Super Mario 64 and Sunshine, unlike the stiffness of, say, Banjo-Kazooie. Unlike Mario however, Banjo-Kazooie (and Tooie)\u2019s strength was its interesting world full of personality, which is what A Hat in Time excels at as well. It has the best of both worlds.\n\nAs for the downsides, the camera freaks out in tight quarters fairly often, but you never feel like you need to fight it. It\u2019s merely a visual annoyance. In some levels the depth of field effect is quite aggressive, and you unfortunately can\u2019t turn it all the way off. (UPDATE: Now you can!)\n\nThe soundtrack is 5 hours of pure perfection. The game oozes joyful charm and maintains a consistently amazing experience from beginning to end. Also Hat Kid is hecking cute.

I never even owned a Gamecube. In fact, I didn't even grow up with Nintendo so I haven't even played a lot of the games that inspired this (Psychonauts being one of the few exclusions).\nSo, what reason did I have to care?\nWell, I did grow up on platformers from the PS1 & PS2 era, so I can say without a hesitation that the 3D platforming genre is one of my favorites in gaming.\nBut my love for this game goes beyond that.\nThe things I love most in this game are the things that give it its own identity.: Its world, its characters, its atmosphere, and its personality.\nIt's easy for someone to look at this game and think \"Oh, that's like Mario Sunshine\" or \"Oh, that's like Thousand Year Door\", but to someone who's never played those games, I was drawn to it by its beautiful artstyle, brilliant and hilarious writing, and not to mention its spectacular soundtrack and, of course, the game itself... just looked fun! And I got into it nearly 3 years ago when the alpha build with only 2 levels was out!\nThe game in no way is trying to bank on nostalgia. One of my biggest problems with Yooka-Laylee was how much I personally felt like an outsider to the whole thing because I had never played a Banjo game. The nostalgia card has never really been a trick that works on me. I mean, it also probably doesn't help that Yooka-Laylee's problems gor way beyond its nostalgia-pandering. Thankfully aside a handful of glitches I ran into (only one of which was slightly game-breaking, but thankfully I had the developer console turned on so I could get myself out of it) and and some minor frame-rate stuttering and visual oddities (likely linked to the fact that my PC's specs are slightly below the recommendations listed for the game), the game is overall structurally solid. And you have to cut these guys a little slack. It's a Kickstarter game made by a small group of people, which actually seg-ways into my next ponit... (You're still reading this, right?)\nI was also drawn to this game by the amazing people who worked on it. Jonas, Habboi, Jenna, Pascal, Aruki and others whom I can't think of right now- You're all wonderful people and it is truly more than admirable that you all devoted so much of your time and energy into making the best game that you can. I think other indie developers- no, the entire games industry- can learn a few things from all of you. I love you all and I can't wait to see what you have in store for the future!\n\nBut I'm sure there's a question still hanging in the back of some of your minds: Should I get A Hat in Time?\nYes.\nI don't care if you didn't grow up with the games that inspired it.\nI don't care if this genre isn't your thing.\nI don't care if you have some sort of negative bias towards Kickstarter games because this game will prove you wrong.\nI don't care if you're 12 and all you play is COD and Madden.\nYou need to play this game.\nIf your PC can't run it, wait for the console release. I don't care. Just play it.\nA Hat in Time is a landmark for indie games and I predict it will be rememberred and celebrated for many years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...You're still here?", "timestamp_created": 1507506904, "timestamp_updated": 1507506904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 161, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814148", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35585295": {"recommendationid": "35585295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054531372", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507899281}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't go looking for reasons *not* to buy an amazing.

This was mainly because of the fact that their kickstarter campaigns set out with the same goals in mind, heck, even I started to get sceptical. But after I debating whether to buy this game or not, I took the plunge and went for it and I have never been so glad to be wrong about a game in my life.\n\nEverything about this game oozes charm to a level that I haven't seen from a game in a long time, in an age where everything wants to be dark and gritty when it isn't on a nintendo platform. I am not lying when I say I have spent all my time with this game smiling, with never a dull moment, which is why this will probably be the only review I ever write, I just want to share my love for this game. \n\nThe two games that are clearly the driving factors for the overall design are Mario64 and Banjo (to a lesser extent). \n\nMario64 has clearly influenced the level design and the movement, creating an extremely fun and fluid experience playing as hat girl, but with the world design itself it is a whole different ball game. Starting in Mafia town, I was pretty sure it was heavily going down the \"Pick a mission and it does something to the large level but it stays mostly the same\", but as soon as you hit the Dead Bird Studios world (Which follows a split path level design that ends up rejoining for a final level in a way I don't want to spoil) I was blown away. Both of the elements taken from Mario64 have been rethought and redesigned into something unique, that feels like a perfect fit for a modern take on what game designers were trying to achieve when making old platformers.\n\nBanjo definitely has an influence in the collectible aspect of the game, and perhaps even the overall world building style. The collectibles in this game feel fantastic to collect, straight from the little dinking noises as you pick up gems, to the beautiful music slowdowns as you near a time piece to beat a level, and the snapping of hatgirls fingers as she picks up a ball of yarn to make a new hat from. I just couldnt deal with not being able to collect everything in one level befre moving onto the next. When it comes to the world style, everything about this game feels unique, the art style and animations, as well as the amazing voice acting (Props to the VA in the forest level) tie up into a cohesive world that, like banjo, feels nothing alike any of its peers and stands out beautifully from the other games I see lining the steam store.\n\nOntop of all these things, nothing is left feeling uninspiring, I just didnt want the game to end, and with free support and updates in the future, I await to play even more of this game. It is everything I had hoped that would make a comeback, and more, and I really hope that it is a success on steam. When this goes on sale, I will undoubtedly be buying it again to force my naysayer friends to play this amazing game.\n\nI wish the team the best of luck with future development and hope this game is a kick in the teeth to all the big developers out there that churn out the same unrelenting garbage each year without even trying to innovate.\n\nHope this review can help at least on person on the edge pick up this game and enjoy it as much as I did :)", "timestamp_created": 1507506274, "timestamp_updated": 1507506274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35585120": {"recommendationid": "35585120", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995672490", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508128747}, "language": "english", "review": "You can play as a cute little girl. \n\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1507505699, "timestamp_updated": 1507505699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35585077": {"recommendationid": "35585077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020522639", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 98, "last_played": 1514694215}, "language": "english", "review": "everything people wanted yooka-laylee to be, but actually good. been waiting since 2013 for this game and im not one bit disappointed so thats something", "timestamp_created": 1507505447, "timestamp_updated": 1507505447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35583379": {"recommendationid": "35583379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002983818", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 69, "last_played": 1513617439}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically the PC port of Nintendos Mario Odessey.

It's more than just some indie game, it's a game supported by a community that wants to see motivated creators at their full potential, and those creators delivered. \nI thought this game had a good balance entertaining both a younger and older audience, members that want fun challenges and those that want to see what GfB is capable of providing on various aspects. Incredibly appealing visually using the Unreal engine, The storyline is fun and simple with moments that really emphasize whatever themes they're shooting for.

And these moments aren't scarce and scattered far apart from each other, that's not something I can say for most games. [/i]\nThere are certain aspects I do have to be critical of though. \nCharacter design was great for most characters, but some models were a bit disappointing, especially for one of my favorite characters. For a spooky shadow spirit, the Snatcher felt too simple. Would have loved to have seen him abuse his ability to change into different forms, but he was pretty much just a blob with a smile throughout the whole game. For a shadow creature trying to scare others into signing his contracts, it would be great to see him have an intimidating figure when he's introduced and have him revert to his normal simple form when he can be himself around you. You got bird blobs with beaks that get boring after smacking 100 of them off your platforms. \nCharacter designs that I enjoyed were the twitchy Pin Peddler, the birds of World 2, and the two main girls. Pin Peddler guy gave me goosebumps, realizing that there are dimensions that leave a permanent mark upon visiting them kinda makes one hesitant when diving into adventure. He's a real nice contrast to the main character, a care free kid with a simple quest. Nice seeing the owls in different outfits, wasn't a fan of seeing the same model of Mafia Men on every side of the 1st World.\n\nI gotta say, I enjoyed this game (and still am).

You will find yourself either growing to love them or growing to hate them, you certainly wont forget them as generic_background_character_a. each world offers a unique gameplay experience that doesn't intimidate with its wild differences but also doesn't allow for the game to feel stale after 1 level. a criticism I had on yooka laylee was exactly that. you can swap between your hats to offer you differnt abilities and you can attach badges to the hats to offer you different passives. theres also ways to collect different cosmetic styles of each hat and/or color palletes for hat girl. fantastic user interface when it comes to swaping between hats, very simple and intuative\n\ngripes: I will admit I am a bit dispaointed with a few things, the controls can feel clunky if playing with a mouse and keyboard, ive found myself failing jumps when it comes jumping around on platforms to advance up, though that might just be a me issue. ive managed to beat it with 60% completion in 12 hours however free DLC is on the way as well as very wide workshop support in \"a week or so\" (?)\n\nwhat i liked: It felt like its own game in the collectathon genre and didn't feel like Banjo-Threeie... which turned out to be a good thing. I did like the \"ooo-aaa-ee-aa\" sounds replicated in yooka laylee but the full voice acting really brought life into the characters i otherwise wouldn't have gotten. the camera function is really fun and i found myself taking a lot of photos. I also liked that jontron's voice is still in the game.\n\nnotes for early access players: if you played the early access, really kinda forget about everything you experienced in it. any of the levels you played were polished and actual story/cinematic work was added in. there are definately a lot more levels than the early access build had.\n\nwould i reccomend: yes", "timestamp_created": 1507494025, "timestamp_updated": 1507494025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35582220": {"recommendationid": "35582220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092360835", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1514200892}, "language": "english", "review": "I discovered this game a day before it's release, I haven't watched any videos of it and it turns out to be one of the best game I've ever played", "timestamp_created": 1507493696, "timestamp_updated": 1507493696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35582181": {"recommendationid": "35582181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001904657", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508604510}, "language": "english", "review": "if you are like me, a fan of the Nintendo and GameCube Platformers, then this is a game for you!.\n\nA Hat in Time is an ultimate Love Letter to fans of the old platformers, but still is it`s own game, eaven if it has borrowed inspiration of old roots, it`s stil A Hat in Time, rather then super mario or banjo, the controlls are almost flawless, same goes for the camera, but the small hickups have nothing on a amazingly  fun and beautiful world.\nThe game is almost fully voice acted, with some voices you might remember.\nThere is also a Badge that allow all the voices to turn in to Mumbling for the Banjo fans out there.\n\nthe game is always renewing it self and keeps thing fresh and fun, the collectible items in theg ame are always used for something, and there are some surepluss or Yarn so you dont have to look over enery inch to get all the hats, hats you say?.\n\nwell this games Powerups are hats and Badges, badges are small agunets for Quality of life and the hats are like Bajo transformations or the F.L.U.D in Mario Sunshine, they give a diffrent way of interact with either the world or enemies.\n\nthere are boss battles in the game, they are fun and suprisingly challanging, but nothing that is to overwheling, i think every player can collect every Time Pice in this game, the Time Pices are the Main Progression in the game, that unlock new worlds. there are 5 worlds, the last world is only a boss map, but there are two worlds ont he way as \"rumored\" free dlc.\n\nThe game is very fun, decently leagth, worth buying new!. i alsoo reccoment bo buy the music as well, the soundtrack is great and supprisingly varied, the Music dlc comes with 72 Tracks, thats INSANE!.\n\nThe movment controlls are easy but still allow players for some impressive movements, and the Hats have suprising uses in diffrent World Missions that you might not have thought of.\n\nThis is my game of the year, and are sad that i did not kick start this game, i just hope for A Hat in TIme II.\n\ni will not give any score, but storngly reccomend buying it,", "timestamp_created": 1507493564, "timestamp_updated": 1508588361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35582053": {"recommendationid": "35582053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030693229", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507510689}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked Yooka Laylee a lot but then I'm a sucker for open world platformers in the Mario Sunshine vein.

"english", "review": "if you're looking for a traditional collectathon in the same vein of mario 64 or banjo kazooie, look elsewhere, because a hat in time is ultimately a completely different style of 3d platformer. that being said, the game is still one of the most enjoyable games ive played this year. the game does have quite major issues, but the stuff that is good far outweighs the bad.\n\nfirst off, the movement is responsive. this isnt a mario 64 situation where you can accidentally end up doing the wrong move (e.g groud pounding when you meant to long jump) or slipping off of a platform because of marios inconsistent turning radius. you stop and turn on a dime, and moves being assigned to their own buttons instead of being context sensitive means every move you do is deliberate.\n\nhowever, in terms of the sheer amount of movement options you have, hat in time is somewhat lacking compared to other games in the genre. when you boil it down, all you can really do is jump, dive, and wall run. this limited moveset does mean that levels are fully designed around your abilities, there are no \"optional\" moves here, and the level design is much tighter as a result. however this also makes even the most open-ended levels in the game feel a little more restrictive. how severe this issue is entirely depends on the person playing, personally i didn't mind so much because most of the levels are semi-linear anyway, and the movement options that are there are fun to control and can be chained together fluidly.\n\nin terms of level design, it varies drastically from chapter to chapter. the opening level, \"mafia town\", is a sandbox level that is exploration oriented, \"battle of the birds\" is a series of 5 (completely unique) linear levels with one mini-sandbox inbetween, \"subcon forest\" goes back to the open-ended level design, and then \"alpine skyline\" is also a series of linear levels, except the levels are all contained within one \"area\" with no loading screens or menus, and you can freely choose the order in which you do them. there's also the final level, but thats literally just a corridor leading up to the final boss with some platforming along the way.\n\nall of this variety keeps the game feeling fresh, and i personally enjoyed every level. however, only two chapters and one act of the game actually feel like collectathon levels, the rest is significantly more linear. again, i enjoyed the linear levels just as much as the non-linear ones, but i know for some people this may, understandably, be disapointing\n\nthe thing that i know a lot more people will find disapointing is the length. mind you this isnt something you can beat in one sitting, its longer than a lot of triple A games, hitting the 10-15 hour mark to 100%, but compare this games 4 chapters to mario 64s 15 levels, or this games 40 mcguffins to most collectathons standard of 100, and it becomes apparant that the game really could have done with some more content. not exactly a fair comparison because one level in 64 was literally just two small rooms of water connected with a tunnel, while the levels in a hat in time are much larger, but even just one or two more levels would make the game feel of a decent length. thats why im very glad that there is going to be two free dlc levels, and workshop support, but i can't let the game off because of content that isn't there yet.\n\nthe visuals of the game are my other complaint besides length. i'm by no means qualified in this sort of thing, so i don't know how to correctly articulate this, but some parts of this game just look extremely cluttered. mafia town and alpine skyline are the main culprits. when your running around them they look just fine, but look at them from a distance and to me its just a mess of colours thats very difficult to read visually. its really not a big deal, and other people don't seem to have an issue with it, so don't let it put you off the game. \n\nthe music in the game is consistently good. every track fits their respective level, with one exception. for some reason the track \"turn on the pyrotechnics\", a track that plays during a certain section of a parade level, has a fast tempo, harsh instrumentation, and use of a descending chromatic scale. all this turns the joyous and lively atmosphere thats supposed to be present into a intense and sinister atmosphere, that is frankly quite jarring. that is literally the only track in the entire OST that doesn't fit its level, everything else is solid. the tracks \"mafia town is asleep\", the main theme, and \"clocktowers beneath the sea\" are the highlights for me, and the \"timepiece released\" track caught me off guard with how relaxing it is, its the perfect music for the end of a level.\n\noverall, a hat in time is pretty darn good. it says a lot when my only major complaint with a game is that there isn't enough of it, which isn't even going to be an issue in the long term because the game has full mod support and extra content coming soon. like i said before, it didn't quite end up as the collectathon it was supposed to be earlier in development, and if you judge it as such you might end up disapointed, but if you judge it for what it is, its solid and well crafted from a game design standpoint, and its genuinely enjoyable as an experience thanks to its abundance of charm and creativity (that ive been trying to avoid spoiling). if your the kind of person who buys based on the amount of content, as the game is now its understandable to wait for a price drop, but if you buy purely based on how much you enjoy a game, its absolutely worth paying full price.", "timestamp_created": 1507491866, "timestamp_updated":

I then sort of forgot about it, all up until it released 2 days ago. Now, having beaten it, I have to say that A Hat in Time will easily find its place in my top 5 games of 2017 list!\n\nThe game is a traditional collect-a-thon platformer, that draws heavily on classic 3D platformers. In my mind the heaviest influencers would be Super Mario 64, Banjo & Kazooie and lastly, but certainly not least: Psychonauts! This last inspiration becomes most obvious in a certain train-related level that I enjoyed immensely! It is also the influence of Psychonauts that sets this game apart from most other collect-a-thons of recent years.\n\nThe writing in A Hat in Time is not perfect, though, and I feel like it is struggling to decide on its audience. For the most part the game is funny and whimsical and could be considered an 'all ages' experience, but occasionally the game slips into using darker themes. At one point you are literally ordered to 'murder' a bunch of spirits. At other points another character openly suggests dismembering enemies, and towards the end of the game even character suicide becomes a thing, in a way. It seems that the writing tries to mostly go for a more mature audience, those adults like myself who's nostalgia for the 90's and early 00's this game feeds. Your mileage may wary, but in my case I found myself laughing out loud at many of the jokes in this game.\n\nThe gameplay is nothing too special. You run, jump, double jump, dive, then jump again. It's a bit surprising how much freedom of movement you have from the word go, and how much more the game expands as time goes on. New abilities are granted through, what else: hats! One hat lets you see into the spirit world, another turns you into a heavy ice statue, another yet lets you sprint fast or even ride around on a cute scooter!\n\nThat last one brings us to the most obvious thing about the game, though it is a point that bears repeating: this game is CUTE! The art style is impeccable and I was surprised to see the Unreal engine used in this way. The game is not without faults, though, and there are a few points in the game where you can see the engine not quite adapting to the style the developers wanted to deliver. However, for the most part, the game makes sure you don't get to see these shortcomings for more than a split second before moving you right along. \n\nIn the end, whether or not you will enjoy this game comes down to your nostalgia factor. If those old games I mentioned before, Mario 64, Banjo&Kazooie or Psychonauts tickle your fancy, then A Hat in Time may very well do you a world of good. If those games were not for you, or you never experienced them in their day, then the nostalgia-pandering of this game might end up irritating you in the long run and many of the jokes might not open up to you. \n\nStill, I recommend the game and feel like this might end up being one of those rare games that even I 100% over time.\n\nPlaytime: 9+ hours (Single playthrough, 65+% completion)\n\nRatings (1-10)\nVisual: 8\nAudio: 9\nStory: 10\nGameplay: 9\nOverall: 9", "timestamp_created": 1507487550, "timestamp_updated": 1507487550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35580186": {"recommendationid": "35580186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056911465", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511166227}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, I haven't played Yooka-Laylee so I can't compare the two games. Regardless though...\n\nA Hat in Time is one of my most favorite 3D platformer out right now (Not counting the classics.)\n\nI think the art style is quite appealing and many of the worlds were beautiful to look at and explore. Chapter 1's Mafia town is admittedly a bit boring in comparison to other worlds and I found myself preferring anywhere else but there just because everywhere else was more interesting to me. The haunted Forests of Subcon Valley, movie sets of Dead Bird Studios, and the vast islands of Alpine Skyline was where I think the game shined and had me lost the most.\n\nThe collectables are fun to chase after and I found myself 100% completing the game. However 100% is a lie. It doesn't take into account the hidden Rift Tokens so that bites. There's also no good way of making sure you grabbed everything. No tracker for Yarns Balls so that also doesn't fall into the 100% complete and by the end I had every hat crafter but still 25 freaking yarns leftover. What's the point?\n\nThe music was really great listening to and getting a hold of the remixes through the Orb Machine was nice so you get some music variety in the levels. Customization was also great when you unlocked Hat Styles and Color Schemes. Howeve it's held back by the fact that all Styles, Remixes, and Color schemes are hidden behind a Slots style mini-game that uses Rift Tokens or you get a free one for beating a rift. There's a limited amount of Tokens and tries at the Slots and there's no current way I see of getting every customization item. Taking away against from completionists that want true 100%.\n\nStory is lacking and it sounds like there's a build up between you an early ally, but then they never bring her up again until the ending. Clearly this was not the focus of the game. I enjoyed the little stories I got in each world with their respective main NPCs though. The final fight lacked the proper build up though in my opinion even though I loved the fight.\n\nThere's even an issue of the game's title. \"A Hat in Time.\" Well aside from collecting the Time Pieces, there wasn't much of any focus on time in the game. Were we on a time limit for Hat Kid to get home? Is Hat Kid a time traveler? Never quite touched on. Time elements were just really few and far between. It's only there to justify your \"rival's\" motivation for wanting the Time Pieces.\n\nHat Kid herself is a fun and cute character. But that's where it ends sadly. She seems to have 0 concern about anyone else and simply wants her Time Pieces back. And that's fine, she's a neutral party. As the game currently is though, we don't know enough about Hat Kid to really care about her goal or understand her. Why is getting home important? We were shown and told nothing.\n\nWhile it does sound like I've railed on this game, I can't help but still love it to bits. I sunk myself into finding everything and loved the other worlds out there and simply being lost in exploration. The controls aren't the tightest I've played with but that didn't matter to me. I had my fun running and jumping and never felt I messed something up or took damage because a control didn't funciton right. It was afun ride and I enjoyed most of the characters I was preented with.\n\nHands down though, the Crows are the best characters. Sorry, I meant my fellow Express Owls.\n\nOverall 8/10 for me. Loved my time with it, but the areas that felt lacking hold the game back from earning a 10/10 in my book. I still reccomend the game a lot though. To me, it was worth backing it and I paid a higher price than $29.99 so at this price, it's quite worth it to me.", "timestamp_created": 1507487521, "timestamp_updated": 1507487739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35580126": {"recommendationid": "35580126", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996811078", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510940373}, "language": "english", "review": "More than enough content to justify the purchase, but I'm still looking forward to what comes next!\n\n*Will update after collecting all the things.", "timestamp_created": 1507487377, "timestamp_updated": 1507487377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35580110": {"recommendationid": "35580110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066415027", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507912236}, "language": "german", "review": "Diese Review spiegelt einzig und allein meine meinung dar!

The game is fun, it has lovely graphics and artwork, and the controls feel responsive. That said, the reason I have played so little (just over an hour at the time of writing this) is because of the control lay out being very poor for keyboard controls. Two highly required controls lie on the Ctrl and the Shift keys, making using them awkward and tricky, making parts of the game far more difficult and frustrating than they should be. \n\nDoes that make this a bad game? No. Doesn that mean that I will stop playing the game? No (I intend to buy a controller). Would I recommend the game? Yes, just not to anyone who wants to use keyboard controls.\n\nEDIT:\nHaving now got a controller, I can now say that playing this game is a delight! The controls are much easier, the game plays well, and although at times the game can be frustrating, I never feel like the game is conning me, just that I'm bad at the game, which in my opinion is very important for a platformer!", "timestamp_created": 1507483564, "timestamp_updated": 1507569913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35578615": {"recommendationid": "35578615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327353103", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512069339}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si eres fan de las plataformas 3D, facil, compra este juego YA!

Chapters 1, 2, 3, and the Chapter 5 boss fight are phenomenal. ESPECIALLY the boss fights of Chapters 2 and 3. However, the only problem that I have with this game is the lack of unique concepts in Chapter 4. You get hit by masterpiece after masterpiece after masterpiece and then Chapter 4's gimmick is that you can zipline. Wow. In Chapter 2 there is a level where you solve the mystery of the murder of an owl on a moving train while you must avoid detection from the crows that are guarding the evidence. But actually, it is a movie that you are in to help the director win the bird film awards against his rival director who is a disco penguin named DJ Grooves. Aaaand in Chapter 4 you zipline.

My main complain is that there's not more stuff to do, but given that pretty much every level and mission is great, I can't fault the game for not having bad content.\n\nDoes the game have problems though? Yes.\n-Some of the voice-work is kinda bad, though that is balanced out by some very stellar performances with some characters. And most of cast sounds fine.\n-Camera is a bit wonky at points, but it's not bad. Just expect the standard 3D platformer yank.\n-There's no easy way to see how many minor collectibles you're missing from each level. This one really sucks, if you are planning to go for absolute 100%. If you just want your file to display 100% clear, I guess it's not a problem since that only counts the Time Pieces, and not the Rift Tokens or Yarns.\n-I don't think there is a way to change the control mapping?

Do you remember games like Sonic Adventure DX that tried to tie Story and 50 minigames into one? It failed at that and couldn't deliver. A Hat in Time however, completely does. From racing portions to horror sections, sky exploration to mail delivery, Hat Kid goes on an adventure to return all of the Timepieces after a tragic accident involving her and a planet's Mafia. \n\nThroughout the Adventure, you will be spoiled with a wonderful, colorful word, funny and sweet portions of comedy, an engaging gameplay Experience filled with optional, yet rewarding pieces that will make your time playing this game just so much more exciting.\n\nThe soundtrack of A Hat in Time, partially composed by Grant Kirkhope, THE Grant, the same man who composed for Banjo & Kazooie and other popular Rare titles of the past, adds life to the visual style of the game. The spooky bits are filled with spooky music, the lively towns emit joyful tunes.\n\nIf your friends haven't recommended this game to you yet, I hope I can convince you to at least 'try' the game out. If you don't like the first hour, you can still refund the game.\n\nAfter talking to the developers and artists for many hours, I really couldn't feel bad about spending 30 bucks on a game again. It's been a wonderful experience and the money goes to forthcoming people that put their heart into the game.\n\nSadly, some portions of the game were sometimes confusing (The spooky world more than once) and glitchy, which subtracts from the overall Rating I am giving this game:\n\n9/10\n\nThe game's length is just acceptable for an indie developer team that worked on it for so many years. Their heart and souls went into making this a good game and in the future we can expect more updates! If that doesn't convince you to buy it, what will?

A control scheme that, even with a mouse and keyboard, controls wonderfully. That being said, there some things the prospective buyer should know. First off, the game, even with its bright, cheery exterior, does contain some scary imagery that may frighten children, though most adults and teens will probably be unaffected. Second, the game is about as difficult as the old platformers it tries to repliate, like Spyro or Mario 64. Just getting to the end credits is easy enough for a child, but colecting all the time pieces is actually preatty darn challenging. Third, the game has a comedic element to it. I thought it was truly funny, but the humor is kind of like that of Paper Mario, the Thousand Year Door, it is inofensive and family-friendly, yet still well crafted and funny. The one complaint I have is that the naritive elements are somewhat uneven. The second chapter, Battle of the Birds, was very naritive intensive, and had lots of great jokes.

If you're buying this for a collect-a-thon, you should look elsewhere. Lots of misdirection, illusion of freedom and blatantly linear segments. From what I can tell, the beta seemed to be a lot more appealing and open ended. For its price, a Hat in Time isn't worth the amount of content it offers. The game isn't half as open or fun to explore as it makes itself out to be with the first world. Combat is an afterthought, NPC and enemy variety is very slim, and there's only five worlds. \n\nOverall, it just doesn't have a lot of personality beyond being cute and having funny voices. This review may change depending on how the free DLC goes over. As it stands on launch, save your money for something with more personality and soul. If you want a better platformer, play Mario Sunshine. If you want a better collect-a-thon, play Banjo Kazooie. If you've exhausted those and need something new to scratch the old-school 3D platforming itch, this might do something for you. Just don't expect anything standout or genre-defining.\n\nEdit: Eh, some of the custom levels are better than the official ones, but honestly the user created challenges only make the shaky mechanics even more clear.

The game's length, quality and amount of content are severly lacking.\n\nA Hat In Time is a return to 3D platforming collect-a-thons of yore, akin to what the recent Yooka-Laylee sought to bring back. It cribs heavily off of Super Mario 64 and Sunshine while adding it's own unique spin on things and it mostly succeeds. However, the game super inconsistant in quality and game design and kinda grew stale quickly.\n\nLet me start with the gameplay, the Kid controls fairly well with controls being very responsive and giving you a lot of moves to play with and make your way around the levels. However, certain things get really frustrating because the camera isn't that great, sometimes it's really hard to hell where the Kid is in the middle of a jump because you might not be able to see your shadow and the wall climb/jump is terrible. If you jump towards a wall you'll run up a bit and you have the option to jump off or just slide down the wall. Jumping off the wall leads to a really, really small jump that almost doesn't get you any height and you can't control the direction of it at all, it's always perpendicular off of the wall. You also don't get your double jump back after doing this which you probably should since it'd help.\n\nMost of your moves come in the form of different hats that you knit after finding bundles of yarn, it's pretty interesting but there's no method to this progression. Every yarn bundle looks different, one representing each of the different hats. Once you get a new yarn bundle, you now have a \"blueprint\" for that hat and any subsequent bundles of the same look just count as a \"plus one\" on your yarn counter, meaning that any other bundle, no matter what it looks like will contribute to the creation of any hat. It doesn't take long to find every hat bundle and just make all of the hats (if you've been good on finding the bundles). Also, a lot of the hats don't have much of a purpose. One of the first ones you get allows you to run faster, but it's not that much faster and really isn't worth using. The last hat in the game allows you to stop time briefly, but it only has a single use for the entire game and I can't think of any other reason why you'd want to use it. The hat powers are great, but they're not well untilized.\n\nOnto the levels, there's only four and they're not that great. The first level is quite large and sprawling with a lot of visual interest. The second one takes place in a movie studio and has some clever ideas, but nearly every mission is it's own secluded section that's incredibly short. The third is a large forest with a lot of barriers you have to take down but when you do, you're left with a largely empty creepy forest without much in it and it can be confusing to navigate because everything just looks the same. The fourth is an utterly massive level that takes place on the peaks of themed mountain tops but the whole level is \"free roam\" without any interesting missions or characters to interact with you're left to your own devices to find the various timepieces yourself. It feels pretty lazy. There is a fifth \"level\" is just the final boss area which is incredibly short, think of the area right before Bowser in Super Mario Sunshine. Other than that there's also several small secluded challenge levels that are all themed exactly the same and really don't have anything to do with the levels they're attached to.\n\nContent: There just isn't enough of it, at 2~ hours of game time I managed to beat the final boss with only optional mopping up to do if I cared to get the 100%. I played for four more hours trying and managed to get to 90% and I won't be going back because I'm already bored of the experience. Also, a lot of the collectibles are pointless, I have all of the hats so all of the extra yarn is pointless to collect and everything else is just cosmetic items that don't even count towards your completion precentage. I believe there's 40 \"timepieces\" (think Stars in Mario games) and you only need 25 to beat the game.\n\nThe good: The music is great (though a lot of it takes heavily from Mario and Zelda), the game has a good art style and stays fresh enough for you to beat it.\n\nI do like the game, don't get me wrong but as someone who spent $15 to get 2 copies I feel like $30 is waaaay too much for what A Hat in Time has to offer and for that I can't recommend it. Definitely get this on sale though if you love 3D platformers.\n", "timestamp_created": 1507445567, "timestamp_updated": 1507445567, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514220", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35564518": {"recommendationid": "35564518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045314553", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509852141}, "language": "english", "review": "Irresistably adorable with its great level and character designs.

Two badges should never have been badges in the first place. The game's picture cam feature has no impact on gameplay....so why is it you can only use it while it takes up a badge slot? Meanwhile the grapple hook is mandatory for many stages, and is used so often everywhere that you'll NEVER unequip it. Not that you would anyway, since the game severely lacks in a useful badges count. How about a badge that increases health by 2 points? Or one that lets you do the slow hover from the beta? Or a badge that boosts the speed of a belly-dive flip even further?\n\nSecond, and this is just personal preference...the overall lack of moves. The game relies soley on two incredibly powerful abilities, the double jump and belly dive. The latter thankfully being incredibly fun and versatile, partially filling the void of an advanced player's need to push a game to it's limits. But it can only do so much. I would've loved to see more moves with that umbrella, like a diving slash, a handstand jump, a spin attack, an umbrella shield, or sliding on your umbrella to go fast like Mario does in Sunshine after he belly-slides through a puddle of water. The belly-dive is a fantastic move, but it frankly just gets kind of boring to dive-cancel/boost everywhere to solve every problem. Don't be too scared of your game getting beaten in unexpected ways.\n\nThird...personal preference again; The double jump makes the game too easy. When HiT is already so forgiving for failed jumps, I think this was a little overkill.", "timestamp_created": 1507443108, "timestamp_updated": 1507443108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525216", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35563780": {"recommendationid": "35563780", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983622279", "num_games_owned": 1068, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508018870}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing collectathon platformer game!\nI was hesetant after the bore-fest that Yooka-Laylee was.

I was afflicted with the autism scale of platformers where I prefer sonic's control stlye to mario's (yes I think that 06 was more fun than 3d world, suck my balls), probably due to the higher level of speed and flow in my opinion. Fret not, for this is a best of both worlds, where you get that elegant mario design with an exquisite move set to tickle your fancies for the coming 10-15 hours. After getting used to jumping and dashing in the first 15 minutes, you will be taken on a roller coaster of a game. The story is a kiddy platformer story, not insultingly bad and actually quite entertaining. The level of flow in the main 20 missions is great, you feel that you're the kiddie that DigibroMLP would have an insatiable erection for, and you are the mofo de la journ\u00e9e. However, the mechanic that helps you grab onto ledges and ropes fails later in the game and in the special stages. I will be trying to latch onto like a basic wall and it will go \"heh, I don't think so\" this is for the special stages only so keep that in mind. The only mission that I actually despised was the last mission of Mafia Town where you have to collect stupid tickets and your main hat (which locates items) is no help.\nOh, can I talk about how redundant half of these hats are? The main hat that Gamer Girl over there wears in the title only locates the hourglasses (\u00e0 la stars from Mario 64). That's it, no location of tickets for safes nor relics or anything. You will not be playing with that hat for the majority of the game, instead you use 5 other hats that don't really jive with the art design of the gamer girl. Which is a damn shame because she looks classy with that hat m8. You will be using the sprint hat which looks like one of those fast food caps from Sanic's burger shop. The ice block is simply a ground pound, that's it. YOU COULD HAVE KEYBOUND THAT TO SOMETHING. The kitsune mask causes certain materials to appear or disappear for a limited time. That's reasonable. The witch's hat throws a chargeable projectile. There's a time stop hat for some unknown reason. Then these hats clash with badges. There are 12 in total, which only 3 can be selected from. I understand this gives you the mirage of choice, but honestly you will be using the object magnet badge, the hookshot badge, and then maybe you have a choice with the others until you need to fill the slot with the mad hatter so your cooldowns virtually disappear (they recharge during the time of your standard jump arc).  Then that witches hat could have been combined with one of the badges that binds it with a charged lazer beam. Also, why are the crates that are destroyed by the witch's hat not also destroyable by the charge attack or the ground pound? Missed opportunity guys. If they gave you like 5 badge slots I wouldn't mind because the badges system had some potential, but it doesn't damage the game so oh well. \nIt feels really clunky how the main gimmick (the hats) transition half the time. If it was down to about 4 hats that you hotswapped with the d-pad or 1234 keys then that would work great. But it's that stupid max payne 3 wheel where you have to hold down LB (which on the one controller is really clunky compared to the 360) and then hold the right stick in the right direction, then let go of LB while holding the right analog. Holding the right stick all the way was so confusing initially, and I still didn't get it all the time. I've been spoiled by latency timers on other wheels, NYEH. \nI don't hate this game, this a STRONG 9/10. It's just soooo close. SOOOO close. The last main world, the goat plateau world is one of the best platforming world ever made. Even with its jaggies, the concept and execution meld so well that it's worth the purchasing price alone.

It brings back so much nostalgia and so many good memories of the good old days of 3d platformers. It's like Banjo Kazooie, Super Mario 64, Psychonauts, and all the beauty of platformers had a baby. Okay, now into the review.\n\nPOSITIVE:\nIt starts off with the most adorable story and light hearted tone. You start in Mafia Town and it's not colorless drivel, it's a world full of color and enemy types, collectibles, vaults, different mechanics and characters. It's the perfect introduction to a game that's so simple, yet can be brought into the speedrunning and complicated scene so easily, just like SM64. You start off with the Kid's Hat, which lets you see objectives; It's so helpful to see where you're supposed to go, yet you have so much freedom it's grand. You can gain up to 5 more hats as you progress, all with their own special mechanics. For example the sprint hat lets you run and the brewing hat lets you throw explosive potions. Even these two hats have so many applications, and it's just the beginning. Oh! And I almost forgot. This game controls exactly like SM64, Super Mario Sunshine, or Super Mario Galaxy would. It has a double jump, a dive, dive cancel, wall jumps, and the mechanics just keep getting more and more complex. For example slowing down time and using a grappling hook. Speaking of the grappling hook, there are badges in this game that you can equip (Up to 2 and 3 of them in the late game) that give you new and different things you can do. Again, for example there's the Item Magnet Badge which attracts nearby collectibles and the Hover Badge that saves you from taking fall damage. There's also negative or trash Badges that give bad effects. For example there's the 1-Hit Hero Badge that makes your HP sink to 1. These negative badges are merely to add challenge to the already rough 3d platformer. Plus, there's a plethera of \"Time Rifts\", aka special hidden stages, like in SM Sunshine. At the end of every level and rift there's a Time Piece (Or a star in Mario language) which you can use to unlock more acts and worlds. Also at the end of every Time Rift there's a slot machine that gives you cosmetics and tracks, making it able to customize your game, your character, adding your own flair to things. So far as the games' length and replayability, I played the game for a solid 14 hours and I still haven't found everything or completed all the achievements. Character-wise, they're all so lovable and they all have their own personality. Like Mustache Girl, who wants to be the hero of the story and destroy evil. (Mostly the Mafia) The controls are very tight and responsive, and if you mess up your inputs, the game most definitely punishes you. The soundtrack is beautiful and suits the game so very well. Now enough of my rambling and onto the negatives.\n\nNEGATIVE:\nI've searched almost every corner of the maps and I've seen only a few glitches and bugs. Which in this day and age is good, yet doesn't mean it's acceptable. I've seen a few T-poses and missing textures, but nothing terribly game-breaking. There's also a lack of explaining advanced mechanics like the speed boost if you cancel your dive when you hit the ground. Plus there's no application for some things, and even if not, sometimes it's only a one time use thing. There's a lack of different physical weapons not counting hats. There's an excessive amount of yarn to the point where it's not even rare. Also everything important glows like a thousand suns, which is nice for newbie players but it's definitely not necessary. I'm not going to talk much about the swimming mechanic because it's literally never used, but it definitely needs some work if it's meant to be a part of the game and not just an instant death.\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis game is a must get for platformer lovers and fans of the mario franchise. \nGraphics: 9/10\nSound: 10/10\nWorld Design: 10/10\nAI: 9/10\nDialogue: 7/10\nStory: 7/10\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nOverall: 8.9/10\nThis game is beautiful, rich, and smooth.\nWhen asked the question of getting this game, my answer is a definite yes.\n", "timestamp_created": 1507438625, "timestamp_updated": 1507438625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524765", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35562341": {"recommendationid": "35562341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093452803", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508201846}, "language": "english", "review": "This game brought back some pretty good memories from some of my old favorite platformers such as Super Paper Mario, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy.

The maps are so designed, so that there is not a single boring thing about it. This is what yooka laylee lacked in my opinion. Each map has been beautifully designed and filled with different things to collect. Mafia Town for example looks like an italian town: every thing is squached thogether. It's colorful and filled with those mafia cooks (everyone looks like a bald muscular guy with a mustache [spoiler]Except for one, which is a huge nerd and scared of aliens[/spoiler]).\n\nSecond: voice acting. Yes, almost every character is voice acted, even some of the not so important npcs. They sometimes give you tips, sometimes they say silly things. My favourite voice is from the ghost in Subcon Forest (I saddly don't know his name, if he even has one), the voice actor there had a lot of fun almost screaming in the microphone. For a game like this, the voices are really well done, you can almost hear the fun they had in each voice line.\nhttps://youtu.be/0qKwpwaUaoc?t=6m53s\n\nThird: the music. The music is AWESOME. You can even collect different types of versions of specific songs. Some songs have been made by the glorious grant and some from Pascal Michael (I don't really know what kind of music he did). But every piece just fits in the game. Mafia towns song has bit of italian vibe to it. The spooky Subcon Forest has some scary melodies in it. They did really great music for the game. I really love the music of chapter two. \n\nFourth: The gameplay feels just right. The controls aren't overly mapped, so you can play it with a controller. They feel just nice and comfortable. The visuals give some great punch to some actions like throwing explosives or punching a critter with your weapon.\n\nBut for such a great game, there are also some flaws, like sometimes spazing cameras or a bit too annoying wall climbs (only in small spaces). But those are tiny flaws, which don't even affect the game all too bad\n\nIn other words: if you loved mario 64 oder other platformers, try this one out.

Your main objective is to collect some Hourglasses (like the Mario Stars), but you can ignore it as long as you want as explore everywhere for money, upgrades and relics, which is as interesting if not more. One world have as only objective \"Free Roam : Do whatever you want\" and I giggled like a child at this idea. It's just that fun and deserves the word \"sandbox game\" better than all the GTA-like games  out there.\nThe story is very light and more of an excuse to send you collecting Hourglasses, but it's charming nonetheless.

Even though JonTron is a terrible person, it's not a dealbreaker for me, though a statement by the devs would really be appreciated. I do wanna put that out there as a disclaimer, though, so people are informed.\n\nWith that out of the way, this game is really good. The best thing about it is probably how varied it is. Every world has a vastly different mission structure: Chapter 1, Mafia Town, is pretty straightforward initially, but after you're \"done\" with it and beat the Mafia boss, it gets more open, especially with it containing a Mission you need a Chapter 4 powerup to beat. Thankfully, the game tells you on the Mission Select Screen if you lack something you need to progress. Chapter 2, Battle of the Birds, takes place in a few more linear areas as opposed to Mafia Town's island. Additionally, there's two paths, each for a movie director who wants to make the best movie, and your perfomance in those levels determines who wins, which impacts the boss fight at the end of the chapter. Chapter 3, Subcon Forest, has mostly linear missions, but the world is probably the most open (and sometimes confusing) of the game. The catch here is that you have to sign contracts before you can access missions, so you have to commit to what you do. Chapter 4, Alpine Skyline, is completely open with no selectable missions and isntead only a \"Free Roam\" option. You can get the 4 main Time Pieces in this world in any order. Chapter 5, Time's End, is only a linear gauntlet with one level.\n\nChapter 1, 2 and 3 are all very good, with Chapter 2 being the best in the game due to the variety. You have to solve a murder mystery on a train, gain a penguin fanclub and run away from a deadly parade. Chapter 3's dark undertones (for instance, there's a noose trying to talk you into suicide and an absolutely terrifying haunted mansion) make it a close second, though, with it mostly being held back by the confusing and samey layout. You definitely learn it, but it's unintuitive compared to Mafia Town or Alpine Skyline. Alpine Skyline has some really nice challenges, but it feels like it's missing something, especially near the end where it just kinda... ends without a boss fight. Chapter 5 has a nice premise of everyone being prosecuted for their alleged crimes and it has some nice callbacks, but it ultimately feels a bit too generic compared to everything else. The final boss also isn't as good as the previous fights, especially with both Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 having amazing boss fights, Chapter 2's being one of the best bosses I've seen in some time due to the way it calls back to the previous chapters while also just being really fun. The final boss has this nice twist with the enemies being aware of their deaths creating health, but both the Chapter 2 (a time bomb from a previous chapter gets tied to you) and Chapter 3 (you paint the boss blue with his own attack so he becomes vulnerable) bosses had better twists.\n\nSprinkled throughout the game are time rifts, which have to be discovered before they can be found in the stages. Each stage has 2 blue time rifts and 1 purple time rift. The blue ones are unlocked as you progress whereas the purple ones are unlocked by assembling artifacts that are sprinkled throughout the levels. Their position is hinted at with a photo of their location. While that is a pretty cool idea, some photos are a bit too generic so it's pretty hard to find those rifts. Blue rifts lead to Super Mario Sunshine Secret Stage-esque platforming-centered stages which are usually pretty fun, whereas purple rifts lead to exploration-based stages where you have to find crowns to progress. The latter also contain pages, which you can collect in order to get some backstory for the characters. I would prefer it if the pages were counted by stage instead of globally, since some of the rifts can have a lot of stages so it's tough to know where you missed a page.\n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely amazing and oh my god please buy it\n\nThe writing is absolutely amazing and oh my god please... buy... it..?\n\nIn the end, this game starts out strong, then gets better, but can't hold that standard until the end, unfortunately.

This game is wonderful, and still isn't even close to being fully done. Theres still Co-Op to be released AND 2 more DLC levels. Honestly, I myself can't wait. Sure, theres a few bugs (Grappling doesn't work properly; I have a screenshot of me being in a wall because, you know, grappling lets you go through walls sometimes.) and that you sometimes T-Pose if you get your hat stolen then you get it back, and you can sometimes get stuck in Gay Baby Jail.

And for every thing it does right there's an issue holding it back from being the best it can be. I'm going to recommend it but I'm mostly going to talk about the issues I've had with the game, because I think if the developers put a bit more work in they could have easily made a great or amazing game.\n\nThe raw platforming, without abilities and without enemies around, is very enjoyable. The controls are very responsive and you're always looking for new place to try and jump to. The Hat abilities themselves are also all quite good and blend into the gameplay well, but there's nothing you can do with Hat Kid that hasn't already been done before, everything she does she does well enough and a bit different enough that you don't mind. It never really feels like a cheap knock-off game. There are downsides though. The character controls are camera relative and the camera does tend to move on it's own in strange and unpredictable directions, this means you'll be holding a direction and expecting your character to go in it, only for the camera to move you an inch to the left, causing you to whack your head on a fence and bounce off, plumetting to your death. All of the automated functions like homing attacks, grapple hooks and tight ropes are character relative too, meaning if your character is facing the wrong way because the camera moved on it's own mid jump you're going to miss the prompt for the next thing and also, plummet to your death. The tightropes in particular are very interesting, since many times I've lined up the ropes perfectly only to go straight through them, where my sloppy or rushed jumps that I think I've missed end up magnetizing me to the rope. This hit and miss situation makes the segments where you have to bounce from rope to rope extremely frustrating because you have no idea what's going to happen. Though they space these sections out fairly far apart so you don't frustrated with them, making these things distance based instead of character relative would make these problems go away.\n\nThe levels are all well done, the worlds are vibrant and have their own stories and the characters in them have their own personalities and motives that get revealed to you as you progress through an area. As you unlock new hat abilities new areas open up to you with lots of hidden goodies to collect and the stories tend to draw you in just enough that you don't mind doing a bit of backtracking every now and then. There's an unusual reliance on stealth mechanics in the game, where you have to dodge vision cones or get sent back to the start of an area, over traditional fighting. The main reason I think is just that the combat mechanics aren't really there. As you explore a level there aren't really any enemies to fight. In fact fighting is very much optional, for a very large chunk of the game unless you need to chain homing attacks to get somewhere. There are specific combat abilities you can unlock that you never really need and there's a slot for 'weapon' on the character screen that I don't think you ever have to use, because after the first mission you get the only weapon you're going to use for the rest of the game. It's a bit disappointing that they give you a cool lazer beam attack that you never have to use. The boss fights don't require you to use any of your hat or badge abilities either, they have very simple patterns that after a tiny bit of trial and error you can get down straight away. I'm sure you can use your hat abilities to make them even easier but I never felt like I needed to. The bosses as characters are great and they are enjoyable as a result of them characterizing their villains quite well, but the fights themselves are underwhelming.\n\nIt's a fairly short game, I have 32 Time Pieces and I've played about four and a half hours or so, about a quarter of that time was spent backtracking through things I've already done to track down whatever I need to progress forward. I haven't finished the game yet but I have unlocked all 5 worlds and 100% completed two of them already. I probably have maybe one or two more hours of gameplay before I've completely finished everything there is to do. Though the smaller worlds and backtracking aren't that terrible, as the worlds themselves are packed full of detail and lore that just makes them a lot more fun to play around in. It's just a shame there isn't more levels. Hopefully at some point there will be, either through DLC. Or mods, as there is full mod support for the game.\n\nOverall A Hat in Time is a good game and worth picking up if you want to play a 3D platformer, just be aware that it's very much a 3D platformer and not much else. It sticks to what it's good at like glue and I think that rigid approach to the level design and gameplay is what lets it down. Not so much just more combat but better combat or even just a reason to fight anything at all would have been very nice. Also with all the hat abilities you get it, you never really find yourself having to quickly switch between them which is a real shame, since the straightforward level design doesn't just bring the game down but it's also a large part of why it's so easy. Outside of their specific usage scenarios inside the areas you find them in and a few others, you basically never have to use them. The game is called A Hat in Time and you never really have to worry about what hat you're wearing until something glowing a certain colour is blocking your way. It does feel disappointing when you have a cool wizard hat that lets you shoot explosions and you basically only use it to clear crates once or twice a level.\n\nEven though my very presitigious Steam review has been fairly negative, A Hat in Time is worth it if you have a young child and want to get them playing games or you just need to scratch that platformer itch.

It's a game that aims to bring back the old style of 3D platformers. Does it really do that? Well I'd say, yes, yes it does. The controls are very fluid and responsive with a bit of looseness to it it making it feel just right. The combat isn't too bad, there's impact when you hit enemies, so that's a plus, as many games I have played have not had that impact that makes you feel like you're hitting an enemy, and moreso like you're trying to hit a pinata directly in front of you while you're next to a hurricane so the pinata is gone and why are you still there, leave, you'll die. And you do. Anyways, gamplay good.\n\nSo what about the story:\nThe story at times, after skimming a couple reviews myself, post playing the game of course, have pointed out that the story may seem a but unituitive and shallow. And I do admit, as opposed to other 3D platformers, it can at some points, but I fell that this could be because the developers perhaps have focused more on the gameplay and the overall experince of the game itself as opposed to the story. There is one really nice thing touch that was really nicely done I must say. And those are the memories of certain characters you can collect whilst exploring these things called Time Rifts, I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers, but I'll say that one of them stood among the rest and actually legitimately gave me some feels and I felt bad for the character.\n\nOverall look of the game:\nSo I played the beta, some are saying it looks worse, I absolutely 100% disagree. It's a major improvement upon the beta and alpha of the game. The aesthetic is very clean and has a cell shading to it, and I find the game very vivid and colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Can't really say much more on that besides the fact that my PC is by far the best, and I was almost afraid that when this game came out I would be unable to play and enjoy it, but putting it down on performance mode, the graphics are still very clean and crisp, especially on my 42' 1080p flatscreen. And the game ran at 60 fps nearly the whole time, except for 1 or 2 certain stages that were a bit rough on my PC, but not for long as after the stage was fully rendered and everything the frames wnt back up to an enjoyable state.\n\nFinally, the music:\nAll I have to say about the music is, it's stellar! It's like really really good. And here's one of my favorite aspects of the game: There's a song remix type of system where ther are multiple versions in different musical styles for each zone that are able to be unlocked and set as the default for that area. And the composition of the music is astounding and very nostlgia inducing. I have the full OST on my phone and listening to it in car rides with my nice sound system is great and the quality is superb, CD quality at that, which it can't get much better from there.\n\nNow to sum it all up:\nThere are quite a few things I didn't touch on and I won't as I'll leave those for you to find out for yourself if you decide to buy this readers. So if you like 3D platformers like Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario 64, is this game for you? Very much likely yes! The game was overall very enjoyable, the playtime can differ depending on how you play, I tried to complete as much as I could and collect as much as I was able to. Sadly the game only took me around a little less than 15 hours to beat, but that also could be as I already had experience in playing it from the beta and knew what to do at some points, despite not everything being similar to the beta. But also with the upcoming mod support, the game will be more enjoyable than ever before! Which I eagerly anticipate to see what people can create as I want to get way more playtime out of this game as I love it so.\n\nMy overall rating for this game would have to be a 9/10. I know it may seem a bit biased as I love this game for one, and I know games like this are not for everyone, so opinions and reviews will differ. I hope my review was at least somewhat helpful in giving those who are uncertain about the game, even the slightest idea on if it is for them or not.", "timestamp_created": 1507398049, "timestamp_updated": 1507398079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35550755": {"recommendationid": "35550755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206540292", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509730437}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely loved this game. 100% completed it and had a blast doing it.

Plus it's got jokes (admittibly a lot the jokes are pretty random so if your not a fan of random humor, some of the jokes may not work for you).\n\nOne problem with this game is that the models clip, but that really only a minor problem that can be fixed with a patch. Other than that, there are no other glaring problems.\n\nWarning: Act four of Subcon Forest is basically a mini horror game that can be pretty scary, so prepare yourselves for that.

In my opinion, that is sad because there are so many great and argubly better N64 & Gamecube platformers at the time.\n\nA Hat in Time would best be described as a game that would come out during the Nintendo Gamecube and Playstation 2. In this era, almost every game made was a 3D platformer. If it wasn't a Nintendo game, it was TV, Movies and anything else like Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom or Scooby-Doo Night of 100 Fights. Every game was a 3D platformer, and  as a kid, I LOVED IT. I absolutely adore 3D platformers with simple and linear objectives.\n\nOverall, it's a solid 3D platformer. It has all the core and essential elements for a 3D platformer. The worlds and levels are very large and open for exploration. For example, on my first run, rather than chasing the Mysterious pink girl, I started exploring and looking around. Eventually, I stopped caring about the Time Relic until I encountered it after my exploration. From there, I completed the level. This is the style of 3D platforming I missed.  It's obvious that Gear for Breakfast were not afraid to embrace thier creativity because they clearly tried to recreate this style of 3D platformer unlike Yooka Laylee. There a ton of uniquie level designs, and the worlds feel very alive. Even the Time levels don't remind me of Mario Sunshine. In fact, they actually have their own idenity and feel  original. It also helps that the music and graphics look pretty good! It's nothing like Mario Sunshine or Mario 64. \n\nHowever, my biggest complain would be that it does in fact feel like it was made during the Nintendo Gamecube era. There are cutscences where you can see no animations in character models. They're just awkwarding sliding or walking. The main protagonist herself doesn't have lip animations, and characters interact by simply moving their hands while a voice narrator reads the text. In general, I feel like I'm playing a gamecube game using Dolphin to run it at 1080p with higher textures.\n\nReguardless, I still recommend this to any loving 3D platformer fan. If you are a 199X born kid and grew up in the early 2000, you'll love this and have great memories of your childhood. You'll remember all those great moments playing Mario Sunshine on Gamecube or Jack and Daxter on the PlayStation 2. I can understand why some would wait for a price drop, however. If you've never played a 3D platformer, and you are interested. This is a great introduction to why people like 3D platformer.  I recommend it at full price for 3D platformer fans. Near 20 dollars for people who never played a 3D platformer and are used to modern AAA platformers like Uncharated or Tomb Raider.", "timestamp_created": 1507397329, "timestamp_updated": 1507397451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555520", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35550537": {"recommendationid": "35550537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055440050", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507608107}, "language": "english", "review": "Very VERY good game.

Don't get your knickers in a twist if I get something wrong or leave some example out Everything you read here is subject to change.\n\nA Hat in Time is a platformer funded by kickstarted developed by Gears for Breakfast.\nIt very much wears its influences on its sleeve. The gameplay harkens back to a time where 3D platformers were a total blast to control (Think SM64/Sunshine and Banjo Kazooie). Even though A Hat in Time is supposed to be a successor to the 3D platformers of the late 90s and early 2000's, the amount of games and other media this game takes from is much larger. Those well-read in game trivia from back in the day will notice references left and right that might evoke a smile, or a sigh of exasperation depending on how immersed you like being.\n\nGameplay: Pretty damn good, but a bit of polish could have done wonders\n     A Hat in Time controls far better than the average PC game in its genre, but it still doesn't have the polish that you'd expect from a Nintendo or Rare classic. Hat Kid has many of the same moves as Mario from Sunshine, but she doesn't have quite the same weight to jumping that made Sunshine such a joy to control. Combat especially feels quite stilted and awkward, Hat Kid has limited options for attacking in the air, which can lead to some awkward situations in more challenging levels. Still, despite my problems with the movement mechanics in AHiT, I still had tons of fun moving around the game world.\n\nPresentation: I really shouldn't complain, but here goes anyway.\n     A Hat in Time, visually speaking is a mixed bag. While many areas have had layer after layer of visual polish, some areas look flat out lazy in comparison. Character animation ranges from pretty good to pretty bad at times. While Hat Kid has a very appealing design, many supporting characters look like they were stock assets taken from an old Dark Basic game (The owls particularly offend me). I have my complaints, but AHiT will look completely fine to most people.\n     On the other hand, the music and sound design here is top-notch. The music will dynamically change depending on where you are in the game or what you're doing. You'll hear instruments be swapped out, the music slow down, or speed up. The songs themselves are quite catchy and evoke the rich sounding music that was present in Super Mario Galaxy. The voice acting, unfortunately, needs work, but the game thankfully gives you an option to have characters mumble like Banjo Kazooie, so I can't be too hard on it.\n\nVerdict: If you dearly miss the days where 3D platformers had actual depth and complexity to them, and Yooka Laylee left you sorely dissapointed, then A Hat in Time might be just what you've been looking for. Especially if you can't afford Mario Odyssey or a Switch. However, if you're like me and constantly nitpick an otherwise fine game for how it's different to what it claims to be, you may be dissapointed yet again.", "timestamp_created": 1507395054, "timestamp_updated": 1507395054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35549584": {"recommendationid": "35549584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023172149", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508337571}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Very good!", "timestamp_created": 1507394900, "timestamp_updated": 1507394900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35549444": {"recommendationid": "35549444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109048091", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513111810}, "language": "english", "review": "I have only just gotten to the end of the third chapter and holy heck this game\nIt controls amazingly, the writing is amazing, the voice acting is well done and the bosses are some of the most fun I've seen in a 3d platformer", "timestamp_created": 1507394537, "timestamp_updated": 1507394537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35549310": {"recommendationid": "35549310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016720768", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513560729}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a Yooka-Laylee fan.

In my opinion it is worth $15 not $30. \n\nBad:\nFirst the controls are not tight enough for a platformer.  Don't attempt to play with mouse and keyboard. Pulling out Steam Controller and Xbox controller make the platforming a little better, but honestly not much.  Appears to have engine problems.  For instance your character will often decide not to perform normally easy feats.  Jumping off a wall, grabbing an edge, or just punching can all have weird unforseen effects that don't make sense.\n\nGood:\nThe camera is really good.  Most platformers encounter a number of problems with camera positioning.  This does not.  \n\nBad:\nThe enviroment is static.  Boxes can't be broken they are part of the enviroment.  Most of the world is not interactive.  Just static enviroments that look like they should be destructable.  \n\nGood:\nThe world is very visually appealing.\n\nBad:\nThe gameplay is bad.  You just run around collecting these nonnarrative coin equivalence that are literally scattered everywhere for busywork.  In the first area these don't appear to have a purpose. Enemies aren't fun.  It is just hit these small things easily.  Very little gameplay.  They are very minor annoyances that you can avoid easily.\n\nBad:\nThe writing is aweful.  The comedy style is that of a teenage le random girl.  \"Taco!\" \"lel I yelled taco unprovoked. I'm so leh random.\" that is the comedy of this game.  Mafia dude floating randomly in space opening space door for his mafia tax.  LEL SO RANDOM IN SPACE!\n\nThe game feels like it was only half done and they ran out of funds.

The controls are fantastic, and it very rarely felt like Hat Kid (the game's adorable protagonist) wasn't doing exactly what I told her to do. Platforming is the core of every level, and the game gives you plenty of tools to move about in a myriad of ways, whether it's diving in midair to get extra distance or swingingly effortlessly with a grappling hook.\n\nThe characters are amazingly endearing, to the point where I can't get them out of my head. The entire game is fully voice acted (with some barely-there exceptions). I found myself enjoying the voices, but if you don't you can simply turn them off, or even convert them to Banjo-Kazooie-style mumbling noises! Every interaction is full of humor, and I found myself laughing out loud on multiple occasions.\n\nThe music is also phenomenally catchy, with each track fitting the stage perfectly, and multiple instrumentations that fade in seamlessly depending on where you are in the level. A Hat in Time's composer Pascal Michael Stiefel deserves major kudos, and I hope to see him in many more games in the future.\n\nI think the one criticism I would have of A Hat in Time is that its first world, Mafia Town, is a bit rough around the edges. The character models seem a bit messy, and there are cutscenes in those levels that seem like they're missing animations. The game's presentation improves massively after that, and I was absolutely in love with the final world. The boss encounters are also amazingly fun and high-energy, in a genre that generally suffers from slow and boring boss fights.\n\nI highly, HIGHLY recommend A Hat in Time, especially if you fondly remember the tight platforming of Super Mario Sunshine or the constant humor of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. At $30 it's worth every single penny, and two additional chapters are on the way as free post-launch DLC.

I've been anticipating this game since I've first heard about it several years ago, and the wait has been well worth it.\n\nPresentation is amazingly cute and charming, with memorable characters across the board, an adorable art style, great soundtrack and actually quite funny gags. Worlds are good and varied if laid out a little confusingly at times. The actual levels and challenges in the worlds are a take on the Mario Sunshine formula of collect-a-thon trinket hunting, but are as a rule several times more creative, unique and sometimes more complex than platformers of a similar kind, ranging from anything to an ordinary fetch quest with a small spin or two to elaborate stealth sections to a portion where the game basically turns into a lighthearted horror game, trying to solve puzzles while stripped off your powers and stalked by what appears to be some demonic queen roaming in her manor. It feels like every other world/level throws a new gimmick or elaborate gag into the core gameplay, and it keeps things fresh to the point that I could binge entire worlds without a semblance of being even remotely exhausted or bored with them. Even the boss fights are really cool in this, which tend to be the weak point of most 3D platformers of a similar jib. Fairly challenging, prone to catching you off-guard with how elaborate and lengthy they are and actually quite hectic, they round out the more straightforward platforming challenges and less confrontational on-off gameplay gimmicks.\n\nBeyond some tiny tidbits like the worlds not being as expertedly laid out as they could be and the camera behaving a little unruly at times(it's still perfectly serviceable for the most part, camera isn't your nemesis this game. Just feels a bit jank at times), I just wish it was a little longer. Game has 4 main worlds with about 5 or so acts(and some hidden platforming mini-levels) each and 1 final world that serves as a final parcour section to the final boss and the boss fight itself, and while many acts tend to actually be quite long for what they are, and I haven't quite finished everything yet, it all just feels over a little too soon. I heard there's free DLC worlds on the way though, so I suppose my plight may only be temporary, and besides it isn't really the game's failing that it's short(I reached the final boss and did a bit of other stuff before actually fighting it with 8 hours, which is fine, really), more that it's good enough that you'd like more.", "timestamp_created": 1507392902, "timestamp_updated": 1507392902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35548728": {"recommendationid": "35548728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065005125", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507891568}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uaf64\ub098 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \u3147\u3147 \uc601\uc54c\ubabb\ub3c4 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc990\uae30\uc2e4 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubb34\uc5c7\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub3c4 \uadc0\uc5fd\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub124 \uadc0\uc5fd\ub2e4\uace0\uc694 \ubab9\uc2dc \uadc0\uc5fd\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ubaa8\uc790\uc758 \uc2a4\ud0a8\uc774\ub098, \uba38\ub9ac\uc0c9 \ub3c4 \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc544\uae30\uc790\uae30\ud558\uac8c \uadc0\uc5fd\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uac8c\uc784 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0 \uc911 \ube0c\uae08 \ub9ac\ubbf9\uc2a4\ub3c4 \uc778\uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4e3\ub294\uac83\ub3c4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 (\ubb3c\ub860 \uc5bb\uc5b4\uc57c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc)\n\ubb34\uc5c7\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uadc0\uc5fd\uace0 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uace0 \uadc0\uc5fd\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc815\ub9d0\ub85c \ub9cc\uc871\uc2a4\ub7fd\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 3\ub9cc\uc6d0 \uc544\uae5d\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \u3147\u3147\n", "timestamp_created": 1507392842, "timestamp_updated": 1507392842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35548649": {"recommendationid": "35548649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204229443", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513054304}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best platforming games I have played period.

The characters are great and the game feels great to control. It's a fun collectathon and I highly recommend it to those who are fans of those types of games and platformers in general.

I can say that I just really love this game (Don't even get me started on the soundtrack).\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1507391517, "timestamp_updated": 1511891400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580153", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35548006": {"recommendationid": "35548006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170099719", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510286795}, "language": "english", "review": "mafia ball", "timestamp_created": 1507391207, "timestamp_updated": 1507391207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35547800": {"recommendationid": "35547800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288059507", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509656532}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and cute", "timestamp_created": 1507390713, "timestamp_updated": 1507390713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35547749": {"recommendationid": "35547749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047747013", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510252801}, "language": "english", "review": "It's beautiful it's cute but most importantly IT'S FUN and buddy boy it is definitely worth the buy.

Tight controls, great abilities and creative level design.\n\n\"How does it stack up to Yooka Laylee?\" you might ask.\n\nWell, in terms of level design, humor and characters, it surpasses Yooka Laylee in several points, or at the very least matches it. The catch? The game is WAY too short. Only 5 levels and only 40 hourglasses to collect, 24 of which are needed to beat the game. However, the sheer amount of mission variety is staggering, and the attention to detail in every level is marvelous. You never seem to be doing the same thing twice. If I had to compare it to an existing game, the overall mission structure is like a heavily abridged version of Super Mario Sunshine, complete with platforming levels in a void.\n\nThe character cast has an incredible amount of heart and soul in it. Even the bad guys are immensely likable. The Cook Mafia has to be my favorite band of crooks in the history of video games. Hat Kid herself doesn't have much personality beyond \"cute and happy\" during most of the gameplay, but her character becomes more apparent in her diary entires, relic descriptions and the way she comments on various world objects.\n\nThe bosses are easily the most challenging aspect of the game. They're fast, have a lot of attacks, and the fights can go on for ages with no midpoints if you die. Some of them can even get you in a stunlock, which is quite infuriating.\n\nOverall, A Hat In Time is a solid little gem, with its biggest problem being that there isn't enough of it.\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n + Great level design\n + Great controls\n + Great characters and humor\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n - Way too short\n - Some bosses can stunlock you\n\n[h1]SCORE: 8.5 / 10[/h1]\n\nPS: How on earth did this get only a Pegi 7 age rating?!

It controls very well. It really doesn't do anything new, though. The concept of moving a little character around a 3D world was novel and exciting back in the '90s and oughts, but now it's nothing special at all. I think that most of the game's appeal is in its high visual production values, amazing soundtrack, and straight-up heartwarming cuteness. Those elements alone might be enough to hold peoples' attention for a couple of weeks. You may get some more mileage out of the game by exploring the growing library of user-created content like new hats and levels. At some point, though, if you've double-jumped through one level, you've basically double-jumped through them all.

I waited for 5 years on this game, and well, it didn't disappoint.\n\nI never backed the game, but i have been closely following it since its very early days, when Mekucube (at the time known as Mechatheslag) was posting small little updates almost every day on his youtube on what progress he had made, be it a small little area to test in, to picking up a water melon and holing it above Hat Kid's head. I was also a slacker backer and played during the beta, i sadly didn't back the game during the original kickstarter, and i regret not doing so.\n\nNow, enough gushing over old stuff, its onto the actual review.\n\nThis game, is just from start to finish, full of charm, cuteness, and emotion, every time i booted up the game i got this huge grin across my face (and not just excitement that its actually here), a grin of happiness. This game knows what it wants to be, and it did just that, giving so many memorable characters such as the Mustache Girl, the Mafia, Snatcher, Conductor and so many more. Each character in the game was unique and different from one another, and no two characters are alike, even each mafia member you can talk to has something different about them that makes them memorable. The writing is on par with Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door (and with TONS of references to it as well)\n\nNext up, Art direction, and oh my god this game looks AND sounds fantastic. It Just oozes with an adorable feeling that makes you giddy at everything you see. The art style is remincisent of the Wind Waker, and it shows, and giving itself its own identity too boot. The game feels fantastic to look at, and also each act of each world has its own title card, which gives you a LOT to look at in between levels. And dont get me started on the music, its just filled to the brim with so many good tracks. Shoutouts to Pascal and special guest Grant Kirkhope, you guys made an OST i can just listen to for hours... which is 5 hours long in total. Great job to them. The voice acting as well is Top notch, everyone delivered their lines oh so well i could feel the emotion they put into each and every line.\n\nNow, how does it play? Well, it plays like Super Mario Sunshine, but a LOT more movement based. Hat Kid feels so good to control that never once did I ever feel like the game took control away, or that any mistake that I made wasn't my fault. Now the main gimick of the game, is Hats. With each hat you gain new abilities, and you can even swap them on the fly too for some extremely fluid switching. and this game wouldn't be a collectathon if it didn't have collectables to nab. You go around, collect Pons, Yarn, badges, other things, and your main plot macguffin, Time Pieces. You can Jump, Dive, wall jump, swing, attack, and so on. Hat Kid's movement options would make even Super Smash Bros. Melee professionals be envious. Theres never one way to get to your goal, and how Hat Kid moves is just right. And if you want to swap from keyboard controls to a controller, its super quick and you dont have to change any settings, it automatically switches over to your gaming preference (and theres Gamecube controller support!)\n\nNow, if i have only a SINGLE complaint about this game, it would be the length. Its short. and I mean, SHORT. only a good 5 hours if you go for everything, while my hours at the time of this review say otherwise, 15 of them were during the beta.\n\nAll in all, I HIGHLY reccomend this game if you were a fan of gamecube era styled games, and its well worth your $30.\nThank you, and have a good evening~", "timestamp_created": 1507363766, "timestamp_updated": 1507363766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634383", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35537376": {"recommendationid": "35537376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089109922", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508560131}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable game, will occupy a lot of my time.

Yes. Do I recommend it for 30$? No. As well polished and good as it is, as of this writing (10/7/17), I was able to 100% this game in 10 hours (the reason I'm not complaining is because I pledged to the KS ~2-3 years back). However, its length being the biggest issue should tell you something about it. I definitely recommend you buy this, just... wait for a sale. Into what I think about it...\n\n\nThe good:\n- Take the best parts of Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario 64, and Banjo Kazooie, mash them all together, and you've got A Hat in Time. You can tell Gears for Breakfast did their homework on what makes a great platformer, because the game controls extremely well from the moment you start. In addition, the camera controls near perfectly, and aside from one area in the game, it never gave me any issues.\n\n- Level design is intuitive and amazing, There was only one area I got lost in trying to 100% the game, and I had no issues navigating through the main campaign. The areas also have little hidden places to put secret levels in them, and locating them was never a chore, but instead a fun challenge. And let's not get into how amazing all these places look...\n\n- Every collectable counts towards something. The pons (currency) are used to buy badges, upgrades for your hat. The yarn is used to knit new hats with different abilities. The time pieces progress the story. The list goes on and on. Collecting them felt fun, instead of a chore, and that's hard to do in collect-a-thons.\n\n- Except for a few parts, there was full voice acting through the entire game. This really struck me as some of the voice actors really sold their character (the spirit in Subcon Woods comes to mind). Some... didn't, but at the very least, everyone was passable, and it really added to my experience.\n\n- Polish up the butt. Everywhere I look, there's little details and hidden things for me to find, and it was a real treat. A lot of the game functions were subtly tailored to player convinence as well. I would describe them here, but it would take way too long. Just take my word on this one.\n\n\nNow, onto the bad (this is mostly nitpicking though):\n- Length, as mentioned above. I can perfectly understand why they want to charrge 30$ for this game, and if it had even just a little more stuff to do on the side, I might agree. But as it is, A Hat in Time would be worth closer to 15$ or 20$ instead of 30$. Buy it when it goes on sale for about that much.\n\n- The story felt flimsy, and its message to me was unclear. In some worlds, it was a fun cliche plotline, but a lot of times, they got no proper conclusion (SPOILERS: There's no real redemption arc for the birds in the movie world where they apologize and that threw me for a loop). I realize this is a platformer and not a story driven game, but the characters felt under-utilized, and I never really cared about them (Also, the main character can be borderline psychopathic sometimes).\n\n- The difficulty was considerably easier than I was expecting. I was never in shortage of yarn (and in fact I had extra left over from when I'd made all the hats), hearts were plentiful, and some hats, like the timestop one, were extremely powerful and made the game feel like a joke at times. Perhaps difficulty settings that alter the amount of yarn needed for hats, how many hearts drop, and etc. would work. The game's current solution, a badge that reduces you to 1 hit point, doesn't fix a lot of the pacing issues outside of battle this game's lenient difficulty creates.\n\n\nOverall, A Hat in Time isn't perfect, but it's the best darn collect-a-thon I've seen in a long while. If you REALLY like collect-a-thons, it might be worth 30$, but for everyone else: wait for a sale.

It truly captures the essence of the whimsical fun of the genre when it was in its hayday, and while the collecting aspect is short and sweet, it is more than worth the wait for those who followed its development, and in the 15 hours it took me to get all the hourglasses, it has earned a spot as one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nTo briefly cover what the game is- not that anyone bothering to read this doesn't know the basics, its a game I would say is most similar mechanically to something like Mario Galaxy- there's a few levels, you pick which hourglass you're going going after in that mission, and you go get it, though they constantly mix the forumla around a little for each level. In some, you'll run over a fairly open and large level searching for loose objectives, more like Donkey Kong 64, for example, while in others  you follow the simple mission structure of a game like Mario Galaxy. Beyond collecting the 40 hourglasses- the main collectable of the game- there's also yarn to find in hidden corners of each world for making hats, but not much else, and green orbs you use to buy little badges- basically, interchangable powerups.\n\nFirst, the good. The game is abundant with charm and characters that are the perfect amount of over-the-top, the music is top-notch, and while I found the level design a little hit-or-miss with me personally, I never stopped having a great time. The gameplay is smooth, fluid, and well animated. The graphics strike a particular chord with me, and each world tends to mix it up enough to keep the visuals interesting and diverse. While I might just be a huge softie, I was surprised to say I felt geniune emotion throughout- a childish joy through most of the game, getting teary eyed at a few times near the end, and one mission in particular that spooked me pretty darn good from the visuals and sound design alone. I could gush for quite some time, but the short of it is, the game is just pure fun- the visuals are fun, the sound design is fun, the music is fun, and the characters are just fun, and the game rarely tries to be anything else. It knows exactly what it wants to do and hits the target dead on at almost every single point.\n\nThat being said, I do want to mention a few faults of the game. The main secondary collectable, yarn, is used exclusively for hats, but there's a very limited number of hats in the game, yet yarn is fairly abundant. While I did a fairly thorough job of searching each level, I never felt I was ever NEEDED to. It felt excessive and just a little tacked on. By the end of the game, I had just under 20 extra yarn never used for anything, and collecting it had long since started feeling pointless, especially as the game doesn't track this collectable in any way to scratch that completionist itch of getting that pretty little \"100% Complete\" written on you game file. That being said, it doesn't detract from the game much, but for those of you who, like me, search every inch of every world and expect some reward for doing so, you'll find yourself wanting. That being said, that's the only thing I could complain about- a small, easilly ignored blemish, besides a small number of visual hiccups I experinced early on that never really detracted from the game in any real way, at least not in my experience. \n\nOver all, A Hat in Time truly feels like the best version of the collectathons we all remember through our rose-tinted childhood glasses- it takes all the good from those and mixes it well with the polish we expect of a modern game. It's short, but its incredibly sweet, and filled with an undeniable charm I doubt many can resist, and perhaps most importantly, it is a game that knows exactly what it wanted to be, and hit the nail squarely on the head. It is absolutely one of my favorite games of all time, and it was well worth the wait.", "timestamp_created": 1507355801, "timestamp_updated": 1507355918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35535009": {"recommendationid": "35535009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307903608", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512958838}, "language": "english", "review": "My god is this game filled with charm!

Or you can just obssessively slam them one after the other.

It never really stops to teach you how to play. Everything is designed simply so its easy to understand.  So even if you get momentarily confused by a boss or puzzle you can figure it out just by playing. The game just GOES. \n\nThe different hats give you flexibility with how you explore the world and fight enemies. The only hat I wish I got to use more is the Ice hat. But Swapping between hats is easy to do on the fly and the different abilities they offer are varied and fun. \n\nIf I have any nitpicks for the game most of them minor things with textures etc. (Like Hatkid says the line FIVE extra loud for some reason.)  I personally had a hard time with the 2nd boss in mafia town but I think thats just on me and not a fault of the game. But no major issues and certainly nothing that messes with the game experience overall. \n\nFor me this game also has great replay value because even after I finish all the chapters, I know I want to go back and find extra bits of story and items.

The platforming is one of the most amazing platforming I've ever seen since Banjo Kazooie and Tooie. Everything in the game relies on gameplay rather than adding in a whole bunch of messy elements and holding the player's hand through it. \n\nThere are no tutorials at all, literally. They actually managed to make a game where I don't have to worry about tutorials. I'm so fucking impressed, holy shit. Props to Gears for Breakfast for learning a lot about Game Design. I can see why this game took 4 years to make, and it was damn worth it. \n\nThe game itself is pretty short story wise, but has a WHOLE BUNCH of content like Side Missions similar to Super Mario Sunshine, and also Special Levels similar to Sunshine as well. I would recommend you to play one Level at a time, they're not only HUGE AS FUCK but hold a lot of secrets and fun little collectables.\n\nThe soundtrack is the fucking best, I couldn't help rock out to the Mafia Bosses theme and the Train Wreck of Science as well.

You can play with a Keyboard + Mouse or a Controller.\nBoth control schemes work extremely well. I personally don't think one overlaps the other.\nRight out of the box the game offers you a lot of different settings for Graphics. Some that most game developers don't even offer. Which is absolutely insane.\n\nNow onto the actual game itself..\n\nThe level design is honestly amazingly good. I loved every single level equally found found enjoyable in all of them. \nNothing else I can really add, they're just overall really nicely done. (Especially Alpine Skyline.)\nThe other thing is the music. The music is top-Notch and honestly couldn't have been done any better. \nPascal completely nailed this soundtrack. I am glad I paid the extra $10.00 because it's most certainly worth it.\nJust the love, thought and care put into this game makes it one of my absolute favorites. The boss fights, the voice acting, the art direction, it's really hard to hate anything that is in this game. I will most certainly continue to come back to it time and time again. I can't get enough. And with the Steam Workshop Support and level editor coming later this week, it'll give me more of a reason to keep playing. As well as the future updates.

It was like the combination of my all-time favorite games. It was too good to be true.\n\nI was overjoyed seeing the project's success, and every video I watched of the alpha just made me more eager to play it.\n\nEventually, I caved and bought the beta, which I loved because it respected and rewarded the player's will to explore. I could venture out into the sea of Mafia Town past its frightening robotic shark to find secrets hidden in the islands on the horizon. I could surprise myself by venturing into suspicious drain pipes and ending up in secret areas. And I had a great appreciation for how much the badges, such as the parasol and the portal, deepened gameplay.\n\nWhat made A Hat in Time so special to me wasn't the bosses or the exploding train stage. (Those were actually the weakest points of the beta for me.) What I cherished was the freedom and the thrill of discovery.\n\nThe development process on Twitter fascinated me. Chapter 4, originally called Sand 'N' Sails, particularly interested me, because it looked to be a more condensed version of the Great Sea in Wind Waker. Roaming freely in a desert looking for villages and hidden caves while staying hydrated so you don't die of heat stroke? What a cool change of pace!\n\nThe end of the beta filled me with intrigue as it hinted towards a greater story. Seeing Hat Kid grown up really made me wonder just how great a role time travel was going to have, and what connections Hat Kid might have with other characters in the story, like Mustache Girl or the terrifying Queen Vanessa.\n\nCut to release day. I'm anxious to begin. I play for 6-7 hours and beat the game with around 25 timepieces.\n\nI'd like to say I loved the game. I'd like to say that I was charmed to bits by all the silly dialogue and unique environmental details, and that each chapter was better than the last.\n\nBut I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed. The final game is missing something. Something the beta and even the alpha had.\n\nThe freedom and thrill of discovery have been neutered.\n\nThere are fewer abilities than there were in the beta, and the abilities that exist are very context-sensitive, forcing you to switch hats regularly.\nThe Time Rift areas are now inaccessible until you unlock them, and the game shows you where they are.\nThe green orbs are less fun reskins of Star Bits from Mario Galaxy in that they're sometimes required to open new missions despite being unlimited, replaceable collectibles.\nHat Kid can't swim underwater anymore, and for that matter, she can't swim much at all.\nRemember when Hat Kid could ride on fireworks? That's been ditched, too.\nThat neat and tense part of Queen Vanessa's Manor where you learn to strategically time the flashes of cameras to defeat shadows is gone.\nChapter 4 is now frustratingly streamlined for a so-called \"free roam\" chapter.\n\nIt's as if the head developer was suddenly afraid of people breaking his game or getting stuck, and he took every measure to prevent that, even if it meant ditching some really cool stuff. The game is less interesting because of it.\n\nIf there's anything I wish had been changed from the beta that wasn't, it's the absurd number of duplicate rewards that serve little to no purpose. It'd be one thing if they counted toward 100% completion, but as it stands, they're useless glowing balls that set off my Obsessive Completionist Disorder.\n\nMost of the game's \"good moments\" are purely cosmetic things, like the damages bill that steepens as you travel through Dead Bird Studios, or the friendship meter when Hat Kid and Mustache Girl high-five. Yes, these moments have their charm, but in my eyes, all they do is add some seasoning to the spoiled meat of the game.\n\nAlmost every mission in the game consists of the same few elements: bounce on tightropes, swing on grapple hook targets, and find the next platform to jump on. Beyond that, there's minimal mechanical variation, especially compared to most other games in the genre.\n\nFrankly, in the end, I don't think this game knew what it wanted to be. It tried to be too much at once, and there's a sense of dissonance as a result.\n\nFor example, there are quite a few times when the game takes a long pause, like while riding an elevator or a zip-line. They're the kinds of long pauses that are right at home in a long, casually-paced RPG, but for a relatively short, fast-paced action platformer like this, it's jarring and somewhat irritating.\n\nThere were multiple times during my playthrough when a new act would open, and I put it off because I didn't want to do it. Navigating the foggy maze of trees that is Subcon Forest was never fun to me, because everything looks the same. The penguin acts in Battle of the Birds were obnoxious and artifically lengthy. Chapter 4, which is easily the chapter I hate most, I stayed away from as much as I could due to its highly inefficient navigation system, lazy theming, and infuriating enemies.\n\nAside from a few unnatural difficulty spikes, A Hat in Time is an easy game, which is not necessarily a bad thing; but when it's \"stroll through the park\" easy, it's concerning. Hat Kid feels virtually weightless, is tight to control, and has bizarre horizonal jumping range, trivializing anything that would pose a captivating challenge with the controls of a 3D Mario game. If you do die (which happened for me when I touched hazards I couldn't even see), there's no lives system and checkpoints are frequent. There's hardly any risk versus reward to keep you on your toes.\n\nI knew in advance Chapter 5 was going to be a one-act final confrontation, and considering how impressively dark Chapter 3 is, I was expecting the game's last stand to be truly threatening. Turns out it's a hackneyed final area with a clich\u00e9d final boss fight that's all flashy effects and sappy exposition with not much of a fight. It comes out of nowhere without any buildup, too. And to top it off, the ending feels basic and incomplete. Normally this wouldn't bother me in a self-proclaimed collectathon, but A Hat in Time is more of a story-focused adventure game, so it's a shame it doesn't have any of the emotional resonance, complexity, or delicate pacing of your average story game.\n\nA Hat in Time is the first game in its genre that I don't feel inclined to revisit. Most of the replay value is the scripted kind, where the game gives you dialogue options and they might each lead to a slightly different reaction.\n\nIt might sound like I hated everything about the game, but that's not true. I started out enjoying myself, and the end boss of Chapter 3 is an honest treat and the highlight of the game. But in the end, it felt very \"manufactured\" to me and was sometimes a real chore to play.\n\nAll the beauty of this game is in its polish instead of at its core. It reeks of missed potential.\n\nIt genuinely pains my heart to say that.\n\nA Hat in Time has all the ingredients of a truly great game, but the recipe has all the wrong serving sizes, and it ultimately left a bitter taste in my mouth. I feel emptier than I would have felt if I'd just skipped it.\n\n---\n\nPeople seem to like bringing up that I prefer Yooka-Laylee, as if that somehow invalidates my criticisms.\n\nMy argument is that if you removed all of A Hat in Time's cutesy charm, you'd be left with a lot of straightforward, run-of-the-mill platforming missions with a few cool boss fights mixed in.\n\nYooka-Laylee is clearly the less polished and less detailed game, but it has all the things I think A Hat in Time lacks: gameplay variety, rewarding exploration, lots of freedom and replay value... I just find it to be a genuinely more fulfilling experience.\n\nThis isn't to say A Hat in Time is bad, but I'd only recommend it at one third of its $30 price.", "timestamp_created": 1507337502, "timestamp_updated": 1507992156, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 327, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636834", "comment_count": "31", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35530690": {"recommendationid": "35530690", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973644085", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508685314}, "language": "english", "review": "I waited 3 years for Yooka Laylee, but this game puts it to SHAME.

And noteably, the Platformer Collectathon catagory. Many a game tackles the Collectathon in different ways. But the motif that progress is made via a player's push to explore is usually the heart of it all. I discovered this game early 2016. All it took was an offhand mention from some video i was watching that somehow steered me to look it up.\n\nIt took no time at all for me to become intrigued, not immediately by the game, but by the team behind it. The charm and love they showed towards their product was more than evident, and their charisma alone is what sold the purchase. As an aspiring Game Designer myself, they reminded me exactly of the kind of team I want to be a part of some day. A team passionate about their project, with great chemistry all around. I had to now trust, that their game would reflect what i saw.\n\nI paid extra for their Beta Bundle. Not only a secured pre-order of the final product, but an extra copy for a friend. On top of that, 2 copys of the Beta Build to boot. And the cherry was 2 copys of the soundtrack. How could i resist? And wonderfully enough, their Beta Build was already out for me to enjoy. Well, i say Beta Build, while it was more of a Beta Demo. It showcased only a few levels, but still felt like there was plenty of content in it to satisfy the long wait.\n\nSo quickly did my trust in devs turn into Love for the devs. Every single inch of every level was overflowing with charm and care. The atmosphere hit it out of the park. Any flaws that would pop up, would be overshadowed imediately by the joy that sets in. Of course, that joy was strong to me since 3D Platformers have always been my favorite, but i have no doubt even those with passing interest will find smiles to be had. Of course, those of you who prefer a more serious intense, mature narrative, then theres really no point. Its openly friendly to younger audiences so if you want something hardcore, by all means skip this game. I love me a good gore filled shooter but this kind of lovelyness is something I can always appreciate.\n\nSo there i was. My confidence fully earned. I had no doubt the final product would land in my favorites. It was easy to connect the dots, and assume such a thing so early on. But only because of the sheer quality presented so far. Fast forward to Oct 5, 2017 (Yesterday). The game was out. It was time to play. And i spent the next 8-9 hours smiling from title screen to the credits. And this morning, i returned to my save file, to go back and 100% the journey. Do all the optional stuff. And just revisit the parts i loved the most. Im so releived. It was just as good as predicted. I may have missed its kickstarter years ago, but i would give anything to go back in time and donate.\n\nNow... before i go into my critiques, which will be as vague and spolier free as i can possibly make them, know that I whole heartedly recommend this game. Its great. Its a blast. And its a product im proud to say is indeed in my favorites. This next section is honestly mostly nitpicking but of course the game isnt perfect. Id hate to see the day a perfect game is made. What more could i look forward to then?\n\nChapter 1 was excellent. Top to bottom, a thrill. However, id already experienced a majority of it's levels during my time in the beta, so i knew what to expect. As a level design enthusiast, the layout of this place excites me to no end.\n\nChapter 2 ended up being my favorite. The game wastes no time after the first chapter showing you that theres plenty of formulas that work with this gameplay. I have no complaints, aside from maybe that the two levels that, well, lets say they center around a laid back penguin, felt lackluster in comparison to the two levels that center around a Irish/Scottish bird. Considering the theme of this chapter as a whole, i feel the Irish/Scottish Bird's levels embraced the concept better. The final level in this chapter however threw me by surprise, and more than flushed away the light dissapointment in the Laid Back Penguin's levels.\n\nChapter 3 is where things got strange for me. This chapter is very dark by the way. The game is friendly to younger audiences yes, but erm... hehe, i think this chapter will disturb and shock a lot of people. However, this is not the part i didnt like. In fact, i rather got a kick out that whole aspect. What perturbed me was how much of this world you can miss if you just focus the Level Objectives. Only those who go out of their way to ignore the object or come back later will experience the entirety of this environment. So much of it easily missable if youre not purposefully looking for goodies. I think this chapter could have benefited by routing your objective paths through these other areas. Aside from that, i must also take note that the main, ahem, sinister character this chapter centers around delivers the best voice performance hands down. Voiced by a youtuber/musician by the name Yungtown i beleive. Quite phenomenal. Bravo!\n\nChapter 4.... my least favorite. While personally, the sheer size of this world is cool and all, i think making it smaller would have been nice. Too many areas looked exactly the same too. Not as many landmarks as youd find in the other chapters. Which can make navigation difficult. However, regardless of it all looking similar, the asthetic itself is very pleasant and quite beautiful to look at. Its the most visually appealing chapter certainly. But while those two gripes are really minor to me, i do have a very legitimate complaint. This entire chapter felt void of any story. There was no characters to follow, no overarching plot that was interesting to follow. The chapter just sorta happens. The very little that did happen in terms of... \"plot\" was strangely confusing. If anything it felt like i caused it to happen in the first place, and its resolution just sorta happened as well. The two main inhabitants of this world desperately need fleshing out, and dialogue with the player. 1 of these species doesnt speak at all. The other main inhabitants dont ever talk to you. I mean, they have voice lines, that are really cute by the way, but they dont... TALK to you. The extent of a conversation is usually \"Hey your objective is in that direction....\" and thats it. I wish there was more active plot. But oh well, at least the platforming sections were rather fun.\n\nChapter 5, le finale. Aaaand i was honestly indifferent to it. I dunno. If anything, a bit dissapointing. Very by the books ending. I expected a little more creativity considering my experience up to this point. Seeing such clever takes on everything throughout my journey up till then made the standardish ending feel... i dunno, just sorta dull. Well done for what it is, but not creative enough.\n\nAnd that wraps it up nicely. Thankfully looking back, any negatives i had towards the game were either heavily overshadowed by all the awesome, or not even worth noting to begin with. Even with my critique of chapter 4, i still enjoyed it regardless. The things that did shine about it, more than made up for it. So yes, i love this game. I wont leave a rating or anything, as rating systems are riddiculous anyways, i leave you with a very, very strong recommendation. You will either love it, or really like it.

It matches it's own description of being a  \"cute-as-heck 3D platformer\" and still manages to pull ahead an possibly become one of my favorite 3D platformers of all time. As a longtime fan of games such as Super Mario 64/Sunshine and Donkey Kong 64; I can say for certain that A Hat In Time (AHiT) manages to encapsulate the essence of those games while still remaining unique on it's own rights. \n\nThe game does a fantastic job of creating large open ended mission based levels which engulfs you into those worlds and makes you want to wander off the beaten path and search through every nook and cranny for whatever secrets may be in the world. Either in the form of a collectible or a sly quip from one of the many characters that fill the large worlds of AHiT or simply to go off and jump and dive around the various areas of the worlds, AHiT's levels always seem to be briming with content and character.\n\nAs an aside, this doesn't mean the game isn't without flaws. One of the most jarring things to me personally is the voice acting. Not even that it is bad in general, just that there are some bad voice actors, especially in the beginning of the game from a certain mustachioed character. The rest of the voice actors do some fine work and as always the game has plenty of ways to ignore that either through simply disabling dialogue from the audio settings to buying the mumble badge that gives all the characters a Banjo-Kazooie-esque mumble sound. This game did do the mumbles very well mind you, unlike yooka-laylee's forced mumble that to be fair was quite horrid. \n\nAnother negative thing about the game would probably be the graphical fidelity of the game in terms of the character models. Some just don't look too good in and of themselves. The Mafia is a model that I may find in an older ps2 game or a very early xbox 360 game which looks jarring in comparison to the decent models on almost everything else. Thankfully the game's aesthetic does make up for it's shortcomings graphics wise thanks to the almost The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker artstyle that makes the game feel very stylistcally sound and makes it a real beauty to look at.\n\nOverall I would have to give this game a 9/10. I deeply enjoy most of the game. I adore the characters, I love the platforming and the levels for me are wonderfully constructed and I feel as if they had a lot of love put into them. The game does have some flaws and I do feel like they stop me from giving it another half a point or more. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507330445, "timestamp_updated": 1507330445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35529172": {"recommendationid": "35529172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027362114", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507580304}, "language": "english", "review": "Great platformer, spiritual successor to [name your childhood 3d platformer here]", "timestamp_created": 1507330075, "timestamp_updated": 1507330075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35528982": {"recommendationid": "35528982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058792875", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509632932}, "language": "english", "review": "So I was an undercover detective on a train ride and this sketchy crow in a brown coat asked me what part of my body I hated the most.\n\nThe prompt requested 6 letters, so naturally I typed in the name for the female reproduction organ.\n\nI was then rewarded with an achievement called \"Why\" with the description \"just... why... ?\"\n\n\nIf I ever meet the devs, I'll take them to a bar and buy them some beers.", "timestamp_created": 1507329317, "timestamp_updated": 1507385281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419569", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35528901": {"recommendationid": "35528901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056395543", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508349894}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fantastic. \nFeels like a gamecube platformer like mario sunshine or wario world brought into the modern era with perfect controlled, fast and precise platforming and fun exploration. \n", "timestamp_created": 1507329029, "timestamp_updated": 1507329029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35528891": {"recommendationid": "35528891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061178854", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "last_played": 1514314191}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been a part of this since Pre-Alpha, It's finally out!!!

A Hat in Time is about taking what you loved from 3D platformers, and cutting out what you didn't, and adding a whole lot more variety to make every single mission unique and memorable. While the game is a bit on the short side in terms of the base game, the A Hat in Time's 2 DLC chapters and workshop support should totally satisfy your craving.\n\nWhile the game is short, it also doesn't have any filler. At all. Not a single mission that was there to fill time or pad out the game. You're constantly somewhere you haven't been, doing something you haven't done, with new set pieces and fantastic music to make that experience unique.\n\nIn short, A Hat in Time is a game with it's own personality and goals, and it's almost certain to make you have a fun time.

While the game is still extrodinary it is far from perfect, with some major and some minor issues to be found, or maybe my expectations were too high.To anyone reading this, some parts are filled with overexaduration to further highlight the issues, i do not actually think THAT Negatively. Because im a negative nelly, i will start with the dissapointments.\n1. The Characters / Story or \"The Mafia, The Bad, and the Moustache Girl\"\n1.1 The Pathetic Excuse of a Villain \n*Spoilers?* After The Act 3 Of Mafia Town, Moustache Girl Ditches you, pickpocketing half of your money and goes on her quest to get time pieces herself. Do you see her doing anything? Does she ever meddle with you trying to get your time pieces? Yes, once. and its just there to set up the lackluster finale. It Wouldve been nice to have Moustache girl atleast interfere with you in some ways atleast once per chapter, because otherwise it seems like she just died offscreen, in the hall of villains that couldve been good. \n1.2 The Story, Beta To Full Release.\nNow, i myself dont own the beta, i missed out on backing it, however, The Beta Had signs of a much more fleshed out story such as : The Mafia boss knowing about the time pieces. The Ending After The Beta Hero challenge, with a grown up hat kid in what looks like victorian london. What happens to that? Scrapped it seems. I get it that a game\u00b4s story goes through many phases but it has just been dumbed down to oblivion. there are no questions you have, Ever. \"Why does the mafia boss know what the time pieces are?\" was a thing i was dieing to find out in the full release, only to find the story to be on the same level as an IOS App. \n1.3 Characters, From charming to boring.\nAgain, ill have to bring up the beta, but Beta Snatcher messed with you towards the end of the mansion, which agreeable would make no sense in the current story, and the puzzle was admittably tedious, however, we dont get to see much of his character anyways, somewhat of a letdown. \nMoustache Girl, dramatically underused. you almost forget she exists.\nThe Mafia, they kept their charm, but you cant mess those amazing guys up.\nQueen Vanessa , Underutilized but for that i dont blame you, she really was a minor character but had quite a bit of potential.\nMoonjumper , Was Scrapped pretty damn early but a powerstruggle between vanessa him and snatcher wouldve been interesting, snatchy using you to tip the scales in his favor.\nMafia Boss , Again, his story got dumbed down.\nThe Conductor and DJ Grooves , Not much to say about them really, i never did like em anyways.\nRoomba , The Single best story change, the roomba is the most amazing thing in the universe\n2. The Feeling of Accomplishment, or \"Just The Normal Ammount of Empty Inside\"\nThis point is very nitpicky, and its kinda just picking up on the grown up hatkid thing again, but i was dissapointed because of the lack of a 40 TP reward. You get a hat. and its not even the best looking one. And its funny that its the regular hat, because that one points you to the nearest time piece, which you got all of. Atleast Something else wouldve been nice G4B. Additionally i dont feel motivated solving small puzzles (which there werent really a lot of) to open a chest to find...wool...woohoo...wool.\n3. Chapter 4.  or \"Sky High above Fun\"\nI just didnt like it. i wasnt a fan of the layout. im gonna admit that this is 100% my personal biased opinion instead of imposing flaws on it. Also, the lack of a bossfight.\n4. Gameplay Balance and Smoothness of Combat or \"Broken Prance\"\n4.1 Foreword\nThe Game may not be focused on combat, however certain badges and other things should still be mentioned.\n4.2 Issues\nThere Are a Few issues with the combat, but ill focus on the ones that arent me just sucking\nIssue 1 : The \"Projectile\" Badge. it isnt very usefull, its actually more of a hinderance when you accidnetally activate it and get killed, because you thought it was a cool badge, newsflash, it aint. Though it was fun using another beam to counter-beam the final boss\u00b4 final phase.\nIssue 2 : The \"TIME STOP\" hat or \"Timepiece Crusaders Ep. 45, Hatkid\u00b4s WORLD\"\nOne thing i didnt like was that its called time stop and not time slow, small nitpick\nadditionally, it is an instant win for bosses. especially on the final one. its ok for it to be a good usefull hat, but in puzzles it was rarelly \"needed\" and was really just a nice addition making puzzles Easier. Also, does that thing even have skins?\nCombine it with Fast Hatter and you can beat the girl with a testosterone defficiency into a pulp.\nWhat im trying to say here is \"Pls Nerf\" as silly as it sounds, to do such a thing in a single player game, but it needs an overhaul cause it feels genuinely tacked on as a last minute addition\nIssue 3 : Lack Of Enemy Variety. You need more enemy types for a game, man. not just 4 recolours of birds.\n5. The Overworlds & General Gripes\n5.1 The Pickup futility\nLook G4B, i appreciate you give me the wool i need, but i dont quite think that making 50% of all pickups on the map into wool is a good idea. Jokes Aside, i dont feel motivated searching areas for pickups that i dont need and dont need for 100%. Most Relic Boxes Only contain rift tokens due to the next point.\n5.2 Underutilization of the Relic System. \nAs much as i hate padding the game with countless same-y pickups, atleast two sets of relics wouldve been nice instead of just 4, they genuinely intrigued me about what they could do. The Second set wouldnt even need to be one of the purple (really well done) time rifts. it could just be something stupid and cosmetic.\n6. The Good Stuff\nNow that youve listened to me ramble on about things i probably dont understand, lts get to the stuff done well\n6.1. The Visuals. A Perfect, cute cartoony style that fits all enviorments and is allways well done.\n6.2. The Platforming and exploring, A perfectly well made thing. Though id have prefered a few time pieces to be hidden in the enviorment behind puzzles instead of them all being inside of rifts or acts. Generally, allways pefectly solid even in my least favorite chapter, chapter 4.\n6.3 The OST. its Friggin Art.\n6.4 Controls, near perfect. Though sometimes the scooter feels like a downgrade from the sprint\n6.5 The Hat Powerup System overall. the hats feel like organic upgrades to the character instead of only existing to deal with certain switches or something, except for the case of the ice hat which i still love to bits.\n6.6 The Hat Skins & Colours. They look dope.\n6.7 The existance of the camera badge. its a great addition not many studios would care about, probs to you G4B\n7. [b] Conclusion [/b]\nI Like this game a lot, i intend on getting all the achievements and i will stay interested in anything that develops. Its a Good First Game of hopefully many from this developer.Although i was dissapointed by a few things,I Reccomend it, but id also reccomend waiting for a steam sale cause 30 dollars is a bit too much. Overall a 7.3/10. Additionally, Superior to yooka laylee in every way.\nEdit : I had completely forgotten about the two bonus chapters, which may fix some issues with the story i had, but they also may not.", "timestamp_created": 1507323715, "timestamp_updated": 1507331588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35527539": {"recommendationid": "35527539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040699856", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509197024}, "language": "german", "review": "Like Nier:Automata, but in cute\nActually more heartwarming and happy", "timestamp_created": 1507323560, "timestamp_updated": 1507324240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35527472": {"recommendationid": "35527472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050545075", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511516905}, "language": "english", "review": "Great controls, great level design, great music, great dialogue.

I felt like a kid again. Not enough cute hats to wear. I need more cute hats.\n\nVisuals: The art is charming and the worlds are unique and vibrant. Plenty of background details for those who decide to explore each level (you should). Conductor is the best, followed by Snatcher and the not-G-Men C.A.W. agents.\n\nMusic: Phenomenal. Hard to pick a favorite track, but a solid OST (the devs said they had to exclude some tracks because the OST was getting huge, so hopefully they release that later -- go bug them about it).\n\nGameplay: Controls are tight, simple, and fun to play with. Takes the best parts of Super Mario Sunshine's platforming and expands on them. You'll be dashing, sliding, and double-jumping and dash cancelling into a wall run/jump from the moment you pick up the game. Only gripe is that the platforming is too easy. Even the secret worlds a la Sunshine are easy. There's also a lot of beta content that was cut, even though it was interesting. It's probably up to modders to restore this, since the devs don't seem interested in expanding on what they had. Hopefully the mod tools are easy to use, so that we get more fan-made levels. Two additional worlds, co-op, and Steam workshop \"soon\"\u2122. The second half of the game does seem like it was focused on less than the first half, but I still had fun.\n\nStory: Sorta whatever. Mustache Girl is almost a non-character for most of the game. There's some \"lore\", but it seems to be a joke by the devs. Don't worry about the story too much.\n\nTechnical: Models need a bit more polish. A few glitches here and there that haven't affected gameplay for me, but the hit detection has failed me a few times when going to grab onto a platform (extremely rare -- this only happened to me on Dead Bird Studio's time rift, with the pipes that you have to grab onto and sort of wall jump off of). Also, the checkpoint system that saves you from accidentally falling off a platform onto an area below (great feature, saves you from having to climb all the way back up) is sometimes a little oversealous (only happened twice -- Dead Bird Studio's basement act, where you have to jump off a pipe onto a duct to get a yarn was impossible for me because it kept resetting, and one island in Alpine where it kept thinking I was falling even though I made deliberate jumps to skip sections of the map and wouldn't have died).\n\nIf anyone bothers reading all of that, you should pick this up if you want a solid (albeit tragically short) platformer. A shame that this ended up being released near Cuphead and Mario Odyssey, this is a good game that will probably have to survive on word of mouth amidst these two storms.", "timestamp_created": 1507309440, "timestamp_updated": 1507729939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35523157": {"recommendationid": "35523157", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988356604", "num_games_owned": 701, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1513875138}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is too cute. \n\nThe atmosphere is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the game play is amazing.\n\nSeriously, This is like Mario 64, Mario Sunshine and Zelda Wind Waker had a cute lil' time travelling baby that has smooch powers!\n\nThis is worth your money, every cent of it.

Delete all the mods (folders) except for \"Steam Workshop\", then restart the game. Also sometimes (sometimes means 90% of the time) when a mod is updated, you won't receive the update. If it happens then just do what I mentioned earlier (delete the mod folders), and all mods should be updated instantly.\n\n2. If you're trying to launch the game and it says \"A Hat in Time has stopped working\", then do one of the following:\n\n- Uninstall and after that reinstall the game (DON'T FORGET TO BACK UP YOUR SAVE FILES, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT)\n- Delete all the mod folders (and don't forget to unsubscribe from the mods in \"Steam Workshop\")\n\n3.

This game is also not like \"Yooka-Laylee\" where you're going to look at the characters and think \"Oh, it's kinda like Banjo-Kazooie\" or \"Oh, it's kinda like Mario\" right?

In each of these acts you can collect \"relics\" that allow you to unlock secret missions, as well as yarn to create more hats, along with the obligatory hourglasses, that are this game's equivalent of Mario 64's stars, acquired through completion of map objectives.\n\nThis game's tone is very lighthearted, with some genuinely good humor (exceedingly rare in gaming nowadays) and some funny characters, though not all of them are paritcularly memorable or good.\n\nIf I had to voice some complaints though:\nThe game is a bit buggy, I've not finished it yet and have gotten stuck on terrain on multiple times, having to restart the level (thankfully, all progress is saved instantly, meaning that any pick up you find is permanently yours, whether or not you finished a map objective).\nThe camera needs a bit of work, it's fine in open spaces, but in tight corridtors it can go crazy, and also sometimes it just moves in a way that really messes with your ability to jump accurately, at one point I even turned off the automatic camera because it was too much to deal with.\nThe music is very hit or miss. Some of the levels have some great music, while others have music that was just annoying as hell to me, to the point where I turned it off. But this is an entirely subjective complaint and I suspect different people are gonna have different mileage.\n\nOverall, the game is very, very good.

It's surprisingly small for a game like this and runs smoothly despite my laptop not working as well as a proper PC. The designs are incredible and I felt a joy wandering around the worlds, finding secrets and collectives. The story is also solid and has a humour that made me giggle multiple times. Unlike some other platformers I've played, I feel the controls to be very responsive. I was worried of this the moment I started the game,  but I found it runs smoothy even by using keyboard!\n\nI absolutely adore the voice acting and the marvelous character designs. They are one of the most unique ones I've seen in a while, which each one brings personality. The hats also are very well done, and I love the addons or 'skins' you can get for them as well. Their abilities don't feel too over powered, nor underpowered. They feel balanced. \n\nMy main problems are that there are things that aren't polished, things like text moving outside of text boxes and countless glitches, which so far have only once made me start over the level because I got stuck between walls. I also found the Mafia boss on world 1 be extremelly tiresome because of the 'Mafia ball' being glitchy. Not only did you get hit often when you were trying to get on top of it, you also got stuck often in a way that you are unable to hit the boss. \n\nUpdate: I've now encountered a massive game-breaking glitch in chapter 2 finale in the boss. After a specific character does a thrust with a knife and goes for a new type of attack ( I assume), My camera glitched and so did the others. I couldn't die, so my only choice was to exit the level, only to find that I have to go through the same frustrating platform level to get to the boss.

Due to some silly shenanigans involving the mafia on a planet she's passing, her ship crashes and her 40 hourglasses spread across the planet. She goes off to collect them all, meeting a colorful cast of characters along the way. The game's story isn't going to win any awards, but I've been surprised how much I've enjoyed it thus far. The characters are voice acted, & so far the voice acting is pretty good (there's also a badge you can equip which makes them to 'mumble' speak if you wish... more on badges in a bit).A few of the characters I've already come to love, plenty have time to let you come to know them & find them likable or not. I also appreciate the game's villain angle, everything is kind of a gray area in the game. The good guys aren't wholly good, the bad guys aren't wholly bad. Hat Kid actually doesn't seem to care about good vs evil, there's a do-gooder who has a morale high-ground of sorts & can't understand why Hat Kid doesn't want to use her hourglases for good, but Hat Kid just wants her hourglasses back. The bosses you face aren't strictly because they're the bad guys, just they're in your way to collect your hourglasses back. Motives for the bosses so far often have to do with wanting the hourglasses to go back in time & undo a mistake in their past, something they'll do anything to change rather than because they're evil, which I find an interesting dynamic. I don't know obviously if the story holds up all the way through yet, but I like it for what it is so far.\n\nGame has a hub world, which is Hat Kid's ship. The ship loses power & needs the hourglasses to restore it. Get more hourglasses, & more of the ship unlocks as well as access to a new world becomes available to play. The hub world is fun to explore & gets more added to it over time, including patrons who decide to board & do small things for you (ranging from allowing you to switch music in stages to selling you something or just loitering with flavor text). Out of the many collectibles in the game are souvenirs you can find (split into pieces though), which you bring back to your ship & you organize on one of a few pedestals (you have to manually stack them though). If you complete a souvenir, you unlock a new bonus level in one of the stages you can then access, which includes a harder than usual level with collectible pictures that give you a picturebook story (no text, all pictures though) of the backgrounds of the characters who live there.\n\nSpeaking of collectibles, the collectibles here are well done, which works well for a collectathon. Every one is linked to something, there's no 'useless' collectible. Green orbs you get everywhere is your main currency, which you can use at a shopkeeper to buy new badges, to buy some new missions in levels, & some other misc things. There's different types of yarn you can collect, which gives you different hats. The hats all give you different powers, & you can change them on the fly with the d-pad or choose one from a menu of hats that slows down times. The hats abilities range from letting you speed forward, doing a statue-esque ground pound, an aura which makes certain transparent objects appear, & more. You also can collect customizable looks for your hats, as well as different colors for your main character.\n\nThere's also badges, which are kind of your power-ups in the game. You buy them from the store mostly, but some you get from other means. At the start of the game you can only equip one badge, but there's two upgrade slots you can buy from the shop to equip three badges total. Badges do everything from giving you a grappling hook to decreasing hat ability charge time to a map showing you where nearby souvenirs are, among many other things. You can change them on the fly in the middle of the level whenever you like, & they're fun to mess around with & think what's best for a situation. And then of course, the main goal of the game is to collect back your 40 hourglasses.\n\nI feel the game's controls are going to have some mixed reactions, but I actually REALLY like them. They're a bit floatier than some platformers, & some may have different preferences here to me, but once you begin to get a handle on them you can do some crazy stuff. They can do a great job at making you kind of feel like you're parkouring, as you can run up walls for a short time, wall jump, slide to go faster, dash in the air, do a double jump, & you can begin combo-ing these things like jump, double jump while in the air, dash in the air ahead, hit a wall, wall jump off the wall, dash in the air again & do a double jump off that dash. It also can combo well into the other abilities you begin to get, like the running ability can run up walls a bit higher (as faster), or the grappling hook can chain very well into things. One ability I was not expecting at all is kind of a homing attack similar to Sonic, where if you're close enough to an enemy in the air you can press the attack button to dash towards them in the air as a homing strike. It's not all very complex, but well handled in my opinion, I personally really like the movement & almost parkour element the game has sometimes.\n\nAll of this wouldn't matter if the game wasn't fun, which at least I think it's insanely fun. The missions are very creative with a lot of twists & turns. I don't want to speak too much in-depth here, but there's a LOT of variety of what you're doing. The game shows all sorts of inspirations everywhere in its worlds & missions, & has its own set of unique twists on each one. The game is the sort of game where one level is a murder mystery on a train & you're collecting suspects while avoiding being caught, to a previously fine island level being loaded with lava and having to maneuver in a whole new way due to the change, to a sort of Luigi's Mansion/Resident Evil/Amnesia hybrid horror level, to a level where you rush to go from press meet to press meet trying to become a diva & get your reputation up by publicity stunts, or going behind the scenes of a studio in a segment that almost has tinges of something like Portal. There's a lot that happens, & then in what happens there's a lot of twists within the twists, & a lot of cleverly timed and amusing jokes & surprises.The game never loses its identity through this, but you end up going through a large variety of scenarios, & different kinds of stages (the main kind of stages are kind of open-world playgrounds that Collectathoners may know, something akin to Mario 64/Sunshine esque style, but there's some very different other types of levels, including these challenge levels that heavily remind me of Mario Sunshine, more linear affairs or sub-areas in the levels with their own flavor & level design).\n\nI've fought two bosses so far. The bosses in this game are surprisingly not that easy, they take like 20-30 hits before they die & have multiple phases. The second boss I fought I REALLY liked, so much so I won't spoil it.\n\nMusic is fantastic, it has some stand-out tracks but all of it I've heard so far is quite good. There's also several variations of most themes which kick in during different gameplay moments, which does amp up & do what's intended.\n\nI need to see if this game falls apart in the second half of the game, & I won't claim everyone will love it as much as I have so far, but this I think is going to be a top five Collectathon title for me. It has made me smile on multiple occasions, I've had a lot of fun with its mechanics, surprises, level design, missions, characters, and collecting.", "timestamp_created": 1507281862, "timestamp_updated": 1507389769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 169, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.907429", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35514043": {"recommendationid": "35514043", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960391620", "num_games_owned": 2039, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507243941}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played a handful of levels including the first couple of boss fights and I must say that despite the relatively high production values with full voice acting, cut scenes, little details and context animations alongside tons of unique art assets, it leaves a lot to be desired. The controls don't feel quite tight and fun enough although they technically work and aren't a hindrance to the gameplay objectives. Especially the overall combat and boss battle mechanics are very lacking in feel. It's not nearly as polished as I'd expect (or as polished as the games it's inspired by) and I actually found myself enjoying far lower budget efforts like \"Skylar & Plux\" and especially \"Poi\" (both are on Steam so look them up if you're into this sort of game) a lot more personally. This probably has a lot more content (and a higher price of course) but when the core feel isn't as fun as I'd like that doesn't mean much. Overall I'd say A Hat in Time seems to be about on par with Yooka-Laylee to me (so, underwhelming for most but the die hard fans) when all is said and done, although this is more impressive given the smaller and more technically amateur team I guess. Perhaps some patches will resolve my main issues but I don't know if they'd even agree that there are issues at all, perhaps that's just how they meant for it to be designed and consider it a total success in that aspect.

I've run into a couple of major glitches so far, such as one that is similar to the backward long-jump in Mario 64, but none of these have made my enjoyment of the game any less. \n\nThe actual gameplay is pretty simple. Its style is nothing new, but it acts more like an amalgamation of several great platforming games. Many of the controls and interactions feel like Mario Sunshine and the style of the power-ups feels a lot like those from Banjo-Tooie. \n\nI have a butt-ton of games in my library and because of this, I don't usually spend too much time on a single game.

I managed to keep myself from any spoilers whatsoever (other than the one that he spoiled about the antagonist almost immediately after creating her) by not watching any videos of the beta or alpha builds that were out. So, now that I've got my hands on the game, what do I think about it? I think it's pretty good so far. The music is creative and fun to listen to, the characters are of an interesting and entertaining design, the gameplay is pretty solid and reminiscent of Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario Galaxy, and a hint of the developer's mod for Team Fortress 2 that he developed, \"Parkour Fortress.\" I haven't gotten a chance to check out too many of the levels so far, but I'm having a lot of fun. I would like to make a note, though, at the time of writing this review, I had noticed a number of simple yet noticeable glitches that are in the game. Firstly, and this is the most major one, if you walk into some objects and then open up the hat selection menu, hat kid will start floating up into the air and clip above the ceiling. So far, this hasn't caused any problems, as the walls seem to extend up infinitely, but it's definitely something that should be taken note of. Secondly, I found that during the first level of the game, when moustache girl asks you to climb up to her and the game shows you the button that allows you to do so, if you instead climb up the rock face onto the construction site-esque building next to you, and then double jump + slide from the edge to reach the top of the belltower that moustache girl is in, she won't move, as, for some reason, the developers didn't think that the player would find their own way of making it up to the top and didn't include a backup trigger or even a simple temporary player clip so that this could be avoided.\nIn conclusion, I'm liking the game so far and think it's been worth the 5 year wait watching it be developed, even though the game has a number of day 1 bugs. Also, tell people if you're going to include a pack that has the game bundled with the soundtrack for less than both individually, I bought the two seperately at the same time and I could've saved a few bucks :p.\np.s.

Hat Kid controls like a dream and simple additions like dive cancelling result in more fluid and controllable platforming. Everything about the game is a marvel, including the OST which is worthy of a purchase.\n\nThat being said the game is lacking levels overall and while it has no bad or annoying missions, things like delivering mail are just too boring that they really stand out. I'd take this over actually annoying sections but it's not desirable over all. As you keep playing you'll see each level have less and less content which is disheartening. Despite the game being in development for 4,000 years, it does feel rushed. The game only has 4 proper levels for example.\n\nAlso to get the obligatory Yooka Laylee comparisons out of the way, the games aren't similar, there is no real need to compare them (yet people won't shut up about this). Yooka was trying to be Banjo, meanwhile A Hat In Time was deliberately aiming to be more original and clearly took more influence from Mario titles like 64 and Sunshine than any Rareware title. Both are fun games, though I'd still recommend this overall.

And this beta is sitting on my desk for review, so I'm like, yeah man I'll write something. \n\nBut I don't know. I'm like, so this is about time travel or some noise? That's fine, I'm sure that's like fucking dynamite in a handbag for some brosephs. But all I'm saying is, when do you get to *thrash* anything? While you're playing with hourglasses or some shit, are you ever in jeopardy of getting mud on your dress or whatever from busting out, and I quote, \"the mad stunts all wicked up-ins\"?\n\nKnow what I'm saying, Bro-Yo Ma? I didn't actually play this game, but I gave it 1.5 hats out of 5 hats to keep it real. \n\nAt this point I'd like to give a shout out to my boy Dennis who was over the other day. We were going to chill in front of Suicide Squad and he was so psyched of it y'all.\n\nSo this one time he was leaning against the screen door and the shit popped open, and the back deck was wet and he slipped down the steps and broke his thumb on the lawn. It wasn't a long fall, but hey I guess a thumb bone wasn't made for supporting the brunt of a huge useless tool against wet grass.

Its rare that I even want to play the same game for longer than an hour, so its something else when this game kept me stuck to it constantly and had me thinking solely about the next time I would get to play.\n\nAs it stands, the only issue I have with this game still is that I cant play it at the proper resolution and get that crisp HD. And thats it. The atmosphere of this game is just perfect, each chapter is an adventure all of its own and shows just the raw love and hard work that went into making this game. Every time you select a level, you get the good Mario Sunshine showing you the basic idea of the level, and the objective. Is it nolstagic? Yes, but is it still good? Hell yes.\n\nControlling Hat Kid is just like, what, how- Honestly I havent had controls this good on my character since Super Meat Boy. At first, it can get be a little wonky, but the moment you get it, that moment of 'Aha!' it just fits and works so perfectly. Its percise and fun to use and gives so many options while maintaining the simple concept but also adding a layer of skill and extra thought that can be used.\n\nThe camera isnt half bad. It definitely isnt bad on its own, but ever so often theres segments where it locks itself into a place or angle - And then it can start to freak out, but even then I never found it to be too frustrating to use.\n\nTo be honest, I really hope everyone read down this far because this is the most important part of the game, and my last point: The charm. I havent seen a game so... Damn, I cant even find the word - Mystical? Amazing? Immersive? - Im not really sure what the proper word is. The characters are so full and unique, the locations are impressive and fun to explore, even Hat Kid, this mostly-mute little girl is just bursting with fluid motion and emotion.\n\n30$ is a little expensive for a game, yes. Usually I go by the rule that for each dollar I paid I should get an hour of gameplay in return. But this game is an exception - Because one hour of gameplay is just so full, so constantly exciting and fun, that the experience is worth more than one dollar. Im sure Im going to get a good 10 hours out of 100% this game and so many more from replaying it and just enjoying it.

Smaller things like mouths not moving during cutscenes - although this is likely a key design choice which I understand and respect, although it gives off that older style of genre that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nVery straight forward story as to why you're collecting stuff in the first place creating for a stale and dull game play, meaning I'm not given a reason to be attached to the character's story at all. \n\nThe game's controls are very wonky and feel out of place. It's almost like I'm playing an older game from the ps1 era with how jank the camera work is. Alongside very clunky fighting mechanics and almost \"brain-dead\" like game play for the first 30ish minutes. \n\nThere was no reason for me to continue playing after the \"tutorial\". There's no indicator as to whether or not I can do X or Y actions at the start of the game. I'm just put into the game. The only bit of a tutorial you're given is that you can double jump if you decide to talk to an NPC early on. On top of the clunky controls you're thrown into the game and baby sat without being told how to actually play. \n\nAs far as progress in the game goes it's very straight forward and simple. It was probably intended for younger audiences unfortunately it has an issue of not having a straight path from Point A to Point B. It seems very easy to get lost in this game and be overwhelmed, almost like a free roam Wind Waker with broader, more expansive and more fleshed out map design.\n\nThe map design seems fantastic, unfortunately it feels out of place as stated above. You're given little direction as to where to go, even cutscenes don't aid you that well.\n\nFor being given 1/3 of a million backed up on this game it's team did put hard effort into this game I'm sure, unfortunately it lacks a lot of elements and contains a lot of issues that make me not want to play this game - even after backing it since day 1. \n\nI'd rate the game (30 minutes worth I guess?) a 2/10.\n\nAnother major turn-off was the price to game ratio. $30 game that I expected to be around $15-20 due to the length and how much effort was put into it as a kickstarter project.", "timestamp_created": 1507248936, "timestamp_updated": 1507252145, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.075735", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35506382": {"recommendationid": "35506382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019698222", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510366978}, "language": "english", "review": "Ever wondered who would win in a fight?\nThe Entire Mafia or a 5 Year Old Girl?", "timestamp_created": 1507248844, "timestamp_updated": 1507248844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601167", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35506381": {"recommendationid": "35506381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183291074", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507483164}, "language": "english", "review": "buy it, you won't regret it", "timestamp_created": 1507248841, "timestamp_updated": 1507248841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35506352": {"recommendationid": "35506352", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960422475", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508387872}, "language": "english", "review": "It's cute.\nIt looks and runs great.\nThe music is super nice.\nControls are spot-on.\nExploration is fun!\nThere are hats!

While this may seem like a good thing, if you happen to notice a secret goodie you missed on your way up, you have to backtrack down, you can't just jump down to take a shortcut.

The level of detail found throughout the world is absolutely astounding. The gameplay is very reminiscent of Mario's early forays into 3D-platforming with chapter based encounters. There are a current total of five unique chapters, which are mostly large environments, just oozing with charm. A huge, fishy town controlled by the Mafia! A spooky, mysterious forest! Even a crazy, western train! Feeling nostalgic? Same. \n\nPROS \n\n+ Precise controls and an intuitive move-set gives the protagonist an unparalleled sense of \nmovement and acrobatic prowess. \n\n+ Stunning visuals that perfectly blend sixth generation sensibilities with modern resolution/lighting/particle effects. \n\n+ The soundtrack. Geez. This soundtrack. \n\nCONS \n\n- Some collision issues and general glitches. Nothing detrimental. Some of it has actually been rather funny. \n\n- The difficulty spikes when it comes to bosses. Not going to spoil anything, and perhaps this issue is just because I am not great as I think I am. But, the sudden rise was jarring. \n\nOverall, A Hat in Time is a game that keeps on giving. From speed-running, easter eggs, developer console, steam workshop, and the later to be added, 6th and 7th bonus chapters, multiplayer, in-game level editor, developer commentary. Buying the game right now at $29.99 is a no-brainer. \n\nEnjoy the hell out of it now, revisit again in the future with even MORE content. Or, continue to play it while the Workshop keeps receiving content from dedicated fans...

this game, but, as many others have stated, you will HAVE to turn the difficulty down on the bots unless you are VERY familiar with similar fighting games and are able to exactly press (NEVER spam) controller buttons, or play very well with a keyboard (for some reason I can press the buttons on the controller (wired XBox 360) and get a 50/50 response after a couple hits (unless you are VERY careful about exactly when you press the buttons, it seems to act as if there's a delay of about 100ms after most button presses, which can *easily* wreck your combos if you spam) but this issue is not present with keyboard, from my brief combo testing). \n\nThe art aesthetic is the main draw (for me, anyways), and the combat system allows for skill and growth to most definitely be major factors. However, unless you can fairly capably beat Normal difficulty or better, you really should stay away from online fights; you will be destroyed. A lot. This game has definitely drawn its number of skilled players, and it makes most fights against them very one-sided. This wouldn't be much of a problem, except that they reward winners with salt, while losers get nothing, and you need salt to get cosmetic items from the salt mines, which you *also* can't even enter without salt. At least *most* of the players are sportsmanlike, but the ones that you come closest to beating (who also lose to everyone else) will more than likely spam-taunt you and abuse your/your character's weaknesses to the point of rage.\n\nFurthermore, I seem to be finding glitches that crash my game or make me spazz out pretty bad online (no crashes, glitches, or jerkiness offline, from my experience), which, combined with my lack of proper experience with 2D combo-based fighters such as this, inclines me to avoid online in its entirety for the time being. The single-player currently just consists of Training and Arcade at the moment, and they're adding a Story Mode, which I will be very glad for, as well as at least one more character, so, while I recommend this game to both fighter fans and fans of the artstyle, I think I'll be only occassionally playing this game until the Story Mode is in (Arcade gets fairly stale after about 10-20 times, and being beaten to a pulp too fast to even see where to improve or getting tilted doesn't strike my fancy, either). \n\nOf course, if you have friends that will also play this game with you, that definitely would change the whole online experience, so be sure to take that into account, as well. \n\nTL;DR: It's a great game, but most average players will have to start off slow and really hone their skills to get the most out of this game before they add Story Mode, unless they have friends who enjoy both fighters and Lauren Faust's artstyle.", "timestamp_created": 1521512202, "timestamp_updated": 1521512202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40929723": {"recommendationid": "40929723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263390568", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 552, "last_played": 1521405109}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome graphics, smooth movesets, and lots and lots of fun to be had in this game! highly reccomend it to anyone who likes fighting games and has 15 bucks.", "timestamp_created": 1521504684, "timestamp_updated": 1521504684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40921577": {"recommendationid": "40921577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079089314", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "last_played": 1521470948}, "language": "schinese", "review": "to whom it may concern,\n\nI am a chinese fan of my little pony who dedicated his passion on Fighting is Magic and have been waiting for TFH to come out for long.

arcade mode.\n\nThis is an indie fighting game, powered by Skullgirl's engine. The original name of the project was My Little Pony: Fighting Is Magic. An fan made game based on [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic]My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic[/url]. They sadly had to stop the project, renamed it and change the characters, that's why the game was delayed. So, what we can find after those changes? A good fighting game, powered by the most interesting and latest 2D fighting game engine created by Lab 0 for Skullgirls.\n\nThe main system of the game is close to Blazblue. 3 attacks levels (light, medium, strong attacks) and a 4th button for chara spec abilities. I don't remember abilities since I don't play enough, but the cow can throw a losso, the unicorn can charge the super bar, ect...\n\nWait, did I speak about cow and unicorn in  a fighting game? Yes, they change My Little Pony's characters for 4 feet animals. That sounds logical indeed, but there is the originality of the game. Your hitbox is very different of others games, and you have to keep it in mind for your spacing.\n\nThe only bad things are the soft feels unfinished yet, but it's an early access so this can change in future patches. Some animations are missing, sound can be delayed sometimes, and small things like this. Stages are not bad, but motionless/lifeless. Not a lot of characters for now, 6 playables chars and a boss wich is 4 animals (a bear, a snake, etc...) to beat with only one life bar.\n\nBut because all of this can be fix in the near future, and because this is a cheap game, I highly recommend to go for it.", "timestamp_created": 1521408135, "timestamp_updated": 1521408135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40908014": {"recommendationid": "40908014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025661650", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 174, "last_played": 1521570613}, "language": "english", "review": "\"I bet Hitler liked cows\"\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1521407506, "timestamp_updated": 1521407506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40901851": {"recommendationid": "40901851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315701010", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 827, "last_played": 1521733316}, "language": "english", "review": "Hopfully you guys can update the command instructions more clearly for the keyboard!!!

It's not even complete yet and it proves to be living up to its potential. The combo mechanic reminds me and feels kind of similar to the new Killer Instinct, making for near endless combos and super link-ups! Some may argue that the bots in arcade mode are extremely unbalanced. However, it provides a huge challenge for both skilled players and beginners!\n\nThis game only offers two game modes at this point of development: Singleplayer Arcade Mode (with Story Mode being added in the future) and Multiplayer, with the common Online Versus & Introducing: The newly unique Pixel Lobby Mode!. \n\nIn the Pixel lobby Mode, u can hang around and chat / battle with random players around the world and with friends alike. You can also dress up the in-game avatar with various items obtained thru chests... Hope to see this mode expand a bit more to where u can roam the lobby with friends/players to find extra gear to customize your avatar! This has lots of potential living within this unique mode! \n\nIn the future I hope to see more playable characters, maybe around 25 total. Perhaps the DEV's can also build a steam workshop support so people could make their own custom characters! Overall this game is a magnificent work of art, and cant wait to see the finished product of Them's Fightin' Herds~!!!! \n\nOverall Rating:8.0/10\n\n(I Will Give An Updated Review When The Finished Product Releases & Hopefully Give It The 10/10 Allstar Rating!)", "timestamp_created": 1521353003, "timestamp_updated": 1521353245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40888657": {"recommendationid": "40888657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282417406", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 138, "last_played": 1521784026}, "language": "schinese", "review": "TS\u53f2\u8bd7\u7ea7\u52a0\u5f3a233", "timestamp_created": 1521344570, "timestamp_updated": 1521344570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40876249": {"recommendationid": "40876249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295953959", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 102, "last_played": 1521478639}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 :D", "timestamp_created": 1521302013, "timestamp_updated": 1521302013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40868402": {"recommendationid": "40868402", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966628894", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 518, "last_played": 1521750633}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, this is one of the MOST unique fighting games I've ever played.\nIt's not really that feel of mortal kombat to it, it feels more like a child's game, but at the same time, it feels like a really great game in general, even with the cute childish graphics, overall, I'd buy this game, even if it's not on sale, the price is extremely reasonable, I suggest buying it now, as the full access may be around 20-25 U.S dollars.\n\nThe only problem I may have is the wacky control settings for keyboard, but that's honestly really fine.

All i knew from the home screen was that Z is accept. its understandable that this game is like a classic arcade fighting game but still most modern games for PC have been using WASD. its fine using the arrow keys it would just be nice to have that heads up when first opening the game as a tutorial. and thats another thing some type of tutorial would be nice when actually going to play for the first time. A tutorial menue on the home screen that takes you into tutorial mode would even be nice and very much helpful for those who are first playing the game. Finally, it would be nice to be able to play the first game type when selecting single player, and so the only games that are playable for single player are arcade, targets, and training(which is not a tutorial, i want explanation on what keys do what when starting the game). I tried arcade mode after i rebooted multiple times because i kept accidentally opening menus by pressing wrong keys by mistake and remapping my entire keyboard, and once i chose my charcter for arcade mode it just threw me right in without warning and once the battle commenced the AI goes absolutely beserk and doesnt allow for a single hit to get in.

One of my friends purchased the game for me since I honestly wasn't expecting the $15 price tag, but I can see why. \n\nThe music is probably one of the best parts of the game. The music is dynamic and changes according to the winning character. Each character's theme combines with each other to create a different soundtrack, like Arizona and Pom, or Olenader and Paprika.\n\nSecond is the art style. The art style is all thanks to Lauren Faust, ironically enough the one who designed the characters for My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and other Cartoon Network favorites like Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends.\n\nFighting mechanics and animations are also great. Since I haven't played fighting games since 2009, it's pretty difficult for me to master all the combos and attacks, but once you understand them, it's really satisfying as you witness the animations that go along with all those kicks and shoves.\n\nOverall, I'm pleased with the game.

Even with that certain parts of the game may lag you. Idk if it's just me but whenever I start a match the character's words and mouths don't line up. Velvet's stage inparticular is the worst optimized just cause of the snow falling. If you guys were to remove the snowfall or make an option to turn it off, that would certainly be nice.

GGPO for the win.\nPixel Lobbies: Son bonitos, son funcionales y tiene sus easter eggs.\nGameplay: Sistema de combos y de defensa de Skullgirls con una combinacion de gimmicks para cada persona en el boton D. No es un airdasher, por que hasta ahora solo POM tiene airdash, Paprika tiene Short hop, Tianhuo vuela (estilo Magneto en MVC2) y Oleander tiene teleport.\nDificultad: Entre facil y media, Oleander es por ahora el personaje mas facil de usar, es la tipica zoner con fireballs y minas, un especial de proyectil que cubre toda la pantalla, mientras Pom es dificil por que usa asistentes para atacar y tienes que colocar estos asistentes en la pantalla y utilizarlos a mano cuando los ocupes. En si, el juego en dificultad es parecido a Melty Blood donde simplemente apretas A B C y launcher para un combo. \nAdemas los devs hicieron algo inteligente, los antiaereos y los launchers se ejecutan de la misma manera en todos los personajes, permitiendote brincar de un personaje a otro facilmente, lo que si varia es el combo aereo, pero se resuelve con un poquito de practica. Los movimientos super especiales son iguales tambien en todos 236 AB.\nGraficos: Los graficos son bonitos pero nada estilo Guilty Gear Revelator, no hay cambios de camara (Gracias a Dios!!) los cuales hallo molestos. Son graficos 2D bonitos, pero no esperes nada excepcional ya que como dije esta en Alpha, ahora estan arreglando cosas relacionadas con el gameplay y el online.\nMusica: El punto mas debil del juego, no es la gran cosa y no agrega mucho hype al match, espero propongan algo mejor mas adelante.\nSuper recomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1520618312, "timestamp_updated": 1520620273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40688946": {"recommendationid": "40688946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147646844", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 241, "last_played": 1521394569}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me regalaron este juego y lo puedo jugar apropiadamente,mi unica queja es que al tener Skullgirls no me aparecen los dlc de aspectos para Paprika (y no recuerdo quien mas era) que prometieron", "timestamp_created": 1520617986, "timestamp_updated": 1520617986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40687030": {"recommendationid": "40687030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059257951", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "last_played": 1520588221}, "language": "english", "review": "still needs polishing and a bigger roster. only buy on a sale or if it gets any better.

The game is rather beginner friendly, and there are not yet any in game tools to teach people combos. No matter what, fighting games will always reward those who grind in the training room.

That being said, the target mode is pretty useless and just some kind of speedrun mode. If that is what you're into, godbless, but I dont find any value in it. The training mode has a helpful combo trial mode that can teach you the basics of combos for each characters and what you should think about landing in a match. as far as online, there are basic lobbies, but the highlight of online is the pixle lobby. If you dont find yourself privvy with the fighting game crowd, you'll really enjoy walking around here and chatting with other players and discussing strats or going into the salt caves, a pretty entertaining mode that could use some more flushing out, but is still very interesting.\n\nCurrently this game is in early access. It is missing animations, sounds, and has some balance issues. However, it is very much a playable and enjoyable game. Even now, i can recommend this game for nearly anybody.

Plenty of fun ways to play with friends, but expect killers online and ready yourself.\n\nThis is a fun, enjoyable game that if even if the subject matter and history this game bothers you, if you can swallow your pride and give this game a fair chance, I think there is plenty to enjoy.

"english", "review": "((The positives))\n\nthis game is fantastic it is really easy to get into and let me say playing this on a normally Xbox or Playstation controller feels REALLY good.. this game is best suited for a controller not a keyboard and unlike 6 button fighting games like Street Fighter or Marvel VS Capcom where Light/Medium and Heavy are assigned to both Punches and Kicks \"Them Fightin Herds\" does is with single button inputs perfect for pretty much ANY controller so there is no need to get yourself those expensive \"Fighting arcade sticks\" \n\nCombo's are really easy to pull off and with training mode there is a option to learn those combo's and practice with them before going online and playing with others \n\n((The Negatives))\n\nalthough this a great fighting game there are some drawbacks for one when your in \"Pixel lobbies\" first timers are going to be confused so maybe in a update have a menu option icon rather then holding the magic button\n\nlike i said before Combos are easy to pull of but it is IMPOSSIBLE to break out of them.. you see when your opponent does combo's your pretty much at their mercy until they end there combo and if you come across a REALLY skilled online player expect to see the match go completed 1 sided.. i just wish there was a \"Combo Counter\" system so you can break out of combo's and retaliate you know to balance the system.. i know there are some arguments im going to face like \n\n*well its like Marvel VS Capcom 3*\nwell first off \"Them fightin herds\" is a 1V1 fighting game not 3V3 the reason the combo system works well for \"Marvel VS Capcom 3\" is because of your team \"Them fightin herds\" is a 1V1 fighting game you have no team to back you up having a combo system like this there needs to be a 'Combo counter system\" is players get to \"Combo happy\" like \"Killer Instincts\" C-c-c-combo breakers \n\n*Well just don't get hit then\" \ndude.... come on... it's a fighting game your bound to get his sooner or later... \n\n\n((How to improve the game))\n#- have a Combo Counter system similar to \"Combo breakers\" from Killer instinct\n#- have a replay feature so you can look at your past matches record them and put them on youtube\n#- Hopefully more characters i would like to see more gameplay styles\n\n#- Music Customization options (PC only) where you can put in your own music for \"Character selects\" \"Stages\" and so on and people can also listen to it online!\n\n((Conclusion))\ni say give this game a shot! you can spend HOURS on it mastering characters get to know there moves and so on i['ll give this game a\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1520421550, "timestamp_updated": 1520435793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

Skullgirls had a very similar problem however the ability to break combos at least gave you something to do when you were getting beaten unlike here where you may as well put the controller down and grab a drink.\n\nCompounding this issue is weird controller lag/input detection that means you have to input combos immediately without hit confirming first or else they will immediately fail, which is problematic because it means blindly hoping your attack landed. This wasn't an isolated issue either, I have come across quite a few people complaining about this and I know this is not a ggpo specific problem because skullgirls uses ggpo and it manages just fine online for even the most terrible of connections.\n\nInfact in the case of skullgirls, it is much more likely your opponent will be teleporting around the screen and the match will disconnect due to being unplayable than your hits and combos will fail. I don't buy the argument that the game is in early access and so these issues will be fixed simply because it has been 4 years of games in early access (on steam) and you just roll the dice and hope the game gets fixed/patched/[b]finished[/b] but this is one instance where I would hope to be wrong and the final product does come through polished.\n\nHope however is the first step on the road to disappointment and although I have rated the game highly I did mention that it just ekes out a recommendation and that is because we are innundated with fighting games right now so the competition is stiff. If you are a casual you will probably get a few hours playtime that honestly hardly warrant buying the game and if you are a hardcore fighting game player, well, you are being spread very thinly right now!\n\nThe game comes at a very bad time and honestly this was the best time it could possibly come out regardless since even more fighting games are on the horizon so they cannot delay release forever can they.\nBack to talking about the game however and it boasts dynamic music although honestly I did not notice it but what I did notice was that the music would frequently cutout, unless dead silence is a part of the music, so there is that. Dynamic music is as old as Phantasy Star Online and that was over 20 years ago, come on guys, sort it out.\n\nThe graphics, well look at the game, it is a cartoon come to life but then again so was skullgirls and dragonball fighterz so there is little praise I can heap on this game that it sadly is not outshone by from its direct competiton and that is a huge, huge shame because this game feels like it is coming from a place of love.\n\nWith all that said, you can see the game has issues of which the biggest is the flow of fighting and while you may or may not have liked skullgirls there is no denying that the playerbase for skullgirls was small and if this game follows suit then consider if you want yet another almost dead fighting game on your hands. At this time of this review I found one lobby with 20 people in it and a whole bunch with 1, 2 or 0 and 0 was the norm!\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews because I am a miserable old man with bills to

finally take the plunge, get a stick, sit down and learn fighting games.\nThere isn't much more I can say, being a newcomer to the genre itself, but I will try.\n\nIt's- wonderful. The style, the animations, the music- every day I spend 30 minutes in the Combo Trials mode and steadily get a little better every day. When I started out, I couldn't [i]touch[/i] Velvet, my first opponent in Arcade Mode, about two weeks ago.\nNow - I just beat Arcade Mode today, and there was a great deal less button mashing and more actual comboing than in any other fighting game I've ever bumbled my way through. I will keep on playing, increasing the difficulty settings bit by bit. That in itself speaks to how hooked I've become.\n\n[i]Of course[/i], it is an Early Access product.

Just doesn't feel very unique or distinguished to me. Defensive options in this feel very lacking to me, limited reversal options, the footises (hoovsies?) and spacing in this game just feels all kinds of strange due to every character being on all fours and how normals are executed. It's just a strange feeling, and you get so easily pulled in by highs/lows. Even with Push Blocking, it's too easy to get locked down with hardly any way out, heaven forbid you get knocked down once, then you're really screwed In other words it's like pretty much any other \"anime\" fighter out there, it's largely a setplay \"single player\" based game and these types of games don't really hold my interest for long, especially when the fighting game market is FLOODED with games like these as it is. I mean you look at the #1 fighting game on the market right now, DragonBall FighterZ, I think that game is absolute nonsense in terms of gameplay.  Defensive play just isn't great, so you need to always take the initivative to overwhelm your opponents with relentless rushdown, because if you get caught blocking, you aren't winning, you're losing. Sadly the fighting game community these days prefers fighting games where literally every move has to hit confirm into a long drawn out combo and you aren't well equipped with any real good reversal options, especially without some kind of resource. The combo's in this game are super easy to do and figure out, but it just feels like there isn't a whole lot of variety because you can turn just about any hit into the same bnb combo. I play mostly old school SNK fighting games and combo's in those tend to be alot shorter, far more damaging, and usually with more restriction in what you can do, because those games tend to be more about slugging it out with your opponent rather than confirming every light low or overhead into a full combo. I much prefer games where there is a large emphasis on feeling the opponent out and exchanging individual beefy hits.\n\nBasically I feel like, this game has some of the same problems I have with Yatagarasu, it's a game I feel like I've played numerous times before and does alot of the same things other big hit fighting games do, but feels way more limited in that regard. However unlike Yatagarasu, this game actually has a very nice art and audio direction, much more convient menu's and UI, and it actually has legit licensed GGPO netplay, something Yatagarasu promised years ago, and still has yet to deliver. Also unlike Skullgirls, I apperciate the fact this game is a strictly 1v1 fighter, I could never get huge into Skullgirls because they wanted to push tag teams+assists so hard for that game, and it's that same reason I could not get into DragonBall FighterZ. I tend to dislike team based games that involve tons of random garbage goin on screen, and DBFZ makes it even worse because of how homogenized most of the cast is.\n\nAll that aside though, this being an early access title and all, I think this game has alot more potential if they just beef up/adjust the movesets on the characters, maybe add EX versions of Specials, and I think the damage should be increased, make those individual hits count more, make combo's scale less, especially supers. I get fighting games these days are all about converting every teeny tiny itsy bitsy hit, whether it's a low or overhead into long combo's, but you don't have to make every move work like that. Back in my day we had beefy strong ass normals, they weren't cancelable, they generally combo'ed into nothing, but they were their to establish spacing, pressure the opponent, and when they hit, they hurt quite a bit on their own. Games that used to do this quite a bit like The King Of Fighters for example, no longer does this anymore really.\n\nOld man rambling side, if you liked Skullgirls but preferred it as 1v1 game, this game would probably be right up your alley. Naturally if you liked the gameplay in games such as Vampire Savior or maybe some Marvel titles or even anime fighters like BlazBlue, you'd probably find something to like here. These types of games have never been the kind I am in love with or anything, but I can apperciate the hardwork that went into making this and hope it can grow/develop enough to get some kind of scene of it's own, but then at the same time I feel this game will have the same problems games like Arcana Heart and Melty Blood have, appealing to the most niche of niche fighting game playerbase.\n\ntl;dr, it's a cute game, great presentation, super easy to pick up and play, but I feel like the gameplay isn't very unique/distinguished, but I understand it's still a major WIP, just like Skullgirls was for the longest time, so hopefully it manages to evolve over time into something much more.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1520325778, "timestamp_updated": 1520325778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40601121": {"recommendationid": "40601121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359109238", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1520582866}, "language": "english", "review": "Keep it up!

I do think a review of this game is in order, however, so I shall oblige.\n\nMechanics\n\nTruthfully, I'm not sure where to begin. The games uses a chain-combo (light attack -> medium attack -> heavy attack -> launcher attack) and launcher system to continue combos in the air and directly cancel attacks and special attacks into super attacks. Everything about it feels fair, fluid, and easy to use, yet difficult to truly master when in practice. Controls are responsive, the sounds of attacks hitting is fitting, and damage is handled fairly (in my opinion). As a fighting game enthusiast (not master), it is my opinion that the games feels fantastic to play on the sheer weight of its mechanics and their implementation alone.\n\nArt\n\nArt is in the eye of the beholder. As of the time of this review's writing, the game isn't fully complete, so certain things aren't fully implemented or animated. That being said, the backgrounds are visually appealing and characters stand out enough that they don't get lost amongst the bright colors of said backgrounds. The character designs are interesting, animate well, and consistent with the chosen art style (i. e. they do not clash visually - there is no stark difference in overall aesthetic). Attacks look like what they are supposed to be (the ones that are finished, that is), and also stand out from the background. This reviewer is of the opinion that the art is well-implemented.\n\nSound\n\nThe voice-acting is pleasant to listen to, doesn't sound forced, and is fitting for each of the characters, bolstering personality rather than clashing with it. The sounds themselves are often basic, but they are perfectly fitting and convey exactly what they need to convey to match character, weight of attack, and overall aesthetic. Sound is well-implemented, just as the art is.\n\nNetcode\n\nFor a fighting game with online multiplayer, netcode is of the utmost importance. As of yet, even when playing against players marked as being on the opposite coastline, this reviewer has experienced no lag during any matches. That is not to say there will be none, just to say that this reviewer has not encountered any and is thus of the opinion that the game runs beautifully in online modes.\n\nThe high quality of product in regard to the game's price (at the time of this review( was such a surprise that this reviewer can only wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fighting games.

To each their own, the reason I wanted to bring this up is due to the game's art style and theme being VERY MLP esque. I however am judging the game on it's own merits as a game. Although one thing I will mention is I wouldn't be suprised if some form of a collaboration between this game and MLP came into light/fruition. Also bear in mind that due to this game being in the very BEGGINING stages of early access, bear in mind I will still critiuqe it, but will give the game the benefit of the doubt/give the game some creedence\n\n\nAnyway, let's get to the reveiw\n\nThem's Fightin Herds is a 2D Street Fighter esque style game with the fast pace of SF IV to be precise, whilst having a very cartoony and not taken serious at all feel to it. However these are just the first few things that come to mind and the first impressions I had with the game.\n\nLet's get to what I enjoy about the game as well as it's problems\n\nPositives:\n\nDiverse characters and likable designs, concepts, and ideas-I enjoy the concept of an animal fighting game, and it's nice to know that aside from just looks and voices, each character plays differently. They each have their own unique movesets and you quickly learn what playstyle or type of character they are after you fight them  or try them out. Your best bet is to try the first stage with each character and see which one fits you best\n\nMusic and Stages-Each stage has a very distinctive vibe to it reminiscent of the character you  are fighting with it's corresponding looks and music, Arizona is in a countryside, Oleander is a night time/slightly ominous looking swamp/forrest, the lama is around a type of field/farm looking area (if I remember correctly) etc\n\nFlow, Controls, and Gameplay-Controls feel very nice and the pace and some elements of the game's controls eminds me of Skullgirls (oddly enough Lab Zero is mentioned as one of the collaborators) and whilst this point is regarding controls and not design, the design can also be thought of as an indicator that the game also has a very skullgirls feel to it, almost as if SF and Skullgirls had a baby, The flow of the game feels smooth and as mentioned befoe, one of the first impressions is SF IV. That element in particular is with the complexities of combos themesleves yet the ease of picking up the controller, learning/looking at the controls, and learning the combos. in short, like SF IV, the combos and combat itself is easy to understand and learn, difficult to master\n\n\nBonus Points (these are positives that are not major, but are cool brownie points, and tbh, one of them got me somewhat excited)\n\nVoice acting and dialogue-The dialogue is cute, expected, but in a funny cheesy way and it compliments the game's atmosphere and vibes and imo adds charm to it. Not to mention, if my hunch is correct and my ears don't decive me, I think Arizona is voiced by Tara Strong and I think that brown french animal in that snowy area (don't remember all the names instantly after only playing for 43 minutes) is voiced by Grey Griffen (Vicky from FOP/Catwoman from Batman) of if that's inccorect, my other guess is Audrey's voice actor from Huniepop!\n\n\n\nNegatives-(Again, I will reiterate that I know this is early access so I can give the game the benefit of the doubt, and these are small negatives that should be taken note of, but they do NOT break or \"damage\" the game in major ways\n\nRoster SIZE-I understand the whole \"quality over quantity\" thing with games or entertainment in general. But with fighting games imo, you need a balance of quality and quantity when it comes to the roster and character types/playstyles, not that they aren't diverse, it just needs expanding, which will most likely be added via an update or patches (here's hoping, but that seems extremely likely)\n\nNo tutorial-Whilst training is available. Bear in mind that CHARACTER SPECIFIC tutorials or a basic controls tutorial is absent, sometimes the best learners need physical experience and not just visual via looking at the controls and buttons, again, this can be forgiven for the time being given this is in early access.\n\nNo AI fights-Again, it plans to be added, it's just a bummer it isn't available\n\nBalancing-This is one of those games where even easy presents some bit of a challenge, which, for most games, isn't a problem, however with a fighting game that's a special case where, (at least in my opinion) is a sign of needing balancing/fixing, so hopefully this gets fixed in the future\n\nOverall-Them's Fightin' Herds is a cute, funny, fun, and suprisingly deep indie fighter with plenty of potential and challenge, and here's hoping that over time the game expands upon itself and grows with more content, characters, and capabilites, because imo it has potential to be up there with skullgirls or brawlhalla in terms of popularity and notoriety if done right\n", "timestamp_created": 1520170892, "timestamp_updated": 1520170892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619951", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40562484": {"recommendationid": "40562484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198371598055", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520169732}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u683c\u6597\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u7684\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u51b2\u7740M6\u6765\u7684\u3002\u3002\u3002\u7528\u4e86\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u7d2b\u8272\u5c11\u5987\uff0c\u88abAI\u4e91\u5b9d\u6253\u50bb\u4e86\u3002\u3002\u3002\u4e91\u5b9d\u8fd8\u8eb2\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u5927\u62db\u3002\n\u4f5c\u4e3abrony\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\u8981\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u4e0b\u5566", "timestamp_created": 1520170117, "timestamp_updated": 1520170117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40558554": {"recommendationid": "40558554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347281715", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 139, "last_played": 1521777736}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u51b2\u7740\u753b\u98ce\u6765\u7684\uff0c\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u4eba\u7269\u592a\u5c11\u4e86\uff0c\u8d76\u7d27\u51fa\u65b0\u89d2\u8272\u5427\n\n\u6709\u5927\u4f6c\u5efa\u4e2a\u56fd\u5185\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5c31\u597d\u4e86\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1520159339, "timestamp_updated": 1520402486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40554082": {"recommendationid": "40554082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251156958", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 319, "last_played": 1521657135}, "language": "english", "review": "PETA wants me dead for enjoying this game.

Though this still rough I hope to see it getting more refined and tuned up. The Devs already acknowledges the problems it still has and has promised to iron them out. The bugs I noticed that not all voices are matched up with the proper characters before and after the battle, and that the AI is way, way OP, Lag before the fight, missing some proper animations and voice syncing before the battle starts. I had to set it to the easiest setting to even have a fighting chance. iIt has odd quirks such as avoiding you or deflecting almost every attack you do is annoying. it's current redeeming factor at the moment is it's online mode and practice mode. It's not terrible but I look forward to when it gets better and hopefully they will add animations to the background characters and add more fighting characters to it as well as the ability to run towards your opponent. It's doesn't even have the story mode added to it yet, though you can select it and get a preview of the the story menus. So far it seems to well worth the $14.99 price tag.

I didn't like it, but it's good.\n\nIt's a historycal child of \"Fighting is magic\" game, which was a fanmade MLP (My Little Pony) themed project. Since fans had  lots of problems with Hasbro owning the franchise, they decided to ask for Loren Faust's help and make their own fighting with lots of references and their own magic. If you play this game you see that they succeseeded in that task. There is actually much more than original game could give you.\n\nPros: \n+ Amazing artstyle by Loren Faust herself\n+ Great music\n+ All of a sudden it's a freaking multiplayer thing! Amazing!\n+ Animation and sound quality levels are high\n+ Even though it's an realy access game it has almost everything you wanna see in fighting\n+ Very user-friendly (because you gotta share, you gotta care) pixel lobby with lots of servers with actual non-toxic people on them and fun little things and clothes with descriptions\n\nCons:\n- My personal problem was in controls: I can't play with joystick and keyboard controls are stiff and uneasy, even less easy is to adjust them, simply because there is no \"Disable second player\" option.\n- Game has her ancestor's problem in menu - it's not easy to choose a color palette when there is no strict and straightforward explanation what options you have and you end up scrolling those colors forever. I am just being dumb here, this is really a super minor con that affects just me probably.\n- As it is made by mane6 and it's a MLP-based (in the past) game, there are only 6 characters and I doubt there will be many more\n- AI will kick your bottom. It's horryfying in it's OP-ness.\n\nIt's really good, yet unfinished and doesn't suit me, sadly. I had to refund this game.

I heard the story of the situation, so I know they're trying to get it fixed and ready. \n\nUPDATE 3/2/18\nPlayed some of the Pixel Lounge Multiplayer.  Was impressed with not only the design, but the netcode was solid. \n\nPROS \n-Good animation a character designs\n-Voice acting is nice\n-Good Backgrounds\n-Really good music in some stages\n-Special Moves are fun\n-Crazy Combo's to be made\n-Great Netcode\n-Loved the Pixel Lounge for Multiplayer\n\nCONS\n- Heavily unbalanced in this state.

No credits, or feeling of accomplishment\n- Game actually crashed when I was changing the Resolution from Windowed to Full Screen \n- Voice sync is off on some of the characters \n\nOverall, I see good things in this game, and considering they adopted from the Skull Girls Engine, it's got a good set of tools to work with.

I'm gonna be going from topic to topic just as it pops into my head, so don't expect any major coherence from paragraph to paragraph.\n\nTo start out, I've been following and anticipating this game for a good while, so I'm definitely at least a little biased. At that, though, I don't have much of a metric for fighting games other than Soul Calibur and Tekken, and it's been years since I've played those, not to mention they're 3d. I've put about 18 hours into casual skullgirls play over the last couple months, but haven't really been soaking in anything about the game, just kinda coasting along and hitting buttons. So that's all to say, my frame of reference here is almost nonexistent for the genre.\n\n\nThe roster is interesting, with a lot of fun color palettes, and the music is fantastic. The UI felt like it was fighting with me at first, but I've adapted to it pretty well, and it's not even an inconvenience past the first hour or two maybe, in my experience. This current build is sparse on anything other than core content, which is to say the fighting itself. I think a lot of people will argue that story-content is as or more important to a release, but in this case I'd have to highly disagree. It'll be out when it's out, and as far as an experience goes, I've already gotten more than an hour per dollar out of this game without feeling like I was missing anything.\n\nThe controls are straightforward, and simple combos are incredibly, stupidly easy to pull off. Simple LMH>Launch>Aerial LMH stuff will get you through your first steps, and I was able to decimate many of my fellow beginners with this combo and slight variations for about the first fifteen hours or so it was out. The training mode offers combo trials, which will teach you everything from basic combos like the one I listed, to master-level, 20+ input chains. It's certainly a system that requires and rewards patience, as any newcomer to the 2d fighting genre is going to have a hard time memorizing inputs to the point where you can read and execute them like reading words on a page. In the several hours I've been attempting combo trials, I've made it down to the end of the intermediates, and feel like my muscle memory is kicking in to the point where I could probably reach the same point on a different character in slightly or significantly less time. \n\nThe netcode is very solid, although not without some stutter here and there. It never breaks the pace significantly, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was exclusively on my end anyway, so I won't take away points when I'm still able to have very capable matches with people who have 200 ping or more, with only minor latency.\n\nThe Pixel Lobby is a fantastic addition, and I'm glad it was able to make it into the EA release. Being able to speak with people in-lobby has mostly been a good experience, although your mileage will obviously vary. There's a lot of cool customization on your avatar (Although I wish we had palette swaps on the pixel characters), and you have the opportunity to garner much more through the Salt Mines, a kind of dungeon-experience filled with NPC monsters that are liable to make you cry your first few goes. The rest of the lobby is a very good experience. Matching up is easy, spectating is easy, although once you're locked into a match, you'll be forced to spectate until the end, and you can even still enter training while in the lobby, marked as your character pummeling a dummy to other players.\n\nInputs are seemingly difficult, but in retrospect very fair. I've been missing inputs since release, but looking into training, and being more conscious of what I'm doing has led me to realize I just need practice. And practice has absolutely tightened up my inputs and responses, as I feel I'm missing significantly fewer after just a few hours of repitition on the difficult ones. Which isn't to say any inputs are particularly difficult in any objective measure, but newcomers are sure to whiff on Velvet and Paprika's DP inputs as often as not, in the beginning, and even just executing supers can seem very precise when you're not aware of your openings after and between attacks. More than once I'd find myself trying to execute a super far too soon, only to realize when examining frame data in training that I was simply too early, or even that I was just straight dropping my inputs.\n\nNone of this is to say that the gameplay and controls are perfect, because I don't know. I just feel that in my experience so far, anything that's felt \"wrong\" has been fixed with a little bit of effort and reflection. I'm also sure it feels different than some or many other fighting games, but that's not exactly a valid con either.\n\nEach character seems to play very different, and of the three or so I've semi-consistently attempted (Oleander, Velvet, Tianhuo), I'm finding myself having to adjust my entire perspective on gameplay just to make dents in more skilled players. It's honestly very rewarding. I definitely do not undervalue the worth of losing either, whether it's to the AI, or better players, because after four a four match losing streak, I'll often find myself changing my approaches and sometimes I'll even come back from the depths for a tie, or close, and that always teaches me something that I can take into future matches.\n\nI've briefly hopped into Arcade mode and the Target Break thing, and don't care much for either. I feel you'll either enjoy them or not, and I personally definitely prefer spending my time facing off against other players, and training. I feel that I'll enjoy Story Mode much more, though I can't know for sure at this point.\n\nAs far as negatives go, the only one I've really noticed is a lack of some animations, and character frames. I sincerely don't know what else to call a negative, especially gameplay-wise, because nothing has felt like one so far. I'm reading the negative reviews here on Steam, and finding I can't sympathize with many of them at all. I've seen the AI referred to as cheap and broken, which is about the most understandable complaint, but even then, I haven't had much trouble with them after some practice, so I don't know if it's just a skill thing, or if they're actually cheap compared to other 2d fighters.\n\n\nYeah, Idunno, as far as a first fighting game goes, I'm into it. It feels good to play, it looks great, the music and general sound-design is ace, and it's had a very welcoming community.  I can see myself sinking a fair amount of time into this between work and other hobbies. Maybe not the fifteen hours a day I managed on release, but a couple hours of practice, a couple hours of matches, every other day, every two days, yeah, that sounds like a genuinely good time. Looking forward to watching the game grow.\n\nWill update if anything else comes to mind, or maybe once I reach a more significant number of hours/once 1.0 is out.", "timestamp_created": 1519879272, "timestamp_updated": 1519879272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40478074": {"recommendationid": "40478074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351910361", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520225202}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0444\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0438 \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439, \u043d\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435. \u041d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u043d\u043e. \u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043a \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0435)", "timestamp_created": 1519878027, "timestamp_updated": 1519878027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40477373": {"recommendationid": "40477373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042265809", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1520841652}, "language": "english", "review": "you can be a cute Llama and beat the crap out other cute animals.i'm all for it. it has potential to become a  solid fighter to say the most cant wait for the updates", "timestamp_created": 1519875153, "timestamp_updated": 1519875153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40476446": {"recommendationid": "40476446", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992027833", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520042847}, "language": "english", "review": "If you can get past the bronies, this is actually a really fun fighting game with interesting characters/mechanics.

Yes, this is a pony-based fighting game. We get it. Y'all think it's trash just cuz the characters have very distinct similarities to that one very familiar pony show that everyone seems to love to hate on. We get it. But if you're gonna just disregard this whole thing based solely on its surface-level design decisions, then you're gonna miss out on a hell of a good game.\n\nIf Skullgirls is an introduction to Street Fighter based games, this game is the Skullgirls of games like BlazBlue or Guilty Gear. Which is also kinda funny since this game is built with the Skullgirls engine, so you catfighting fenatics already know that the engine certainly works smoothly. And it's not just that part that works either! The controls are responsive, the gameplay is fun and easy to pick up, and the characters are very diverse and introduce players to different styles of fighting characters. (Except grapplers. Unless you count Arizona as a grappler, which...I don't, really.) I had never even considered picking up a zoner character until I played Oleander, and it's the most fun I've had with the archetype.\n\nThe game also comes with a Pixel Lobby, which basically functions as a way to find players to fight without having to directly seek them out and make a lobby with them, while still having a bit more interactivity than the Skullgirls Quick Match system. The game itself has about 8 official lobbies, with a whole bunch of fan-created lobbies to spice things up if those ones are full. When entering, you are given a little avatar you can customize with hatsand accessories. Bored of the hats you're given? Go to the Salt Mines! There you can fight Predators and open chests to get salt which can be used to open more expensive chests to get the aforementioned Hats and Accessories.\n\nCons? Well, it's hardly finished, for one, though I wouldn't let that bother you too much. All that's really \"missing\" per se are things that wouldn't really affect gameplay otherwise, like missing animations and stuff. That's not counting things like Story Mode and quick matches, but you can get a lot of the content missing there through other means, like Arcade mode and the aforementioned Pixel Lobby.\n\nIn the end, I'd say the game has a lot of potential, and definitely is a lot of fun right now.

Not much to say about that.\n+ Music. Man I love the soundtrack of the game. Plus the Dynamic Music System is incredible too. Makes fights much more intense. \n+ Gameplay. This game is fun as hell. Like I said, not a huge fighting game fan but I can't stop playing this. It's simple enough for a new player to understand but takes a lot of practice to master. I can understand why I got my butt kicked. Pulling off combos is so satisfying.\n+ Characters. All the characters are unique and fun in their own way. Love em all. Everyone can find the one that fits their playstyle.   \n+ Pixel Lobby. The Pixel Lobby is such a fun place to just fight other people, talk to them, spectate fights, earn cosmetics for your little pixel fighter, and has co-op against CPUs.\n+ Community. The community is great. In game and on Discord server, everyone is cool and friendly. Makes the experience much better. Plus the devs are great too. Not really about the game but still felt like adding.\n+ Training. The amount of options in the training mode should be enough to help you master combos and even make your own. Definitely helped me get better.\n\nNow for the negatives.\n\nI don't really have much to say. Only negative thing would be that the game is in Early Access. So it's missing a lot. \n- No Story Mode. -Some bugs. - Lip Syncing issues. - Some sound issues. - No ranked play. \n- Needs different pixel lobbies. - Some characters aren't fully complete in terms of visuals.             - No option for private lobbies. \n\nAll of those issues can be fixed in a couple of months though so I'm not really worried. They don't really affect how much I'm enjoying this game. So if you want to spend 15 bucks( or 11.24 if you have Skullgirls until March 8th) and just wanna play a fun fighting game involving adorable animals then get it.

Yes I may only have .8 hours in this game. But I haven't gotten mad over a single loss. As I would in Mortal Kombat. Yes, I am bad at these games, that's why I lose and get mad, but I would say the bright colours of everything makes everything that much better. I've already found one easter egg with a skin.

Online is mostly played through lobbies. As with most fighting games, expect people to kick your ass. All fights are 1v1. The games that are most similar to this are Skullgirls and BlazBlue. There isn't much else besides the salt mine in the lobbies and waiting for story mode to come out. Expect to get your money's worth getting better online: that's where the longevity of fighting games always occur. It's as good of time as any to start now before people start learning more of the game's mechanics in the next few weeks.\n\nPositives:\n+Wonderful and buttery smooth MLP-inspired art.\n+Crazy mechanics from every unique character keep every fight fresh and fun (especially with the magic system).\n+Color palatte of characters taken from characters (there's an animal crossing skin for the alpaca, a spyro skin for the dragon, and a god damn deadpool skin for the cow)\n+Probably one of the most unique and interactive lobbies you'll see in a fighting game (very similar to ArcSys games like Guilty Gear Rev2 and Dragonball FighterZ)\n+Master your skills with combo trials via training mode. How convenient!\n+THE SALT MINES\n+An in-depth fighting system with a lot to learn!\n+$15. Pretty cheap for a game like this, and discounted if you own Skullgirls or Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator/Rev2.\n\nNegatives:\n-Lack of a tutorial for new players.\n-Steep learning curve for new players.\n-Not much besides salt mines and the upcoming story mode to keep new players interested.\n-Early Access = a few main game stuff is missing (specifically certain character animations, quick match, story mode and tutorial mode). The game will become a regular release in a few months, so they're close to finishing the game.\n-An in-depth fighting system with A LOT to learn...\n\nFAQ:\n\nHow is this related to My Little Pony/Why are there so many Bronies playing?\nOriginally the game was created to be My Little Pony: Fighting is Magic. Hasbro put on the ol Cease and Desist on the game, and further development was canceled. The team agreed to recreate the game using all new characters based on the main 6 of the show (thus the devs were called Mane6). MikeZ offered the Skullgirls engine to the team, and Lauren Fraust, creator of MLP:FIM, created the designs for each of the characters. After 4 or so years of development, the game is finally out on Steam.\n\nWhere is the content? I thought there was 4 years of development.\nIf you're unfamiliar with fighting game development, it's a pain. Especially if you're an independent studio. There is an incredible amount of variables that go into creating a fighting game because of it's complexities. Say you have 6 buttons of attack like in Skullgirls. You also have to consider how each button is pressed when crouching, in the air, and how they chain into each other. Not to mention programming special moves, designing hitboxes and hurtboxes, and worst of all, balancing the game so that no insane-looking character is better than the other insane-looking character. If you're still not convinced, just know that development for this game is focused on the long-term. That means that simply having a bunch of single player modes will not help the game when eventually, everyone else will play each other online. For the developers, online comes first.\n\nWhat the hell are the Salt Mines?\nThe Salt Mines are a semi-hidden trial in the online lobbies. Simply pay some salt that you gained off of playing against other players, and you may fight the AI in a sort of rogue-lite setting and collect cosmetics for your character. It's pretty fun, and quite possibly even co-op.\n\nWhat character should I pick? Is one character better than the other?\nDon't fall into this trap. Ever. Pick a character that you want to play and stick with it. If you want to play a character just because it's on a higher tier, then you'll get less fun out of the game. Worry about tiers only if you're attending or watching a tournament.\n\nWhy should I worry if I'm a new player?\nSimply put, this game does not have a tutorial to teach you. And trust me, there's a lot to learn. Don't know how to block? How to pull off special moves/commands? Don't know about any of the new mechanics? Then you'll be completely lost if you go in blind. If you want to play this game as it's intended, you'll need to do some prior research, or better yet ask for help! Anyone in the lobbies or the Steam forums will gladly help you.\n\nWhere do I start if I'm a new player?\nLearn the fighting game basics. Try to get a feel for your character. Learn normal button presses, learn to block low 75% of the time, and if you lose, HIT THE REMATCH BUTTON. Vets love it when they see a new player keep trying.

An Easy fix is to change the launch move, input wise, to the crouching attack instead as it makes the controls and combo's more reliable AND intuitive across all control types without affecting any characters combos (except potentially Arizona)\n\n\nCharacter Issues: \n\nOleander: Lack of mobility outside of this characters teleport is her gimmick i guess, but it seems forced. Increasing her dash distance is the only thing that hinders the character overall, Raw Super (level 1) should do more damage, as it only does 7 more damage than something like Velvets CSB light.\n\nVelvet: Characters damage in general is way to high, Her reward for spacing is far to great as everyhting she does gives her managable space from opponent. Moveset is Obsurdly safe on block, and needs to be toned down, all version of her CSB attacks do OBSURDE ammounts of damage and should de dialed down a tad bit. Ultimalty character excells to well at all locations of the screen with far to much safety. \n\nArizona: Is in a great spot with exception of her entire moveset seemingly worthless against crouching opponents, This NEEDS fixed as there is really not reason her light and mediums CSF should completely wiff. otherwise i suggest you give her another lasso attack for close range (holding Toward opp. ) so her combos can be more flush with it as a utility tool and make it so she cant land more than 1-2 lasso hits per chain anyways.\n\nPOM: Havn't noticed to many changes needed, great hitbox sizes and fun character.\n\nPaparika: THERE IS SUCH A THING AS TOO MUCH LOVE\n\nTianHuo: Suffers from Crouching to launcher move being to sensitive, causing it to be far to liable to do the Airial grab which is ussless on grounded opponents (or you could be cool and give it a wiffing hit box since she is doing a fancy twirl) Super is only cappable of being landed as a combo ender, make her hieght gain when it launches from ground shorter so she can catch cheeky grounded opponents with it raw,(SINCE THE REST OF THE CAST CAN) and hit Box for it is FAR TOO SMALL.\n\nPROS: \n-Game Feels increabily Nice\n-plays well with exception of the Launching attack\n- has much potential DLC character wise\n\nCons:\n-Very sensitive controls, mean game needs to be as intuitive as possible, so the hiding of an important combo piece behind a a sensitivity trap works against feel of game\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1519719397, "timestamp_updated": 1519719397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40432889": {"recommendationid": "40432889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024088292", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 69, "last_played": 1521448524}, "language": "english", "review": "7/10\n\nThe PVP is fair and addicting.

Casually, yes, but I do win every now and then.\n\nNow, technical problems:\n- It is impossible for me to change the game into fullscreen mode. While it is not a BIG deal breaker, it does kinda suck cause I can only see the upper half of the super meter cause of this.\n- A major amount of animations are unfinished, again it is Early Access, but come on, you had 3 years to do this.\n- Absolutely zero lipsinc. Intros and outros are very buggy.\n- UI in this game is one of the worst I have seen in my life. I could not believe there can be a worse UI than the original Melty Blood but boy, was I wrong.\n- No tutorial.\n- AI basically has two modes: A) Barely even trying. B) Never missing a block and air juggling you for 50+ combos. The AI slider is a joke. A bad joke even.\n\nGameplay Issues: Disclaimer, since there is no tutorial in the game, I may be wrong about most of these, but you cannot exactly blame me for that. I tried.\n- Seems like there is no Perfect Block/Perfect Dodge/Perfect Counter mechanic to get out of infinite combos. I swear I have to be missing something here cause if so, first attack is all that matters which is a really bad gameplay.\n- Juggling harder than Blaz.\n- A lot of attacks have really bad hitzones. I personally wanted to main Arizona but I have quickly learned that her lasso attack, which is the only way to replenish resources by the way, has probably the worst hitzone in the history of gaming. It is so pixel perfect that you have to literally be a quantum computer to be able to pull it off and if the enemy is laying down, in the air, moving, attacking or doing literally anything other than staying perfectly still, it will not connect. This is just one of many similar problems.\n- General character balancing: Who thought its a good idea to give Totally-Not-Twilight extreme range on every attack, ranged attack that does not cost any resource, ability to constantly teleport and even teleport that does half of the screen of hitzone and is one of her most damaging attacks? Insane much?\n\nLike seriously, I knew char balancing is gonna be kinda shoddy in the backer build but I was hoping this would have been solved by, you know, people playing the game and devs paying attention. Do they even play their own game?\n\n- It is impossible to counter pick. Most melee characters get melted by ranged characters like Velvet or Arizona. Feels like this game was supposed to almost be like League of Legends or DOTA, where you counter pick chars, cause some chars are much better against other chars.\n- Salt Mines are currently entirely pointless.\n\nSo yeah, there is a lot wrong with this game. I had MAJOR hope for it, not cause it was made by Mane6 and would have been a nice middle finger to Hasbro, but cause I wanted another good fighter in my life.\n\nIt is not often I feel strongly about me backing a game, but this time, I wish I could refund it.", "timestamp_created": 1519715099, "timestamp_updated": 1519715138, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413349", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40431830": {"recommendationid": "40431830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278198524", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 159, "last_played": 1521276288}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9ai\u5f3a\u5f97\u6211\u4e0d\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7528\u8e44\u5b50\u73a9\u7684\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1519713517, "timestamp_updated": 1519713517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40431290": {"recommendationid": "40431290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158232191", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519744269}, "language": "russian", "review": "10 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0448\u0435\u043a \u0431\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044f\u0448\u0435\u043a \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1519711322, "timestamp_updated": 1519711322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40431245": {"recommendationid": "40431245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155425508", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1520910450}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 a m a z i n g\n\nomfg its amazing", "timestamp_created": 1519711083, "timestamp_updated": 1519711083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40431080": {"recommendationid": "40431080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007522455", "num_games_owned": 632, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519516502}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just not all that polished even after years in development.

never played a fighting game (except ARMS, which stole me around 100 hours and MK 9/X, which i only played occasionally with friends), so my experience with this genre is pretty limited, but i feel like TFH is a promising game.\nI enjoy it's fighting mechanics (haven't tried multiplayer yet) as they feel \"easy to understand, hard to master\", but i think the bots are too much punitive on the easiest levels, which isn't bad by itself, it's a good way to improve at the game, but it's probably going to scare most newbies\n(as i said, i am not very experienced with 2D fighting games, so i was pretty surprised when the AI bots didn't let me land a single hit on them on Normal the first time, which led me to spend the first hour and half practicing combos and blocking attacks in the Training mode and only the last 30 minutes playing an Arcade game).\nThe art style is actually pretty inspired, the animations are smooth and the character are really cute, but i think the stages should be less static and more entertaining. Moving over, i really enjoy the musics (i think i'm in love with The Woodlands and Alpake Highlands's background themes), and i appreciate the dynamic music system.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, of course:\nIt lacks some voice lines and animations, stages are too \"static\" and i feel like there should be a proper tutorial mode that actually teaches the basics (it took me a while to understand how to block attacks, and i'm still not sure if i'm doing it properly), and i think the AI bots need another difficulty setting aimed at players who never did an half moon in their entire life.\n\nSumming it up, i'm quite impressed by how good the game feels (i honestly expected worse), as i said it's a promising product, i'm pretty sure the things i mentioned earlier are going to get fixed soon, as the game is still in early access.", "timestamp_created": 1519690786, "timestamp_updated": 1519690786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40426524": {"recommendationid": "40426524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301426462", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520116241}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game because I'm a huge fan of MLP.

However, I feel as though Them Fightin' Herds is the perfect balance on the difficulty bar that makes it a lot more fair and welcoming to people that are new to the fighting genre while still providing the depth and technically that inspires fighting game veterans to put in the time to take this game to the competative level. At its curent Early-acess state it is missing a story mode, however there is still plenty of content to enjoy including arcade mode, training mode, target practice, local and online multiplayer pvp, and a feature called pixel lobby in which you can costumize your pixel avatar and join a lobby of other players where you can walk around a 8-bit-like rpg world and interact with the people you are fighting. Before closing this review, I would like to point out that the training mode does have a trials mode within the menu while in training mode that shows the player combos for each of the fighters. This helps a lot before fighting the AI or online players as it shows you a few combos that not only allow for you to get in a few extra hits, but also teaches you the mechanics of each fighter and how to effectively use their kit to your advantage. In conclusion, this game is great as a casual or competitive fighter and fills a gap in the fighting genre that connects both newcommers and veterans to a single game that both groups can enjoy. (Also don't let the art and aesthetics of the game discourrage you from playing it, I personaly don't like MLP or any similar shows, but artistically the game looks beautiful and behind the cute art style is a seriously fun and in-depth fighting game.)", "timestamp_created": 1519677085, "timestamp_updated": 1519677172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40423431": {"recommendationid": "40423431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135723326", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519463722}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked it when the horsie punched the goat 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1519676774, "timestamp_updated": 1519676774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40423016": {"recommendationid": "40423016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087820964", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1521657626}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been following this game for years, and It's not that I wouldn't recommend it as I think it's coming along very well, however there are some issues that need to be fixed before I'd recommend purchasing.\n\nPROS:\n- The Characters themselves are appealing and well animated in most places.\n- Diverse characters and environments.\n- Good soundtrack.\n\nCONS:\n- The AI is extremely hard to beat. It isn't impossible but very difficult. They block nearly every move you pull and I have had games where I am repeatedly smashed against the wall and can't do anything.\n- The inputs for combo attacks (especially super attacks) seem very temperamental. Sometimes I can pull it off instantly, whilst other times I can sit there doing the input over and over again but nothing happens. This happens in both Arcade and Training mode.\n- The command list is unclear in places - especially in regards to blocking. It took me a very long time to work out how to block an attack because all the command list showed was attacks that you could do whilst blocking.\n- The controls for training mode are complex, which is a good thing in a way, but equally is a little bit confusing - there are a lot of settings with scales from 1-100 but not much indication of what this changes or by how much. Not a huge issue but would be better if it were a bit clearer.\n- The characters do not stand out enough from the background in certain environments, making the overall game feel crowded and messy. This is especially problematic when it comes to background characters. Requires a better depth of field to gain a separation from the two.\n- The story mode is missing, which is what I would have ideally liked to have played first.\n\n\nOther notes:\n- It would be nice if you could choose the skin your character will have rather than a random selection.\n- There is often a delay at the start of the match causing the characters voiceline to be heard before their mouth animation begins.", "timestamp_created": 1519675437, "timestamp_updated": 1519680437, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479759", "comment_count": "18", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40422312": {"recommendationid": "40422312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019848791", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519826964}, "language": "english", "review": "I waited 7 years for this game, and it's better than I expected.", "timestamp_created": 1519673411, "timestamp_updated": 1519673411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40420662": {"recommendationid": "40420662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078434581", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519615723}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember when this game was Fighting is magic.It was so cool and i STILL OWN BOTH!

I played Arcade Mode, and in the final two battles against the constly blocking and combo-ing Ai can be a bit frustrating, and leave you abusing the fact that they sometimes don't know how to get out of foot-sweeping. This is to be expected, however I had the Ai on Easy, and though I can never complain about a challenge, this seemed less like a challenge and more of a \"ya tried\"\n\nLike I said, the game is absolutely worth the price tag, especially with the content that may be present in the future.

This actually just scales the objects higher as it's built on the 720 Resoultion. \n\nThe amount of reference on Skins are noticeable, from Oleanders DJ and Biznis Skin representing the My Little Pony Show. The game takes alot of resources from their previous game which is fairly noticeable for those who followed the work by Freelancers & Mane6 itself and character attacks, which is really great as the Hitboxes are fair and easily able to tell if you are going to hit them or not.\n\nWhile the game is early access, I can't hestitate a few issues & more suggestions that could make this game benefitial.\nThe game has a known issue for Crashing while going to and from Windowed to Full screen\nPerformance issues when Tabbing Out.\nMissing Audio from alot of Characters and Lip Syncing is off.\nAdditonal Controller support for the Bumpers and triggers would be optimal for those who thrive off fighters (I was pushing A + X to grab Alot)\n\nThe game starts needs a few Tune ups and fixes\nA proper Training mode needs to be introduced, as there is no proper training mode to tell players how to juggle or even launch, while the AI have this Kill feature of pulling off undiscovered combos and techs.\nSome nerfs including Hitboxes on ranged Projectiles size need to be fixed up.\nAlot of work regarding the character dialogue and syncing needs to happen, it feels like two characters were primarily focused.\n\nIt's a beta, but it's great to see a small team work on something so amazing.

and want a good fighting game, pick this up. I had little to no interest prior to it's release but I owned Skullgirls(which grants you a discount) so I figured,  for 11 bucks it's worth checking out. My mind was almost instantly changed to loving what this game has to offer from a gameplay and feature standpoint. \n\n- Character variety rivaling that of Guilty Gear and Blazblue. Puppet characters, zoners, hyper aggressive rushdown with fly mechanics, grapplers, you name it. Somehow with just 6 characters the game managed to have more variety and creativity than that of Marvel or Dragonball.\n\n- More training mode features than any AAA fighter out there. Most notably the ability to save and share combos through files that can be then added to your own game with ease and shown on the screen for you to do. \n\n- Better netcode than most fighters out there(GGPO). Gives you actual ping stats, not just ambiguous bars. GGPO then allows you to also set a delay to better accomate bad connections to make it much more seemless than most fighting games.\n\n- A lobby system that surpasses that of every other game out there, this shit has it's own single player elements woven into the 2d lobby you can run around in. Treasure chests will even appear in this lobby and you can challenge a person trying to open it to see who gets it. The lobbies also feature voice chat and highly accurate ping bars. Which could be toxic and bad for the game, but there is a mute feature and so far nobody has been toxic on the mic to eachother.\n\n- Gameplay is smooth and  intuitive. Combos and moves flow nicely and have enough freedom for higher level players to come up with crazy ways to combo without hurting beginners.", "timestamp_created": 1519627771, "timestamp_updated": 1519628055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40408523": {"recommendationid": "40408523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147588951", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 206, "last_played": 1521172427}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buena jugabilidad, Increible Soundtrack, Buen Netcode, que mas quieres en un fighting game. \nLo unico negativo que le veo son la cantidad de personajes pero al precio que esta, Its worth it. \nSi quiere hechar la reta con tu amigos este puede ser un excelente juego.", "timestamp_created": 1519627680, "timestamp_updated": 1519627680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40407939": {"recommendationid": "40407939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044369863", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520194526}, "language": "english", "review": "Smug french raindeer has no time for your shit", "timestamp_created": 1519625033, "timestamp_updated": 1519625033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40407902": {"recommendationid": "40407902", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989658996", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1922, "last_played": 1521753299}, "language": "english", "review": "First ever fighting game, and I couldn't be happier.

Go buy it now.  \n\nLong Version:  \nI love fighting games and have done for many years, but not just *any* fighting game will do. I'm happy to say this isn't just a low effort game and I would recommend it to any fan of the genre. Them's Fightin' Herds' (TFH) fighting system isn't breaking new ground, but it has enough features to have it's own feel. It feels kind of like a dialed back anime fighter. There are no air dashes, super jumps or double jumps outside of unique, per character passives. The combo system is the usual Light > Medium > Hard fair, but there are variations based on each characters individual moves. The magic button handles auxiliary special moves and features of each character, somewhat similar to Blazblue's 'Drive' system.\n\nPros:\n-Solid fighting game mechanics.\n-Beautiful hand drawn graphics.\n-Great net code (GGPO).\n-Unique characters.\n-Fully, I mean FULLY featured training mode.\n\nCons:\n-Only 6 characters (I think they are adding more later).\n-No story mode (as of this review. It is being added later).\n\nHonestly, if you don't mind the small roster and like fighting games, it is well worth the asking price. Bear in mind, the small roster still represents a lot of variety; there are no shoto clones here and you are sure to find a character you enjoy playing.

I have to elaborate on this, since playing against the bots, you can see them use mechanics that are not explained anywhere. If the game would even list these, it would be passable, but it doesn't. Push-blocking at least seems to be pretty damn prevalent and is not actually explained. Hell, the game doesn't even tell you if there's a throw function. \n- The AI is hard. As in NRS levels of bad in input reading. It's super frustrating for it to react instantly with a ground/air throw on wakeup. \n- It's really early, but a roster of 6 is not good in any shape or form.\n- I guess there's audio desync or something in the animations?

Though it has the stigma of being a \"MLP\" game, about the only connection left at this point is that the current roster has obvious ties to the show's main characters.\n\nI believe the best thing to start with is that the game is paradoxically simple and complex. But in a good way. The simple part comes in from having a basic three attack + unique skill button layout and being chock full of simple easy to use commands(no 360 inputs here!). That said, the combo system used here is the same style as Skull Girls allowing comboes to get quite lengthy and there is also a \"Magic\" meter one must be aware of on top of their super meter which is critical for many of their moves.\n\nIt also pulls off some fairly interesting design choices regarding supers. Typically, characters either have one or multiple supers that are performed with various commands typically with a multibar munching one that is extra powerful. TFH instead takes a newley tread middle ground by sticking supers inside other supers. For example, Arizona has a ramming attack for a super, but with an extra super bar, she can tack on an additional high powered kick. For other characters though, it tends to be a bit more intersting. Paprika can intterupt her super to plop down a picnic basket and then use that as either an escape tool or a way to spam projectiles, Pom can abort the final hit of her super to instead keep a giant dog around for a while and have him attack on command, Oleander simmilarly can end her super early to unleash \"Fred\" and gain access to many new attacks, etc.\n\nOh and it's quite pretty too.

I also have a natural knack for these kinds of games. A few minutes in training mode to fiddle around with the characters and mechanics, and I'm basically ready to compete with high skill level players.\n\nFast forward to somewhere in 2012 and Skullgirls is released, and I have to say, it's been my favorite fighting game the day I downloaded it on my Xbox 360 even until now. I can go on about why it's the perfect fighting game, at least from my perspective, but this isn't a Skullgirls review.\n\nWhile Skullgirls is arguably the best indie fighting game ever made, Them's Fightin' Herds has potential to be the next indie fighter powerhouse. It may be it's close resemblance to Skullgirls in which that it uses the same engine as it, or the hand drawn characters, or the GGPO netcode, but those are all things that made these games spectacular. I've only been playing for a few hours, but it's held my attention more than any fighter that came out since Skullgirls, and that's why I'm certain that this game will proseper.

It seems the build up at the moment, is one that must be quite a while back in development. There are multiple things that are definitely not release quality other than story mode missing. Many characters have fill-in animations, much of the UI feels odd, and even intro animations in battles are wonky and unfinished.\n\nHowever, if you really don't care about these problems, and trust the developer to patch these issues, as they claim they will do soon, then the game itself is great and solid for the most part.\n\nThe game plays as some kind of weird amalgamation of Guilty gear and Blazblue, with a hint of skullgirls feel. The game has a Light, medium, heavy, and a Magic/Gimmick button. Each character has a 'magic' bar in addition to their super meter, somewhat similar to the V-System in Street Fighter V. Every character gains magic in different ways, some over time, others by confirming certain moves.\n\n\nPros!\n+The 6 characters feel varied, and feel unique to each other in their playstyles.\n+The movement and combo flow is extremely fluid and feels great and intuitive once you get practice in. \n+Match-ups seem, at least at face value, mostly evenly matched, and it seems like no character has anything more than a 6-4 matchup on another.\n+The game's training mode, as it is Skullgirl's heavenly Z-Engine, is amazingly robust and has plenty to work with for practice.\n+Pixel Lobby system s'alright, and there is a private lobby system as well.\n+I haven't played the Salt Mines mode yet in the Pixel Lobbies, but from what I've seen and heard it's decently fun\n+The music in the game alone is great, but the dynamic music system adds to an already great soundtrack. It swells and calms down at appropriate moments, and seems to decently follow the pace of the match. Mostly.\n+The animations look and feel great on many of the characters and their attacks, and have a lot of personality to them.\n+The character designs are 'unique' and have a nice artstyle to accompany them.\n\n\nEdit: The first patch has gone out and fixed some of these issues, I've marked them with a @, and moved them lower.\n\n\nCons!\n         -Intros and Victories are so horribly bugged and painful, it kinda deflates a victory. Many of the intros will only have 1 character talking, their mouths flapping at random after they finish their line, while the other is silent but mouthing words. Then, an odd pause later the fight countdown will start. Same with victories.\n     -There is no where NEAR enough lines for characters and their intros/victories. It seems like most have maybe 2 or 3, and some of them will cut themselves off, like Arizona's victory. She has only 3 victory lines, which are all terribly out of sync with her talking, and one of them completely stops at the last line. \"Kickin', Stompin', and Ki-\" gets real old, real fast.\n     -While in theory this would be a good and simple game to have beginners in the fighting game genre start with, there is absolutely no tutorial of any kind for even basic game mechanics. Even the combo trials for the game are hidden inside of training, in the training options.\n     @-Hot damn that AI is a piece of shit.It's understandable that AI in fighting games are always gonna be BS. atleast in some way, this game takes it back to the Mortal Kombat 3 era of enemies being absolute brickwalls with perfect punish strings. It doesn't help the AI isn't even set to Normal by default, it's set to Competent (Hard, essentially) @The AI is now set to normal by default, and it seems to not be so godly at defense and combos. They still occasionally do insane combos after a punish, but fighting a zoner AI won't make you want to bite through your own jaw.\n     @-Damage numbers feel incredibly wonky. As Arizona, a standard bread and butter (Gatling>Launcher>Special>Level1Super) does an okay amount of damage, but heavies from other characters seem to do as much as the simple combos I've figured out so far. It's possible this is on me, but it does feel unfair that a single projectile from Velvet does as much as a standard gatling gun combo. @After playing a bit more, I think I figured out what my problem was, I was fighting a mirror match in practice, and Arizona has a bit more health than others, so after optimizing my combos a bit and trying them on other characters with lower health, it looks like they're mostly fine.\n      @-The art assets on a few stages and characters are absolutely ABYSSMAL. Arizona, on her front fore leg facing the camera on any color that has a splotch, shows that it's almost barely attached to her skin. This is especially bad since her default design has this issue, and colors with monotone colors look better than the default. Some parts of the background stages, specifically the characters, are pixelated to hell and back. @Arizona still has that odd floating splotch, but I can't seem to find any background characters like I saw before the patch with horrible pixels on them.\n\nIf you're looking for a good fighting game, and you're not stopped by a lack of polish and even essential features, this game will do great as a

Despite this being in early access the game is super fun and features some surprisingly technical mechanics (also the dynamic music is great). As a fighting game fan I am highly impressed by Mane 6's work here and am definitely looking forward to the progress this game will exhibit.\n\nDon't be fooled by the cute aesthetic, this game is pretty legit. Also running on the Z-Engine which was developed by Lab Zero Games for Skullgirls (another fantastic 2D fighter btw) and it clearly shows.\n\nI'm in no way even remotely a fan of MLP. But this is just a fun game I could recommend to any casual or hardcore fighting game fans. If you have any questions/concerns and whatnot leave a comment and I will gladly try and answer with the best of my ability.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

It's well put together with great visuals, music, and even character design, but it also lacks what a good fighting game should have: a decent roster. Now, I understand the direction to an extent, they wanted to make a smaller cast of more unique fighters instead of a bunch of interchangeble ones like how most fighting games end up having it, and in that regard, they succeeded. The six fighters present at launch do fill very different niches well, but the thing is, that's still only six fighters in the roster. Even Skullgirls, a game that went a similar route with its roster, still had eight characters from the start, and many more added later.\nSo then, even with the one chracter planned to be added to Fightin' Herds, that still only gives us seven, and six or seven fighters does not create a very varied match expierence.

The character roster may be a tad small, but the current six characters are each unique and have different playstyles, not to mention the pallette references, oh the pallette references. Also, I don't care what you've heard, you don't have to be a fan of any cartoon show to appreciate this game. \n\nThe game also uses the Z-Engine, which you may have heard of from Lab Zero and their game, Skullgirls, who helped the devs of Them's Fightin Herds, Mane6, by letting them use the Z-Engine here. \n\nCurrently it includes a single player arcade mode, training and target mode, with story mode currently being worked on to be released soon in episodic format for free. Multiplayer modes include a lobby play function, and the pixel lobby, which is essentially a lobby with avatars from which you can challenge other players to 1v1 fights, and get cosmetic hats in the pve salt mines. \n\nThe Game's lore is also fairly interesting (the lore info is on Mane6's website) as well as the overall aesthetic of both the characters and world. The world and characters are somewhat adorable, but that doesn't detract from the fighting by no means. For those of you out there who are fans of a certain TV Show.....y'all might be interested to know that Lauren Faust helped to design the characters and world as well. \n\nNow, to end this review on a high note, allow me to just ask you a simple question\n\nWhat other game allows you to play as a headbanging cow or sorceress with a necronomicon on the same engine as Skullgirls for ONLY 15 dollars? None?

support.\n\nThem's fightin' herds is a 2D fighter that works with a four button scheme. There are only six fighters so far, move sets & inputs aren't complicated to perform as one would think. And to make it better, the movesets themselves are as simplistic as UMVC3. despite the fact there's not a 2v2 or 3v3 mode, that makes picking one of these characters to main even easier as opposed to being forced to pick 3 members, then an assist move for each.\nRight now the arcade mode, target mode, and practice mode are the only things you can do locally, but then there's online. Is the netcode for online good? YES. I most framerate drop I ever experiecned was maybe 2-3 frames during online fight. To give you some perspective, Street fighter 5...it has moments it drops 7+ frames making awkward skips in the battle to catch up. So for the most of the game, you'll be playing in lobbies online.\nThe lobbies themselves are these cute pixel area's to walk around in. As far as finsing items or cosmetics, i have no clue. haven't spent enough time out there. But its more entertaining than looking at a menu screen to say the least.\nSince the game is only a day old, running into other people is always there. And until the game progresses enough and the community surrounding it grows, there won't be many them's fightin herds tourney's or locals of any kind.\nIts clear that competition is in mind from the devs. there is just yet to be enough time for things to be worked into the game. If your so worried, keep in mind, its an indie game in early access. it'll get there someday.\n\nThe game is in early access as in, WOW you can be reminded of that easily with some drops in framerate, the occasional crash, or lip syncing not working.\nFor the most part, the only bugs I encountered were those, and with one I hope is only a visual hit box not aapearing in training mode. \nIt also supports the use of fight sticks, which came at some surprise. I expected it to require me to go into a menu and switch controllers and remap the controls along with dealing input lag, but no. I put it in, click. and its good.\n\nFor those who want to take it seriously, just play online for awhile and lets work to build a community around this game. Thats the healthiest thing for any fighter.\nuntil the game gets fleshed out some more, to later be a full release, I give Them's fightin herds\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1519426717,

little pony, and furry, lovers of the world, HOWEVER.\nIn it's current state, it is a garbage game. the game is very very hard to enjoy, some moves don't connect, almost every charecter on the rostrer doesnt have an intro or outro, the supers dont do much damage, and every charecter is missing 2-10 sprites a piece. \n\nIn it's current state, I have no reason to reccomend it unless you like the things I mentioned above, as a fighting game its lacking, but it's fun for those who love the combos and the charecters.\n\nI also have a huge issue with the unfinished nature of the stages, they are clearly not done, looking like polygon messes.\nanyway, buy it if you want to, or if you wanna support the devs but I can't reccomend it till it's a finished game.\n\n", "timestamp_created":

Even though I have played games like Street Fighter, Marvel vs Capcom, Mortal Kombat, Skullgirls, and Soulcalibur to name a few, none of those games really held my interest for very long, even if I liked some of them. Now in comes TFH and changes my outlook on fighting games forever.\n\nPros:\n- Cute and charming characters that can appeal to all audiences\n- Extensive training modes to help you understand how to play from beginner to master\n- Incredible variety in character skins. Nowhere have I seen so many alt colors for characters\n- Varying difficulty levels\n- Wonderful soundtrack\n- Lag-free online matches\n\nCons: (as of this writing)\n- Incomplete animations\n- Menus can be confusing to navigate\n- Some bugs\n- Only six characters (but there will be more in the future)\n- Missing story and CPU vs mode\n\nOverall, in its current state, I give the game an 8/10 with the potential to go higher in the near future.

It's probably one of the better ones to start out with too since it has the common light, medium, heavy, and special attack buttons, and other functions like grabbing is a combination of two of the buttons, but none of the complex mechanics that can overwhelm newer players.\n\nThis is clearly an Early Access review, and at this point in time (one day after it's Early Access release) it definitely seems like within the next few months this game will be more than complete, by which I mean they will continually add free story mode expansions.\n\nRight now, there are 6 characters, no story mode, but the arcade and online (using unexpectedly-fun Pixel Lobby) modes work completely fine. So far only one character has a couple missing animations, and they have place-holders which just look like stick figures, but before you roll your eyes over this fact it honestly doesn't change gameplay whatsoever and after seeing it once you know that the placeholder does it's job very well. Right now it's definitely playable and a good idea to do so if you like learning new games early/watching the growth and development of certain games. For me, 2D fighters are my favorite game genre so I'll enjoy watching this one improve.\n\n\nIf you have played any 2D fighters made by Arc System Works, this is specifically directed towards you: If you took Blazblue and just removed air-grabs, air-dashing, double jumps, super (high) jumps, recovery rolls, barrier guard, Burst/Overdrive icon, and Astral Heat, you would essentially have this game.", "timestamp_created": 1519414256, "timestamp_updated": 1519661608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40335713": {"recommendationid": "40335713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110252023", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519640744}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 , \u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f . \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u044b\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f . \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435 Pixel lobby \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431 \u043f\u043e\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043c\u0438 )", "timestamp_created": 1519413557, "timestamp_updated": 1519413557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40334794": {"recommendationid": "40334794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153244572", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 874, "last_played": 1521562411}, "language": "english", "review": "This was defenitely worth the wait.

Fightn' Herds[/b] is your normal 2D fightning game. Except it's filled with animals to fight with as opposed to humans or mutants. The game's controls are [u]really really easy[/u] to pick up and play. That means if you're fairly new to playing games like Skull girls this is a breeze. Otherwise, You the new player, does not need to sweat it, just learn the moves first and make sure you have a controller to play with. There isn't too much to hightlight in general since it's still [u]subject to change[/u].\n\n[h1]Adorable Characters w/ Voice!!![/h1]\nEach character has their own unique voice and playstyle. Although, they are adorable to to play around with they all have pretty simple combos to use against players. Others having their unique playstyle to combo and their pretty nice defensive moves. This allows you to easily counter players who have you stun locked and give them a nice surprise!\n\n[h1]Multiplayer![/h1]\nThe game has split screen support and online multiplayer lobbies called \"Pixel Lobby\". It has a similar layout to \"Pony Town\" the online flash game, but it allows you to dress your characters and fight with them. The lobby has enemies to fight NPCs as well and an easy to use chat the system.\n\n[h1]Training & your quick pay off[/h1]\nDon't be tempted by previous fightning games that have confusing combos. Them's Fightn' Herd allows you to practice your relatively simple moves in any matter you would like and there are people in game that are willing to help you train as well. Generally, You have to pay attention to your opponents range and what attack is apporpriate for their distance. I picked up the range and moves to use so fast, I was generally surprised with myself.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nWhile this is still a new game, You can generally point out which characters still need work. Genearally speaking, their characters design still seems to be in progress. However, the characters are pretty well designed, in terms of their \"art design attack\", which is the animation whenever they attack. The scenery is also very pretty and has matching music to really get the player ready for their opponent.\n\nOverall..\nIf you're new to fightning games try it out! It's really easy to pick up and learn.\n\nIf you already have [u]Skull Girls...[/u] You get a [b] DISCOUNT [/b] for the game.

You can also dress your charecter in their pixel form with a bunch of items. Skull girls players will get 2 hats and a neck piece.\n\nThe pixel version of the charecter you pick matters as there is a feature in the game that allows you to go salt mining in the caves of the lobby world and find chests full of salt but in the caves are shadowy predators of herd animals that will chase your pixel charecter and begin a fight. They will keep coming until you have been beaten. The pixel charecter you chose will be the charecter you fight off the predators with.\n\nIt is important to note that the game is still in early access meaning that it is not quite complete yet and some charecters still have frames of attacks that need to be finished first. Currently the game has card board cut out like sketches as replacements for missing frames on some charecters and their attacks. Some of these are quite distracting. I have no doubt that they will look as nice as the rest of the animations once complete though.\n\nOne personal complaint I have about how the game plays is the dashing, it is short and does not close much of a distance making getting in close for an attack difficult. I have encounterd multiple fights where I have had to dash many times to get close to the other player as they keep a large distance with ranged attacks. This is a problem in many fighting games but with the dash in this game it feels harder to close the gap than others.\n\nLike Skull Girls this game is a good game to start with for those of you who that may be intrested in getting into 2d fighting games.", "timestamp_created": 1519406967, "timestamp_updated": 1519406967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40332804": {"recommendationid": "40332804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141064446", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520332320}, "language": "english", "review": "The only fighting game where it forced me to buy an arcade stick to git gud", "timestamp_created": 1519405940, "timestamp_updated": 1519405940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40332687": {"recommendationid": "40332687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070696085", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1521238371}, "language": "english", "review": "Do not buy this game...

Aber zum Gl\u00fcck teilt nicht jeder diese Meinung und somit kam der Tag, an dem ein Mitglied des Entwickler-Teams von Mane6, einen super Einfall hatte. Es m\u00fcsste ungef\u00e4hr so abgelaufen sein: \n\"Hey Leute, was haltet ihr von der Idee, wenn wir Ponys, K\u00fche und Lamas gegeneinander k\u00e4mpfen lassen?

Aber sie bek\u00e4mpfen sich mit Feuer, Laser und schwarzer Magie und so. Bei\u00dfen und kratzen, schlagen und treten, spucken und schie\u00dfen. Halt so richtig B\u00c4M! So richtig in die Fresse und so!  Und mit schicker 2D-Grafik und Spielstil und Animationen, wie in diesen typisch japanischen Pr\u00fcgelgames \u00e0 la BlazBlue oder Guilty Gear. Na was haltet ihr davon?\"\n\"Mensch, geile Idee! Und dann machen wir noch so eine Lobby, wo sich die Spieler treffen und sich gegenseitig herausfordern k\u00f6nnen.

The fighting isn't hard to learn but maintains the heart of a fighting game without becoming a jugglefest (due to a juggle cap, which is an incredible feature).\n\nThe pixel lobby is a great idea. Like in Dragon Ball FighterZ, there's a lobby of 20 players where you can choose your favorite character, put a hat or neckless on them for fun, and chat in the lobby. You start multiplayer fights there, make friends, or be silly with random people! It's my favorite addition to the game.\n\nFrom a DMCA take-down to a Steam release, I'm glad to finally be a part of the process of a kickstarted game, watching it grow over the years into what it is, and look forward to seeing where it goes now.\n\nI don't even like fighting games.

This is why you should not buy it [b]yet[/b].\nThis game does not that different from other fightning games which are actually working.\n\nThe problems are...\n\u25d8 [b]Some of the animations and sounds are not finished.[/b] Meaning that, you will see animation frames when your character will be a doodle, and skills which are just pencil drawings. And won't hear any sound at some point either. (It is an early access, yes. But this is the first time when I see a game with doodles in it. Releasing a game like that is just silliness.)\n\u25d8 [b]Scripting errors[/b] making your time harder, using your abilities are not guaranteed when you press the key combination for it. Sometimes you need to press the keys slower, sometimes faster. Putting them into a combo is not easy, not working all the time when you just do the same moves thus you lose your combo.\n\u25d8 [b]Set up the controls is a pain.[/b] There is a [u]must have[/u] player 2 in the game that you cannot turn off. If you want to use this game alone and so config your keyboard like that, then you need to configure the player 2's controls first and put its keys away, like next to the ENTER key.\n\n\nIt is obviously would be an enjoyable fightning game just like the other titles...

Grabbing attacks are also unfinished: you have characters suddenly being flung across the screen as the other does a slide show representation of what a disappointed hug looks like. I can't wait for these to be properly implemented. They'll add a whole 'nother level of fun and make the game feel more finished.\n\n- Paprika's saddle cloth is clipping through her neck in her idle animation.\n\n- One of the stages, Tianhuo's specifically, doesn't have any variations. Others have hardly any, at least compared to Velvet's stage. Again, I'm assuming that these too are still in the oven and more will be on the way. Can't wait.\n\n- Making the Pixel Lobby's controls more obvious (eg. referencing them in the controller menu and referencing them in the top right corner of the screen along with the server's stats and lobby settings) would definently help us keyboard peasants just so we're not mashing our keys to figure out how to exit a lobby if we impatiently skip the 2 slide tutorial (I actually did this, and was in a world of regret for half-an-hour). The other lobbies are still being worked on.\n\nWhen these things get fixed I will wholeheartedly recommend this game. For now though, I'd hold onto your wallet.

Definitely a lot of potential for this one to grow.\n\nSome standout positives have been:\n+ Great animation (with a few exceptions in certain visuals)\n+ AMAZING soundtrack\n+ The feel of gameplay is just as good as you'd expect from most anime fighters\n+ Netcode and the pixel lobby experience has been a treat.\n\nOf course this is an early access title and there are some changes I'd like to see made:\n- This game heavily assumes you have prior fighting game knowledge and can be off-putting to newcomers, as evidenced by other Steam reviews\n- Combo trials are buried within 3 Training menus, definitely would like to see them in their own mode\n- There is no proper tutorial when you first jump in. The game's tutorial, as of right now, is pause the game and look at your command list. A proper playable introduction in the vein of Guilty Gear, etc. is essential imo.\n- A couple of visuals are off-putting. Velvet's Tornado is a moving jpeg. Backgrounds are almost completely static. These are nitpicks, but polish in these areas can go a long way.\n- The six characters the game has now are quite varied and unique, but I would love to see at least double this roster in the future.\n\n/ And of course there's the elephant in the room. My Little Pony. I do not like My Little Pony. I am not a brony. I have accepted the fate that if I play this game I will be labeled a brony. I will die with no regrets.\n\nI can look past it all.

I liked the combat moves and the dynamic music. Even though I'm not used to fighting games I can appreciate how good it feels to rack up combos. But, the game falls short in pretty much every other way.\n\nFirst, let me address the missing story line. I might not be a game developer, but you don't need to be a chef to tell if the food is burnt. How exactly do they have an error in the story so large that it causes you to delay it's release? This should've been figured out months ago through beta testing. Regardless of how \"busy\" the progammers are.\n\nAnother major gripe of the game is how there is no quick play. This has nothing to do the story so why is this missing from the game? Another thing missing is the pixel lobbies that were present in the trailer. Unless I'm looking in the wrong place, there is only one pixel lobby and it's very small. There's nothing to do in it either. Unless you count collecting \"salt\" which only purpose is to gain access to the salt mine which just allows you to collect more salt.\n\nCould there possibly be more missing content? Yes, there is. There is still place holder art present all over the game. The salt mine exits are black squares and some attack animations for the characters are just cardboard drawings. How could they have originally planned to release the full game while still using placeholder art?\n\nTheres a lot more I could nitpick like how I have no idea which skins are the backer only ones or how the voice lines don't match the lips of the characters (often times the the right character isn't even talking). But there really is no point in talking about the flaws in a game that wasn't even finished.

The reason you don't typically see indie fighting games is because they are extremely difficult to develop. But, I figured since the developers were able to license the Skullgirls engine and had the blessing of Lauren Faust, that it would at least be a good start. It also helps that I hate Hasbro as much as any (ex)Brony.\n\nThe first major issue is that half of the animations are missing. I get its early access, but all that is hinted at in the information box is that the story mode is being developed and maybe some balancing needs to be done. Not the fact that half of the art needs to be developed. \n\nSecondly, the AI, while not a major role in these kinds of games, is absolute bottom of the barrel trash. Seriously. Normal / competent mode left me dead from a 38 hit combo on the first fight. Easier difficulties just made the characters guard and run away constantly. If I'm supposed to use AI as a practice point, then the developers have certainly failed. You think since they licensed an engine, enemy AI (which is one of the more difficult parts to develop) would be included. I played Skullgirls. That game had great AI. Actually, calling it \"intelligence\" is an insult.\n\nThirdly, the game's gimmicks and controls are by far the most confusing thing I have ever seen. Magic is nearly useless. Only a few moves use it and they are barely effective. They either do minimal damage (Paprika) or have absurdly limited range (Arizona). It appears you also can't regain magic (or regain it easily), so instead of focusing a few good moves for a combo, you just barely hit the enemy sometimes maybe who knows. Also, the move execution is the dumbest thing ever. All the inputs are mostly the same. This is fine and good for beginners and veterans alike. However, the inputs that are standardized are bizzare and don't come from any fighting game I've played. The supers require you to hold 2 attack buttons. Not press it twice, but hold both at the same time. It's not quarter circle + punch, it's not a direction + magic, but quarter circle + two buttons at once. Confusing in both practice and when communicating the moves to the player. I legit thought half the moves were broken.\n\nThe fourth and most glaring issue is that the 6 characters are obviously carbon copies of the ponies from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. They all have the same personalities and move styles (when they aren't ripping off King of Fighters character's move sets). I get a response would be \"that's not an important part of the game\"! But characters are actually important. They draw you into the game more easily. Imagine Mario was a red rectangle or a guy named \"Jim\". Would the games still be remembered as icons? They would probably still get favorable reviews, but would be criticized as bland or lazy. And that's just what this game is. \n\nThis is honestly the first Steam game I've refunded. It's sad as unique fighting games are a rarity outside of foreign arcade machines. Yet, to be candid, I honestly feel this game is doomed. The pony basis, despite it no longer existing, has greatly polarized the game already. The fanboys will defend the game uncritically, while the game itself suffers to the curious.

Unfortunately, \u201cthe least\u201d is about all I can say right now.\n\nComing into TFH as someone curious about fighting games, it wasn\u2019t a pleasant introduction. My previous experiences range from Skullgirls to Street Fighter, but only as a casual player. Skullgirls, for me, is more or less the epitome of exciting, fast fighting. It differentiates itself from other fighting games through its art style, music and general atmosphere, as well as many of its quirks that other games don\u2019t even consider.\n\nUnfortunately, TFH attempted the very same thing, but found little in the way of success. Where Skullgirls has a fantastic tutorial to teach newcomers everything they\u2019ll need to know, TFH has no tutorial. Where Skullgirls has a very interesting and unique roster, TFH feels trapped in its own characters, as they tried faithfully to remain true to the original cast from its predecessor. What came of this is a cast with odd, exaggerated characteristics. However, this is only a factor for those coming to TFH from FiM, and not from outside this game and its history.\n\nWhile this title is an Early Access title, Mane6 mentioned that the Story Mode will be omitted until later. What they failed to mention however, is that AI Matches, Quick Play, Ranked Play and Extras are also missing. This was not mentioned on the store page, and stripping this much from the full release, this close to release date (mere days before) felt like a disservice to fans everywhere.\n\nWhile Lobby Play is still functional, that might be the only word for it. I could join matches, fight others and return to the lobby. However, more times than not, I would be presented with a \u201cLobby Protocol\u201d error, a random failure message, or even an empty error box. Being kicked from a lobby also feels as though it was a rushed feature, and in my limited experience, it hardly works. Many lobbies I joined, I sat and waited several seconds (think 30+) and nothing would happen. No fight would start, there was no lobby voice or text chat, and I would be left idling.\n\nThe game has crashed on me around three times in the three hours I\u2019ve played. Once while changing options, once while opening the game (it crashed before reaching the main menu) and once while in the Pixel Lobby. Additionally, while in the online lobby area, my selector graphic disappeared, and I could no longer see what I was selecting. The only fix was to restart the game.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nWhen this game works, it really works. Once you find a good match, the combat is incredibly fun. The four-button system makes practicing much easier than other, six-button fighters, and each character has vastly-different play styles from one-another. Some prefer to stay at a range, others prefer to be up in your face. The difference between characters is, frankly, staggering to witness, even while just practicing with the roster in Training.\n\nVery rarely did I lose a round or match, and feel it wasn\u2019t my fault. I always felt that my mistakes were mine and mine alone, and that the opponent simply outplayed me. This is a good sign. Never feeling as though you lose control is a very hard thing to pull off in fighting games, but Mane6 has done this flawlessly. Just keep in mind that the skill curve of this, and many fighting games, is steep. A side effect of that is that even a few hours of experience can ascend you and your capabilities, making newbies feel unwelcome, especially if you jump online as soon as you start playing. Practice first, or you\u2019ll regret it!\n\nThe few stages and characters are made up for beautifully by how much polish each has received. The characters and their animations look excellent, the stages are well-detailed, and the music in this game is, of course, phenomenal. Anybody coming from FiM should know what to expect. The dynamic music is also awesome, and really adds to the action.\n\nAny fight stick based on Xinput should work just fine with this game, but I am not sure about Dinput. I was able to plug in my Qanba Carbon and be off to the races almost immediately. Note however, that you\u2019ll need to configure your stick in the options with your keyboard first, as it doesn\u2019t seem to have any defaults. \n\nThe menus in this game, unlike other fighting games, leave much to be desired. While they\u2019re functional, they\u2019re certainly nothing to look at. It\u2019s very possible that I am simply spoiled by Skullgirls, however. I would have liked to see more attention to detail in this area though. \n\nOverall, [I]Them\u2019s Fightin\u2019 Herds[/I] looks to be a promising fighter, but Mane6\u2019s claim of this being a v0.95 release is far from the truth. In all actuality, this was more of a tech demo than a near-full release. There\u2019s too much missing, and the game needs a lot of polish before it can truly shine. For now, I cannot recommend this game, but I will remain hopeful and keep a keen eye on it, as I know that it can be great with a little bit of TLC. \n\n[H1]The Good[/H1]\n[list]\n    [*]A greatly-varied roster with unique playstyles and personalities.\n    [*]Excellent music.\n    [*]Great art style.\n    [*]Addictive, rewarding and simple-to-learn combat.\n    [*]Based on the same engine as Skullgirls, meaning great performance, combat flow and unique-to-the-genre design quirks.\n[/list]\n\n[H1]The Bad[/H1]\n[list]\n    [*]Several missing features, including Story Mode, Quick Match, Ranked Match, AI Match, Extras.\n    [*]Semi-frequent crashes.\n    [*]Some audio sync issues with SFX and voices lines in-game.\n    [*]Odd bugs with the lobby, including weird error messages, connection issues and more.\n    [*]No tutorial.\n    [*]Several areas of the game feel rushed.\n    [*]Missing a lot of polish that would make it feel much better to play.\n[/list]\n\nGood luck, Mane6!", "timestamp_created": 1519375515, "timestamp_updated": 1519375614, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602872", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40322249": {"recommendationid": "40322249", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995041633", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "last_played": 1520735054}, "language": "english", "review": "i absolutely suck at fighting games but i've had a ton of fun with this so far!

It's your typical Lauren Faust art, simplistic yet detailed, smooth yet much depth, forward yet much care put into them. The backgrounds follow what most 2D games attempt to do, make a 3D or layered background: that means the backgrounds have depth to them that help wrap the player into the game.\n\nNext to mention is the gameplay. Everything flows very well, as a person who plays many fighting games I can happily say this game nails it. I personally tend to struggle with arena sizes and height of characters (generally how high they jump or how far the screen goes up) which is a constant down fall in fighters that either tug the screen so one player is out of the screen, or the arena is too big and i'm left helpless against some spammer with no approach... Hugo mains lyf. This game mirrors Skullgirls, the game it's built off of engine wise, with a decently sized arena and abilities that use said space pretty well, I myself taking Pom under my wing and letting me float around as I need.\n\nWhich leads me to characters. The only concern I have going into this game is the ability for characters to abuse range, long or mid range, I often struggle against people who have the fast, instant range bolts or massive area mid attacks when playing with friends, though to answer that most characters lacking in that department have answers. Paprika does... whatever Paprika does, some good range mixed with tossing stuff. Pom (my spirit animal no doubt) has a float that juuuust tops off some projectiles, as well as her evasive dash that can either set you up or bait depending on the light or heavy varients you use. The designs are brilliant and unique, and stick to quirks that I personally find just adorable to no ends. Silly llama, southern belle cow with an attitude, shy sheep, angry warmonger dragon, it's all so great for design.\n\nAs a fighting game, this game isn't hard, and it isn't easy, it's a solid inbetween. You struggle but the layouts are so simple you can quickly pick it up, everything seems very balanced except a few small adjustments needing to be done (which, early access, duh).\n\nI have high hopes for this game, and I hope Mane6 sticks with it and makes it a brilliant game it deserves to be!", "timestamp_created": 1519366950, "timestamp_updated": 1519366950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40320019": {"recommendationid": "40320019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050481008", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519504180}, "language": "english", "review": "Great fighting game even with the little amount of content it currently has.

I really wouldn't mind if the game was any fun to play, but it definitely isn't. The game isn't fun.\n\nLet's compare it to Smash Bros because that's a fighting game I actually like. In that game each character has the same control scheme. You have your up A, side A, etc, then up B side B and so on. That makes it a lot easier to 1. learn the basics and 2. remember how to execute the move you need to do when in the middle of a fight.\n\nIn this game, each of the 6 characters has completely different controls for all their moves. For some reason fighting game enthusiasts jump at the chance to memorize a page of 20 unique button combos per character and 15 generic combos across all characters. In Smash Bros that isn't an issue because the different moves have the same buttons. In this game all the different moves have all different buttons.\n\nIn fighting games where knowing all the moves is REQUIRED to be any good and have fun, that one decision made their game take 10 times harder to learn and play.

I'm so, so very sorry.\n\nI want to recommend this game. I backed this game. I've followed it for many years now. I've watched every stream, and chated a bit on the forums with the community. I've been on the rollercoaster ride for so long I never thought this would be what I got on release.\n\nI'm just going to break down the pros and cons because this is really painful for me:\nPros:\nThe animation (what's there) is nice and fluid. It's clear there was a lot of work put into it.\nThe systems are well thought out and work together very well without cluttering the screen with meters\nThe dynamic music system is amazing and the music itself is also top notch.\nThe community (at least as of right now) is not a toxic cesspit like many other fighting game communities\nThe move inputs are nicely simplified without being brainless\nThe netcode is great\n\nCons: (I'm going to say that these can all be fixed with time in early access and infact have a lot more to do with miscommunication with the devs)\nSome animations are unfinished. Some are unfinished in ways that break move telegraphs\nSome balancing issues (Pom is absolutely impenetrable to learn, and even then I'm not sure if she is viable. Some of Oli's movie lack any kind of telegraph or tell making them free damage unless you are a prediction monster, I had to stop playing as Pap because I felt she was way too overpowered)\nThe game is not analog input friendly, this isn't a big issue if you have a controller with a dpad or a fight stick, but if you are using a steam controller (like I am) you will have a lot of problems crouch blocking\nThe netcode, while very stable, is misleading. I have awful lag with players with green connection strength, but some matching I've played with red strength ran flawlessly,\n\nMy final complaint is that the devs, while seeming to be trying to be as transparent as possible, can be needlessly cryptic,\n\nI don't feel robbed like other crowdfunded games, and I truly do hope these issues can be fixed in time, however I can not recommend buying this game in its current state.\n\nThe day this game is updated to be a presentable product, even if it's not fully finished, I will change this review to reflect how it is at that point.

The animations are solid, the voice acting beautiful and the fighting fluid and quick. This is definitely a combo fighter's game for sure.\n\nPros:\n-Music is amazing and the dynamic music system runs almost flawlessly\n-Pixel lobby is a great way to experience and explore the realms, though I wish there was more to do in them. It's early access so can't expect a huge amount.\n-Fighting is crisp and fluid, though the characters feel a bit heavy at times. Makes your hits seem sharper and more damaging, but it makes it a bit harder to start and maintain decent combos.\n-Lauren Faust's designs are beautiful, the voice acting is spot on, and the multiple color pallate options give each character a sense of personalization that you don't get from other games where characters may only have 2-6 colors.\n\nCons:\n-The game, especially the arcade mode AI, is insanely unforgiving for inexperienced players. Combos can be hard to get started and maintain, and when you are trapped in an AI's combo it ranges from hard to downright impossible to break free without taking around 20-30 hits.\n- Some content is missing, though the developers are upfront about it and what we have avaliable is well worth the price of admission. This isn't a critism as much as it is me wanting that missing content (Story Mode, Quick Match, etc.)\n- The roster is small. This doesn't bother me in the slightest because there is so much to learn in the game I could spend hundreds of hours learning and mastering the movesets of the 6 characters. Would I like to see more characters and lore in the future, of course. What we have however is amazing.\n- Just not enough to do in the pixel lobby right now.\n\nAll in all TFH is an amazing game, well worth the journey from Fighting Is Magic, and I really hope to see more content and more tweaking in the future.

It is the testimony that crowdfunded games can still be made and not be awful. It's the very opposite of awful. It is amazing.\nThe inclusion of a pixel lobby transforms what would have otherwise been just another fighter game(but with quadrupeds), into an almost RPG like game... you could probably role play too if you were so inclined. I've spent hours playing the dungeon raids to get more interesting wearables and it is fun. The fighting feels good and exciting and the graphics are beautiful.\nThere are a few graphics and artwork missing here and there and some still having the sketch placeholder but those are just in a couple of places. They delivered an almost complete game, it was stable with only one minor crash when I changed resolution but it didn't reproduce. \nThe game works really well with a controler (tested with Xbox 1 controller), and has a voice chat and text chat, as well as a small board with quick responses such as Hello, GGWP, and a couple quick question buttons to ask others to fight you or train with you or maybe reconsider that rematch they declined.\nThe game's roots from the original Fighting is Magic are still present. The characters are very familiar to anyone who has watched MLP:FiM, yet they are completely new and unique. They truly managed to strike the center of the target. Making something completely new and giving players exactly what they had wanted back in 2013. An amazing quadruped fighter game.\nNetcode worked quite well. When playing with nearby players or even slightly further away the experience was good.\nThough if you intended to match with your friend from Australia you may experience issues with performance and everything stuttering. Which isn't to say the game is bad, quite the opposite, the game deals well with the issues of high latency, as much as it can. It's just not a problem that can be fixed, unless someone makes a really fast internet connection from Europe to Australia. Players are given an option to tweak some settings and try to achieve better experience while playing with distant friends. I've not had the time to test or play with them but the game does well with default ones, even recommending different values so you don't have to do the guesswork.\nThe game comes with plenty of options for new players to practice, such as practicing their moves and combos without time limit or health limit, and you can also do it with another person if you want to take your practice to the next level and simulate real battles with your friend.  You can play against an AI in arcade and practice your skills against someone who is very much not fair (though you can make the AI easy, normal and so on all the way up to unfair difficulty). The game also has a list of challenges you can complete in the Target mode where you have to destroy the target's in a specific way as quickly as you can.\n\nIf the game is this good on release, who know's what it will be like when they polish it up with updates and the additional character the Goat, and the Linus/MacOS support. Unfortunately the Story Mode didn't make it into the release but I will definitely eagerly await for them to finish this piece of the game. Cause who doesn't like a story mode?\nHappy Fighting.", "timestamp_created": 1519357697, "timestamp_updated": 1519357781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40317668": {"recommendationid": "40317668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008568330", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1521557658}, "language": "english", "review": "In all honesty, I look forward to seeing what this game can become rather than what it is right now. I almost guarentee that this will be at EVO next year as some kind of niche' tourney, but at the moment for this year, not so much. In particular with Oleander, there are alot of sprites in game that arent in the game quite yet and have been cartoonishly drawn over (literally in crayon) to show what the character will be doing. They also are planning on adding pre-fight character motions, but those arent in there yet and the lip-sync is really off except for Velvet. Overall tho, this is an extremely addictive fighting game that uses unique mechanics on the A button on the game pad. Whether that is lasso whipping with Arizona, chucking potted plants and broccoli as Paprika, or ordering your dogs to attack as Pom, it definatly a nice and refreshing change of pace from the normal bipedal human jobbers in all other fighting games.

Though the character's animations are unfinished, they move beautifully and the attack animations have a lot of charm. The pixel lobby is pretty neat, too, and contains a \"hidden\" adventure mode that puts a new flavor inside what would otherwise be a typical fighting game.\n\nThe online mode is neat, with the aforementioned pixel lobby functioning as a \"hub\" for players in the lobby to chat, dress up their pixel avatars, and start fights. It's all fairly seamless and the lag isn't terrible, which is good, since, as an Australian, lag is a constant concern in a fast paced fighting game.\n\nI'm not particularly proficient in fighting games, though, and my only method of play is with the keyboard, and this seems more appropriately played with a fightstick. In addition, some character's moves have wonky hitboxes and too often I find myself being bodied by things that I was certain I was avoiding. The CPU difficulty is also bizzarely balanced, with \"normal\" difficulty being on par with the worst kinds of input reading CPUs I've ever seen. The game is still in beta, so while it can be changed, it does pose a significant obstacle to someone new to the game.\n\nAll in all, the game is a fine addition to the fighting game genre, but I doubt it will change the minds of those prejudiced against it because of where it came from. If you can get over that, you'll find a solid fighter with some growing pains that the devs will hopefully address in the coming months.

That said, I'm going to be requesting a refund on this one. I'll do my best to explain, because I do believe this game has a lot of heart and potential.\n\n1. I don't like to use the \"standard\" 4 button control scheme, with \"special\" assigned to the A(Xbox)/X(PS4) button, then light, med, heavy going clockwise from there. I prefer to have A/X be the light attack, X/Square med, Y/Triangle heavy, and B special. Upon changing my scheme, however, that caused the B button to start acting as the A button would in the menus, and the Y button becoming the cancel. Some games have an option to change this, but I didn't see one here. This is almost a deal breaker for me, as it's a very simple functionality that should be in place already.\n\n2. While the art and overall style of the game, and especially the characters and their movesets is fantastic, the game is simply too barebones for me in its current state. If you are only interested in the game for the fighting mechanics, well then I think you will be satisfied. I gave this game a chance because I thought I'd be happy with it even during the early access period, but it just doesn't have the features I expect in a fighting game.  And, as quoted from the devs below: \n\"It is mostly feature complete to our intended amount and type of content for a Full release.\" There's not even a way to have simple matches with AI partners outside of the Arcade mode yet. There's no challenge mode in place to familiarize yourself with the characters movesets. I knew there was no story mode yet, but what I didn't notice until now is that the story mode will be released piecemeal, and I'm not thrilled about that idea and generally don't like the paradigm of releasing in chapters - even if it's going to be free. \n\n3. I generally don't play these sorts of games online,  but rather with friends in person, so I can't comment on the functionality there. \n\n\nEDIT: I did not realize that owners of Skullgirls (myself included) got a 4 dollar discount when purchasing the game. Still leaving the next part for posterity. This short paragraph is the only edit I have made to the original review, and any others that may be made in future shall be noted.\n\n4. Lastly, I just went and checked out this game's Indiegogo page. The lowest price all of those 4500+ people payed for this game was $15 bucks. I had no idea this game existed until today, and yet I paid 4 bucks less than they did. I'd be a bit annoyed about that if I was them, as the discount should be given to those who believed in the project from an earlier point in time, in my opinion. However, it's possible those people who backed it wouldn't mind at all, because they liked the project that much. Still, it seems unfair.\n\nI'm sorry I had to give a negative review, and I don't feel good about it. It's clear that a lot of time has been put into creating the characters and theirs abilities, and I hope that none of you who read this think less of the game because of my review. I would encourage anyone to give it a try, especially those who are fans of games like Skullgirls and perhaps even fans of a certain tv show. (I've never seen the show, personally!) I'm clearly the odd one out here, as there are nothing but glowing reviews. I can only give my honest opinion in the end, and this is it. \n\nI may come back at a later point in time to see what the game has become, but for now, it's just not what I was looking for.", "timestamp_created": 1519353220, "timestamp_updated": 1519433061, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533728", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40316597": {"recommendationid": "40316597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103978279", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1520949525}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u539f\u6765\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u5411\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u8f83\u4e4b\u524dFighting is Magic\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0d\u5c11\u3002\n\u4eba\u8bbe\u8d85\u53ef\u7231\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u5f88\u5e26\u611f\u3002\n\u5bf9\u50cf\u6211\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c0f\u9a6c/\u4eba\u5916/Furry\u7684\u7231\u597d\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4ece\u6765\u6ca1\u73a9\u8fc7\u683c\u6597\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8fa3\u9e21\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d...\u4e0a\u624b\u597d\u56f0\u96be\u53c8\u56fa\u6267\u7684\u60f3\u73a9....\n\u867d\u7136\u6709Traning\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709Combo\u7684\u7ec3\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5bf9\u6ca1\u63a5\u89e6\u8fc7\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4eba\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u4e9b\u56f0\u96be\u3002\n(Fighting is Magic\u548cThems Fightin Herds\u6211\u90fd\u4ece\u6765\u6ca1\u8d62\u8fc7\u4e00\u5c40...\u867d\u8bf4\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u957f\u5c31\u662f\u4e86)\n\u5f3a\u70c8\u5efa\u8bae\u63a8\u51fa\u65b0\u624b\u6559\u7a0b\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff01\nA tutorial mode is needed!", "timestamp_created": 1519353164, "timestamp_updated": 1519385387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40316591": {"recommendationid": "40316591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211339172", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519953321}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10!

First thing I did was try to change the resolution to fullscreen and it crashed. I don\u2019t blame them for using windowed as default though, the game looks terrible at higher resolutions. It\u2019s very blocky and animations are missing or not timed correctly with voices like you\u2019re watching a youtube video that hasn\u2019t buffered correctly.\n\nOnly arcade, online, and training are available, though story is \u201csupposed\u201d to release soon. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any tutorial or instructions, so if you\u2019re not knee-deep in fighting games already, you\u2019re left flailing around as the CPU beats the snot out of you. It\u2019s possible to change the difficulty, but it\u2019s unintuitive and doesn\u2019t really help you get any better.\n\nI think the number one thing that appalled me about this game though was it\u2019s option menus... I never actually thought a game could have bad option menus, but they certainly proved me wrong. They\u2019re all just a massive, disorganized, confusing disaster. One menu opens to another, and another...

The art is superb, and the music is PHENOMENAL. The release date was announced a little ways back, then a few days ago Mane6 announced they wanted to push it as \"Early Access\" and polish up story mode to release later. That's all well and good, and the game feels fine. I have very few problems overall.\n\nThere is no tutorial MODE as of yet, instead all tutorial options and combo guides are hidden under a submenu in the Training mode. You select one at a time and can practice it over and over again and then you select the next and so on and so forth. Standard combos/character-specific commands are located in a command list option in the menu during battles, which is fine, but a tutorial mode to help newcomers learn the ropes would be more than greatly appreciated.\n\nAI difficulty is also hidden in the main menu, and every setting seems to be slightly overtuned compared to what the setting would imply.\n\nThere are loads of missing or unpolished animations, and that can be chalked up to early access, though there are some pretty egregious and aggravating ones, such as Tianhuo missing an Idle Flying animation, and the fighter animations/quotes at the beginning of a match being clunky/empty/nonexistent. Not to mention one (that i especially noticed) of Oleander's moves is just wireframe sketches at the moment. Again, it's in Early Access so it's fine.\n\nThere are a lot of good options in the menus and the online is fine; the Pixel Lobby is extremely interesting already.\n\nI'm very very excited to see this game get updated and pulled out of Early Access down the line, and right now it's a fun timekiller. I can see myself getting super super sucked into the characters and world and gameplay once story mode is released.\n\nTLDR; No REAL tutorial mode, AI difficulty, and missing/unpolished animations are all my main problems at this point, but it's early access after all!", "timestamp_created": 1519351788, "timestamp_updated": 1519352132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40316260": {"recommendationid": "40316260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359487300", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 203, "last_played": 1521767657}, "language": "english", "review": "Obviously this game is early access, so there is much to be refined.

I've been crushed by beta players who can string 25+, but even the biggest combos give you time to respond allowing for comebacks.\n\nThe animation and voice acting is superb too.  You'll notice there's unfinished placeholder art in the game, but it takes from its Fighting is Magic origins and expands on it to have its own, fresh style that has really powerful crisp attacks.  A lot of these big blaster specials and supers definitely give Street Fighter or DBZ vibes, and pausing any individual frame of this game is a treat for my eyes.\n\nFor 15$ any fighter fan or casual gamer looking for a spin on some cute, powerful characters will enjoy this game.

However, the physics here haven't changed much, the game feels like a polished FiM.\n\n  The one complaint I have I guess; wich is only because I don't play fighting games, (or even games at all (since I get too mad at them,) is the difficulty of just jumping in and playing the game. I'm educated enough to know it was gonna be hard, and it's supposed to be, but it kinda was tough to accept being \"perfect'd\" by a game I thought I somewhat knew how to play. I'm practicing, but damn, it's more hard than FiM.\n\n  As for any critical kind of input I have, I don't have much to say since I'm too shy to go into the multiplayer and visit quadripede-town of overworld, since I'm so embarassed about getting owned; and I can't make any criticism for the \"bugs\" that do happen concerning character dialogue and animation since that's currently being worked on.\n\n  I wish I could say more, and thinking back, I don't think my review is even fair XD but I still recommend this game because there's nothing like it. It's the first \"quadripedd\" animal brony game to be on steam, and it really makes the \"quadripeed\" community look good, especially since it's an \"I touch you once and you don't get to play again\" game ((seriously, I'd play FiM at school with 5 friends every breakfast and lunch and people who'd see it would nod and go 'veri nice'))\n\n  ADHD set aside, get the game. It's only gonna get better. Thank you, MANE6 for staying strong to make this silly pon game.

The gameplay is butter-smooth, with easy-to-grasp controls and a satisfying whump to every hit. \n\nThe characters, designed by cartoon producer/director Lauren Faust, are colorful and full of personality. It was kind of amazing to see these characters come to life as their \"cardboard\" placeholder animations were gradually phased out. \n\nThe music is crazy good, and hearing the character instruments dynamically take over the song over the course of a match is just fantastic. The voice acting, which was just recently implemented, surprised everyone with its highly experienced cast. This ain't no fan project!\n\nNetplay is generally pretty good, but it obviously depends on your connection. I've had a few bum matches in the past.\n\nIt's also kind of easy to get comboed to death if you go up against someone who's real good, or fight the CPU on above the default difficulty. That's just how fighting games go, though.\n\nOverall,  I'm running out of ways to say this game is real good.

However, we shan't dwell on what isn't, but what is.\n\nI like the game, I've only played the arcade mode using Oleander and she's pretty fun to play as if you know what you're doing. Lauren Faust's style makes the game for me, I love seeing her artwork brought to life in this goregeous looking arcade game. The characters each have awesome personalities and have such beautiful designs.\n\nThe issues I have with the game stem more from the fact that I am terrible at arcade fighting controls. I mash buttons and do simplistic base moves and occasionally pull some magic out of my flank and perform a special move but that only happened so many times. I hate that I had to re-check which keys C, A or Y were bound to, which was one of my major issues with Skullgirls, cept this game has better menu controls. I honestly hate it when they do that. This isn't on an arcade, just use the damn keys the moves are assigned to not C, B, Y, H etc etc. It's infuriating. \n\nI would be content if it had been styled after the control scheme Neatherrealm uses for MK and Injustice, but then it wouldn't be an arcade style game.\n\nRant aside, this game is awesome, it's been long awaited and you don't have to be a Friendship is Magic fan to play it.

I just want this to succeed because it\u2019s good.\n\nBefore I come across as preachy, though, I want to be realistic: some other games try to sell you on being good for \u201cbeginners\u201d. They usually come with super elaborate tutorials and big single player modes. This doesn\u2019t have that. The single-player is supposed to come along shortly, and I doubt we\u2019ll see one of those 50+ part tutorials that take you from A to Attack to X for Crossup.\n\nX for.. Xcross.. Uh. It sounded better in my head. ABC\u2019s? Attack, Block, Crossups? Yeah, should\u2019ve gone with that one.\n\nAnyway. I haven\u2019t felt the need for what this game lacks at present. I\u2019m not trying to knock tutorials as \u201chand-holding\u201d or try to make some argument about \u201chardcore\u201d vs \u201ccasual\u201d. Play the way you want and be happy. I know a good tutorial is golden.\n\nFor me, however, the fighting game that\u2019s got me sticking around was the one that just felt good to play, and that\u2019s this one. Get in game, learn what 6A 6B 6C 23C etc. means (assuming I even got that right, I am garbage) and rejoice. I\u2019ll leave it to others to point out the rest of the stuff in detail, such as the amazing music (holy butts), the community and the voicework.\n\n...But, y\u2019know, between you and me, the dynamic music system is amazing. Oh, and you have to hear the voices.

To survive you must have a purpose for task at hand and do so with urgency. Every second spent out in the open away from a source of heat brings you another moment closer to death. \n\nThere is no need for large animals or scary monsters hunting you when the wind and the dropping temperature of the air you breath can kill you just as fast! As the game progresses the intensity of the wind literally pushes your player character around the environment as you struggle from one location to the next. \n\n\u201cNear Death\u201d has great atmosphere and soundtrack. There is basic crafting and inventory management. It also forces you to read a map and the terrain. As with real life, before GPS on every phone anyway, there is no blinking dot on the map to tell you where you are.  It can be easy to get lost in the near white out conditions and perish.\n\nThe only downside to this game is the relatively short time it takes to complete. Although, I say it is a short game I don\u2019t mean it to sound like I feel cheated in any way. There is a story to follow and a mission to complete. Extending the story any longer would have detracted from the Urgency that you feel while playing. \n\nWas it worth the cost of the game? For myself, who purchased the game during a Steam Winter sale the answer is absolutely. Is it worth the full $15? That would be harder to say. Would I still have enjoyed it as much? Without a doubt!

I can`t shake the feeling that the atmosphere is very \"The Thing\" like but with less intense feeling that something is going to eat you and noone will hear you scream. If you liked Alien Isolation, Penumbra, Insomnia and other puzzle solving stuff but you are affraid of monsters, than this is the game for you.

The cold will kill you in a minute or two. It\u2019s conveyed with flair and immersive atmosphere.

It\u2019s a great game to play in winter, or in summer if you want to forget about the heat.\n\nWith streamlined survival and scavenging mechanics, the game slowly raises the challenge, although it never gets terribly complex. You\u2019ll need to set up light beacons and rope guides to get between some of the more distant buildings, and you\u2019ll need to prioritise resources to enable you greatest mobility through the base. It\u2019s simple and absorbing. \n\nThe story is basic but compelling, offering likeable characters who try to cope with challenges in a practical way. The writing builds a plausible world and situation without encumbering it with melodrama or complicated backstory. There is enough inherent drama in the basic scenario, and it was better that the game kept it simple. \n\nIt\u2019s neither very difficult (on normal) nor very lengthy, but it\u2019s probably the right length to not outstay its welcome.

Oh, and it's pitch black outside, except for the snow. Your map is helpful, but you need to use your compass because the map, by design, does not give your \"live\" location. The wind builds and your trek between buildings slows to a crawl, you realize you were off on your map reading just a bit and are now lost (this rock wall isn't supposed to be here!!), you're shivering, the screen is getting blurry -- death is imminent.

You have a generator to generate warmth and you need to get the base back up operational.

Quite intense\n2. Started on normal and you really do feel like you have to fight to survive.\n3. The music at times knew how to take everything from intense to unsettling. Always quiet but disturbing\n4. The price tag is really great.\n5. Games like this continue to erode my confidence in huge titles and companies and now favor more Indie games(this being indie of course) \n6. The story line while simple made sense.\n\nCons\n\n1. The game felt like it set you up perfectly for a second stage but instead ended. I don't mean it felt like a forced ending because it didn't. I'm just saying it easily could have gone further. DLC could very easily be added to this game and not feel forced in the least bit. DLC e.g. you have to make your way home of course but have your radar direct you to different outposts to gain much needed supplies. A different station, different requirements and so on.\n\n2. Crappy batteries made sense and was spot on. Batteries sitting to long lose charge and therefore it easily stands to reason that you would chew through them quite quickly (as is the case) Kerosene did not make sense. It burns slowly so it made no sense that you burn through your fuel as fast as a drag racer goes through fuel. At the same time it's a semi con to the game because its understood that your fighting to gain body heat. If your fuel went on forever, half the strain of staying alive would be eliminated. That being the case I hold that con with a very light hand. \n\nAnd that's it on the cons. All I can say is I really wish they would add DLC and new areas so you have to fight your way back home.\n\nAlso, for there not being a single monster in the game the intensity, darkness and soundtrack really freaked me out at times and I wondered if something was going to step out of the shadows. Even when I knew that there were no other creatures in the game the feeling was always there. If anything had stepped out I would have shat myself.

The whole story feels very realistic--I imagine that wandering around while stranded in Antarctica in 1982 would probably be very much as depicted in Near Death.  I kept wondering if there might be some jump scares, if I would find some creature lurking in the cold darkness of some room in the base.  Or, perhaps I would uncover pieces of some twisted military plot, some terrible research going on at the Sutro base.  But in fact, there's basically no one to interact with in the game, except some people you communicate with via a teletype (like a typewriter and a telephone together), hundreds of miles away, as they provide you guidance and warm wishes to help keep you, and the story, moving forward.  Apart from that, and the bit of humor that comes through at times in your communications, there is really only one main thing that drives the game forward--and that's the gameplay itself.\n\nIn a much larger and much broader game, perhaps a Mass Effect or Elder Scrolls or even Half Life, the gameplay of Near Death might make up a chapter or two.  But in this game, the creators have chosen to focus in on a few very specific gameplay elements.\n\nThe challenge is to survive the worst nature can throw at you: the wind, the snow, the darkness, and the freezing temperatures of Antarctica.  You do this with a few pieces of equipment, such as a flashlight, and later light rods you can plant in the snow; a heater you carry around to warm you up inside closed rooms; a blowtorch, to melt snow and ice and gain access to new rooms and supplies; and even your character's clothing is important, as you realize you can find ways to upgrade your clothing (and other items) to stay warmer for longer.  The game actually reminds me some of Neo Scavenger, another game in which it's important to manage the cold, stay warm with good clothes and scavenge stuff to stay alive--though Neo Scavenger also features food and sleep, and combat with sci-fi enemies.\n\nIf you manage to survive the earliest and most disorienting stages of the game, you will begin to get fetch quests, essentially, as you are sent off to the different parts of the base to retrieve pieces of equipment to aid your in your survival and escape.  Along the way you must properly manage your equipment and supplies, and avoid getting turned around too much when you're in the heavy wind and snow outside, and be certain you can get to heat sources in time.\n\nDo that, and you should have a good chance of surviving and ultimately escaping Sutro.\n\nIf that sounds fun to you--a game where you're pitted against Mother Nature herself, rather than any kinds of enemies--you may find Near Death to be a wonderful little game, as I did.\n\n\n\nNow, with all this said, there were some issues I had with Near Death.\n\nFirstly, my laptop moved at a crawl much of the time while my character was outdoors.  Having some options to turn down the detail of the snow falling, and other such things, would have been nice.\n\nI fell through a catwalk next to the power station--this was a clipping issue, not a piece of catwalk that broke (though there were a few catwalks that broke in scripted events).\n\nAnd a few more gameplay-oriented annoyances:\n\nIt would have been nice to jump a little higher, and be able to climb up short objects.  There were several times where I would have just climbed up the side of a building, rather than being forced to find some way to go around.  And the duck-jump feature, by which I was able to gain access to certain areas, felt very clumsy compared to in Valve's FPS's, often requiring me to make several attempts.\n\nThe main character gets cold and dies too quickly in my view.  Even with all my clothes fully upgraded, I think it would only take one or two minutes to die.  Perhaps this was a deliberate decision to keep up a sense of urgency, but I think it could have been handled better.  Also consider that, in addition to dying too quickly from cold, I think the character also warms up too quickly once in the presence of heat.  You can go from being right on the point of death--wobbling around with your vision and hearing badly blurred from being too cold, literally ready to fall down dead--to being 100% OK and ready to go out into the cold once more, all in less than a minute, so long as you enter the presence of heat.  No frostbite, no numb limbs, almost no recovery time.  It's fun and scary to deal with, but it's also a kind of simplistic system that I think could do to be revamped.\n\nEvery single door in a room must be closed, and all of the broken windows must be sealed--no matter the size of the room or how closed off certain parts of it may seem--before your personal heater is able to warm you up.  I was bothered that I couldn't just move into a secluded corner, turn on the heater and get warm.\n\nOn a similar note, I kept on waiting for one of the generators to fail or run out of fuel, taking my best heat sources and forcing me to go on a hunt for more gasoline.  I was kind of disappointed that never happened.\n\nI would have preferred if the locations, shapes, and sizes of the buildings, and their rooms, and the supplies available within them, were randomized.  Near Death kind of suffers from convenientitis.  Of course the very first building you find has the personal heater.  And of course that is the sole building that possesses the only personal heater, of the ~15 buildings in the game.  I think it's pretty clear that the game is meant to be played in a linear fashion, moving from one particular building to another in a particular order.  Early on I didn't realize that I was supposed to activate a generator, and instead ended up moving to another building.  Only after getting there and spending some time there did I realize I didn't have enough propane to stay warm with the personal heater.  I kept searching for propane but didn't find enough to last long.  Realizing I was probably going to freeze to death, I checked my inventory and objectives and such, and only then discovered that I had skipped an objective earlier, so I had to restart from the beginning.  Personally I think that randomizing building locations and supplies would really have added a whole new level of fun and difficulty to the game.\n\n\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Near Death a lot.  It doesn't take too long to finish, even on the highest difficulty, which I've now completed as well.\n\n***Minor spoiler alert***\nOther than that, the only I have to say is that, on Normal difficulty anyway, the game ends with what is basically a sandbox mode.  After completing what was basically the last objective, the temperature suddenly went up from about -100 C to -5 C, and the wind and snow and darkness cleared.  It was the perfect time for this to happen, as I was up on top of the radar tower at a high elevation, and thus able to look down on all the other buildings below, able to see their lights and the green lights I'd placed around on the snow.  It was quite a beautiful moment, perhaps equally as memorable as all the chaos and peril of the game up to then.  Under those conditions, with virtually no fear of death, I happily went back to every building I could, exploring all around inside and out.\n***End spoiler***\n\n7.5/10  Near Death is nothing amazing, but it's certainly a lot of fun to play around with for a little while.", "timestamp_created": 1509269625, "timestamp_updated": 1509747203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36103248": {"recommendationid": "36103248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118576710", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509216485}, "language": "german", "review": "Near Death... ein wirklich sehr gutes, wenn auch recht kurzes Spiel.\nHier geht es darum der Natur, in diesem Falle der K\u00e4lte, zu trotzen und sich durchzuarbeiten.\nHunger und Durst sind gl\u00fccklicherweise keine Faktoren, die dem Spieler zusetzen.

"Near Death is a very linear survival game. You have set goals with set locations. The only thing between you and survival is the harsh weather of Antartica. Through my own observations, it appears that the weather and temperature are dependant on which \"checkpoint\" you are at. When you first start, the temperature is well below 0 degrees Celcius. As you progress further in the game, the winds pick up and temperatures reach nearly -100 degress celcius. Im not saying that this is a bad thing, however, when the game is as short as it is (about 2 hours + if you understand what youre doing), RNG with the weather might be a nice touch. \n\nThe game itself isn't very dependant on the map and compass (default button is M). You'll notice the compass in the top left hand corner, and the blue dial is the direction you are facing. While early game this is useful, towards the end, you should have rope poles and light poles set up so that you can run from building to building without much problem (rope poles allow you to sprint, even in the heavy winds).\n\nNow, since this game is linear, there isnt much \"re-playability\". Yes, there are 4 different difficulties, but you are essentially doing the same thing over again, just on a different difficulty. (And a lot worse weather)\n\nIt is a wonderful game for what it is, and if you are looking for a nice survival game with a wonderful atmosphere, then Near Death is a good bet for you.", "timestamp_created": 1508725541, "timestamp_updated": 1508725541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670669", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35932345": {"recommendationid": "35932345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007547637", "num_games_owned": 493, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508778499}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool cool game :-)", "timestamp_created": 1508709035, "timestamp_updated": 1508709035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35796241": {"recommendationid": "35796241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117750508", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508246137}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this game.

Despite the bugs, the game was enjoyable enough for me to keep playing. The game itself is a set of simple fetch quests. However, in order to sucessfully travel around the map and complete these fetch quests, you will need to craft various items and manage your resources. The difficulty slowly ramps up as you complete each task: visibility decreases and the wind becomes stronger, making travelling between locations increasingly difficult.\n\nBugs... there are a lot of bugs. You can jump-crouch through some of the windows (intact, non-broken windows), and you can also use/pickup items through windows. The collision with the terrain is sometimes glitchy as well. Worst of all is that whenever I'm within approximately 100 metres of the garage, my game starts intermittently freezing up for approximately 20 seconds at a time (nobody else seems to be experiencing this, so maybe it's just my setup?). I also experienced a total crash at one point. Regardless of the bugs, the game was still enjoyable.\n\nMany people are complaining that the game is too short (about 3 hours), but I would argue the mechanics would get boring if the game was much longer. The game is bite-sized, but it's also quite tasty.

Quite frankly, there isn't any sustenance in the game, and while that may break some of the immersion for some people, to me it only intensified and displayed just how urgent my situation was: I'm stranded in an abandoned facility, no food or water, electricity barely works, and all I have for communication is menial text between myself and someone at another station. Storms were difficult, and honestly terrifying at times, and I perished many times while thinkng I could make a trek when I couldn't. I had to navigate a map without a marker, making me [i] plan and prepare [/i] any treks that I did make. \n\nOver all, the game is fantastic. It was short, and took me just under three hours to complete with all but one of the blueprints found. Despite being on the shorter end of the spectrum, the game was beautifully crafted in that I was rather psyched out every time I hear the storm, every time I frantically tried to patch a window or repair circuitry.

Pure adventure survival against the elements, no zombies, mutants or robots. Basically you are trapped on an arctic station, in the middle of a storm.

Unlike the sandbox survival titles that are usually associated with \"survival\", however, this game is story-driven, hand crafted with little to no random elements and, while it doesn't avoid the concept of \"crafting\", it has more in common with the permanent upgrades you'd see in a metroidvania here than collecting random junk to created another random junk. In fact, despite one open map, the game is very much linear.\n\nWhich is, probably, the biggest gripe I have with it. With the way the story progresses and the map is set up, I'm genuinely surprised the developers locked down exploration as much as they did with outright not giving you tools necessary to progress before they want you to by just making them unpickable. Which, unlike other key stuff the character would really have no reason to pick up until it becomes important, looks extremely stupid and also introduces the ugly \"okay, now what\" problem, when you have explored a location before you had to and have no clue that now you have to go back to it again.\n\nAll that said, this is quite a unique and amazing experience with you stumbling in extreme conditions from building to building, from room to room, searching for a warm place and something helpful to scavenge. To fix the rooms, to make navigation between buildings easier. It's a unique concept, which, while looking less beautiful and impressive as in Cryostasis, works really well and shows how exploration games can be made and how many themes, locales and ideas are still left unexplored for truly engaging experience.

The flashlight has limited life unless supplied with fresh batteries, and the lantern will warm you in sealed spaces, but only when fueled with vital kerosene; both of which can be found in precious scarcity throughout the facility.  Some parts of the facility interior have busted windows letting in the cold or doors held open by the wind which need to be patched up and shut respectively.  This is where some light crafting comes into play as the remains of canvases and duct tape allow for makeshift seals, letting you break out your lantern to ward off death once a room is closed off from the elements.  These mechanics never feel cumbersome though, as progress is saved regularly and you learn to think in small goals; taking baby steps to ensure survival rather than making a mad dash from one end of the map to the other, freezing to death in the process.  Immersion is a big part of the experience as well, as the only indicators that you're getting too cold or have fully warmed up is through convincing voice acting; shivering in the cold growing more and more panicked or a quick \"much better\" after huddling with your lantern.\n\nThe key to survival then, is braving the outdoors in hopes of making it alive to the next sealed facility space to warm up and look for supplies, then continuing on to the next major goal.  It's easy to get disoriented when out in the elements however, as the few, sparse lights of the barely functioning facility act as dim beacons in the dark and the wind rages against your progress.  It very accurately captures the feeling of struggling to find safety as your head bobs violently, exhausting yourself before barely reaching respite.  Yet narrowly escaping death and warming yourself in a new space, filled with supplies, is a feeling of pure joy and quickly becomes a highlight of the game.  It never feels unfair when you die, but rather, an error in calculation.  Perhaps you tried to go too far in a single trek and had the misfortune of coming upon a door that's been frozen shut with no more time to look elsewhere before you freeze.  You quickly learn from these mistakes, and learn the facility bit by bit, so you reload your last save and try to be smarter next time.\n\nIn short time, you come into contact with help via a teletype 2-way messaging system, and from there are given some hope for rescue and instructions as to how to survive long enough to be saved and bring some of the facility back online.  Turning a part of the facility from a barren deathtrap into a self-heating haven is elating, and offers a welcome break from the survival aspects of the game; allowing you to save on batteries and kerosene.  Rescue is still a long ways off however thanks to the turbulent weather, so basking in your small victory must give way to soldiering on and securing more long-term means of survival.  It keeps you engaged with realistic survival objectives to achieve, and rewards you for your efforts in tangible and surprising ways.\n\nUltimately, Near Death sets out to do one thing right, and it accomplishes it in spades.  Simulating a no-frills survival experience in a lonely, unforgiving place.  There's no monster besides nature itself, no magic to learn or shelters to construct from wood and earth, just you, some hobbled-together necessities of life, and the punishing cold and darkness.  It feels simple, but intuitive and engaging because of it.  It doesn't need to be more, and what it is is done with exceptional thought and care.  Near Death is a hidden gem in the survival genre, and it frames its own identity with a well-earned confidence.", "timestamp_created": 1500539325, "timestamp_updated": 1510005477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447401", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33658561": {"recommendationid": "33658561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248743462", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500494102}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0442\u0430\u043a, \u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435-\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b.\n\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0445\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0430\u044f.\n\u041f\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b \u0438 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430 KHOLAT.\n\u0418 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f \u0432\u0442\u044f\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \n\u041f\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0440\u044f. \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043b \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435, \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0431\u044b.\n\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 6 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044f, \u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 8.\n\n\u041d\u0435\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0430\u0439\u0444\u0445\u0430\u043a - \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0435\u043a, [spoiler] \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u044f\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e \u0443\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430. \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0431\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f.

It's a survival story about not freezing to death. It's also got simple crafting mechanics and some exploration aspects.\n\nHowever, the emphasis is really on the story and the desperate atmosphere. The limited resources demand action and constantly pushing forward. It is [i]not a horror game[/i] despite its gloomy looks and rather obvious sources of inspiration, although the situation presented would be considered horrendous in most scales. Yet the atmosphere is intense and keeps you on your toes.\n\n[h1]Introduction: The fall[/h1]\n\nStory begins as you crash-land to Antarctica in the middle of the (polar) night. Alone in the dark, the only spark of hope is the nearby research station. Alas, it is abandoned. You have to get out of here before lack of heat, hunger and shear exhaustion bring you down!\n\nThe story is simple, yet powerful. You set out to gather various resources and find shelter. Not only are the supplies extremely limited, there's also what would be considered the blizzard of the century coming up if it were experienced way up here in the squishy latitudes. Your only solace: a contact in another station. But the news are always bad.\n\n[h1]So cold[/h1]\n\nAtmosphere in [i]Near Death[/i] is immense: darkness engulfs the landscape and only dim storm lights lead the way to a shelter. And the storm is getting stronger.\n\nFairly intuitive, you will die of hypothermia if you stay too long in the cold. A main game resource is heat and how to retain it long enough to complete all your tasks. Fortunately you've got a heater that can be used in-doors, as long as the room is sealed.\n\nHowever, heater takes fuel. Your meagre flash-light requires batteries and it keeps running out. Good thing the protagonist has a knack for tinkering and can craft all kinds of nifty tools and upgrades. No silly combining is required, you just click on the craftable item in the inventory and she creates it if there's enough parts at hand.\n\nThe constant rush forward is relaxed only after you get the power up and may think about your slim options.\n\n[h1]Short but intensive[/h1]\n\nThe whole game only takes a few hours to complete but it is intense. There are four difficulty options, from [i]easy[/i] to [i]Condition 1[/i], the latter a reference to the classification of the most extreme weather conditions on Antarctica. Difficulty affects the amount of resources, the resilience of the protagonist and the duration of the flashlight batteries/heater fuel.\n\nAlmost bug-free, only once I got stuck in some snow bank and promptly died of cold. I experienced no crashes during any of my playthroughs. I played it once on Normal (I took ~4 hours) before playing it through thrice on Condition 1 (~2 hours per new game).\n\nThe experience was so cool (pardon the pun) that I feel [i]Near Death[/i] has great re-playability (hence my extra playthroughs), even after grabbing all the achievements. I feel that a great part of the reason was the intense ending that only feels stronger at higher difficulties.\n\nThe game is unfortunately quite short so maybe the \u20ac15 ask-price is a bit steep, but on a sale, I think it's well worth at least \u20ac10.

My PC may be a potato, but it still passes minimum requirement. I am sad to say that, with the advent of Condition 2 weather, which appears a little bit into the game, the game grinds to a halt. It would freeze 30 to 60 seconds to render 5 or so frames before freezing again and repeating. This makes the game unplayable beyond that point because you are slowly dying every second that you are outside.\n\nSo unfortunately I had to refund the game, and the view is negative since the minimum specs apparently doesn't mean anything.

Not your typical survival game, as it's not open ended, has a storyline, and is rather short, but a masterpiece nonetheless. I'll try to keep this review spoiler free, as giving away details will ruin the experience.\n\n[h1]Premise:[/h1]\n\nYou play as a pilot who's plane crashes in Antartica. Heading for a nearby research outpost, you discover it abandoned, and must find a way to survive and escape.\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n\nGraphics aren't top of the line, but are decent enough. The game makes liberal use of the snow effects, using it to obscure far away distances, but does so in a realistic manner. Most of the interiors were fairly generic, but given that it's supposed to be an Antartic rescearch facility, it didn't need to be unique, in my opinion. Exteriors were better, but that may be because I didn't take too much time to examine them, as you're almost never safe outside, and can rarely see very far in front of you.\n\nLighting was well done, not too bright not too dark, enough to make me have to make use of my flashlight, but not so much to where I was leaving it on all the time.\n\nThe game offers a few filters in the options, which I thought was a nice touch, however, I don't recommend them for your first playthrough. It's hard enough to get your bearings in the storm without extra filters.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\n\nOne of the high points of the game. From the foreboding music, to the near constant howl of the wind, to every creaking metal door you open, even the crunch of snow as you walk, the sound design of this game did an amazing job of setting the mood. There wasn't much in the way of voice acting, but the little there was sounded realistic and well placed. The deep gasps of warm air after trudging through the snow and nearly freezing to death are incredibly satsfying to hear.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\n\nThe story wasn't deep, but served it purpose of driving the game foward. It consists of your character's correspondence with home base, which is where you get your objectives and information on where to find suppiles. The teletype machines, reminicent of old spy movies, made the choice of minimal voice acting interesting. Still, I felt connected to the character. Her sarcastic wit, to her reassuring herself she can make it, and even her sighs of relief when she finally gets warm, really helped put me in her shoes- er, snow boots.\n\n[h1]Controls:[/h1]\n\nControls were simple and intuitive, consisting of WASD keys for movement, C to crouch, space to jump,  1-5 for selecting items and left clicking to interact or use your equipped item. The game did a good job of making me feel like I was stumbling and having trouble walkng in a straight line during strong winds, afraid that I wasn't heading in the direction I thought I was, just like a real storm.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nAnother high point of the game, arguably the best point. Sound and graphical design did a good job of immersing me in this game, and gameplay mechanics did a good job of keeping me there.\n\nThe heat/cold system was well done, rather than giving you a temperature gauge, gave you audible cues from your character to let you know when it was time to stop and get warm and if you were warm enough to continue. I usualy see games like this trying to add monsters or creatures creeping around in the shadows trying to kill you, instead this game decided to make nature itself the antagonist of the story. As the game goes on, the storm gets stronger, and you start to wonder if you're going to make it.\n\nThe crafting system was simple, but interesting. Supplies were just sparse enough to force you to manage your inventory carefully, lest you run out of something important like kerosene for your portable heater or batteries for your flashlight. New recipes were unlocked by finding folders stamped with the research facility logo, or a couple of times by finding a new item. There were even a few upgrades for your gear, such as a manual that details how to make your parka warmer so you can last longer in the cold.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1]\n\nThis game had me so sucked in that even though it was 70 degrees in my house, I was getting chills, and when I paused to take my dogs out, I was fully expecting a blast of cold air to hit me when I opened the back door. At points, I'd recieve another objective and would just stop and stare at the door for a few seconds, mentally preparing myself for the storm raging outside. The sense of dread that you might not make it to the next safe space to get warm hangs over you right up until the end. The thought of \"Did I get everything?\" that crosses your mind right before you step out into the snow to trek to the next building, because you REALLY don't want to have to come back because you missed something. The thoughts of, \"Will I make it?\"\"Should I use my meager supplies now or save them?\"\"Oh God, I hope the next building is close\" all cross your mind as you focus on trying to stay alive, and trying to escape.\n\nThis was probably one of my favorite purchases in a long time, and my only regret is I waited so long to pick it up.", "timestamp_created": 1499070339, "timestamp_updated": 1499070339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736759", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33155262": {"recommendationid": "33155262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075374891", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499511964}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0451\u043c \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0435. \u0421\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435, \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442, \u043d\u043e \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0435, \u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0442\u043e.\n\u0417\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f. \u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c -

O clima \u00e9 o \u00fanico inimigo. E \u00e9 impressionante como consegue ser incrivelmente imersivo e te instigar a jogar mais e mais. Prova disso \u00e9 que comecei a jog\u00e1-lo \u00e0s 14h de um s\u00e1bado e quando percebi, eram 22h.

Jogar na maior dificuldade \u00e9 um desafio e tanto. Quase me fez desistir, quando fiquei praticamente sem nenhum recurso, mas consegui realmente sobreviver a todas as adversidades, o que deu um gostinho de recompensa muito legal.

The immense struggle to compare this to more famous survival games is hard to let go, but I'll instead wish to point out that there is no amount lacking in conveying the unforgiving nature of being alone in the cold hoping to just make it to the next building to warm up.\n\nThe environmental detail is sparse - but then again this is a land of ice and snow. The game succintly develops a sense of tension as the weather whips up and the cold drops down further and further around you. There is an amazing soundtrack that creates an oppressive feeling in your ears when you wander into the darkness. It's a pulsing sound like that of a heartbeat. Which leaves you feeling paranoid, alone, and as if something is hunting you. The Artic has thrilled the minds of explorers and scientists since it was first recorded. And has taken it's fair share of lives of the brave, unfortunate, and unlucky. When the very elements of the land are so hostile and dangerous to people that is the greatest threat and it's fascinating that this game was able to re-create this feeling. \n\nI greatly enjoyed this game and recommend it to anyone who wants a short but great game. I highly recommend playing this in the dark with headphones. I hope the developers of this game will create something akin to it in the near future with the same nuanced fear inducing feeling.\n\nBetter dress up warm.", "timestamp_created": 1498964187, "timestamp_updated": 1498964453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33098542": {"recommendationid": "33098542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202786928", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498936743}, "language": "english", "review": "A short but sweet game.

It's definitely scary, in fact many other readers have tagged it as a Horror Game. But for once, it's really really cool to have a horror game in which camp-enthusiasts are not encouraged to laugh in jest at the weirdness of the tentacle-faced monsters you face. Near Death's only opponent is the cold - temperatures below 100 degrees celcius, and winds that have the power to turn a sprint into a 1-foot-per-second crawl.\n\nProgress in the game involves a long series of fetch quests through the facility's many buildings. Any room without a total vacuum seal against the outside is freezing cold, meaning that sometimes your progress through buildings may have to be taken in steps, and some rooms have such large breaches that you'll need to rush your looting to avoid freezing.\n\nThe game is actually quite brutal just in the challenge of getting between buildings. Mercifully, you have a compass, but even with that, it's very easy to lose your bearings in such total darkness, and even high winds reducing your speed. You can redeem yourself by planning ahead and crafting light / rope poles to make return trips easier, but even these can go wrong. More than once I made a stupendous trek through the snow, found the building, got inside, only to find out that through my desperate run, I ended up at the wrong building (or, even, the back door of the building I had left from).\n\nSometimes, I thought \"[b]F*** it[/b]. The doors here are frozen over?? This turnout feels unfair. I want to give up. Kill me so I can go back to my last quicksave.\" But...something about the theming of the situation made me reconsider. I thought about moments in The Martian where Mark exhibits just about the same feelings. It made me want to turn those situations around. I knew I wouldn't reach the building I was aiming for, but I kept going, kept trying to recover my goals, because a person in this real situation wouldn't get a second chance. I certainly did die a few times, even playing on Easy Mode ([i]I first tried Hard Mode, but found myself rushing so much to get warm / not waste kerosene I actually missed an important tutorial message - Easy still gave me much of the intended feel of the game[/i])\n\nNear Death is very short, so buy it if you tend to not have enough spare time to finish off most games in your Steam backlog, since you could very likely easily binge through it in one gaming session.

But every once in a while you find that diamond in the rough that bucks the trend and actually manages to deliver everything that indie games promise \u2013 a unique experience that doesn\u2019t have the market clout necessary to see it given attention or funding from a major studio, often an experimental or left-of-centre concept, perhaps something personal, or simply something with a single, focused ambition. \n\nNear Death is absolutely that diamond. Built with a loving nod to John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing, you play a pilot and engineer whose plane is downed in a storm whilst on-route to her base in Antarctica. You crash-land near a decommissioned station, and with the temperature plummeting and visibility decreasing by the minute, you must find your way to the nearest building and contact your colleague via teletype, who gives you what little assistance he can. From then on, the situation becomes more and more bleak as you find supplies and reactivate the power to the various parts of the station, braving the storm to venture between different buildings and build your plan of escape. Spending any more than half a minute outside will kill you, and your movement and vision is impeded as you freeze to death. You aren\u2019t much safer indoors, as rooms with broken windows or walls offer no respite from the cold, and you have nothing to warm you but a small portable heater that will only work in sealed rooms. You can improve certain items such as your torch and parka, and these will make survival marginally more likely, but despite my initial overestimation of my abilities, you can and will get lost outside if you\u2019re not careful, which will spell certain death under most circumstances.\n\nThe game saves frequently, thankfully, so even if you die, it won\u2019t likely set you back very far, but there is a certain degree of anxiety that hits every time you have to trek to another building, especially as the game progresses and the storm gets worse. The wind picks up and can make walking almost impossible unless you have fashioned or manage to find or build a rope line, which mitigates the movement penalty of high winds, and gives you a trail to follow to the nearest building. These are few and far between, and absolutely necessary in the later stages of the game, and there\u2019s no worse feeling than knowing you\u2019ve left underprepared when the wind is stopping you from moving forward, and you\u2019re too cold and tired to move back, and you just know that you\u2019ve doomed yourself. \n\nThe games visual assets are simple, but suitable. We\u2019re not looking at the Unreal 4 engine here, but there\u2019s enough of a degree of detail in the environments to give an immediate feeling of familiarity to anyone that\u2019s\u2026y\u2019know\u2026been to a science base in the Antarctic, and the lighting effects are extremely well-implemented; darkness feels suffocating, the buildings are creepy in their dark, unexplored corners, and the eerie green pulsing glow of light poles will fill you with dread as they appear and disappear from view. Similarly, the script is simple but tight, and the small amount of voice acting on hand is believable and helps immerse you in the world. As your character starts shivering uncontrollably and your movement lurches and slows, you might feel a genuine chill within yourself as you know that you\u2019re killing her. But in that way, every light in the distance becomes a beacon of hope, and closing the door on a sealed room leaves you with a palpable sense of relief. \n\nNear Death is not an epic affair, but in a market that has been flooded with games that oversaturate themselves with gimmicks and vast but empty worlds, it\u2019s always refreshing to come across a game that performs a single premise very, very well. And Near Death absolutely nails it. I recall that when pondering whether or not to buy this game I was unsure from the reviews as to whether it was just a \u2018walking simulator\u2019 or something similar, but I can assure you that it\u2019s not. It is a survival game, and a bit of an adventure, and the degree to which you scavenge and prepare ahead of venturing into the cold, especially in the later game, will absolutely make the difference between life and death. As your supplies dwindle (maybe you\u2019ve been a bit too frivolous with your flashlight or your heater), you will find yourself praying to find a single item in one of the desks or lockers, and if you can\u2019t, you will steel yourself to make do and hope for the best. Or perhaps you\u2019ll do as I did and run out of the equipment to make rope poles, be forced to venture blind into the height of the storm and pray you make it to the nearest building, get disorientated, nearly die, and make it inside just in time to save yourself from the brink, all in order to retrieve and reuse some poles from elsewhere. This game is harrowing, and after I was finished I felt like I watched a great survival movie. It\u2019s a class act, and I frankly can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t heard of it before.", "timestamp_created": 1498587726, "timestamp_updated": 1498670096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32850756": {"recommendationid": "32850756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006786117", "num_games_owned": 508, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498560827}, "language": "english", "review": "It's \"The Martian\", oniy you're in Antarctica.

The player gets colder and colder until she dies, and can only warm up by sealing the doors and using a portable heater (or turning the generators on.) Hazards include storms, broken windows, pitch black conditions, and other fun things. \n\nThe game is easy to get a hold of, looks very nice, and is very well polished. There were a few clipping issues where I phased through closing doors, but ultimately, nothing was confusing, and the game's two characters (Miss Pilot and a man she talks to on what passes for 1980's texting) have loads of charm. \n\nIf you're into survival games, pick this up.

Near Death is an indie game and it is short.  It is *very* short.  I took my time, wandered about at the end, reloaded the ending a few times, toyed around Sutro station after campaign end and sat back and soaked in the menu imagery/soundtrack before I uninstalled.  The game is probably closer to 2 hours in length than 3.  \n\nI still recommend it.\n\nWhy?  The engine runs well, the game experienced minimal glitching during the three hours I played it.  The game was serviceably attractive and brutally atmospheric.  It's not often that you encounter a survival horror title that doesn't revolve around aliens, or zombies, or monsters, or evil people.  Near Death pits one determined woman against the most dangerous and inhospitable place on Earth: night-cloaked, winter-ridden Antarctica.  The game has minor crafting, some minimal puzzling and solemly ominous script.  However, the star of the game is the intense environments, coupled with an almost frenetic need to regulate your body warmth.\n\nJaunts, however temporary, between structures in Sutro station become an all-out fight for survival.  Visibility declines.  Temperatures plummet and the wind gusts can easily move you/point you in different directions.  It is exceptionally easy to get lost or pointed in the wrong direction, where a short trek into the snowy wilderness means certain death.  Players must carefully ration batteries, kerosene and other equipment for maximum efficiency.  Light/rope poles become your greatest friends when caught outside during a blizzard.\n\nI initially started the game on basic Easy mode to finish it one quick go-through (I didn't think dying would support the premise of the game).  However, after finishing the game in about an hour and 45 minutes with no deaths, I can honestly recommend that Normal difficulty would probably be a better fit for most.  With careful gameplay, deaths can still be avoided and the game would probably lengthen to 2 hours +.  The game provides a satisfying, if not exactly flamboyant ending and the Antarctic landscape offers a glorious surprise while you descend from your final fetch quest/mission.\n\nThe game isn't exceptionally complex.  It lacks a wide array of features.  It doesn't have a hyper advanced graphics engine or massive multiplayer longevity.  What the game *does* have are atmosphere and tension in spades.  You will struggle to keep cool as you stumble towards your destination, as your labored breathing and chilled feet continue to plod slowly forward in knife-like blizzard winds.  You will care for the protagonist and most of all, you will appreciate the opportunity to play a game where your task isn't to kill, maim or destroy but, instead to survive against mother nature, in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nNear Death can be had on sale for five dollars and for a 3 hour jaunt unlike anything you've likely ever experienced before...it's worth it.\n\nRecommended. \n\n7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1498275438, "timestamp_updated": 1498346285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 106, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900660", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32686570": {"recommendationid": "32686570", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973484986", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498232551}, "language": "french", "review": "immersif, principe du jeu super, franchement tout est au top ^^ seul b\u00e9mol perso, j'ai termin\u00e9 le jeu assez rapidement, mais je ne m en plaint pas vu le prix, je recommende aux fans de survie", "timestamp_created": 1498232846, "timestamp_updated": 1498232846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32439749": {"recommendationid": "32439749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118727156", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492703003}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a simple straight forward survival game.

This is a good game. It was a very immersive, very tense, and harrowing journey into the Antarctic wasteland\n\nNear Death takes homage from John Carpenter's The Thing, however, there aren't any enemies in this game, aside from the frigid weather of Antarctica in the middle of a raging blizzard\n\nThe survival aspect in this game is really something. When you're outside for too long, and you begin to succumb to the -100C kind of cold, you genuinely feel relieved when you make it to a spot to warm up\n\nYou have to use your supplies wisely and always make sure you keep warm\n\nThis game does not hold your hand. There are no quest markers. All you get is a map, and it doesn't even show you where you are on the map\n\nYou have to use common sense to navigate your way through the blizzard to the many different buildings of the abandoned Sutro Station, which has fallen into disrepair. You need to place light posts in the ground to mark paths to different buildings\n\nYou need to make a rope trail between buildings so you don't get staggered by the strong, freezing winds. You need to make use of the crafting system by collecting supplies wherever you can in order to survive\n\nStay warm. Collect supplies. Jury rig said supplies into things you can actually make use of. Just keep going, and try to survive\n\nIf you want a deep story, look somewhere else. If you want a ton of content, look somewhere else. If you're looking to slay monsters and collect epic loot, look somewhere else. But if you're looking for a fun, challenging, and actually immersive survival experience, then this might be the game for you\n\nI can honestly see myself playing it again on harder difficulties so I can get the rest of the achievements from the game and also because it's fun!\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1493738626, "timestamp_updated": 1493738626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436397", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31485846": {"recommendationid": "31485846", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982853933", "num_games_owned": 575, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493639971}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like the premise; I think it can be improved, but I stopped playing this game because it wasn\u2019t fun for me.

Consequently, you have to be cautious in your exploration, especially when you\u2019re going to have to carry something heavy from point A -> B. You will generally have just enough resources to do what you need to do and then move on. \n\nHow this works poorly: \n1) Artificial scarcity: your batteries run out in about two minutes of flashlight use, \n2) Fixed Objective Order: you need to complete areas in an exact order, objective items will not be highlighted absent that. For instance, I cannot infer the need to pick up area maps or survival equipment until after receiving those instructions.  \n3) Constant fetch it quests that require encumbered movement in low visibility, movement impaired conditions \u2013 this feels like padding designed to stretch the game out.\n4) Jumping requirements in windy conditions, where failure is close enough to death that a quicksave/quickload style is the only viable alternative.\n\nOther comments:\nThe map doesn\u2019t have nearly enough details (i.e. which pods are where), nor does it allow notation of any kind; furthermore, the compass is only accessible from the map, requiring the player to constantly toggle. Given that navigation is core to this game, and visibility is highly limited, this is a cardinal sin. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO EQUIP THE COMPASS, if it\u2019s not always visible by default. \n\nClosing:\nI appreciate what the devs tried to do here, and I won\u2019t hit them with a negative review. That said, I think there are some real problems with the game, and I hope the devs can sort some of them out. I have a little difficulty with spatial orientation, so I respect that aspects which were deal breakers for me might not be for other players.", "timestamp_created": 1493642262, "timestamp_updated": 1493642262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31483709": {"recommendationid": "31483709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253337173", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493572947}, "language": "turkish", "review": "s\u0131k\u0131c\u0131 bulup iade etti\u011fim bir oyun. daha iyisi i\u00e7in the long dark yeter de artar.", "timestamp_created": 1493635505, "timestamp_updated": 1493635505, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31475956": {"recommendationid": "31475956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071371904", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493597714}, "language": "french", "review": "Jeu vraiment sympa, dur\u00e9e de vie assez courte, donc je conseille de le prendre en rabais si vous trouvez que le plein prix est cher", "timestamp_created": 1493598804, "timestamp_updated": 1493598804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31469153": {"recommendationid": "31469153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027194104", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493573965}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple, but good game.", "timestamp_created": 1493574700, "timestamp_updated": 1493574700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31465979": {"recommendationid": "31465979", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997138435", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493565093}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um jogo bom pra mim tem que ser divertido, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 outro prop\u00f3sito em perder seu tempo se n\u00e3o for por isso.

Just beware of the short play time and imperfect map details that crop up if you decide to explore late game.\n\nWithout spoiling the story, it is a very neat concept, and the gameplay is very well polished.

Survived unharmed, the only hazard is endding up in a part of the map where you can't escape) It does a great job of showing off the nerative via just one VA and the teletype, and sorta makes me wish I had one of those things of my own... ah well, those are likely outdated now.\n\nThe issues with the game however is the surprisingly short playtime, as it takes typically only 1-3 hours to finish the game, even on the hardest difficulty, to wrap up, assuming no deaths... and the map when you get around to exploring. You can't tell during normal intended play due to the snowstorms and fog and darkness, but if you decide to explore during the post game letup of the storm, you can detect more then a few areas where the map just cuts off suddenly, with invisable walls to deny falling off the map. Thankfuly, the ease of getting the achevements is just as good, so you are not forced to grind like hell to get all the achevements.

This is a good game.  It was a very immersive, very tense, and harrowing journey into the Antarctic wasteland.  I paid full price for the game and it took me about 5 hours to beat it.\n\nMany others might say that a game that only lasts for 5 hours isn't worth $15, but I disagree.  To me, it seems that PC gamers feel so entitled to get a ton of content from any game that costs more than $5.  I am not one of those people.  I am happy to spend $15 on a good game and show my support for future releases from Orthogonal Games.  I had never heard of them before, but they're definitely on my radar now.\n\nNow let's get past the price and into the game itself.\n\nThere aren't any enemies in this game, aside from the frigid weather of Antarctica in the middle of a raging blizzard.  The survival aspect in this game is really something.  When you're outside for too long, and you begin to succumb to the -100 degrees celsius kind of cold, you genuinely feel relieved when you make it to a spot to warm up.  You have to use your supplies wisely and always make sure you keep warm.\n\nThis game does not hold your hand.  There are no quest markers.  All you get is a map, and it doesn't even show you where you are on the map.  You have to use common sense to navigate your way through the blizzard to the many different buildings of the abandoned Sutro Station, which has fallen into disrepair.  You need to place light posts in the ground to mark paths to different buildings.  You need to make a rope trail between buildings so you don't get staggered by the strong, freezing winds.  You need to make use of the crafting system by collecting supplies wherever you can in order to survive.\n\nThis is a game about survival, through and through.  If Orthogonal Game were going for realism, they achieved that goal in spades.  Stay warm.  Collect supplies.  Jury rig said supplies into things you can actually make use of.  Just keep going, and try to survive.\n\nIf you want a deep story, look somewhere else.  If you want a ton of content, look somewhere else.  If you're looking to slay monsters and collect epic loot, look somewhere else.  But if you're looking for a fun, challenging, and actually immersive survival experience, then this might be the game for you.  I can honestly see myself playing it again on harder difficulties so I can get the rest of the achievements from the game.

The premise is very simple but the devs manage to do a lot with it. The game reminded me a lot of Penumbra, with a monsterless metroidvania twist. The puzzles are all believable scenarios as you try and find your way across an ambandoned base and slowly bring enough systems back online to keep yourself from freezing to death while also forming a plan to get back to humanity. \n\nIt all comes together to make a very immersive story that is surprisingly tense for your only enemy being nature itself. When I started the game I pretty much ignored using rope poles and light beacons since everything seemed easy enough to find just using the map and compass. But as the weather worsened and took a huge toll on visiblity and mobility those simple tools became life savers for traveling between the longer streches between some parts of the base.\n\nAll in all I'd highly recommend Near Death to anyone who enjoys a unique immersive experience. Although being trapped in an antartic base isnt a new premise, this is the most realistic representation of it I've seen so far. The game is short but it doesnt outlive its welcome, and a simple surprise they put at the end really gives you a great sense of accomplishment once you're on your final stretch home :) .", "timestamp_created": 1484567552, "timestamp_updated": 1484567552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532759", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29286813": {"recommendationid": "29286813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018518445", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 126, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485454963}, "language": "english", "review": "Truely survival game.You must have some guts to play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1484528477, "timestamp_updated": 1484528477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29256648": {"recommendationid": "29256648", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978259892", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485643028}, "language": "english", "review": "Atmospheric.

I've just finished the game and i can tell that is fantastic ! The gameplay is the classic adventure mixed with some survival , that with the beautiful atmosphere that the game can create makes a game that can make you get stuck on the monitor till the end. 5 start . The only 2 critics that i can do is : for first the duration , for me at this price it's good and all the stuff but is short to play ( unless you want to have all the achievement of the game). The second critic is that at the end of the game , without making spoilers , the finding of the objects become very ripetitive .

You'll be pleased with that part.\n\nIf you are interested in Near Death because you like survival, then you need to know something. Near Death is not a survival game in the way that \"Don't Starve\" is a survival game, where you are merely fighting hunger (plus whatever other stats) using resources that are infinite if you are careful, economic, and smart. Near Death is survival in that more \"survival horror\" way where there are some finite and predetermined resources available to help you get from A to B, and if you squander them or dawdle too much then you're basically outta luck and dead.\n\nNear death is also a game where the objective is not just to keep putting food in your mouth and warmth on your body for the purpose of staying alive forever. There are specific story goals that must be completed in a specific sequence, and you have to keep moving, moving, moving. There are finite resources, which by extension means there is finite TIME. And trust me when I say that this creates a harrowing situation for you that is quite interesting.\n\nBUT.\n\nIt also creates a kind of frustrating scenario that you, depending on what kind of player you are, may find awesome or frustating. And I will explain via analogy. Imagine if I presented you with a game that was just a maze. All you have to do is get to the end. But you only have ten seconds to solve it or you die and have to start over. If you already know the way through the maze, it's easy. If you don't know the way through the maze, it's incredibly frustrating. And Near Death is extremely close to being this exact scenario. (Did I mention the maze has incredible atmosphere, though?)\n\nSo I will recommend the game, yes, bearing in mind the above reservations.", "timestamp_created": 1479677302, "timestamp_updated": 1479677302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.806697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26717659": {"recommendationid": "26717659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105961323", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 5227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510174791}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0443 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0438 \u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0430! \u0430 \u043a \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0432\u044a\u0435\u0437\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430! \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430 \"\u043d\u0435\u0447\u0442\u043e\" 80-[i]\u044b\u0445[/i]! \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430 2-3 \u0434\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0439\n", "timestamp_created": 1479663759, "timestamp_updated": 1479663759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26631966": {"recommendationid": "26631966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007672491", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490209218}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u041d\u0435\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0443, \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0441 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u044b\u0442\u043a\u043e\u043c. \u0412\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0448\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u0438-\u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438. \u0423 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u041d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0449\u0435 \u0441\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439. \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0432\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043a, \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0440\u044f\u0442-\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e. \u0422\u0443\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e...", "timestamp_created": 1479314415, "timestamp_updated": 1479314415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26559378": {"recommendationid": "26559378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147895533", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478960238}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you Orthogonal games \u2014 Fantastic.

Neither focused too too much on crafting but utilizing light elements of item construction along with plenty of survival strategy; in the form of conquering the game's starring blizzard, the experience of dealing with isolation, how to avoid hypothermia, making successful desperate dashes to light up the next part of abandoned Arctic facility to avoid frostbite and the game's sparse narrative...Near Death is a success across the board. It actually gave me the experience that I hoped to take away from Firewatch (even if it too was a good game), by not falling into the trap of being simply another walking simulator. \n\nThe story begins with the lead character crashing his/her (not sure on that voice, honestly) plane in Antarctica, thusly beginning the first in a grueling series of mad dashes to the communications building to reestablish comms with the McMurdo H.Q via teletype. Dialogue is in short order and I fond that to work to the game's advantage personally. You will cherish your few comminques with Jack back at basecamp as he tries to formulate an ever more complex plan to keep you freezing in the tundra's icy blight. Thanks to a recent update you can play the game on the ruthless Condition 1 difficulty where movement is difficult, the wind is against you, blizzard snowfall limits your visiblity to zero and time is generally not on your side. The story itself is a simple one...similar to other stranded feature films from The Edge to The Martian to Gravity and beyond. In my opinion, the stakes felt much higher in this game because there's just enough interactivity provided to make you feel that you are in total control of the pilot's fate. While the plot doesn't change necessarily from difficulty to difficulty, the way you must plan your moves ahead is altered dramatically on the hardest setting. Learning the map and your surroundings will be key. \n\nAlthough the graphics are slightly dark and muddy it doesn't hurt the game but in fact enhances it. Nobody expects a derelict research facility in the Arctic to be in tip-top shape and things are appropriately rusted, broken down and blown asunder from the whipping gale force winds. There's enough detail and signs of where life once existed (like in the haunting biology and science sectors) that you can get mental pictures of the once hustling, bustling enviroment the compound gave purpose to. I also found the sound to be a highlight with the ever intensifying quiver of your character's breath giving you much needed clues as to when you need to seek shelter with heat/light or find a place to set up your portable heater. Winds howl like the last cries of the dead, eerie teletype keys echo the halls and the overall atmosphere is somewhere between the 1950s version of the Thing, Carpenter's version, Cryostasis and even The Long Dark. \n\nGameplay in this case is refreshingly devoid of monster combat. Some reviewers question the choice but I found it quite pleasing. If you choose to jump into the Condition 1 difficulty the storm has a personality all of its own hellbent on burying you beneath the permafrost and even on normal the wintry mix ranges from manageable to pounding, so each difficulty lends the snowstorm its own dangerous and wholly ominous vibe. \n\nThankfully, you are not helpless to just freeze, die and hope the nearest generator that you encounter will turn on with a flip of a switch and offer instant respite. Oh no, it's not that easy bub! You're going to need to scavenge for supplies to create much needed protective items along the way with each crafting requiring a certain number of excavated supplies. You can insulate your pants and parka for more defense against the elements (adding precious seconds to your outside forays), bypass electrical boxes with tool kits, marks your travelled paths with rope lifelines and glowing light markets and even wield a blowtorch that can melt your way into much needed supply rooms and pantries. With the grim situation at your feet and a number of useful tools at your disposale, you can fight back against the cold and buy yourself time whenever you're on the verge of totally freezing. \n\nAs you progress through the game you'll be provided with numerous different tasks and objectives, discovering snippets of information along the way. The narrative isn't in depth but the discoveries that you make and lonely conversations with McMurdo make you feel for the character that you play and hope there is some bright light at the end of the tunnel to get him home. Getting lost will happen from time to time, especially moreso in the harder blizzard conditions, so it's important to keep an eye on your completely realistic map/compass system that leaves navigation in your hands. Visibility can quickly go to a total whiteout and it's a frequent challenge to move heavy pieces of gear back to certain locations whenever the wind is blowing you left, right, back and taking down bridges beneath your feet. Some scenes are scripted, yet there's enough moments of white-knuckle gameplay alone to keep you playing for the duration. I immediately soldier through a normal playthrough and subsequently bumped up to Condition 1 since I knew the lay of the land. With the tougher conditions this didn't always end up easier than it sounds and I both froze death and was reaching for restart in sevral instances. Progression isn't beyond frustrating, just fairly challenging and it always feels good to fail miserably at a mission the first time only to think your way to a successful solution further down the line. \n\nThere are plenty of tools to help you along and the game never suffers from excluding a more in-depth crafting system. What's there is exactly what you need and yields multiple options for keepng the heat in. Two full-playthrough and earning every achievement but one ensured that I got my $14.99's worth and then some. Walking simulators can be fun in the right circumstances, though the team that coded and created Near Death came up with something far more unique than a simplistic \"walk here, okay walk there, okay back track there to see one minute thing\" style of walk-sim gameplay. Near Death might not be for horror fans into the stranded aspect looking to build camps, go hunting and stave off piles of foes but it offers a formidable foe in the blizzard and the ever hopeless conundrum of just how in the hell you're going to beat Shackleton at his own game. \n\nPros:\n\n-Chilling, desolate atmosphere with a fairly immersive map to explore. \n-Appropriately dark, downtrodden graphic style that really pushes the isolation aspect to the breaking point. \n-Rewarding exploration that yields supplies, clues and creepy locales that you must power up. \n-Several optional questions for powering up generators that will tip the light/heat dynamic in your favor. \n-Condition 1 difficulty is a really authentic blast of fun with a decent challenge. \n-Solid crafting system; never too deep for the game's style but provides multiple options for progression/protection.\n-Simple story told through teletype machines furthers the trippy descent into arctic insanity. \n-Ability to save anywhere besides simply checkpoints which helps cut some time out of trial and error dashes. \n-Authentic navigation system. \n-Elements naturally have effects on control which makes for an engrossing, immersive expedition.\n\nCons:\n\n-The game's short length of 4-5 hours or less makes one long for an expansion pack. It doesn't HAVE to be as the game stands on its own but the quality here definitely makes me want more. \n-The ending while marginally satisfying could have been better or perhaps lead to another run of problems to solve. \n-Controls/interactivity can be wonky.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10\n\n-A tough, creepy survival game pitting man against the ultimate foe; nature.", "timestamp_created": 1476746927, "timestamp_updated": 1476746940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26004981": {"recommendationid": "26004981", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961264191", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472144328}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ive ever played.....for 5 hours...needs more content!", "timestamp_created": 1476311997, "timestamp_updated": 1476311997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480466", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25991555": {"recommendationid": "25991555", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992518038", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476238144}, "language": "english", "review": "What a great game.

There is no micro meter-management as found in many survival games, and your role is to escape rather than remain.  The story starts with you surviving a plane crash at abandoned Antartic station Sutro, and you must gather enough supplies to plan your escape/rescue while not becoming victim to the hostile minus 100-degree temperatures and storm blizzards.  Resources such as batteries for your torch are scant and you must use these VERY carefully, as is your only source of heat: a portable kerosine heater.  Make these last because they've all you've got!\n\nThe game also involves a small amount of resource gathering and crafting to make rooms of the shelter tolerable and functional.  These steps are optional objectives but your survival experience will be much easier if you do this.\n\n\n[h1]What's to like?[/h1]\n\nThe totally believable atmosphere and difficulty scale.  Although the game is short, it is INCREDIBLY atmospheric - perhaps one of the most atmospheric survival games I've yet played (and I've played quite a lot of them).  Nothing feels unreal or silly.  Everything feels urgent and not at all easy - as it should!  There is very little hand-holding.  The difficulty curve seems spot-on: hard without being frustrating.\n\n\n[h1]Anything not to like?[/h1]\n\nOne of the complaints people have about this otherwise-excellent game is that it's short, but it's only a quarter of a full AAA game price, so I would expect a quarter the amount of playtime, and I exceeded that easily with 7-8 hours (others have reported less, so this might rather depend on how fast you speed through games). I would have liked to have had a little further playtime at the end of the game [spoiler]as part of my escape away from the base[/spoiler] but that wasn't to be.  There were a couple of minor world glitches such as being sometimes a little too easy to fall into impossible-to-escape crevaces and I did accidentally drop a piece of vital equipment a few feet ahead of me, only to find there was an invisible barrier prevanting me from walking towards picking it up (presumably I had reached the edge of the map but objects were able to sail over that same edge).  Still, save-games weren't spaced too far apart, so no huge deal there.  It wouldn't stop me recommending this game.\n\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nFor those \"challenged\" by video games like, er, me, the 'normal' difficulty is difficult enough!  You WILL die, you will become lost (and die), you will freeze (and die).  There will be times when you're groping around in the dark because you didn't listen to yourself when you said \"be sparing with those batteries!\" and you will absolutely run out of necessities.

The game places you in Antarctica after the plane that you were traveling in has crash-landed. You are stranded and alone. Thankfully, the plane crashed near an abandoned research facility. Unfortunately, however, you have crashed in the midst of a deadly blizzard. It is blindingly dark outside and obviously frigid. In order to survive, you must explore Sutro Station.\n\n[h1]Survival Without Fully Fledged Resource Management[/h1]\n\nThere are so many survival games on Steam that rely on resource management. They have almost become a clone of one another. If you throw a different skin and setting on it a developer may assume that they have a new game. But it\u2019s certainly not true because there is little to separate them from one another.\n\nIf I were to compare Near Death to any genre on Steam it would be the Unity engine horror games. This is strictly because of how the game plays and controls are. However, because of the genre differences and the associated quirks that come as a result the similarities end there.\n\nTherefore, because of the lack of resource management, I feel that this may prove to be a major positive selling point for the game. That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need to look for tools to aid your survival. You\u2019ll need things such as kerosene to fuel your heating device (and the heating device, of course). Consequently, your focus is not on finding X amount of an object but rather where it should be \u2013 on the adventuring itself.\n\n[h1]Antarctica is No Walk in the Park[/h1]\n\nThe game isn\u2019t a particularly simple game to play\u2026 at least in the beginning. It certainly controls well but it is difficult. I died several times very early in the game. Your body can only sustain the Antarctic conditions for a short period of time. Consequently, you must constantly search for the next safe zone. This is a place where you can set your heater down on the floor in an enclosed area and generate warmth.\n\nThe game makes superb utilization of the realities of Antarctic conditions. If you ever wanted to understand what it was like without experiencing it yourself then this game does a very good job of simulating it. One of the highlights of the game is the dynamic weather system. It utilizes snow, wind, temperature and lighting to create a realistic setting. It feels as though you are in a genuine blizzard where there are genuine moments of calm weather interspersed with craziness.\n\nFurther, the temperature simulation takes into consideration each room and area of the map. This is an outstanding feature of the game as it realistically calculates what each area of the map you are in and what the conditions would be like.\n\n[h1]The Downsides[/h1]\n\nFor all of the plaudits that I can willingly throw towards the game the biggest negative is arguably its brevity. For a $14.99 game, I was expecting to be glued to my seat for a number of hours. I am not sure where players are claiming to get more than several hours out of a single playthrough. I clocked in my first playthrough at about three hours and twenty minutes. For the amount of content \u2013 albeit much of it is quality \u2013 that you are getting I would claim that the asking price is too high. As others have recommended a $9.99 price point would be more reflective of the title.\n\nAnother complaint about the game that I have is that the difficulty appears to be front-ended. The game starts out difficult and becomes easier the longer you play. I personally favor games that offer a consistent level of challenge across a game or an increased level of challenge. The problem is that the availability of life-sustaining items becomes too frequent the longer that you play. You can almost guarantee that if you survive the beginning parts of the game that you\u2019ll be able to complete the game.\n\nAnother issue that I have with the game is that because of the way that it is programmed it doesn\u2019t allow for an exploratory playthrough. I readily admit that it was in reading GameSpew\u2019s Christian Mincks\u2019 review of the game that this truly dawned on me. While I appreciate that that is not the intention of the developer having the ability to have a game in this setting that you can explore would have been nice.\n\n[h1]Is it Steamified?[/h1]\n\nNear Death has a set of Steam trading cards and 18 Steam achievements. You\u2019ll have to complete the game on each of the levels in order to unlock all of them. This may be a sore point for players who would like to perfect the game with only one playthrough.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nI love the way in which the weather systems have been implemented. I\u2019m never going to be able to travel to Antarctica and explore it. Therefore, I have to commend the developers on creating a game that was able to take me there as well as any documentary that I have ever watched. On that basis, I recommend the game but perhaps you would be best served to wait for a lower price point just because of the lack of content will disturb some patient gamers.\n\nFor similar reviews and your chance to win great giveaways please visit [url=http://www.steamified.com/]Steamified[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1472657777, "timestamp_updated": 1472657812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25256445": {"recommendationid": "25256445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026062236", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472588882}, "language": "english", "review": "A short but good game.

Apparently the Gondola ride is one way. And when the game decided to give me a great view and see all the little blinking lights int he valley, I was concentrating on not falling off the gondola ropes so that I could make it back down and not die. \n\nTLDR: if you do not have a problem with the price, I would recommend this game for you but don't expect it to be lengthy or to have any real replayability.", "timestamp_created": 1471813113, "timestamp_updated": 1471813172, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732130", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25017521": {"recommendationid": "25017521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165729622", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509223806}, "language": "german", "review": "Near Death ist ein wundersch\u00f6nes Spiel, in dem es ums \u00dcberleben geht.

I've played every version of DS 1, 2, and 3 on every system it's available on. Hordes of hours of my existence. I enjoy the Souls series so much that, as others have claimed as well, it's practically ruined other games for me. I find it extraordinarily hard to really get invested in other games. I have tons of partially or barely completed games on both PC and consoles that I just flat out lose interest in, oftentimes very easily.\n\nThen there's Near Death. One of those rare games that truly captured my attention and held me firmly in place for the entire journey.\n\nYou have one enemy: the weather. You're trying to survive against the cold and the wind. That's it.\n\nBut it's so beautifully done. The items you scavenge are used to craft realistically useful items that have true purpose in helping you to survive. The key items you'll need to collect make sense as well and are scattered brilliantly, having you make use of the full game world without ever feeling like a slog for the player but definitely an arduous task for the player character. Even little things, like kneeling becoming more useful than you would initially think, work favorably to immerse the player.\n\nAnd another big deal for me: I generally cannot stand games that force you along, fighting a timer in whatever form that takes. Timed missions you fail when the clock hits zero. But it just plain works here. I felt a definite sense of urgency, but looting is done so well that I never felt overwhelmed by some insane quantity of containers to check before I froze to death. And you're actually given multiple ways to bring your body temperature back up, which was a welcome and thoughtful addition.\n\nAlso, the little bit of writing throughout the game was informative when it needed to be, and both clever and witty at other times that made me smile.\n\nIn all the years I've had a Steam account, this is only my third review, so you know I don't normally do this. But I felt heavily compelled to say something about this game. And I could go on to elaborate further, but suffice to say, I love Near Death. Phenomenal game in my opinion.

Not everyone will care about this point (some may even roll their eyes at it), but THANK YOU SO MUCH for including full controller support. I can use a mouse and keyboard with the best of them, but I just plain prefer controllers. My PC is hooked to my main TV, and I play most games from my couch. In fact, had Near Death not had full controller support, I may never have seen it. I was specifically looking for a new, not-so-expensive game to play under the \"Full controller support\" category.

Most people are reporting a completion within 3-5 hours which is a little shallow, although understandable considering the games setting.  I just think if you compare it to other \u00a36.99 games this sits as a master of that price point.\n\nCheck out my video review of the game below\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3MLhsiDZ8\n\nJust Have Fun!\n", "timestamp_created": 1470414998, "timestamp_updated": 1470414998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24727250": {"recommendationid": "24727250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119430536", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470413696}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, so I dont post many reviews, but.

As the weather worsens it gets trickier and trickier and that moment when you lose your bearings in a blizzard and stumble in the wrong direction really gets the tension rising.\nThe game also convey the sense of isolation partly because there is just enough evidence of the former inhabitants to really reinforce this and due to some clever decisions on communications.\nOverall much like in a story like the Martian it is being in a terrible, life threatening situation and trying to survive.\nIt's not the longest game but it is a fantastic experience and one I would greatly recommend, especially if you are a fan of games like Dear Esther, Firewatch and to some extend Soma.", "timestamp_created": 1470351391, "timestamp_updated": 1470351391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24716003": {"recommendationid": "24716003", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981519088", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470361415}, "language": "english", "review": "Hmm, this one is actually hard to review. It's a very good game. It's just very short, took me 3 hours to complete and I felt like I was taking my time. It's a single scenario, very good atmosphere, really well done in general. Runs easy even on a crappy older computer, but I did have framerate lag issue for like 20 seconds where game stuttered for no reason during my first 3 hour run. I do want to play this game again on harder difficulty. It's really like a well-made interactive movie.\n\nThe environ is creepy by itself much like the original The Thing movie. Here there are no aliens, monsters, nothing. Just cold and wind in an eternal dark that seems to get darker occasionally. Doesn't sound bad compared to aliens on mars from hell but it is very atmospheric. You keep flipping the flashlight off as much as you can because batteries left in the cold have little charge, and you don't know how many you will find. Ditto for Kerosene. Tension is made very well. There isn't any cheap monster-in-the-closet scares like in the old Doom games, this game creates legit tension. Very well made. Minor nag, protaganist is female. Would help immersion for me if it was a male protaganist. Still well-done game.\n\nSummary: For current price I got it it is very short, replayability is limited. If it hits sale get it by all means. Me paying $13.49 (release price, 10% off) is about the price of a $12 movie ticket here, this is longer than a movie at 3 hours and was a way better experience. Plus I have it here to play again if I want or I can let family members give it a run, so in that aspect it isn't so bad.

I've never been, myself, but I feel like the devs really captured that feeling of unwelcomness in Near Death.  From the minute you step off the plane, it's clear you're in trouble.  Visibility is poor, you can hear your character chattering her teeth and the only thing you can clearly see (albeit barely) are some lights obscured by the snow in the distance.  \n\nThe game's systems are all designed around the idea of 'dont freeze' and they support it well.  This isn't a quick A to B to C game, you're going to spend time in each area you expore trying to find every useful scrap for crafting; though even on Normal difficulty, I found by the end of the game I had more than enough of everything.  You can repair holes in windows to seal rooms and make them safe, but you can't repair EVERY room - so a large part of the game involves managing where to make your 'safe spots'.  Places you can duck into as you make your way around the base (and you will backtrack quite a bit) to quickly warm up before continuing on.\n\nThe heat mechanic is especially harrowing - on more than one occassion, my sight began to fade and sounds drowned out (warnings you're about to die) only a dozen feet from a door.  The dread comes when you open it only to find a single window is broken - this spot is not as safe.  If you're about to die, the game gives you a quick 'second wind' before you hit the game over screen.  If you can patch that window in time and drop down your heater, you'll be fine.\n\nThe score really adds to the experience as well - adding to the already sense of loneliness, although as the night goes on and the storm gets worse, you can only really hear it when inside.\n\nThe only negative I would probably say is Normal felt a bit too Easy, however it always felt tense which I think for this sort of a game is probably more important than difficulty.\n\n9/7 freezing simulator of the year.", "timestamp_created": 1470342261, "timestamp_updated": 1470342261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24713821": {"recommendationid": "24713821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236974548", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473443971}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a short and sweet, atmospheric tension and relief roller coaster.

The entire story is a tale of survival, as you battle the elements, searching for warmth, and a way home. Your only contact is with someone on the other end of the teletype.\n\nYou get cold very quickly, especially if you are outside or in unsealed rooms. It adds a sense of urgency, which I did enjoy, but some people might feel too rushed. As you get colder your vision gets blurry, and then turns into black and white. If you don\u2019t get to heat quickly, you die. The greatest foe you encounter is the frigid temperature, and you need to scavenge supplies and components, and restore the power whenever you can to stay warm.\n\nThe components you find are used to craft various items to aide you on your quest for survival. Crafting items takes a short time, and recipes are found as you explore. Accessing the inventory or crafting menu doesn\u2019t pause the game while in it, so make sure you\u2019re somewhere warm. There are quests you need to accomplish, and most of them are straightforward fetch quests. I didn\u2019t mind the questing, but expect to do a lot of walking, and stopping to warm up.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list][*]fitting music, and the sounds of the wind feel so real; the audio is very good, and it helps to set the atmosphere nicely\n[*]aspects of a walking simulator combined with the survival element makes it feel a lot more tense, and enjoyable\n[*]voice acting at the start of the game is done well (but I wish there was more voice dialog instead of communicating using the teletype)\n[*]decent graphics; being outside in the snowfall, battling the wind, trying to walk as you shiver and shake from the cold (camera shake can be adjusted or turned off in the settings)\n[*]crafting system is good, and items are easily managed\n[*]no HUD to monitor, instead you use these audio and visual queues to know when to get warm, and it feels more immersive[/list]\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list][*]a bit short for the price\n[*]searching for items takes time; it\u2019s a short time, but I would have preferred instant (you will sometimes find nothing)[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nThe game took me about 2.5 hours to complete, which I feel is a bit short for full price. I still liked the game though, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere a lot. If you\u2019re interested in an immersive walking adventure in the Antarctic, with crafting, and a heavy focus on survival, Near Death might interest you.\n\nIf you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curations [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AzralynnReviews#curation]here.[/url]\nYou can also view this review on my website [url=http://www.azralynn.com/near-death-quick-game-review/]here.[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1470263121, "timestamp_updated": 1491779478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631848", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24698208": {"recommendationid": "24698208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094615056", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470262827}, "language": "english", "review": "Very interesting game.

You are a pilot who has crash landed near Sutro Station, a research facility in the Antarctic. Your first objective is to find warmth. Once you\u2019re temporarily heated up, you need to make contact with another base. As the game takes place in the early 1980\u2019s, you do this by interacting with teletype machines, which is where the bulk of the story is told from. You\u2019ll need to restore power to buildings for warmth, find parts, and rebuild a vehicle, all while battling the elements.\n\nAs you progress in the game, it gets colder and the wind gets more harsh, meaning that\u2019s less time you\u2019re able to spend outside before needing to warm up. It\u2019ll eventually be -100, making traversal quite difficult. The wind plays an active role against you, and slows your progress down; if you\u2019re walking against the wind, you\u2019ll move extremely slow, making crouching the faster bet, and if you\u2019re walking with the wind, you\u2019ll move pretty much unhindered.\n\nTo help you navigate when you can\u2019t see more than ten feet ahead of you, you can craft light poles and rope poles. Lights can be planted anywhere to mark something of interest (perhaps a shed you can duck into to place your heater), and rope poles can be used to help navigate so you don\u2019t get lost. Walking next to a rope will help your movement, even in heavy wind.\n\nThe game contains a fairly basic crafting system, and components are pretty easy to come by. You can make window patches to block off broken windows, allowing you to warm up inside that room. You can craft lights and ropes (as mentioned above), repair kits to restore power, a liner for your jacket and pants, which reduces the frequency of your body heat loss, and a few other items.\n\n[i]Near Death[/i] looks pretty good. You\u2019re on a research base, so the buildings all have a pretty similar style, but the environment itself is great to look at, and all the objects in the world have a distinct 80\u2019s look to them, from the old computers to the teletypes to even the filing cabinets and equipment.\n\nThere is an awesome soundtrack accompanying the game, and the sound effects really make you feel like you\u2019re stuck there. Having the wind howl in your face while your feet crunch the snow underneath is a pretty terrific experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s not much replayability to the game. There are two difficulties, normal and easy. I\u2019m not sure what the exact differences are, but I assume on easy you can spend more time outside before needing heat, and perhaps crafting items costs less materials. I finished the game in about 2.5 hours, on the normal difficulty. I missed some item blueprint somewhere, so I\u2019ll go back and find that, but otherwise, there isn\u2019t much of a reason to revisit the game. The world is the same, the story is the same, and the game will always follow the same outcome.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list][*]Good adventure\n[*]Easy to die and requires some good management of your warmth\n[*]Several options of warming up (batten down a room, restore power)\n[*]Decent story\n[*]Linear story with semi-open world advancement\n[*]Looks and sounds good\n[*]Fun back and forth with your partner at the other station\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list][*]Fairly short at just over two hours (less if you don\u2019t explore)\n[*]Not much replay value\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nWell worth the cost, [i]Near Death[/i] is a fantastic survival game that makes it somewhat easier on you by giving you only one stat to manage: warmth.

It was brief, obviously. The game felt as though it should have been an episode of a larger game, so for the money, I'm not sure your average consumer would say it was worth it. But, for me it was worth it - much better than plopping $25 to sit through another mindless Avengers movie.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is superb. I felt physically frozen for most of the game. The lack of light, blinding snow, and the destroyed, almost post apocalyptic setting was marvelous. Right from the jump, your situation feels completely hopeless. After dying the first few times so easily, I wondered how long my persistence would hold up. But, after figuring out a couple critical mechanics, I was off and running. The feeling of isolation saturates the game's feeling of hopelessness. The crafting system is simple and absolutely necessary regarding a few items. Some items you may disregard, as YMMV, but each item can have a significant impact on your situation. It was an intense, brutal 3 hours of gameplay.\n\nNow, I simply have to point out how much this game resembles The Long Dark. Audio clues, the protagonist's voice, even certain sections of the soundtrack were ripped directly from The Long Dark. These things were really easy to recognize, as I have probably put in a couple hundred  hours in TLD. The similarities were so much that after 15 minutes into the game I began wondering if this game is merely a pilot for an episode the creators for TLD were planning to include in their game.

As it stands, I still, and will almost certainly, recommend this game upon completion. <3\n*FINAL UPDATE*\n\nIn this game, you're essentially Matt Damon in The Martian - except you're a lady in Antarctica. Same principal. \n\nYou've crash landed and you've got to scour an abandoned research facility to search for supplies, craft items to aid with puzzle solving, and eventually - get the hell outta there.\n\nThis can be beaten in a 3-5 hour span, and because of that, some would say it's not worth it. I would argue that - if you're gonna go spend $12 on a movie ticket, spend the extra couple bucks to experience this game. It's a great little story-driven, puzzle solver, survival game developed by 4 or 5 people, and it fills a void that other games in the genre don't. It gives you an experience that's intense, and only meant to last a few hours. It's crafted that way to deliver a story that you see from start to finish, rather  than feeding your addiction to scavenge day after day, getting little achievements here and there to string you along. (It's worth pointing out that I love those games too, I just want to clarify that it isn't that type of experience.)\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the game, and would recommend that you try it. :)\n\nAlso, here's a video review for the TLDR crowd. It has Macho Man Randy Savage.

Even looking at the Store page was enough to see that  [i]Near Death[/i] isn't one of these half-broken, abandoned survival clones popular in the last few years. It is complete, focused and exciting.\n\nAs someone obsessed with polar expeditions (espedially Antarctica), I had high hopes for [i]Near Death[/i] and I have not been disappointed. It's not particularly long and, having completed it on normal difficulty I do have a slight yearning for more variation in my future playthroughs at higher difficulties (different item distribution, procedurally-generated layout, etc.), but on the other hand, by being short and hand-crafted, I feel I've experienced a lovingly designed and refined space, survived a believable situation.\n\nThe story timeline is short, meaning that crafting is thankfully brief and the inventory isn't intrusive (think [i]Alien Isolation[/i]). This is a game about making it from one building to the next without having to apply a crude 'sped-up' hunger meter or rely on zombies as a threat.

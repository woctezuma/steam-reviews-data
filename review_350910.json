They used real people to portray the characters in the story,Digitized graphics is something I miss in gaming,so that's a treat. Most of the designs of these characters are stupid and plain but the cheesyness of it brings the games charm in the looks deparment which is for the most part good and looks the part of a beat em up. However the game does faulter in the Game play. Enemies who have weapons will rush in and attack giving you NO able way of blocking or parrying (To parry most attacks in the game you have to have the reflexes of a god). Blocking is almost useless because groups of enemies will attack relentlessly until you are able to pull off a counter by which you take tons of damage before hand... I feel the game play needs tweaking because there is actually a fun experience to be had here given the issues. 4 player action, catchy sound track and some characters acting live version of Capcom and SNK characters! There is even a level up system where you gain more playable characters and there are a bunch of them. I love that idea!  The only reason I recommend it is the cheese has to be seen to believe and it's a fun little 35 min diversion (granted you don't lose all your continues by the end),but don't spend more than $5 on Streets of Fury EX.

The biggest problem with the game though is unlike a lot of old beatemups there is no desperation move that gets enemies off of you. So this game just loves having a bunch of enemies getting you into ridiculously long combo strings that you have very little option to get out of. There are tech rolls and counters but they take long to build so you just watch your health melt away.

It's not to be taken too seriously and it's \"cheap production value\" and classic Mortal Kombat-esque sprites is part of the charm. The game play shows similarities to Phantom Breaker: Battle Ground (input a command to switch planes) and various fighting games in terms of combat. There are tons of playable characters, including the Nostalgia Critic and Benzaie from ThatGuyWithTheGlasses.com that are unlocked as you perform combos to increase your Security Level. \n\nCombat wise, you have a variety of \"Mash X\" string combos that change based on the direction you are holding. The Y button provides various launchers that also function based on the direction you're holding. The B button actions like the Smash Bros games as well, providing different special moves like travel attacks, slide kicks and dragon punches. The game doesn't tell you this, but doing the down B attack (or the B attack) in the air can sometimes do a sort of dive kick, which can be handy in dealing damage and continuing combos. Finally, there are \"fury\" moves which act like supers from a fighting game. Both you and enemies can block and be guard crushed, and after being attacked too much, either of you can perform an unblockable counter (even as you're dying!), though, enemies don't do it too often. \n\nYou can string these moves together, in silly, spammy, but bombastic combos. However, some enemies can resist being stunlocked/interuppted and perform a powerful attack that will set you up to take more damage or be juggled. I can't quite always say the game is fair. One the one hand, you can batter the enemies in an almost Dynasty Warriors style fashion, and it takes learning of the enemy behaviors to really maximize your dominance. On the other hand, you can easily get stun locked and juggled to oblivion, especially by some of the more annoying enemies like the \"Drop kicking cornrow F**ker\" or \"nunchuck slinging b**ches\". There are many places I dread in the first act (which I can't beat the last boss on :( ) because I'm expecting to loose 3/4th of my health to a handful of enemies.  (though, some playable characters might handle them better than others, you have to unlock them though).\n\n\nThese unfair moments hold me from seriously suggesthing this game. I had fun with it, and not a terrible buy at sale, but I don't recommend it if you're looking for a good brawler that you want to finish. Maybe get it on sale to experience for an hour or so, or spend hours getting good at it, which seems preposterous for it's corny nature.", "timestamp_created": 1483021831, "timestamp_updated": 1483021831, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533076", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28774806": {"recommendationid": "28774806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038431675", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508158858}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun...Fun...Fun...

The one problem is the absence of online mode, but the campaign's second story will help scratch that multiplayer itch if you can't do local co-op (or local versus!).\n\nAnd, hey, it DOES have an awesome soundtrack as well!", "timestamp_created": 1480027292, "timestamp_updated": 1480027292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550706", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27235097": {"recommendationid": "27235097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040381282", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489927693}, "language": "german", "review": "Dieses Spiel ist einfach nur von Vorne bis Hinten total bekloppt und durchgedreht, im Possitiven sinn.

We started off laughing our asses off at the character sprites that looked like they were made by a few friends getting together on a Saturday with a camera or reading the bizarre character bios and backstories.  But then we found ourselves genuinely hooked on the combo happy multiplayer.  After finishing the demo we actually ponied up for the full version and played it all weekend.\n\nFast forward to 2016 when I noticed Streets of Fury EX randomly on Steam.  I wasted no time picking it up (and immediately  notifying my friend from before).  This \"EX\" version is largely the same as the XBox version, but it adds more content and higher resolution assets.\n\nThe game itself is a beat em up that takes a lot of queues from Guardian Heroes on the Sega Saturn.  You and your opponents shift between three vertical planes.  You'll be tasked with punching out scores of bad guys using one of a roster of characters that all look pretty much like normal people in their street clothes.  But just like Guardian Heroes you can easily pull off ridiculous combos by stringing together elaborate-but-easy-to-pull-off moves.  Lots of launching, air combos, juggling, and crowd controlling AOEs.  Inputs are simple and once you have the basics down you can be racking up combos in the hundreds in no time.  With up to 4 players going at it at the same time, things can get absolutely bananas.\n\nSo the gameplay is fun (though not necessarily perfectly balanced) but the presentation is definitely what got its hooks in me.  It's all very low budget and none of the \"actors\" look particularly menacing.  Bosses are usually just regular mobs that are scaled bigger or tinted a different color.  This may all sound unimpressive but it adds to the game's charm: it's clearly a low budget effort from a small team, but the game emulates the fun of Guardian Heroes exceptionally well.  The game can eventually get repetitive with a limited number of backgrounds and characters, but I say for those that know what they're getting into it's a hugely fun time.", "timestamp_created": 1479935019, "timestamp_updated": 1479935019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500312", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26826911": {"recommendationid": "26826911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019827570", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499977805}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice indie game with some crasy combos and characters.

On top of it all, I don't have an Xbox 360 controller to play this with; I'm typing this review with the same keyboard I use to play this game. Nevertheless, this game is so fun and charming. The controls are completely customizable and therefore very easy to pick up and start playing. While the game isn't super balanced, namely Bob Lennon destroys everyone, it is still fun and the wide array of characters prevents this moderate lack of balance from destroying the game. The game has two campaigns with several difficulties for each, so completing the game is a task for the dedicated. That being said, the game feels oddly shallow in content for some reason. But with a friend to play with, this is mostly negated. I bought this game at half-price for $4.99, and at that price the game is an 8.3/10. At full $9.99 price, the game receives a 7.9/10.

Buscaba algo parecido desde hac\u00eda tiempo por steam, el t\u00edpico juego de ir dando mamporros a todo lo que se mueva para jugar en cooperativo, pero por desgracia soy un desconocedor de este g\u00e9nero y la mayor\u00eda de juegos que encontraba eran de disparos estilo Metal Slug o Contra y eso ya no me gusta, hasta que di con Streets of Fury EX.\n\nNo se bien como analizar este juego, es un claro homenaje a Street of Rage y otros juegos de este estilo, quiz\u00e1 en un primero momento me choc\u00f3 la est\u00e9tica de sus personajes (si, se hace muy extra\u00f1o ver esas capturas de personas reales con fondos fotografiados y mezclados con gr\u00e1ficos simplones hechos por ordenador). Pero al final me decid\u00ed a comprarlo y no me arrepiento. La de risas que me estoy echando jugando en cooperativo, a parte de que disfruto del juego cada partida que juego. Ahora pasar\u00e9 a comentar brevemente aquello que me parece rese\u00f1able del juego.\n\n- La jugabilidad, pese a que el juego es el t\u00edpico avanzar y aporrear a todos los enemigos nos encontramos con un muy buen sistema de combos, ademas de que cada personaje posee 3 tipos diferences de especiales que podemos ejecutar una vez llenamos nuestro medidor de \"Fury\". Un tutorial nos explica al principio el funcionamiento en profundidad del sistema de combate pero tendremos que dedicarle buenas horas a saber cuando protegernos, esquivar, atacar a ciertos enemigos, etc...\n\n- La dificultad sin duda es elevada en los modos de juego Hard y en adelante, apenas he podido completarlo en cooperativo en Medium (a\u00fan no se jugarlo bien evidentemente), pero sin duda ofrece buenos ratos y un desafio para aquellos que les gusta rejugarlo en dificultades mayores. Ademas de que segun derrotemos enemigos y hagamos combos mas largos subiremos el \"Security Level\" con el cual podemos desbloquear el resto de personajes (son 15 en total) y otros modos de juego (otro modo historia, modo versus, survival, etc...).\n\n\nNo puedo decir nada malo pues era lo que quer\u00eda y esperaba, es divertido, gracioso, extra\u00f1o y alocado por momentos. Un indie que me ofrece aquello que buscaba, quiz\u00e1 eche en falta el poder coger armas (bates, tuberias, cuchillos, etc...) algo t\u00edpico en muchos juegos de este g\u00e9nero, pero ofrece un buen sistema de combate y combos en compensacion.\n\nSin duda lo recomiendo para aquellos que vayan a jugarlo acompa\u00f1ados, ya que solo se puede hacer algo pesado.

Le principe est de prendre des vid\u00e9os de vrais acteurs et de les num\u00e9riser pour en faire des sprites. L\u2019exemple le plus connu reste le jeu Mortal Kombat et ses fatality. Mais malgr\u00e9 d\u2019autres exemples de jeux, la mode s\u2019estompe assez vite tandis que la 3D fait son entr\u00e9e, pour revenir 20 ans plus tard. Les d\u00e9veloppeurs Fran\u00e7ais de Guard Crush Games d\u00e9cident de rendre hommage \u00e0 leur fa\u00e7on avec une beat them all, non pas en 8 bit ni en 3D mais avec des acteurs. Le r\u00e9sultat s\u2019appelle Street Of Fury EX, reste \u00e0 savoir si cette originalit\u00e9 fait un jeu.[/b]\n\n[h1]PARIS BR\u00dbLE T-IL?[/h1]\n\nDans cette reprise de Street Of Rage, le sc\u00e9nario tient sur une demi feuille de papier. La ville de Paris est compl\u00e8tement submerg\u00e9e par les gang dans une version catastrophique des \u00e9meutes de 2005, et m\u00eame l\u2019arm\u00e9e est en gr\u00e8ve. L\u2019Etat Fran\u00e7ais fait appel \u00e0 vous, membre des grang de L.A pour faire le nettoyage et r\u00e9tablir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Vous allez donc dans le mode campagne affronter les ca\u00efd un \u00e0 un , chacun ayant ses propres coups sp\u00e9ciaux et son arm\u00e9e de sbires pr\u00eats \u00e0 se battre jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la mort. Pendant la s\u00e9lection des personnages, on sent le bon clich\u00e9 de la rue : des messieurs \u00e0 capuches, des flingues, des wesh ma gueule ou encore des karat\u00e9kas (?). Le fait que tous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 digitalis\u00e9s a partir de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de d\u00e9veloppement rend le r\u00e9sultat plut\u00f4t mythique. Un guest vient d\u2019ailleurs s\u2019incruster dans la bataille, bien connu des habitu\u00e9s de youtube : Benzaie.  Mais passons au jeu en lui m\u00eame, et aux techniques de combat de nos guerriers des rues. Pour vaincre les ennemis, le joueur poss\u00e8de trois coups : un coup classique qui fait peu de d\u00e9g\u00e2ts et deux coups puissants plus utiles. Ces deux derniers utilisent cependant de l\u2019endurance et il faudra r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer entre deux s\u00e9ries de mandales. Enfin une barre de fury se remplit tout au long des combats, permettant de lancer des coups sp\u00e9ciaux \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re d\u2019un Street Of Rage. L\u2019avantage de Street OF Fury EX est de proposer des variantes des coups cit\u00e9s ci-dessus que ce soit par l\u2019ajout d\u2019une direction, par une fury associ\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque bouton ou des combos. Ajoutez \u00e0 cela des conbos, et vous obtenez un jeu avec un gameplay digne d\u2019un jeu de combat de la p\u00e9riode Street Fighter 2. Et c\u2019est bien l\u00e0 sa seule qualit\u00e9, car pour \u00eatre honn\u00eate : on s\u2019ennuie.\n\n[h1]UN D\u00c9LIRE DE D\u00c9VELOPPEURS NE FAIT PAS UN BON JEU[/h1]\n\nEn mettant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le parti pris graphique des images digitalis\u00e9es, qui ne plaira pas \u00e0 tout le monde mais qui est assum\u00e9, le jeu ressemble plus \u00e0 un trip sous acide des d\u00e9veloppeurs mis tel quel en mouvement. Les environnements sont tout d\u2019abord tr\u00e8s peu inspir\u00e9s, et on alternera entre ville/m\u00e9tro/ville/m\u00e9tro, avec seulement quelques plans modifi\u00e9s. Je ne dis pas que Paris est une ville multicolore, mais l\u00e0 c\u2019est d\u00e9primant, et le level design n\u2019arrange pas les choses. Pas de phases en scrolling forc\u00e9, d\u2019int\u00e9rieurs (sauf le m\u00e9tro), pas de plateformes (Double Dragon), ici on avance et on tape, en esp\u00e9rant ne pas br\u00fbler ses pr\u00e9cieux cr\u00e9dits. Il y a bien trois niveaux de profondeur pour varier les plaisirs mais on touche au principal probl\u00e8me de EX : son c\u00f4t\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9titif. J\u2019avais fait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la m\u00eame remarque pour Hyrule Warriors, \u00e0 savoir foncer dans des ennemis \u00e0 l\u2019IA tr\u00e8s variable en encha\u00eenant coups-attaque sp\u00e9ciale-coups-\u2026, avant de passer \u00e0 la suite. On peut essayer tous les personnages disponibles, et d\u00e9bloquer les autres pour voir leur set de mouvements, mais si le reste ne suit pas on en revient \u00e0 toujours prendre le m\u00eame membre de gang. On essaye alors les autres modes comme les \u201cChallenges\u201d ou le \u201cSurvival\u201d mais ce ne sont que des variantes bas\u00e9s sur le m\u00eame jeu de base, donc vite lassantes. Bon point n\u00e9anmoins, le multijoueur jusqu\u2019\u00e0 4 peut permettre dans une soir\u00e9e arros\u00e9 de d\u00e9lirer entre potes une fois ou deux. Pour r\u00e9sumer une bonne d\u00e9ception.\n\n[h1]A retenir[/h1]\n\n[b]Street Of Fury EX partait du principe qu\u2019il fallait faire du second degr\u00e9 (sc\u00e9nario, graphisemes) mais oublie de nombreuses choses dans le jeu final. Malgr\u00e9 un gameplay plut\u00f4t fourni, le jeu est assez r\u00e9p\u00e9titif, plut\u00f4t moche et \u00e9quipe ses ennemis d\u2019une IA assez incompr\u00e9hensible. Seul le multijoueur rattrape un peu le tout et permet de passer une ou deux soir\u00e9es sympas avec des bi\u00e8res.

Pas un beat de hip-hop malgr\u00e9 les titres de niveaux qui laisseraient penser \u00e7a.\nY'a 3 persos et demi pour faire les ennemis et tout ce qui change c'est leur couleur ou taille.\nTout ce qui fait l'interet de ce jeu c'est Benzaie, Bob Lenon (eux on fait vraiment bien leur persos) et la nostalgie. A 10 balles c'est trop cher. Mais bon ca a le m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre dr\u00f4le.\nC'est un bon mauvais jeu. Ca aurait plus de sens si yavait JDG.\n\nIl y a de tr\u00e8s bon point et notemment que franchement c'est tr\u00e8s drole. C'est un joyeux bordel.\nL'animation est fluide et la mechanique de combos est franchement sympa.\nSi vous avez envie de rire et que les beat em all oldschool vous manque....\n\nBref c'est fendart mais ca reste trop cher pour ce que c'est... en esperant que ca s'update :) Et qu'ils le porte sur GNU/linux/steamOS...", "timestamp_created": 1453167797, "timestamp_updated": 1460771943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20530942": {"recommendationid": "20530942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081930566", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452814089}, "language": "english", "review": "doesn't have Co-op and multiplayer", "timestamp_created": 1452814619, "timestamp_updated": 1452814619, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.176472", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20497099": {"recommendationid": "20497099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023073191", "num_games_owned": 4853, "num_reviews": 271, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452645091}, "language": "japanese", "review": "[h1][b]\u30dc\u30b9\u6226\u4e2d\u306b\u5927\u91cf\u306e\u96d1\u9b5a\u6575\u306b\u82e6\u6226\u3057\u3066\u3001\u306a\u3093\u3068\u304b\u30c8\u30c9\u30e1\u306b\u5fc5\u6bba\u6280\u304b\u3051\u3066\u4e00\u7db2\u6253\u5c3d\u3067\u307e\u3068\u3081\u3066\u5012\u3059\u4e8b\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u3066\u3001\u4e00\u606f\u3064\u3044\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067\u5f8c\u308d\u632f\u308a\u5411\u3044\u305f\u3089\u3001\u5473\u65b9\u304c8\u4eba\u304c\u304b\u308a\u3067\u30dc\u30b9\u30d5\u30eb\u30dc\u30c3\u30b3\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3001\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u9593\u306b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u7d42\u308f\u3063\u3066\u308b\u795e\u30b2\u30fc\u99ac\u9e7f\u30b2\u30fc[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1452645312, "timestamp_updated": 1452645417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599191", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20494652": {"recommendationid": "20494652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009090811", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 16842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513572625}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game \nAir combos\nJuggles\nSuper moves \nMy favorite beat em up !\n\nPlease make this game for 3ds or ps vita so I can play on the go", "timestamp_created": 1452633756, "timestamp_updated": 1452633756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20477750": {"recommendationid": "20477750", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988905054", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453076503}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun game to play and reminds me of Streets of Rage but with a more modern look.

A really good parody!\n\nSeriously, on my first playthrough I couldn't stop smiling or laughing even when i tried. If you played this kind of games in the 90s you'll know what I'm talking about when you play this one :P\n\nAnyway, the fighting mechanics are solid; in fact they are better than most old beat-em-ups. There are a lot of  playable/unlockable characters with unique personalities and fighting styles. And, for the most part, their animations are very smooth. The gameplay can be a bit repetitive, but very polished and challenging.\n\nI wish they included more female characters and female enemy npcs. In fact, I wish they had a bigger variety of unique enemies as a whole, especially when it comes to the bosses. Still, by combining different enemy types on each level the game will push you to keep coming up with new strategies.\n\nThe one thing that failed to impress me is the level design. Levels are kind repetitive and flat. In the old-school fighting games you were fighting on moving trains, inside buildings, inside elevators, on beaches, in gardens, etc. There were bystanders, destructible barrels and boxes, power-ups and weapons that you could pick up. Not here unfortunately. Most of the time in Streets of Fury you are fighting either in the streets, parking garages, or the subway platform, but the textures and colors are so similar for each location that it feels like you are on the same stage over and over.\n\nDespite the shortcomings, Streets of Fury EX is a great game.

The graphics may look like doodoo, but when the gameplay is so excellent, it really doesn't matter. It's kind of charming in its own way.\n\nMechanics:\nYour characters have a lot of attacks and you can do all sorts of crazy juggle combos; just watch the trailer to see the kind of extreme techniques that you have at your disposal. You'll never feel limited and you'll keep wanting to discover more and more combos.\n\nControls: \nSharp, on point. This is very important in a beat em up. Button layout is easy to comprehend.\n\nMusic:\nVery catchy music! It resembles 90s techno, which is the perfect tribute to a classic beat em up.\n\nExtras:\nCo-op is couch 4 player and players can jump in. There are two campaigns and while they share similar areas, you recruit CPU allies in the second one to help out. There is also Challenge, Survival and Versus. The game can be very challenging on Normal, don't be ashamed to play on Easy or ask a friend to join you.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nJust buy the game, it's way too much fun! A wonderful tribute to old beat em ups and lots of nods to 2D fighting games. There's even Jesse from Breaking Bad as a playable character! At 10 bucks, it's a steal.

That's not saying anything at all.\nOk.\nStreets of Fury EX is one of the best beatemups on Steam.\nEh? Eh?!\nWhat? That's still not saying anything? Jeeze.\n\nBeatemups are a tough genre to figure out. When you break it down enough, it's just walking up to people and punching them in the face. However, there's much more to it than that. This is a genre that demands perfect mechanics, solid controls, and the right balance of challenge, depth, and entertainment. Most developers don't even get the mechanics right, let alone everything else. \n\nStreets of Fury EX gets practically everything right. On first glance it looks ridiculous, but that's part of its charm. Not everyone is going to be nostalgic of games starring digitized characters, but I don't know. I kinda hope they'll make a come-back. It also helps that the cast of characters are uh...mostly normal. It reminds me of Dong Dong Never Die. That was a game filled with random people that can somehow throw fireballs, soar through the air, and cause earthquakes when they stomp the ground. \n\nThere are 15+ playable heroes in SoFEX. Each fighter has a set of regular moves, special attacks, and a handful of supers. Combining these techniques to create combos is extremely enjoyable. Even during the beatemup genre's peak (the 90s) most combos were just mashing the attack button to perform automatic moves. With this game, if it keeps the enemy in the air, it counts. This game uses a lot of ideas present in other fighters, such as ground bounces, launchers, and OTG shenanigans. Basically, this means that you have a lot of tools to play around with. While unnecessary, it's also nice that each character has a distinct personality. Most of them have multiple taunts as well as unique \"death\" animations.\n\nWhile it would probably be enough to create a bunch of dullard enemies to style on, SoFEX relies on making every enemy unique. There are a ton of re-used sprites (as per genre-standards), but they all have different strategies. Let's look at the Jesse Pinkman knock-offs. These jerks use guns. The orange Jay Cees don't attack, but will shoot you out of the air. Red? He taunts and then fires, which has the added affect of making him partially invulnerable (unless guard-broken). As for green, he just fires with no warning, but has no invincibility. No Jessy can be approached in the same manner. This ideal extends to the entirety of the enemy roster. \n\nThe two campaigns do a fine job of exploring the possible enemy combinations. Eventually you'll grasp what works, and try to maximize your damage in the few openings you can create. It's the perfect showcase for the real depth that can be found in a beatemup. In order to beat someone down, you have to work for it. This aspect is further driven into the player's head in the Survival mode. In each wave, the player must contend with increasing odds. The enemies are randomized, which can result in an numerous combinations. It's up to the player to use the myriad of tools at their disposal to separate foes from the pack and give them a quick yet thorough crushing. The bad-guys will not shy away from making the player suffer. In later waves, a single screw-up can lead to the player getting juggled for half their health. \n\nFor another kind of challenge, the...uh..challenge mode offers numerous battles. It's almost like a puzzle game. You have to figure out the right character, what enemies to focus on, and which moves to perform. There are a few \"kick everyone's ass\" missions, but most of the time you're going to try different combinations and ideas until you find the one that really works. It's a satisfying addition. An amusing bonus that shouldn't be ignored is the campaign edit. Various parameters can be changed, from enemy aggressiveness & numbers to gravity to how fast everyone moves. This can result in tons of hilarity, as well as even more ways to play through the game. \n\nMore important than anything else: This is a beatemup that just [i]feels[/i] right. The mechanics are properly handled. There is enough satisfaction when punching an enemy, as well as appropriate warning when an enemy is going to attack. This is accomplished through animations and flashing effects. If you have a watchful eye and keep your ears open, you'll always have an idea of what's going on, even when 10+ enemies are on-screen. Every hit is on-point, nothing feels cheap or leaves you thinking \"how'd he hit me?! He was way over there!\" Within minutes of playing you get a feel for how everything works, and can start working on the finer details as well as developing your own amazing combos. \n\nThis game is missing online-play...which hurts bad. The last release didn't have it either but damn, I hope it happens eventually. Couch co-op is always an option at least. In any case, this game will last quite awhile. I couldn't tell you where Streets of Fury EX stands among the classics, but it is one of the finest beatemups released in the 21st century.\n\nI hope that's saying something.\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1435819438, "timestamp_updated": 1436924597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.813173", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16837794": {"recommendationid": "16837794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018512090", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436230364}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like Tekken Force and Mortal Kombat had a baby.

I'm a big fan of beatemup games, I've been playing them since Double Dragon I, even though more often than not they're horrible button mashing monstrosities, so when I say this is one of the best beatemups I've ever played, it's worth paying attention.", "timestamp_created": 1435810283, "timestamp_updated": 1435810283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16821770": {"recommendationid": "16821770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059098963", "num_games_owned": 522, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435749525}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uadf8\ub0e5 \ubcd1\ub9db\uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1435730307, "timestamp_updated": 1435730307, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16808144": {"recommendationid": "16808144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016444009", "num_games_owned": 1480, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491999187}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5b9f\u5199\uff1f\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u304c1\uff5e3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u6226\u3046\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\n\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3001\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u3001\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u79fb\u52d5\u306b\u65b9\u5411\u30ad\u30fc\uff0b\u5f31\u5f37\u5fc5\u6bba\u6280\u306b3\u7a2e\u985e\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u6280\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u6226\u3044\u307e\u3059\n\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3084\u4f55\u51e6\u304b\u3067\u898b\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3042\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306a\u6280\u306b\u7b11\u3044\u304c\u6b62\u307e\u3089\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\n\u304a\u624b\u8efd\u306b\u7a7a\u4e2d\u30b3\u30f3\u30dc\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3066\u697d\u3057\u3044\u304c\nHA\u6301\u3061\u306e\u6575\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3066\u306e\u653b\u6483\u304c\u3042\u307e\u308a\u306a\u3044\u306e\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3066\u6575\u306f\u30ef\u30f3\u30d1\u30f3\u3067\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u3076\u3061\u7834\u3063\u305f\u308a\n\u304a\u624b\u7389\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3069\u3046\u306b\u3082\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u305d\u3053\u304c\u6b8b\u5ff5\uff08\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u306f\u4e00\u5fdc\u3042\u308b\u304c\u5730\u306b\u8db3\u3064\u3051\u3066\u306a\u3044\u3068\u610f\u5473\u304c\u7121\u3044\uff09\n\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u30ce\u30fc\u30de\u30eb\u304f\u3089\u3044\u3067\u30b5\u30af\u30c3\u3068\u3084\u308b\u306e\u304c\u4e00\u756a\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1435669996, "timestamp_updated": 1435669996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694910", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16806350": {"recommendationid": "16806350", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970030761", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507912340}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu extr\u00eamement fun qui saura animer vos soir\u00e9es entre potes.\nGraphisme simplistes, mais gameplay vraiment tr\u00e8s complet  pour un beat them all.

That's Streets of Fury EX in a nutshell.  It reminds me of the sort of game a bunch of my buddies in high school and I might have made, had digital cameras and cheap chromakey software been widely available then.  But underneath the somewhat amateurish look is a surprisingly deep and fun side-scrolling beat 'em up, with tight controls and a robust combo system.  Stringing together multi-hit beatdowns is a snap, and each of the many unlockable characters has a full arsenal of combat moves, including chargable super attacks.  Up to four players can join in local co-op, and survival and challenge modes are also available.  Sadly, there's no online play, nor is there a training mode to practice your combos.       \n\nIf the game seems familiar, that's because it originally made its debut in 2007 on the Xbox Indie Games service, and was a finalist in the the 2008 Dream Build Play competition.  The 360 version was fun, but clearly constrained by limitations of the hardware and the platform.  The smooth animation of the video-captured sprites meant that only a few actors were used, and their footage spread across multiple characters with extremely similar movesets.  In a genre that's already heavy on repitition, that's not a good thing.  But for the remaster, the developers added a slew of new, distinct brawlers, many of whom parody popular fighting game icons (check out the martial artist with his Ryu-style Shin Shoryuken, or the scarf-wearing send-up of Street Fighter 3's Q).  Guard Crush Games even apparently got one of their dads to play the end boss!  The fighting system has also been revised, with some control changes and a \"stamina\" meter added, which can be used for powerful special moves or to block enemy attacks.  \n\nOverall, this is definitely worth a look even if you played the original eight years ago (yikes, has it really been that long?).", "timestamp_created": 1435610424, "timestamp_updated": 1435611027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629352", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16753593": {"recommendationid": "16753593", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974802174", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435279343}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't laughed so hard while playing a game in only god knows how long.

I was pretty amped to discover that they were planning on doing a PC version of this, so I've been patiently waiting...\n\nStreets of Fury is a throwback to late 80's - early 90's arcade style beat-em ups done in the style of games like old-skool Mortal Kombat using digitized sprites. Streets of Fury sports a very competent and deep combo system that is simple and pick-up-and-playable for beginners, while more experienced players can string together ridiculously long combos that look like something out of a high level MvC2 or Skullgirls match...\n\nThe EX version takes everything from the original and simply expands & improves on it.\n\n[b]+[/b] Larger roster of playable characters.\n[b]+[/b] New enemy types. And unique sprites for all of them :D\n[b]+[/b] New game modes.\n[b]+[/b] Higher res sprites, and improved environment visuals/variety.\n[b]+[/b] Gameplay tweaks & streamlined control scheme.\n[b]+[/b] Some new music as well.\n\n\n[h1]Some notable changes from the original:[/h1]\n+ With the dash and lane switching tied to the direction keys, it means you can play this game with a keyboard & fight stick perfectly fine. In the original, you were required to use the triggers to dash, and switch lanes...\n\n+ The stamina meter, is a simple addition to the game but changes the way you'll need to approach this game if you're coming from the original version. Basically, whenever you use a special attack it requires some stamina and if you run out then you won't be able to do any special attacks until it fills up a bit... R.I.P gun-cancel infinite spam :(\nWhere things get complicated is that your stamina meter also doubles as your guard/armor meter so blocking attacks reduces your stamina and losing all your stamina causes you to guard break. It should be noted that both players and enemies use stamina.\n\n\nAnd while I do like this game, there are some glaring omissions, and just some general stuff I don't like with this version.\n\n[h1]Stuff missing:[/h1]\n- Character movelists from the original. Seriously why was this not included???\n- Combo tutorial videos. I found these very useful, and having these videos in the original gave players an easy way to see what the general playstyle of the characters were, as well as a basis for building combos.\n\n[h1]General annoyances:[/h1]\n- 2015, and still no online play for both the co-op and versus :(\n- The button prompts in this game do not reflect your current control scheme and prompt simply assume that you're playing this game with an Xbox 360 pad using the default key binds.\n- Characters are locked behind a level gate again, sigh... The variety of characters, and mastery of the characters already give you enough incentive to replay this game IMO, so this is just pointless grinding...\n- This is just a personal nitpick, but I really did not like the inclusion of the enemy that swears all the time. It was something that really stuck out like a sore thumb for me, and IMO doesn't gel with the silly, playful nature of this game. Fortunately they included a language-filter option for that guy lol.\n\n\n[h1]Overall Rating:[/h1]\n- If you're looking for an old-skool arcade brawler with some fighting game sensibilities then I recommend it on account that you're perfectly okay with playing this solo & local co-op/versus.", "timestamp_created": 1435441656, "timestamp_updated": 1435488027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16743081": {"recommendationid": "16743081", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963522145", "num_games_owned": 691, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496445029}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little gem.", "timestamp_created": 1435422574, "timestamp_updated": 1435422574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16740768": {"recommendationid": "16740768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111968405", "num_games_owned": 2030, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435147163}, "language": "english", "review": "NOTE: Key was provided by developer for testing\n\nStreets of Fury EX is classic beat 'em up game.

Choose from a list of regular looking people wearing rugged clothing and fight your way to the Big Boss. That\u2019s really the story, I mean it is a beat-em up title after all!\n\nHigh Points\n\nBeat them down \u2013 Streets of Fury EX excels at the classic go straight formula. You can select from a wide variety of characters and proceed down the street beating the living crap out of anyone in your way. There is a direction based combo system in place that allows you to air juggle opponents, guard crush, or pull off powerful special abilities.\n\nMortal Kombat with a hint of Narc \u2013 Visually it hits the nostalgia factor with the live action combat of a Mortal Kombat title. The backgrounds remind me a bit of the old Narc arcade title. The game has that pasted together look that most live-action based Arcade games usually have. It works well for a game that is clearly intended for the coin-op generation.\n \nCooperative play \u2013 Playing with a friend is the absolute way to play Streets of Fury EX. The combat is less cheap with two people watching each other\u2019s backs and stringing together combo after combo. I was only able to play this with two players, but I can only imagine the insanity of playing with four others!\n\nNitpicks\n\nNo Online Play \u2013 Local only cooperative play in a world of the internet. Hope you have four controllers and a few friends that want to come over and play a ragtag arcade game. \n\nLack of enemy variety \u2013 By the time you\u2019ve reached the third act of the story, you\u2019ve fought everyone in the game. They will then distinguish themselves by walking around with disco lighting all over their bodies or adding a different animation to their attacks. It starts to become repetitive for what is mostly a game you can plow through in about forty-five minutes.  \n\nLow Points\n\nQueued up moves \u2013 There isn\u2019t a lot of room for reaction to certain moves in the game. Unlike beat-em ups in the Arcades of the 90\u2019s, there is a lack of fluidity when attempting to fight multiple enemies. Let\u2019s use Streets of Rage 2 as example. I can easily fight a character in front of me, spin around and attack the next one and move in-between the foreground and background to avoid attacks. \n\nStreets of Fury EX queues up moves and leaves you vulnerable to attacks. Unlike most games that allow you to spin around and immediately attack, the only type of defense in these instances is to block and wait for a counter-attack. It leads to a lot of unfair ass beatings while playing solo, which means this game was truly intended for cooperative audiences. \n\nTerrible character choices - There are a lot of brawlers to play as, but a large amount of them are dreadful. Despite the awful choices in clothing some of them wear, there are just too many that leave themselves open to attacks. Not a lot of attention was paid to making these fighters functional combatants. At least sixty percent of these fighters are straight up doo-doo on a cheese sandwich and that\u2019s the opposite of delicious. \n\nConclusion\n\nStreets of Fury EX is an Arcade game from the 90\u2019s in the year 2015. It\u2019s only going to appeal to people with that hint of nostalgia in their hearts. It\u2019s not anywhere near a masterpiece but it does provide us with a fair amount of coop beat-em up action. I\u2019ll be honest\u2026 you probably won\u2019t want to shell full price out for this. It\u2019s a bit rough around the edges in terms of beat-em ups, and fails to live up to the genre with a barebones combat scheme.", "timestamp_created": 1435248387, "timestamp_updated": 1435297897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642112", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16700704": {"recommendationid": "16700704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039725265", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467999496}, "language": "french", "review": "Des perso tres bien digitalis\u00e9e,un paquet de mod (dommage qu'il ni est pas de versus avec l'ia),de quoi faire,une bonne dur\u00e9e de vie,tres fun,possibilit\u00e9e de jouer a 4,vari\u00e9e (versus et bite fait mal),pas chere et BENZAIE...\n\nDeja meilleur que Street fighter 5,bravo les devs,vous avez m\u00e9ritez mon argent,3 ans que j'attendais cette \"suite\" de la version 360,je suis combl\u00e9e.\n\nReposez vous bien,vous l'avez m\u00e9rit\u00e9 ;)", "timestamp_created": 1435248034, "timestamp_updated": 1435248106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502610", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16699608": {"recommendationid": "16699608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067489753", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450145340}, "language": "english", "review": "I put countless hours into the 360 version of this when it was release for the Indie Game service quite a few years back.

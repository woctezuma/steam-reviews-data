The gameplay actually requires you to master the games decks (or use a rush deck if you're a scrub) to beat the final few bosses! The gameplay as well reminds me of the Skystone Minigame from the mediocre Skylanders Giants with a few extra twists that makes it infintesimally better. The artstyle is also appealing to me. The only real nitpick I have is that the gameplay can be easily cheesed by using a rush deck.\n\nThis game is pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1521767801, "timestamp_updated": 1521767801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40969337": {"recommendationid": "40969337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048871855", "num_games_owned": 489, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 417, "last_played": 1521778045}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2665 Amusing game\n\nCard City Nights is pleasing with it's odd array of characters & irony filled humor (example: a volcano character with a spicy personality, named 'hot head'). A friend said it reminded them of Scott Pilgrim, an observation that's correct! This game resembles Scott P. in it's humor, along with Napoleon Dynamite, Snot Girl, etc. \n\n\u2665 Challenge filled fun\n\nCard City Nights has a variety of different boss/rival characters. Some you can only play against once, typically difficult fights that grant you 'legendary' cards (the goal of the game is to find them all), while other characters you can fight over and over again in exchange for rewards: booster packs and/or gold. \n\nWhile I did find that each enemy has their own pattern, making it somewhat easier to fight them (in some cases - too easy/repetitive especially when you have 'best out of 3' or 'best out of 5'), the game can prove a challenge. Sometimes you can understand their pattern but actually beating them is another matter!\n\nMechanic wise, I think the developers did a great job with creating a diverse series of cards, each with their own attributes, and angles that can be used. There's endless possibilities for combos (you need at least 3cards that line up angle wise) that can create devastating attacks, as well as strong defense. There's so many different styles a player can take, from trying to wipe out the enemy's health completely, to filling up the enemy's board (if they can't make a move, you win), to something else entirely. It isn't a system that makes you feel limited nor forced to play a certain way. There's a million ways to win!\n\n\u2665 Easy to run\n\nThough the gameplay isn't terribly easy, Card City Nights is very nice on systems. I have a laptop that's going down the drain life wise and it's not a strain at all to play it. The game itself is very simple: there's no moving backgrounds, walking characters, etc. This also makes it easier on people, like me, who have motion sickness. There's very few games, whether on PC or console, that I can spend hours playing and not feel/get sick - this is one of the (appreciated!) few. \n\nCard City Nights also has trading cards and steam achievements. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1521699251, "timestamp_updated": 1521699251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40901549": {"recommendationid": "40901549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336862792", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518710290}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u5909\u308f\u3063\u305f\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002\u8ab2\u91d1\u8981\u7d20\u306f\u4e00\u5207\u306a\u3057\u3002\n\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u540c\u58eb\u3092\u77e2\u5370\u3067\u7e4b\u3052\u3066\u653b\u6483\u3084\u56de\u5fa9\u306a\u3069\u3092\u884c\u3044\u3001\u76f8\u624b\u306eHP\u30920\u306b\u3059\u308b\u304b\u3053\u308c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7f6e\u3051\u306a\u304f\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3068\u52dd\u3061\u3001\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u3002\n\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306b\u63cf\u304b\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u306f\u3053\u308c\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u4f1a\u793e\u306e\u4ed6\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u3067\u3001\u8857\u306e\u4f4f\u4eba\u305f\u3061\u306f\u305d\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u305f\u3061\u3092\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u306b\u3057\u305f\u5225\u4eba\u3001\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u304c\u7279\u5fb4\u3002\n\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u5bfe\u6226\u3067\u304d\u308b\u5834\u6240\u306f\u5b66\u6821\u3084\u30d0\u30fc\u3001\u5e7d\u970a\u5c4b\u6577\u3084\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d4\u30f3\u30b0\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb\u306a\u3069\u30d0\u30e9\u30a8\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u306b\u5bcc\u3093\u3060\u5834\u6240\u304c\u591a\u3044\u3002\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4e2d\u306b\u6d41\u308c\u308bBGM\u306f\u591c\u3092\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3057\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3001\u3053\u308c\u304c\u307e\u305f\u3068\u3066\u3082\u826f\u3044\u66f2\u3070\u304b\u308a\u3002\n\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u3082\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u304a\u5024\u6bb5\u3082\u3068\u3066\u3082\u5b89\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u8208\u5473\u306e\u306a\u3044\u4eba\u3067\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3002\n\u3068\u306b\u304b\u304f\u3001\u3068\u3066\u3082\u697d\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1521388712, "timestamp_updated": 1521388712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40372752": {"recommendationid": "40372752", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962520519", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519519097}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "Fun little game.

After a few encounters with the locals, you get dragged into a quest to find the eight legendary cards for a chance to battle the Card King and win 1 million dollars.\n\nBut it\u2019s not really the destination that matter but all the people you meet along the way, and almost everyone you meet is a familiar face from a Ludosity and Remar game like you got a fishbun from Ittle Dew, or there\u2019s those handsome hunks from Space Hunks. I think there\u2019s even a few original characters here cause I might be wrong here but I think this is the first appearance of the Business Casual Man I\u2019ve been seeing in some of their games.\n\nAs for the characters themselves, they either the same character like all the Jenny\u2019s except one, they have some minor changes to them like a Titan actually being on the ground so you can have a calm conversation with him instead of screaming in fear or they never were given a personalty like the that volcano. I enjoy them and I like reading all their text with the only exception being Little Dude, the gender swapped version of Ittle Dew, and I don\u2019t why he bothers me. He\u2019s never a jerk to you or anyone else, maybe I just find him dull compare to Ittle, and I love the cute little adventurer.\n\nGameplay\n\nBefore we get to the card game, I have to say that the buttons to go places or the deck and options aren\u2019t that responsive and took some time for them to get pressed. Just an issue I had with the map.\n\nNow for the game. While it\u2019ll take some getting use to, the game is very simple once you get a hang of the rules. You and your opponent have a 3x3 grid to place cards on and to win you either, make sure you\u2019re opponent can\u2019t play anymore card, turtle up and outlast them or try to remove all your opponents health, which unless you make a deck that is specifically designed to remove for that plan is the least effective plan of attack.\n\nAs for the cards,you have to chain 3 symbols to make a combo and we have 4 types, attack for hitting you\u2019re opponent's HP or disable their cards, defense to increase your health, revive cards which not only revives a disabled card, but they always have two symbols so you can use them to remove cards from your board, and neutral who\u2019s just a spare connector if you need it. some card also have effects which can turn the tides of battle like rotating a powerful card so it can\u2019t connect a combo which can screw them over or remove all the cards of your board to stop from being blocked. And sometime you can activate two effects depending on how they activate like one revive card heals you for two while another revive lets you rotate one card of your choose.\n\nWhile the game is enjoyable, I can\u2019t say it was very challenge once I had a decent deck. I only had to drastically change my deck once and that was for the boss fight against the Fiery Woman who\u2019s an example of a full offensive deck. I guess this would be when people who finished the game would compete in mulitplayer matches but there is none. I don\u2019t care about much about multiplayer myself and the sequel is suppose to have multiplayer, but those two are very different from what I\u2019ve seen.\n\nPresentation\n\nLets get the soundtrack out of the way and say it\u2019s not that great bit nice to listen to when playing. Not much else to saw there.\n\nNow for the art. It\u2019s good. While it has the visual novel thing with you talking to still images but they show what kind of character thy are at first sight, like Exicatble Student just scream happiness, The Kid looks like she done with the card craze going on and the fox looks drunk to name a few examples. I am curious if that Bookworm is suppose to be Adowa from MURI , she looks a lot slimmer and has longer hair than her ingame pictures show in MURI.\n\nVerdict:\n\nWhile not the most challenging game, this is a pretty fun card game.

Aside from generally good gameplay mechanics, it takes place in a weird, zany world that is quite apart from the stale, drab poker games we are all used to. In the world of Card City Nights there are talking corporate turnips, magical foxes, and many other fantastical things. \n\nIt's a refreshing, innovative attempt to make a card game that is different from anything else you've played. \n\nIt is single player only but I found the AI to be a challenging opponent. \n\nAs far as the plot, when the game starts out you've just moved to the titular Card City. You quickly run into a large cast of colorful characters in a surreal world. The people of Card City are obsessed with (you guessed it!) a card game. There's a tournament and whoever can collect 8 legendary cards and defeat the Card King wins a big prize. So that is your goal for the game.\n\nAfter a brief tutorial you starting building up your deck and, in a mostly linear fashion, start challenging tougher opponents.\n\nThe card game itself takes place on two 3x3 grids. You and your opponent each have decks of between 20 and 40 cards. You start by drawing 5 cards, and then each turn you play 1 card and draw 1 card. You win if you can reduce your opponent's health to 0 or if your opponent is unable to play another card (his entire 3x3 grid is full). You both start out with 7 health and can go up to 10 health.\n\nThere's 4 basic types of cards you can play. Attack cards damage your opponent or disable his cards. Defense cards add to your health. Revive cards bring disabled cards back into play. Neutral cards do nothing by themselves but are useful to facilitate using other kinds of cards. \n\nEach card has from 0 to 8 arrows on it corresponding to the N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW directions. The goal is to play your cards on your grid in such a way that the arrows connect. This will trigger a combo based on what kinds of cards are part of the combo. The cards will then be removed from play. \n\nThe whole system is very easy to learn. But as you continue on your journey you run into all sorts of new cards that force you to change and adapt your strategies. When I first started the game I was using a balanced deck with a healthy mix of all the different card types. By the midgame I had an Attack deck that was focusing on dealing as much damage as possible as quickly as possible. By the end game I had a deck that dealt no damage at all but was focused purely on disabling the enemy's cards. \n\nYou gain more cards for your deck by challenging particular characters for booster packs. If you win a booster pack you get 5 cards at random from that type of booster. As you progress through the story you will also find a store where you can buy cards for coins (that you get by defeating opponents). You'll also find a chemist who can merge certain cards together to create new cards. \n\nThere's 180 cards in all and a huge variety in the sorts of decks you can build and play against. A few examples: \n\nThe Apathetic Frog card is useless as it literally does nothing. It has no arrows or effects.  But it can be used with the chemist to create cards that are actually useful. \n\nThe Princess Pitch DX is an Attack card that is highly useful. It is easy to trigger and when triggered it removes all cards in play. So basically you use it at the beginning of the game before you've played anything useful to get a cheap shot on your opponent. Or you can play it later in the game if you're losing and need some enemy cards wiped out immediately. \n\nI liked the various soundtracks in this game.\n\nI encountered only one minor bug; sometimes while on the world map I had to click multiple times on a destination to travel there. That's just a minor quibble though.\n\nI also wish there was some way to go back and see what the computer just did. There were a few times the computer played some new card that took me by surprise and I didn't have enough time to read the card text before some devastating combo was used against me. Yes, you can change the overall game speed but here I was really just looking for a one-time way of looking at what cards had just been played.\n\nAfter finishing the main game there are a number of optional boss fights to try out. \n\nOverall I quite enjoyed Card City Nights. It took me about 23 hours to beat it (including the optional fights). The game is inexpensive too!

Both players have their own 3x3 grid in which to play.  This grid also serves as an important resource; if you reach the point where you can't play a card (because your grid is full, or because your hand and deck are empty) you lose the round.  Interestingly, if you run out of cards in your deck you still have a couple of turns, as you start taking damage for every card under the hand limit you are, meaning that you can still make a last-ditch attempt to turn the tables.\nThe simplicity of the core mechanics belies quite a bit of strategic depth; Card Mill and Disruption are all just as viable as the basic Offense and Defense strategies, but the game will require you to have a way of doing at least some of everything.  It's possible to spend a lot of time optimizing combo potential with card utility and there are very few 'wrong' ways of building a deck.\n\nCard City Nights is apparently a massive cross-over game, featuring characters from the studio's other works; of these I'm only familiar with Iji, so most of the crossover appeal is lost on me.  Having said that, the result is a downright bizzare setting in which you'll find giant anthropomorphic vegitables, sentient moai in top hats, demons and the patron diety of explosions all living together in a single city; unfortunately you only get to explore 30-something screens of it, all illustrated but not animated.  There isn't really a story: you have a set of legendary cards you have to track down that serve as the means of stringing you from battle to battle.  All in all the plot and the setting both exist primarily to connect you to your AI opponents, and while i'd be lying if I said it wasn't charming it's not really a reason to go out and buy the game in and of itself (unless you're a diehard fan of Ludosity's library of titles); it certainly works in the game's favor more often than not, but I think they could have gone a bit further with it to make something really memorable here.  \n\n\nAt the asking price it's definitely worth picking up.", "timestamp_created": 1508125244, "timestamp_updated": 1508125244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35091551": {"recommendationid": "35091551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087032026", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505938643}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f)", "timestamp_created": 1505938942, "timestamp_updated": 1505938942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34939862": {"recommendationid": "34939862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042951349", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508739968}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a great take on the CCG format where instead of focusing on things like card draw and mana curves, you instead focus on placement and positioning.

The AI is passable, although I have to admit that I spent most battles executing my own strategy instead of having a back-and-forth against a computer.\n\nThe visuals, characters, and humor all range from 'okay' to 'lovely', with the whole plot thing being just unintrusive enough as not to annoy you between battles. The deck management system is nothing to write home about, but it does its job and is, once again, simple enough to work. [i]Card City Nights[/i] is also streamlined and slick enough to play nicely and without any unnecessary clicks.\n\nSo in the end it all boils down to whether you'll like the combat mechanics, which are... original. A mixture of CCG and match-3, it offers a 3x3 field and a deck of cards that can be connected via a number of points (sides and corners). Your goal is to create combinations of various card types to achieve great strategic results...\n\n...At least in theory. In practice most fights I've had ended with either me or the opponent not having valid moves (i.e. being unable to place any more cards) instead of killing each other. Perhaps it was the intended strategy\u2014after all, disabling cards and turning them from strategic resources into clunky fodder is a part of the game. But it also made the fights lengthy and monotonous, and just didn't feel fun to me. It felt like a game of attrition.\n\nAll in all, [i]Card City Nights[/i] has an inventive system that isn't balanced/utilized properly.

However, the system of connecting one card to another through the arrows on the periphery of the cards has some potential. Some things that might benefit the game include some deck-building statistics in the builder. Let me organize my collection by symbol: for instance, if I click a shield in the deck-builder, only show me cards that include that symbol (including two symbol cards). Additionally, let me organize by arrow: if I click on the left arrow or left upper arrow, only show me cards that feature this. This would greatly benefit players who want to dig into the system that you've created.\n\nThe main issue with the game, in my opinion, is the booster feature. Whenever you beat an opponent, you get a booster with random cards from one of the featured sets. Some of the opponents can be played repeatedly to earn extra boosters, but often these are \"best of 3\" matches and can take some time. But this is a single-player game, this isn't Magic the Gathering. Just give the player certain cards after they beat certain opponents - I don't think it's a wise move to build grinding into your game. Though perhaps certain players feel excited opening boosters, I never used boosters in the entirety of my time playing Magic the Gathering (many, many years). I always bought on secondary markets where I could pick the cards I needed. You can buy individual cards from some of the vendors in the game, but the majority of the cards are underwhelming and overpriced.\n\nThe \"best of 3\" matches take a while, because the majority of the time it seems like the best strategy is to either have your opponent run out of cards or have him be unable to place one on the board. Attacking the opponent would be faster, but this strategy seems less viable to me than the others I mentioned. Opponents begin dropping cards with two symbols quite early in the game, meaning that only two cards are needed to create a combo. Some of the cards that opponents drop are absurdly powerful, and if you don't have an answer immediately you'll be in trouble. One opponent dropped a card that removed one card from my deck every turn - another dropped a card that disabled a random card on the board every turn (this almost always seemed to target my cards). The cards I had access to just seemed uninteresting and underpowered in comparison.\n\nLastly, this game has a fantastic soundtrack.

But I had a coupon for 90% off, it looked nice, had mostly positive reviews and promised to be something different from the usual card game. So I purchased this game anyway. And I must say it's one of the better decisions I have ever made, as this game is quite fun to play.\n\nThe gameplay is somewhat different from any card game I have ever played before, with each player placing cards on a 3x3 board. Most cards have arrows indicating which directions they can be linked to other cards, and an icon which designates which effect the card will have (attack, defence, revive and coin). The aim is to reduce your opponents defence to zero while preventing them from doing the same to you by chaining cards with a total value of 3 or more icons. Although it's game over when one of the players has filled up their board and cannot place a card at the start of their turn.\n\nDifficulty starts out quite easy, with your opponents mostly killing themselves by filling up their boards before you even have a chance to finish them off properly. But after the first couple of locations are dealt with the AI quickly steps up its game. All the opponents seem to have different strategies, as well as different cards in their decks, so what was a winning strategy for one opponent may fail completely with the next. The game easily allows for different strategies to be employed by giving the user a total of six different card decks, so you could for example have one deck which is primarily an attack deck, another wich focuses on defense, another which quickly discards cards from an opponents deck (I forgot to mention, when a deck reaches zero the player takes 1 point of damage each turn, even if they have a shild activated. And dies when they have no cards left to play.) and another which... well, you get the idea. Although I could find no way to completely remove a deck once created.\n\nThe game is beautifully presented in all aspects. The cartoon graphics are first class, the music is pretty good and provides a nice ambiance, and the plot is mildly amusing if perhaps a little ridiculous.\n\nOne feature I would have really liked to see in this game, and I feel is a bit of a glaring omission is some kind of online two player mode. I'd really like to test my Card City Nights skills against human opponents, as beating the AI can be a bit too easy once you know what you're up against.\n\nOverall I'd give this game 8.8/10. While it was really quite fun to play there is little to make me want to come back to it after completing the game, 100%-ing the achivements and beaten every opponent at least once. That and a lack of any kind of two-player mode prevents this game from breaking the 9 point barrier.", "timestamp_created": 1485491580, "timestamp_updated": 1485526204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557169", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29486532": {"recommendationid": "29486532", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986230282", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503703986}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1485365413, "timestamp_updated": 1485365413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.401394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29411116": {"recommendationid": "29411116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186865498", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485046958}, "language": "english", "review": "I was REALLY enjoying this game up until I met the Rock Enthusiast, at which point the difficulty is ramped up considerably and the game is just impossible to finish.

You have an amount of life/shield (depending on difficulty settings), and you must either drop their life to 0, or managed to stuck their boards, as you must have to put 1 card from your hand to the board. But you can clear it, if you can link at least 3 card (or 2, if one of those have 2 icons) or something else lets you do that.\n\nThe game's musics are sooo catchy, calm, the awesome mix of hiphop and jazz.\n\nAlso: the game is full of cameos, easter eggs to the developers other games, so actually this a big crossover of Ludocity Games finest games.

And you\u2019ll mostly need to make different deck to counter or beat some tough opponents with a very specific deck.\n\nYou begin each standard match with 10 HP and a number of cards set as well as your opponent. (unless you set a special name, refer to (*) at the end) Each player has their own 3X3 playing field. Each turn the player need to place a card on their field. The aim is to set your opponent health to 0 HP. To do so you need to connect cards together to make a combo. To connect 2 cards you need them to point toward each other with their arrows: like a card on the left will point toward a card on the right with its right arrow and the right card will point toward the left card with its left arrow. To make a combo you need to connect cards together to have 3 or more symbols of the same kind. \n\nThere are 4 kinds of symbols: attack (red sword), defend (blue shield), revive (plus shape) and support. (yellow coin) And each card can have one or two symbols on it. The support reduces the number of symbols you need to connect. So if you place a 2-support-symbol card you only need to connect it with another symbol you wish. (attack, defend, revive or even support) If you connect 3 defend symbols you\u2019ll get 3 shield points. If you connect 3 attack symbols, you\u2019ll need to choose if you wish to attack your opponent or your opponent\u2019s cards. If you attack your opponent, you\u2019ll decrease his/hers shield or health points. But if you attack one of his/her cards, this card will be disabled and will stay in the field forever. Unless your opponent revives it by combining 3 or so revive symbols.\n\nSo you can win a match by:\n-\tattacking your opponent until he hasn\u2019t any health point left\n-\tdisabling cards of your opponent to make his/her field full so he lost by forfeit.\n-\tDrawing your opponent until he has no card left. He will take an increased damage every turn.\n\nWhen you defeat an opponent (a match can be done in 1, 2 or 3 sets) you earn gold and/or a specific booster pack. You can also earn gold coins by clicking in the scenery. Gold are the currency of the game: with it you can buy extra cards you already own or a skin for your field or fusion cards to make a new one.\n\nAnd two more main things. Each card has their own rarity and depending of it you can only have a limited number of the same card. You can have 3 same common cards, 2 same rare cards, 1 epic card of each kind and only one legendary for the whole deck.

I've played Magic the Gathering, Hearthstone, Dragonball Z, Pok\u00e9mon, Gundam Wing, and others over the years; with that said I highly recommend this game.  It has the perfect balance of simplicity and depth that very few games do successfully and an engaging story that doesn't take itself too seriously to go along with it.  You are a simple card game player hunting for the legendary cards and a grand prize and you meet plenty of people along the way.  It's one of those games that is perfect for playing a couple of games in here and there until you complete the story. \n\nI won't get too detailed on the game play because trying to explain it here probably wouldn't do it justice and I am sure you will get the idea from the screenshots / videos.  The game is about making groups of cards which activate abilities that can help you or hurt your enemies.  For example, you place cards on your board in groups to attack your enemy's life points or block their ability to play cards while they try to do the same.  \n\nThe only negative about this game is it has very little replay value.  Despite that, the game felt long enough where I was satisfied with the time I had invested when the ride was over.  This is a game I would recommend even at full price; if you have a few extra dollars in your steam wallet and don't know where to spend them, grab this one! \n", "timestamp_created": 1471133012, "timestamp_updated": 1471133012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561753", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24749531": {"recommendationid": "24749531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025689227", "num_games_owned": 580, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450126246}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438-\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 (\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u0445). \u0421\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e, \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u044f \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f, \u0438\u0431\u043e \u043a \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0443 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b \u0447\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0439 Ittle Dew. \u0412 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0432. \u041c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u041c\u0415\u0425\u0423\u0415\u0427\u0415\u041a, \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445. \u0413\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c, \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c. \u041d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0451\u043b \u043d\u0430 100%, \u0430 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430. \u0425\u043e\u0442\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0451 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435, \u0442\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435.\n\n(\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0436\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u0434\u0430\u0430\u0430)", "timestamp_created": 1470520259, "timestamp_updated": 1470553974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541670", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24510716": {"recommendationid": "24510716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146964188", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468520420}, "language": "english", "review": "I went into the game blind, frankly I didn't even really know what the game was about.

Upon that the art within the game is astonishing it really outside the box\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467231986, "timestamp_updated": 1467231986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23884309": {"recommendationid": "23884309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080420823", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461004803}, "language": "english", "review": "A refreshing take on card games where the placement of cards deals damage, revives other cards, or heals you.

SKIP DOWN TO THE BOTTOM FOR THE TLDR\nplaying threw this game i had plenty of good things to say. the art style is nice, its funny, and the card game itself is fairy balanced (if not having some useless cards but every game does). but all these positive things i had to say were over shadowed a bit by the final match. long story short your final match is against some one who is useing every legenday card and has multiples of rares. the ai seems to have every card needed to counter any strategy at each time. its made to be unfair and along with that it takes away the fun. yes you can probably beat them eventually but its an exercise in tedium where you will eventually get mad, put the game down and move on to something else or just fight older opponets. however the game is still fun to play just not fun to beat. however for a 5$ price tag you do get enough fun out of it to justify the purchase and its certainly more entertaining than most phone games of the same price.\n\n\nTLDR: good visuals fun and occasionally challengeing gameplay marred by a overly difficult final fight. you could do much worse for the price. \n\nfull price: you can easily get your moneys worth of this game just expect some frustration if you intent to beat it.\n\nsale: definaly! when this games on sale its like 2$ a must play for card game fans.", "timestamp_created":

You collect cards that have arrows on it and you line up the arrows to combo into different actions (attack/revive/defense). It sounds simple, but the game pulls it off really well and makes you consider if placing a certain card down into a certain position is the right thing to do. I'd say the level of difficulty really depends on the player, but I'd give it a medium difficulty. It's the uniqueness of this game that makes me recommend it, I can't think of any other TCG game currently that utilizes this style of gameplay. The storyline is average/straightforward, not particulary interesting but fun enough with humorous dialogue here and there. I wouldn't say this game is incredibly replayable - there aren't any \"random\" opponents to play that have really new strategies every single time, you'd be playing the same characters over and over again if you wanted to keep playing after defeating everyone. The AIs will stick to their playstyle - defensive, offensive, etc. I guess it really depends on if you *really* get sucked into the gameplay. For me, this is probably the only time I will be playing it through unless if new content was added. It was really compelling to finish the game and I found the experience thoroughly enjoyable; and here I am, writing a review days after buying the game and \"completing\" it - after completing it though, I just don't feel the urge to keep on playing and rebattling the revamped opponents (the game kicks up the difficulty a notch once you complete the storyline).\nIt took me around ~15 hours to achieve 100% but I'd say 2-3 of those hours I spent idle/afk, also, I could probably get another hour or two of new gameplay in if I went ahead and challenged the \"revamped\" characters.\n\n[b]Verdict?[/b] \nThis game is well worth the money regardless if it's on sale or not.

I only used my mouse and didn't try the other control methods, or was even aware there were any.  \n\nTrue to its name, Card City Nights is a collectible card game with a strong focus on combat.  As a new arrival to the island, you quickly learn about the game and how everyone is positively bonkers about it.  The plot is fairly basic--find the eight Legendary cards and face the Card King in combat for the million-coin prize.  The protagonist resists at first, but they have a free deck of cards and there are plenty of people to face, so why not?  \n\nThe tutorial gave a pretty easy overview of the rules.  You and your opponent each have a 3x3 board, a coin is flipped to determine who goes first, and you both draw five cards to form your hand.  Then it's a matter of linking your cards' arrows together in order to attack, defend, and recover.  You lose if your life hits zero, if you fill your board and can't place a card, or if you completely run out of cards to play.  Matches are played in best of 1/3/5 format, and there didn't seem to be a penalty for losing other than having to start that fight over from the beginning.  Several cards have a variety of effects, such as one reviving a random downed card and then disappearing off board, or moving to an open space every time you start your turn, or having an additional effect depending on what kind of combo it's a part of.  \n\nAnd like most other card games, most of the game takes place outside of battle where you try to put together a deck that can't be beat.  You have to build a deck of 25 to 40 cards, and you're allowed five dupes of common cards, three of uncommon, only one rare, and only one total Legendary per deck, so there's a lot of options.  My interest in the game kinda waned until I woke up and just made a deck from scratch, paying attention to arrows and effects I wanted.  Everyone in the game uses a different deck though they only stick to one, so you could honestly tailor a deck around destroying specifically everyone as you play.  In battle, you're at the mercy of RNG on your draws as well as what the opponent feels like using on you, but outside of perceived biases, the game felt fair about random targets.  Kinda hard to say that when victory is snatched from you with a convenient draw for your opponent, though.  \n\nI was kinda surprised at how much dialog there is.  You can talk with several people at each location and everyone has quite a few things to say, especially if you can fight them since they'll have different things then.  Of course this is entirely optional, but it's kinda neat.  Characters have things to say about other people, or you, or other things.  One NPC in the mall had what felt like 100 things to say, though thankfully that wasn't the norm.  That all of the characters come from prior Ludosity/Daniel Remar games might be a treat to some, seeing familiar faces in different roles (and on the cards), but this was my first so I'll be facing retroactive recognition whenever I go back for Ittle Dew and pick up some of the others.  \n\nAs for things I didn't like...I initially didn't like that you couldn't outright buy new cards.  When the shop unlocks early in the story, you're only able to buy extra copies of the non-Legendary cards you have already.  To get new cards, you have to fight certain NPCs for their boosters (or trade them in later on), so you're at the mercy of RNG for what cards you receive, but each booster NPC provides only one specific pack and each card is tied to a specific booster.  You can keep fighting them to eventually get the cards you want, but my only other complaint is that there's no card catalog to fill out.  It'd have been especially helpful to at least see what cards you have/have seen/haven't seen so as to know how to get that amazing card you saw your opponent use and to scratch that completionist's itch, but I guess the guides on Steam have you covered there if you want to do some cross-referencing.  \n\nOverall, I liked CCN and I think it's definitely worth the buck I gave for it.  If you're into card collecting or deck building or whatnot, you'd probably like it too.  Difficulty is kinda hard to pin down since each person has their own deck setup, so you can go from being stonewalled to being locked down to being blitzed to being drained of cards.  You'll probably have to lose your first fights with everyone so you can learn their decks and how to counter them, so that might turn some people off.  But as someone who seems to have interest in card games but rarely plays them, this was not a waste of time at all.", "timestamp_created": 1463196325, "timestamp_updated": 1463196325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22791314": {"recommendationid": "22791314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115504170", "num_games_owned": 1276, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489314700}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than Hearthstone", "timestamp_created": 1462356479, "timestamp_updated": 1462356479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22737771": {"recommendationid": "22737771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025505538", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428258342}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e, \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430\u0442\u044f\u043d\u0435\u0442. \u041f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0443\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439. \u0412 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c, \u044f \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c-\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443.\n\n\u041d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445-\u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0430 \u0432 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0451\u043b \u0432\u0441\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443.", "timestamp_created": 1462087577, "timestamp_updated": 1462087577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22665040": {"recommendationid": "22665040", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960768476", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437495487}, "language": "german", "review": "F\u00fcr alle Freunde von Sammelkarten-Spielen ein nettes kleines Spielchen in das man die eine oder andere Stunde investieren kann.

normal (only difficulty)\nComplexity: Ages 10+\n\nCard City Nights is an altered version of the 9-square mini-game from Final Fantasy VIII, except that in Card City Nights, it's the entire core of the game.  Childish humor fills the game, as the main character goes on a quest to collect all 8 legendary cards from a variety of card masters.  Defeating associates and assistants to the card masters in best of 3 or best of 5 collectible card matches,  you collect enough cards by winning battles until you have an almost unbeatable deck.  Cash dropped by these thugs give you money to buy more cards and more 9-square boards, until you have enough rare cards to absolutely mow these people down.  \n\nThe mechanics of this game design are well thought-out.  Excess cards can be recycled into card packs, preventing the player from collecting 10-20 of each common card in a never-ending quest to collect enough rares (cough Pokemon TCG for Nintendo's Gameboy cough.) In addition, there's a minor alchemy system to process cards that may not be affordable from the game's card store in the mall.  \n\nAll an all, a moderate-speed economy system gets this game going.  The delightful humor prevents the game from getting dull, and this is a must-play for card genre fanatics or older children. 5/5 stars.", "timestamp_created": 1459918728, "timestamp_updated": 1459996097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22211812": {"recommendationid": "22211812", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970339445", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458199317}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a small game, but fun for a while.

The game mechanics are fun but the problem with the game is in the card collection and deckbuilding.  My favorite part of trading card games is being able to put together fun and creative decks.

(For the record, I haven't played a card game since yugioh like 10 years ago, so my opinion about card games may not be that informed)\n\nLike other card games, you will need to gather cards(by beating enemies, buying from stores, combining unwanted cards, you can get a special card by beating each boss) and build your decks. To beat the enemy in a match, you either have to reduce his hp to 0, make the table full of cards so the enemy cannot place any more cards or make the enemy use up all his deck.\n\nBased on these different winning conditions, you can design your deck accordingly. For example, if you want to play aggressively, you can put many attack cards that can easily combo(the cards have directions, you need to connect cards of the same type(attack/heal/revive/neutral) to combo) in your deck. You can also pick many cards with disable/rotate effects. If the enemies do not have revive cards, they will get stuck with too many cards(either disabled or in wrong directions) on the table. Alternatively you can build a large deck with lots of healing cards and try to outlive the enemy. This works well when the enemy has a small deck(there are also cards that let you directly remove the enemy's cards).\n\nDifferent AI enemies will use different strategies. There is enough variety. In particular, bosses will have special cards that have powerful effects, like hp regen every round, attack card that can be reused indefinitely, shield that prevent any damage to the owner's hp(but you can disable or remove the card). The bosses are appropriately challenging(tho I don't feel that they are cheating). You will have to use the correct tactics to beat them.\n\nThe graphic of this game is ok(you can see screenshots on steam). The story is not very serious. The dialogues sometimes can be pretty silly but funny. Anyway I think the focus of this game is the gameplay. For someone like me who doesn't usually play card games, I have lots of fun playing this game. It even makes me want to try out other card games. For 2 bucks, I think it is really worth.

In the card game proper, each player has a 3x3 card grid, and seven Defense Points. The goal is either to fill up your opponent's grid with occupied space, or decrease their Defense Points to zero.\n\nCards have three main categories: ATTACK, which can disable opponent cards, or damage your opponent's Defense Points; DEFENSE, which can increase your own Defense Points; and REVIVE, which can bring your disabled cards back into play.\n\nThe challenge of the game is that cards must be played in combos. Each card has a specific set of arrows which tell you where on the grid it can be placed for maximum efficiency, and cards in a combo must point to each other in order to be played. While some cards have multiple arrows, others only have one (some trick cards have none). They can also have additional effects such as rotation, teleportation, or extra damage, making gameplay interesting, unpredictable, and especially fun.\n\nThe game works in an almost Rock-Paper-Scissors type of balance, where a specific strategy you use for your deck to counter that of your opponent's will expose you to another vulnerability. Having the freedom to make your own deck allows you to explore and create your own combos. Each NPC uses a consistent strategy, making training accessible, but not simple-minded, since the variability of play is kept intact by the limited number of cards you're allowed to use at once. This could actually be printed as a physical card game, and I would invest in it without hesitation.\n\nPersonally, this game meets all my standards for a perfect single player game: completely replayable, expansive but not overwhelming, customizable, encouraging of practice, and a smooth, approachable mood shown through the art style, music and NPCs (I once spent a quarter hour just reading the funny lines of the gossiper at the city mall).\n\nAn online multiplayer mode would send my love for this game over the top, like a rocket that shoots through the sky and explodes, scattering its awesome rocket parts over the world.

As someone who loved Yu-Gi-Oh! and dabbled in Magic The Gathering, I thought I'd give this a shot since it was only $2. When you start the game, you're thrown into a tutorial and it teaches you the unique way to battle. The way this game is different in how you battle is that not only do the cards matter, but where you place them matters even more. Each card has its own unique layout of arrows that you have to connect with other arrows on other cards, as well as matching the different card types (Attack, Defense, and Neutral). Using this, you go through the town and battle different unique and quirky people and work your way to the top.\n\nThe only thing I'm not that fond of in this game is there's really only one dominant strategy, and it's offense offense offense. I wish there were different ways to beat enemies, like milling or a defense-type thing.

Be it combat with an executive turnip person or duelings with a ghost or three, there are few digital card games that outright wants to have fun, in both execution and style. It never had me laughing out loud but the cartoonish surrealism and genuinely well crafted card play brought me back again and again. \n\nThe card play itself has more of a boardgame feel to it, with a 3x3 board both you and your opponent have free reign of placing down cards on. These opposing boards basically demand that you have preplanned combos in your deck, as the only person that really can determine if you're going to have the upper hand or not is you. While the decks are randomized, luck isn't really as much of a factor as it is a gameplan, which you'll probably have to change up often as you go into new battles with different variety of foes. \"Matching\" cards is done through connecting the arrows each card possesses. There are eight points of contact in all; the angles and the sides. The majority of cards you collect will only have two or three arrows each, where special silver, gold, or platinum cards can vary from all 8 to just 1. Having cards that line up with each other is crucial, and demands a certain kind of forethought that you will build over the course of the game. It's far more complex than it sounds, and a variety of special abilities and different ways you can win makes the game an utterly fascinating breakaway from the usual fare.\n\nIs there bull**** moves that even the computer abuses? Yes. Yes there are. Matches can go on forever, and when it follows a 2/3 game style, not knowing if your hardfought victory is going to happen twice is a horrible feeling, especially when what you fear comes true. While this does garuntee that even the easiest matches still demand some thought, the over all repetition can eat away at you near the end like it did me. I do love this game for what it is, but at the end the final couple fights feel downright unfair, and that's where the 2/3 deal often works at its worst. The experience as a whole was absolutely worth it, but who knows, you may grasp the rules better and stand a greater chance by the end of it.\n\nWhile I haven't checked out Little Dew yet, I'm probably going to have to make that as one of my next stops. For the insanely cheap asking price of two bucks, CCN is of such insane quality that anyone would be hard pressed not to pick this bad boy up.

In fact, I was hopeful I would like this simply for that fact alone. I've largely given up on most deck construction games (digital and print) simply because of that lack of self containment. Those few that I do still play are either LCGs that I stopped buying when there's enough cards to build a decent range of decks, or long out of print games that aren't ever going to get bigger than they already are. But I'd also like something electronic that I could play like that same vein. Card City Nights clearly isn't going to be that for me.\n\nThe biggest problem for me is that I just didn't care about the cards. Without that inspiration, I looked at the deck design screen and felt zero motivation to refine my deck and eke out those tiny optimisations that I like to obsess over in this genre of game. I think this comes down to the interdependency between all the cards. Almost all the cards are only conditionally useful. It just ends up feeling to my CCG-addled brain that this is a card game made up solely of suboptimal cards. From an objective mechanical standpoint, that's fine.

At some point in the game, you get into a situation where you need to grind for better cards by continuously re-battling opponents. If the card game felt super-awesomely fun, this would be perfectly acceptable, but it tends to feel more frustrating and anti-fun than I'd expect in a game. Some battles are best of three or even best of five, which is normal for how card games work, but just feels like kind of a repetitive slog. \n\nThis would be more fun as a mobile game (and it IS available on mobile platforms) where you're not sitting down and expecting a game to provide you with an evening of entertainment. As a desktop game, it's kind of lacking in the entertainment department when you look at all the other games you could be playing on PC that you can't play on a mobile device.\n\nI'm not a big fan of most turn-based games for the PC, though (but I prefer it for mobile games). Usually, it's because they lack the level of excitement that you get from time constraints and developing reflexes and hand-eye coordination. This game certainly doesn't go the extra mile to buck that trend and provide a sense of excitement and engagement.\n\nI like the art style, writing, and music. I just don't much care for sitting at my computer playing what feels like a mobile game.

Thank you.  Thank you!\nMy wife, my 14, 7, and 6 year old children and I have been playing Card City Nights for a couple of weeks now.  Your game was unreasonably low priced, so I picked up 5 copies.\nThe kids picked up on it really quickly and loved it.  I knew it was a special game when I saw the card and interface design not get in the way of the superb play mechanic.  Its simplicity 3x3 grid and card interaction leads to a surprising amount of strategy.  We're talking enjoyable strategy...you know...the feeling of KNOWING I should have put that other card in the deck or KNOWING that I should have played those 3 cards in a different order.  When I lost games against the AI, it made sense.  When I won, there was absolutely always a reason for it and a reward to follow - a new booster pack or some money (used to buy cards to round off your pool of cards).\nThere is quite a bit of quality humor in the game from dialogue with AI opponents to flavor card text.  I couldn't stop playing.  Do I have the best card(s) - not yet.  Do I have enough of that card or that type of booster - not yet.\nThe game doesn't get old or feel played out, much like MTG, but at a MUCH cheaper price point. Not as hard to learn and held our interest at least as well.  There are no microtransaction here.  None.\n\nMy family and I appreciate you and your efforts on this one Ludosity.

I was satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nThe aesthetics are nice - the artstyle is cute and charming. There is a large variety of cards to collect and use, each with its own unique picture and text flavor. The sounds and music are decent, however, I quickly muted the latter in favor of my own. You can buy different game boards to place your cards on during matches, and your opponents will often have their own boards that are distinct from the default one. The story is highly reminiscent of a hybrid between Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh - you must obtain 8 legendary cards to qualify for a hefty gold prize, playing against an assortment of different characters along the way. \n\nControls are super simple and consist of mouse clicks. There is a helpful tutorial in the beginning that will show you most of the things you need to know, however, I found that some aspects of the game have to be discovered through play. For example, many possible strategies will be more salient to you when you've encountered them in a match - like using mainly defence cards to outlast/fatigue your opponent. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with trading card games. You may have to do a bit of grinding at times to farm enough cards/money to build better decks. A big thing I didn't like about this game is how you cannot just scrap decks (you can have 6 built at a time) to start from scratch - you have to manually click and drag 25 cards from your \"deck list\" to your \"total cards list\" one-at-a-time. \n\nGameplay consists of placing a single card from your hand of 5 onto a gameboard every turn - the board can hold a maximum of 9 cards, and filling it will cause you to lose the following turn. You will also start to take increasing damage every turn if you run out of cards. Cards have a certain number of differently-oriented arrows along the border. You must chain combos by matching up arrows between cards. Each card has an icon on it (a shield, sword, circle, or healing cross). Once you have matched at least 3 icons together (usually meaning 3 cards; they cannot all be circle icons), you will trigger an action. Shields provide you with +1 health/defence per icon, swords do +1 damage per defence icon, circles are neutral icons, and healing crosses will reactivate cards. \n\nWhen you chain together an attack action, you can either attack your opponent's health, or one of his/her cards. Attacking a card (regardless of damage) will cause it to be deactivated, preventing it from being used to chain arrows. They will stay on the board, and accumulating too many disabled cards may result in you filling up your board with 9 cards, resulting a loss on your next turn. To revive cards, you must chain together healing icons. These cards are also useful because it will immediately remove all cards that are linked to it (possibly saving you from filling up your board with useless cards). Since cards with healing icons always have at least 2 icons, this means you can usually revive a card using only 2 cards (versus your usual 3 card set). Later, as you unlock more cards, you will encounter cards that may have 2 shield, sword, or circle icons. \n\nMany cards will have an extra effect - for example, \"placement\" effect cards will trigger something (deal 1 damage to your opponent, gain +1 HP, or lose 1 card from your deck) once they are placed on the board. Other cards may rotate 180 degrees or move horizontally every turn, allowing you to pull off creative strategies and synergies. An effect you will frequently see is attack/defence/revive combos, which are effects triggered when using certain actions with that card. For example, a card may have an attack combo that removes a target card - using that card in an attack action will allow you to remove any card that has been played. Note, however, that chaining this card with different icon types (ex: shield) and using it to perform a different action (ex: increasing your HP) will not trigger the attack combo effect. Rarer cards will have multiple effects, and many cards with significant effects (ex: deal an extra +1 damage) will have a trade-off to balance things (card starts off deactivated, or it deals 1 damage to the owner whenever it is disabled). \n\nMatches may be a best of 1, 3, or 5. At the end of every match, you will usually be given a booster pack with 5 cards of random rarity and/or some gold. You can sell cards at the mall for gold, and also purchase new ones. You may sometimes have to beat opponents before unlocking more difficult ones (including bosses that will give you a legendary card for beating them). \n\nOverall, the game plays fairly well and is a nice time-filler for anyone interested in the trading card genre. The arrow-connect style of play is also a nice change from your typical Magic TCG/Yu-Gi-Oh style of placing monsters/characters to down to fight each other. Matches are usually very quick - easily one of the quickest trading card game I've encountered. If you enjoy playing with cards, then you should definitely give this a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/djsfsroguereviews]@DJSF's Rogue Reviews[/url]\n\n[url=http://theroguereviews.com/]My Website[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1432282278, "timestamp_updated": 1432282325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532776", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15880590": {"recommendationid": "15880590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221206804", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430347359}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30a4\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u3001\u97f3\u697d\u3001\u3069\u3061\u3089\u306e\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u3082\u597d\u304d\u3002\n\u3067\u3082\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u305d\u306e\u3082\u306e\u304c\u9762\u767d\u3044\u306e\u304b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3068\u3001\n\u6b8b\u5ff5\u306a\u304c\u3089\u307c\u304f\u306b\u306f\u826f\u3055\u304c\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u305f\u3044\u3057\u305f\u99c6\u3051\u5f15\u304d\u3082\u306a\u3044\u3057\u2026\u2026\u3002\n\n\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4eba\u3068\u304b\u3001\n\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u4eba\u3060\u3068\u5225\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u65b9\u3082\u3042\u308b\u306e\u304b\u306a\uff1f\n\n\u307c\u304f\u306fSteam\u3092PC\u3068Mac\u306e\uff12\u53f0\u3067\u904a\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\n\u30dc\u30edMac\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u3066\u304f\u308c\u308b\u6570\u5c11\u306a\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001\n\u305d\u306e\u70b9\u3067\u306e\u307f\u91cd\u5b9d\u306f\u3057\u3066\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1431913871, "timestamp_updated": 1431913871, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15810412": {"recommendationid": "15810412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125826059", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431514161}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a cool little single player CCG (i.e., it's all campaign play vs AI). The gameplay is vaguely similar to the Triple Triad minigame from Final Fantasy VIII, but with more cards and depth. Although there aren't as many fiendish combos as you'd get in a top CCG like Magic, there's still scope here to build decks based on damage, milling, denial, etc. The only negative is that you start off slowly with some crappy cards, and it takes a while for deckbuilding to become a serious option.

Some opponents give you a booster pack upon winning, most give you money to buy single cards of.  Some areas you unlock let you recycle or combine cards for new cards.  Some areas make you battle in sequence without changing your deck, and some battles are best of 3 or 5.  Similar to Yu-Gi-Oh handhelds, but with a lot less blockading your progression than in those games and no grinding a fight 10-20 times to unlock a pack.\n\nGame mechanics are fairly simple and fluid, but you may find yourself a little disappointed if you are used to MTG or Yu-gi-oh.  There aren't too many special tricks the player can do without a bit of grinding, meaning most times you will have a fairly rounded generic deck against themed decks.  This means a lot of fights will go to deck-outs since you will be even against other mixed decks, unable to break your opponent's defensive decks, and you don't encounter a truly difficult aggressive deck until midway through the game.  Taking this, I somewhat luckily found a card-mix recipe early that produced a strong milling card (Business Casual Man).  I made two of them a and sailed through most of the game easily with a mixed-mill deck, only adjusting my deck for 3 fights to be more defensive.  Only the mid-point aggressive boss and last boss required multiple tries to beat.  \n\nI ended the main game with a 56 W / 9 L score, and only battled a few optional fight-for-booster opponents multiple times.  [b]I'm not new to card games and so making a strong deck wasn't too difficult, and I ended with just under 10 hours playtime.  Because of my milling strategy its hard to say how difficult some of these fights would have been and how that may have elongated the game.[/b]  There is optional postgame content against some difficult opponents, and you can complete a full collection if you are so inclined.\n\nThere is unfortunately no multiplayer, but I imagine the difficulty there lies in the problem of deck archetypes.  A strong burn / aggro deck is incredibly difficult to fight unless you have a defensive or disruptive deck, defensive-mill decks destroy any delay or mixed, etc.  It would come entirely down to archetype advantages determining who would win.\n\nAll in all, for $4 retail I'd say its not at all a bad game.  I got this game in a bundle, and I think its on iOS for $2.  If you see it at 50% off and want a casual game that's well-designed enough to appeal to gamers, then I'd say go for it.\n\n(Business Casual Man recipe :  [spoiler]Itan Carver + Jenny Bun[/spoiler])", "timestamp_created": 1429178821, "timestamp_updated": 1429178979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15388335": {"recommendationid": "15388335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005739651", "num_games_owned": 733, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429117446}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3068\u5bfe\u6226\u3057\u3066\u3001\u52dd\u3061\u9032\u3093\u3067\u3044\u304f\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002\n\u82f1\u8a9e\u3060\u3051\u3069\u3001\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u7c21\u5358\u3067\u308f\u304b\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3002\n\nBundle\u304b\u4f55\u304b\u306b\u5165\u3063\u3066\u3066\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308c\u305f\u3093\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3051\u3069\u3001\u9762\u767d\u304b\u3063\u305f", "timestamp_created": 1429117686, "timestamp_updated": 1429117686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15291849": {"recommendationid": "15291849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040583605", "num_games_owned": 798, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463586908}, "language": "english", "review": "Ey yao boys and girls, its CARD CARD CITY!!!!! nights.\n\nOther than card gods, there is no end game value.

First off, it serves a satire of other TCG shows and games. If you've played the Pokemon TCG game for the gameboy color, you will notice the parallels. Parallels which are twisted into a funny, lighthearted experience. At the same time it is a crossover of many of Ludosity's different titles. If you're like me, the only character is recognized was the protagonist of Ittle Dew, a game I still haven't played (for now).  The game developers did not let this stop them from making the experience enjoyable, and made the rather smart decision of making said characters alternate versions that reflect the original form's personality and behavior but belong exclusively to that world. The visual designs have also been updated to maximize the effect. And as a result, the cards you collect become more enjoyable, as you draw the parallels between the characters of Card City Nights and the characters of the original games. And speaking of cards, the actual game is a nice, casual experience. The developers were able to take a rather simple concept for a card game, and still make it enjoyable. The music is wonderful as well. It is a light treat for the ears that doesn't provide any distractions that might ruin your cool strategies. My one complaint is that the game is only single player, but the games build up as a casual adventure doesn't really allow for that. I would recommend this game if you love TCGs and/or are looking for a casual experience. I also recommend you experience with different decks and go for all of the achievements.

The gameplay is a 3-3 grid per player where you place cards with arrows any try to connect them for combo effects. There are 4 different types of cards Attack (damage/disable), Defense (heal), Revive (recover disable) and Neutral (any). Comboing cards and using special effects makes the game a blast.

The AI is terrible in the beginning, letting you experiment with different strategies.

I've been an avid player of CCGs for a number of years and I've seen some great ones and some terrible ones, both in physical and in digital formats.  This is one of the better ones.  I wouldn't say it's a great CCG, but it's definitely not the worst, nor is it even close to being so.  It's quite good.\n\nThe game's mechanic of connecting points at the sides and corners of the cards took me a little getting used to as it's different to what I'm used to as far as making attacks, but once I figured out how to effectively build a deck, it's fun.\n\nSpeaking of deck building, one awesome feature of this game is that it's a one-time purchase.  You buy it and you get access to all of the cards in the game via gameplay (either by winning them, getting them in booster packs, or buying them with in-game currency).  None of that \"buy the game for $20 and then pay $1 for boosters\" crap.  This game knows that's bullshit and it deosn't play that way.  It loves you and understands that your money is valuable to you.\n\nThe artwork is a little \"meh\", but it's whimsical at teh same time.  I've never played the game that it's based on, Ittle Dew, but maybe that's part of the charm that I don't get because of that.  The humor in the game is clean and chuckleworthy.  The game has in-game strategy help via talking to the characters in the game.  Unfortunately, the in-game characters are the only ones that you'll meet as there is no multiplayer support.  My only real complaint here is this, but, it's a BIG one.  This game is fun but after you beat it (which takes all of about 8-12 hours, from what I hear).  My only other complaint is that there's no cloud saves.  If this could happen, I might buy the mobile version to play on the go.  Fix both these issues, and you've got a classic...\n\nFrom what I've played so far, this game is quickly becoming a new favorite of mine.

While a direct and offensive tactic can be used to beat most opponents, each uses different strategies that can seriously complicate such an approach, making it optimal to research tactics and learn more about the individual card synergies.\n\nThere is no penalty for losing and always a reward for winning, so it's very much so a gentle game for those who may be unfamiliar with battling card games in general, making it playable and appealing for new or veteran players alike.\n\nThe music is enjoyable and adds flavour to the already living world, and the artwork is unforgettable and appealing, in that \"trying hard to look like it isn't trying hard\" way. The palette choices and composition are aesthetically pleasing and give the world a setting all its own, despite borrowing elements from many other games that the developers have made.

At first it was a bit awkward to get used to this spacial placement of cards in a grid and connections between them. Especially when trying to figure out which cards with how many connections and what directions do you need while building a deck. Btw, don't make too many decks as you will have 25 cards wasted per deck, if you don't really want some of them anymore. No way to delete a deck and get back those 25 cards. I needed just one to complete the game and it stayed 70% unaltered for second half of the game. Either i'm so good at deck building or i was lucky to strike the attack/defence/trick balance early. Only in the end i faced an intended roadblock and was forced to switch to a secondary all attack deck and then wiped that last foe easily. You might need a second deck to complete some achievements. I wasn't so lucky (if possible at all) to receive a card with 8 connections, so doing 9 cards combo and 10 attack combo would be easy. But i had fun completing them with just a 5 connections card.

I'll try to keep this short, and to the point, first of all because I don't want to waste your time, but mostly because it is currently 6 AM, and I've been up all night finishing this game. Anyway, to get started:\n\nMUSIC: Let me tell you, this soundtrack is great. It's catchy, and I find the tunes stuck in my head after I close the game.\n\nGRAPHICS: Unique, cartoony, and easy on the eyes. The artwork on the cards is great, too, of course.\n\nSTORY: Although others are saying that the story is forgettable, I'd have to disagree. Although not the best around, it's compelling, and is easy to get into. Essentially, you're the new guy/girl/vegetable in town, and as you explore the city, you meet zany characters, get yourself a rival, and play tons of cardgames. Your goal is essentially to defeat the 8 people who each have a legendary card. If you win, you get the cards, and if you collect all 8 of them, then you are allowed to fight against the Card King, the greatest card player in the city, and claim one million coins. There is also a little more content to explore after defeating the King, like fighting the former legendary card holders looking for a rematch, or facing off the Card Gods, who are four great card players, who use illegal cards.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The battling system is very unique, and lots of fun. To simply sum it up, each card has a different symbol (attack, shield, healing, neutral) which do different things. Attack does damage, shield heals your health (a maximum of 10, by the way), Healing can revive a knocked-out card (which get knocks out by taking damage), and neutral mixes with anything. The catch, however, is that each card has arrows, which you must use to connect the various cards to group together a total of 3 symbols. If one symbol is more dominant of the others, then your combo will go to that automatically, but if there is a tie, you get to choose what symbol you want to activate (Ex. Your card combo has 2 attack and 1 shield, then you will have to do damage to your opponent; Ex. Your card combo has 1 attack, 1 shield, and 1 neutral, then you get to choose to either attack for 1 damage, or heal yourself for 1).\n\nOthers:\n+You get to play as a carrot, with a fedora. 10/10\n+Ludicrously low price. 11 hours of fun, for 4 bucks? That's what I call value.\n-One of the worst final bossfights ever. It's tough as hell, and not very rewarding, but the content that becomes available afterwards (the cards gods, and rematches) is a pretty good reason not to give up.\n\nOverall, this game is really great. Really a hidden gem. To be repetetive, I was really pleasantly surprised at this. Anyway, that's just my 2 cents.

(I got this game as part of the Humble Card Game Bundle and the compressed archive includes printable versions of the game.)", "timestamp_created": 1423671655, "timestamp_updated": 1423671655,

I've never played the developers other games such as The Little Dew.\nBut from what I can tell it isn't necessary to have experience in that lore.\nHumour such as; early on you'll be dualing with cards titled 'Stick' which is a weapon that's just a stick.\n\nThere is a decent variety of decks, as you progress.\nWith the early decks being comprised of 'sticks' and 'old men.'\nSome other decks are futuristic decks, monster decks, and a few others I can't recall off the top of my head.\n\nWell enough of my blabbering on.\nIf you ever get an itch for a Singleplayer CCG, give this game a whirl, it should suck you in nicely.", "timestamp_created": 1422928703, "timestamp_updated": 1422928703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14295618": {"recommendationid": "14295618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012008940", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462653698}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game in a humble bundle and played through this game offline, 9 hours total.

Buying other starter/theme decks would mitigate this issue and possibly the gold issue.", "timestamp_created": 1422883335, "timestamp_updated": 1422883335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14285103": {"recommendationid": "14285103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026424637", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422818819}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun for a couple of hours - but no challange for experienced strategy players.

Your options for deck-building improve as you play, since each time you defeat a foe, you're rewarded with cards that are then added to your library. The characters you meet are quirky, offbeat, and humorous, and I appreciated how many times you could talk to them without their flavor-text dialogue repeating. Replayability is high: new opponents emerge and existing opponents improve after you finish the story; you can continue to earn cards and fine-tune your decks; and the story was always secondary anyway.

Unheard of in this day and age! I enjoyed this game from beginning to end. The unique artwork and character dialog fits the tone of the entire game. There are a lot of unique characters with crazy and varied personalities. The way they battle during matches also happens to be in sync with their character. Each fight is more like a puzzle piece and the same strategy can't be used for every battle in the game. For those who are looking for true randomness in each battle in reference to the opponent's card might have to look elsewhere. The story is your typical I need to win the card battle tournament at the end but how it's presented is what makes this title unique. Of course there are the usual twists and turns during the whole event. The music is also amazing and is a mix of both melodious and upbeat jazz styled tunes.\n\nDo yourself a favor and purchase the soundtrack.

The goal is to defeat the opponent by either draining their defense to 0 through attacks or forced card draws (the opponent looses defense when they are out of cards and are given random cards) or forcing the opponent to fill their 9x9 card board with cards, leaving them with no way to complete combos. Card combos are made by linking three symbols from cards  in a almost tic-tac-toe fashion, where each card has an arrow pointing to where it can be connected. Combos include attack to damage defense or disable enemy cards, defense to restore your defense, revive to enable disabled cards and neutral to act as filler for other combos. Some cards have different effects, such as multiple symbols so it only needs a second card instead of a third, or rotating player or enemy cards.\n\nIt's a cute little card game that's quite casual, and most importantly, inexpensive at full retail.  I found the character design and interactions to be rather charming and definitely a more laid back exprience than Magic or Hearthstone.

If you choose to, you can find that every person you come across has several (sometimes more than a dozen) different things they will say to you. And what they say will change depending on whether or not you have defeated them yet.\n\nThe actual gameplay is quite balanced. As you get stronger, so does the opponents. And there are many different strategies you must use. Going all out offense will work sometimes, but some characters are built to counter with good defense and the ability to disable your best cards at just the right times. You must choose your deck wisely depending on your opponent. This depth is part of what makes this game so fun.\n\nThe art style may turn some people off but I think it's very endearing and original. I don't know any of the indie games that this takes it's characters from but it's cartoonish and quirky and simple and it fits the overall mood of the game.\n\nThe best part of the whole game however must be the music. Everything from the menu screen, to the various places you visit, to the battles have music that is perfect for the situation. It's soothing and it's energizing at the same time. This, along with the humor of the game, and the visual styling make this a game you will never want to put down.\n\nAlthough I have not beaten it yet, I know from reading around that the game has more things to accomplish even after you defeat the 'final boss'.

I talk about a lot of irrelevant shit.\n\nThis is a game I was interested in for a while. After looking at the description it reminded me of not only one of my favorite games as a kid, but one of my favorite games of all time, Pokemon Trading Card Game for the Gameboy Color. IMO PKMN TCG was better than 80% of all of the Pokemon games ever made. It had a really fun battle mechanic, fun characters, fun sidequests that you would expect to be in a JRPG (i.e. doing certain things or trading to get rare cards), it was actually challenging unlike the standard Pokemon games (hurrdurr rock beats paper, idiot) and it had a lot of depth for both a seemingly simplistic Gameboy game AND as a Pokemon game.\n\nFirst Impression: I could tell from the previews that this game had a fun and cartoony art style and characters, so I knew not to expect hyper realistic GRAFIX going in, and I didn't mind, the cartoony art style and the weird characters not only compliment each other, but the setting was appropriate for a \"TCRPG\" (Trading Card Role Playing Game). The setting wasn't overly dramatic and it wasn't some shit eating \"deep\" social commentary that hipster indie devs like to throw into their games for no reason.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough, point and click adventure-y stuff with trading card battles (which are also point and click). I played this on a Microsoft Surface Pro so it was pretty easy to play. If you're using a desktop and mouse, it might be slightly more annoying due to having to move the mouse all over and having to plant yourself in front of your computer. If you have a laptop that doesn't have a touch screen or you don't have a traditional mouse to use with it I'd really recommend looking into buying the Android port of this game, this is a game that really plays best with a touch screen and it's also more relaxing to play in bed or in your spare time as things can get dull just sitting in front of a computer since this game doesn't feature much variation in how it plays.\n\nThe game was easy enough to control, but let's talk about the core of the game, the TCG. At first the TCG was kind of confusing, you place cards on a grid and they have to connect with arrows and all this shit. I pretty much won my first couple of games by luck because I really didn't understand the strategies well enough to do anything coherent. However, by the time you're ready to fight your first \"boss\" you should be able to have a general understanding of the main deck strategies and card types. The game does a pretty decent job of teaching you how to play and adapt to increasing opponent difficulty.\n\nNow to pick out the criticisms I had about the game. This section should be a little less macular degenerating. I'm just going to pick out some things that I personally disliked about the game, you might agree or disagree, I don't really care. Just remember that I have somewhat overly high standards.\n\n- Cards scale in strength and effectiveness.\nThis isn't something that I personally think makes the game bad, but when it comes to TCGs, I really dislike this. Basically, you start off with both you and your opponents using a bunch of weak, stupid cards that can barely pull off any kind of high damage or chain combo. However, the more you progress into the game, the stronger the cards get. What this means is that as the game goes on, cards that you used before can go from being the bread and butter of your deck to being completely outclassed and obsolete. Now, going back to Pokemon, imagine that when you go to fight your first gym leader you have a team of 3 weak pokemon. Now, at the time, they might be able to beat the first boss, but if you were to go directly to the next gym leader without any kind of interim training, you would get completely rekt. Now, imagine instead of training your pokemon to get stronger, you just catch a bunch of stronger pokemon and just throw your old pokemon into the trash. Theoretically this is a viable strategy, but it takes away most of the fun of pokemon games, being able to train your pokemon from being a bunch of bowl-cut, glasses-wearing noobs into a team of Hulk Hogan American heroes. Back to CCN, as the game goes on both you and your opponents keep getting newer and stronger cards. The strategies you use might stay the same and similar enemy deck types might stay the same, but now your cards are just slightly stronger. Now, for something like Final Fantasy this is an acceptable formula, but the thing that makes TCGs fun is the degree of strategic complexity. Would you rather keep playing against new enemies with unique decks and strategies or would you rather just keep fighting the same guys over and over but each one being slightly stronger than the last? The \"Card Gods\" at the end of the game have some of the most clever and difficult strategies out of anyone in the entire game, but there's only 4 of them and that's after you wade through the huge river of regurgitated goons that serve as checkpoints throughout the game. IMO, a good TCG should have as many \"viable\" cards as possible. If we're talking about something on as large of a scale as YuGiOh then of course there are going to be old cards that can't even hold a candle to some of the newer, crazier cards, but CCN is a game that can be beat in <10 hours and probably has less than 200 cards. If they spent more time creating efficient cards instead of just making tiers of cards then I think the game could have been a lot more complex and fun.\n\n- The TCG system is too basic.\nI honestly think that you can beat the entire game using the starter deck and maybe a couple of early cards. I know I just spent like 2 years talking about cards becoming obsolete and useless, but the thing is that the actual base TCG features overly simple mechanics combined with simple enemy AI. There are 3 main strategies; pure damage (attacking an enemy directly), preventing them from placing cards (blocking up their board) and making them run out of cards. It might be harder to do with weak cards, but once you devise a strategy based on one of the above methods of winning then it's possible to just go through the enire game with the same cards and either rushing the enemy's HP or blocking up their board. I mean, this obviously wasn't designed to be a game with some huge, competitive meta game, but with the number of opponents you have to fight and the fact that you can beat them using the same strategy (there might be like 3 or 4 enemies that require a different approach), the game can feel pretty repetitive.\n\n-The game doesn't have a lot of content\nIt's a short game, <10 hours, but the biggest problem is that the game is too formulaic. There's 8 bosses, each occupying a certain area and following the formula of wiping out their goons and then eventually fighting them. It was fun the first and even the 2nd time, but by the 4th (not to mention the 8th) time it got old really fast. The only thing that drives you forward is seeing both the new cards and new characters (and wanting to beat the game, obviously). I really loved the characters though, despite this being my first game from this dev and CCN featuring a lot of cameos of their other game characters. The only thing that even comes close to variation is the little hidden coins mini-game. Each area has coins hidden in the scenery which I thought was fun.\n\nOverall thoughts: In the end, I enjoyed the game a lot. I liked the characters, the setting, the gameplay (for the most part) and the \"style.\" It was just enjoyable overall. I bought the game for $2 (regular price is like $4) and i think for that price it's a pretty good game, but with the lack of content and how easy most of the game is I'd say to go for the Android version (which is $2 and controls better with a touch screen). It's a good TCRPG, but not very complex, might be fun for kids or any fan of TCGs such as myself.", "timestamp_created": 1407660663, "timestamp_updated": 1407661785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11581689": {"recommendationid": "11581689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138201014", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430884015}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Card City Nights es una parodia de todos los juegos de cartas ya que las cartas de este juego son muy random y muy extra\u00f1as, el modo de juego es muy facil solo tienes que hacer que las flechas conecten entre ellas y se activen ya sea atacando a una carta del oponente o a sus puntos de vida, o defendiendo curando tus puntos de vida, tambien curando una carta que te hayan atacado. hay varias formas y estrategias para ganar la principal rreduciendo los puntos de vida del oponente a 0, la otra es quedarte sin espacio para colocar cartas en el tablero y la ultima es quedarte sin cartas en el mazo y los puntos de vida se te iran reduciendo.

There are various ways you can get cards in the game which from trying them all are relatively pain free. You can grind battle and win packs,buy cards from the mall,take your unwanted cards and trade them in for a random deck, and even take two cards and turn them into a different one. Combining cards is not random they have specific combinations they can have. \n\nThe battle is pretty simple, you have best out 1,3, and 5 as far as victory conditions. Each player has  7 life points and each card can do anywhere from 1-4 attack points depending on if they have a bonus.Default max for attack,revive,defend is 2.\n\nFrom my playing the  Boss A.I. seem to be sorta cheaters but I am not fully sure.Each boss I card battled against more often then the regular fights could counter at least 80% of my strategies.This becomes far more shown when you are 1-3 attacks away from winning.

It may appear simple at first, but there is surprising depth.\n- You get to open tons of booster packs and form a huge card collection. How sweet is that! Also, there's no in-game purchases or anything like that. My hat is off to you, Ludosity, for having some moral fiber, especially within a genre of game that seems to feature some of the most rampant abuse of \"pay-to-win.\"\n- Super lighthearted and dumb characters, cards, and locations. The aesthetic quality of the art is great!\n- Really nice music. I'm a musician and producer, and I really enjoyed the tunes. Game music is often tired and boring, but not here.\n-Crafting and recycling system which allows you to get rid of excess cards that you don't want, and discover new cards!\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat short game. I've played a total of 7 hours, and done all the fights and achievements. To be fair, I went through very quickly, playing a very fast \"RDW\" style burn-to-the-face deck. I'm fairly experienced with CCGs, so I was able to be pretty efficient. Also, this was before the balance patch, so that particular style of play is a bit harder now.\n- General card and deck management is kind of annoying. It can be a bit of a pain to constantly have to scroll through your collection, especially once you open a few hundred boosters. Additionally, when you're buying and selling cards, it's difficult to know how many of each you actually own, because cards that are currently in decks can't be sold.\n- Rehab expenses are pretty high if you want to stop playing Card City Nights for good.\n", "timestamp_created": 1401925712, "timestamp_updated": 1401925712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10338536": {"recommendationid": "10338536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049619936", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406746807}, "language": "english", "review": "Best 0.99 $ I've ever spent.\n\nPros:\n+Cool relaxing soundtrack.\n+Great for casual time.\n+Easy AI, only a few opponent will kick your butt.

I don\u2019t like TCGs IRL but I do tend to like them on a PC, and I really enjoyed this game. So if this is in your wheelhouse, buy this game immediately! \n\nThis is a great fun game, what indie games are all about. The graphics are average, there is no voice work, the music is repetitive (though not terrible for an indie like this), the conversation is in the cheesy tongue-in-cheek variety but none of that matters, nor detracts from the fun. I understand this is also an Android tablet game, and it does have that feel, but not in any kind of bad way. Just that it feels like I could easily play it on one of my tabs and get the same enjoyment.\n\nThe card system is very simple but well thought out and complete. With 187 or so cards well designed around specific ideas, there is room to make several kinds of successful decks. The balance (as of 5/22) is pretty good. I found a deck attacking the opponent\u2019s number of cards was the most challenging to make work right and an attack deck the easiest, so the balance does tip a bit to the attack and defense based cards.\n\nI have 10 hours in, I got to 100% completion and I enjoyed every minute. My 10 hours would probably be around 20 if you grind. However, I don\u2019t like to grind and the devs give you an easy way to avoid that without throwing the game off with cheats. Your card library is in a text file that you can edit to add more copies of cards you already earned (and add new cards as well, if you are so inclined). So you don\u2019t need to go through hours of battling to gain booster packs or gold, and just do the duels you want while using in-game tools (card recycler, card mixer) to expand the kinds of cards you have quicker. I really appreciated this!\n\nEven at my 10 hours and at the non-sale price, I would say you get great fun for your buck. The only thing I would like to see in a sequel is multiplayer. Other than that, more cards for more deck ideas and the ability to import/use our deck and library.

If you're curious about the mechanics, I suggest having a look at people playing on YouTube. It's very simple to learn how to play. Slightly less simple is the deck building, which will require a little trial and error if, like me, you're not accustomed to games that require building your own decks. And once you get in the swing of things, the card game is legitimately fun.\n\nEverything else around said card game is just window dressing, but at least it's nice window dressing. The characters make fun of various archetypes, both in real life and in fiction, and have lovely hand-drawn avatars to match.

Mais aussi ce genre de jeu qu'on ne devine pas si addictif, si prenant au premier abord. M\u00e9lange entre un jeu de cartes \u00e0 collectionner et jeu d'aventure, vous d\u00e9cidez un jour d'aller r\u00e9colter le Gros Prix mis en jeu par le cr\u00e9ateur d'un jeu de carte populaire, et d'aller dueller toute la ville ; mais surtout affronter les 8 champions possesseurs des 8 cartes l\u00e9gendaires afin de pouvoir affronter le g\u00e9rant de toute cette affaire. On r\u00e9colte des boosters de cartes \u00e0 chaque combat et on peut ainsi cr\u00e9er jusqu'\u00e0 6 decks suivant les strat\u00e9gies que l'on souhaite adopter. On y reviendra sur les strat\u00e9gies possibles, sachez toutefois que la cr\u00e9ation de decks poss\u00e8de les restrictions suivantes : de 25 \u00e0 40 cartes seulement - les decks l\u00e9gers permettant de forcer la chance en tombant sur les combos de cartes d\u00e9sir\u00e9s, les plus gros permettant d'\u00e9viter de tomber en rade et de subir alors des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s de d\u00e9g\u00e2ts \u00e0 chaque tour ; mais aussi la possibilit\u00e9 de ne prendre qu'un exemplaire de carte rare, 3 non-communes, 5 communes et, pour finir, 1 carte l\u00e9gendaire par deck.\n\nAinsi outre les classiques bases de points de vie de chaque joueur - que l'on peut remonter avec des combinaisons d\u00e9fensives, et la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9duire ceux de l'adversaire \u00e0 0 pour l'emporter, il faudra r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 l'agencement des cartes sur un terrain de 3 par 3 cases - avec des cartes poss\u00e8dant chacune des fl\u00e8ches parmi les 8 axes de connexions possibles. 3 cartes connect\u00e9es et vous g\u00e9n\u00e9rez un combo offensif ou d\u00e9fensif en fonction des attributs (d\u00e9fense, attaque, neutre, r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9ration) d'une carte. Il existe environ 180 cartes avec des atouts variables : peu d'axes fl\u00e9ch\u00e9s ou une myriade, des effets puissants au placement, \u00e0 chaque tour ou si d\u00e9sactiv\u00e9e - les effets pouvant \u00eatre la d\u00e9sactivation d'une carte, sa rotation ou sa suppression ainsi que des bonus de points de vie ou d'attaque).\n\nSi la m\u00e9canique est donc tr\u00e8s simple \u00e0 assimiler (le tutoriel de 5 min suffit amplement), les strat\u00e9gies multiples en font un jeu fun et passionnant. On peut ainsi se concentrer sur l'utilisation des combos d'attaques ou d'effets secondaires de cartes pour d\u00e9sactiver celles ennemies et ainsi pourrir son tableau - et donc forcer sa perte, un tableau plein sans connexions de 3 cartes mini apportant une d\u00e9faite imm\u00e9diate, un jeu d\u00e9fensif au possible jusqu'\u00e0 l'usure de l'adversaire qui aura alors tir\u00e9 toutes ses cartes, ou d'autres combinaisons multiples et malines. Chaque citadin que vous affronterez - au passage le style artistique cartoon et \u00e9trange donne \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de cachet au jeu - adoptera une tactique bien pr\u00e9cise, et si l'on perd on cherche alors \u00e0 adopter une contre-strat\u00e9gie en cr\u00e9ant un deck aux petits oignons. D'autant plus que des cartes sont aussi obtenables en recyclant les doublons ou en les fusionnant dans un lieu d\u00e9blocable pendant l'aventure, voire d'acheter des doublons de celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9es en passant chez le marchand.\n\nCard City Night se d\u00e9roule dans une ambiance jazzy pos\u00e9e et fun avec un univers graphique \u00e0 la personnalit\u00e9 \u00e9trange et chaleureuse comme tout, se d\u00e9roule toujours la nuit mais surtout, engouffrera les v\u00f4tres jusqu'\u00e0 compl\u00e9tion du jeu (100% obtenable en 15-20 heures sans trop forcer).

Finished the entire story (which includes post-game events) in roughly 15 hours. Story follows the courageous attempt of \"SpacePirate\", aiming to be the best card player in the city. Comparable to Pokemon games, in a way. Rather than collecting gym leader badges to reach the elite four, you're collecting legendary cards to battle the Card King.\n\nGame is fairly straight forward, though not as casual as it may seem. You travel from location to location in seek of information for legendary cards. Each victory earns you gold and a booster pack which may contain a common, special or rare card. There's a variety of different booster packs, which further adds to the gameplay and replay value if you intend on building your deck around a specific type or card. Legendary cards pack unique abilities, further adding to the variety of options available. You can also buy or merge cards to create your ideal deck - Whether that be an all out offensive deck (which is what I used), defensive, deck burner, healer, focused on a combination deck, or various other combinations. Storage space of 6 decks, with minimum 25 and maximum 40 cards.\n\nGameplay is also fairly straight forward, though the battle phase is not like your average trading card game where each card has an attack and defence point, but rather connecting card arrows to form an attack, defence, heal, and so on. Victory is earned by either depleting the opponent defence points, burning their deck, or forcing them into filling up their playing board by stunning cards or hoping they can't match anything. Very formidable opponents late game, including some challenges early on when trying to understand the type of deck you want to build and the cards to include in this construction.\n\nVisuals are both charming and delightful. Several cards and characters, from my understanding, are characters from the Ludocity franchises - Including Ittle Dew. No complication in terms of settings and adjustment. The game in general is very accessible and user-friendly.

At the same time, it has good drawings for each of the cards, most of which are characters from Ludosity's earlier works. For a price of $3.99, it is a must buy. Great replayability, as you constantly want to improve your end-game stats. It does not have any in-app purchases, which means you are not troubled by any future payments for additional content in the game. However, it lacks constant game updates, which means that the game content stays stagnant for a significant amount of time. Also, it is a single player game, this makes it impossible to challenge human players who have newer decks, further incresing our gaming experience. So we can only play with A.I. opponents.

Rather than going for a complicated ruleset, the base rules are straightforward, but there's just enough variety in the cards available to allow for a number of strategic options in deckbuilding, and the excellent soundtrack helps the game's upbeat feeling. The difficulty curve is just about perfect if you hate getting \"stuck\" in games, as well... only in one or two places did I ever feel I wasn't quite \"getting it.\"\n\nThere's also some fanservice here, as the characters/cards are mostly from the company's other games, but it's unobtrusive enough that those unfamiliar won't find it distracting. (Of course, if you're me, you will squeal in astonished joy the first time you see an Iji or General Kor card.) Those seeking a great story should look elsewhere; although the characters feel well fleshed out and the writing is clever, more emphasis is put on gameplay than worldbuilding or plot, which I feel serves the game well. The card game mechanics form a solid core, and nearly everything present here is in service of that.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is a definite recommendation from me. It won't change your life, it won't suck away weeks of your time, and it won't provide anything truly revolutionary that you'll measure other games up against for years to come... but what it will do is provide a solid, fun experience for relatively little money.

It seems inspired by a bunch of card/collection-focused games, from Triple Triad (some gameplay mechanics) to Pokemon (mainly story progression and characters), and it all works pretty well together. The presentation/art is pretty good too, simple but very likable, although it does have some tablety crap going on here and there in the UI, like possibly the worst scrollbars I have ever seen in my life.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward, matching arrows on the sides of cards to chain them together and make combos to attack/defend/cause other effects. The basics were very easy to pick up, and the addition of extra effects on new cards you get as you progress adds more depth to it. Unfortunately getting new cards that do interesting things feels kinda slow to me, and I think I'm losing interest in the early part of the game faster than it's giving me stuff from the later part of the game.

Each draws cards from their decks and place them on the board, one per turn. The cards have arrows pointing in anywhere from 0 to 6 directions. Linking 3 or more to make a combo is your primary method of attack and defense. You can do damage to the player or disable their cards on the board. The advantage of disabling cards is they can no longer link together, though they can be healed. You win if you can drop their life to zero or their field fills up and they can no longer place cards. If a player runs out of cards, they don't immediately lose, but damage is dealt to them each turn by the board. \n\nThere's very little strategy involved. You fill your deck with cards that will link together easily. Beating enemies is mostly luck based, since they tend to have weird and unpredictable cards, like ones that randomly rotate or move cards. The winning strategy is often just to disable as many cards as possible without regard to health.\n\nOverall, veteran gamers will find this simplistic and boring, while casual players with not be especially enthralled.", "timestamp_created": 1395961127, "timestamp_updated": 1395961127, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9641975": {"recommendationid": "9641975", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989403783", "num_games_owned": 1080, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1395916818}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive as balls, if balls was an addictive card game with booster packs ripped straight out of final fantasy 9.

when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought \"Why not?\" and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.\n\nWhat I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose \"defense\" (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.\n\nWhile - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements.

I liked seeing its weird characters from different game series of the game's developer, i loved opening packs and wishing for me to get the rares, i enjoyed listen to the beatiful music it had during the battles and during the dialogues and of course i was happy after i completed all the achievements for this game (1st game to do so). To conclude, the 10 hours i spent on it were well worth it.

It turns out there's more to the card game mechanics than it would seem at first glance. Card City Nights gives you a 3x3 grid to play cards on, and asks you to make combos by joining groups of two or three cards together to perform certain actions. Cards connect to each other only in certain ways, so making sure you've got the right cards in your deck and knowing when to deploy them is crucial. Later you'll discover different ways to interact with cards, including rotating, moving and disabling cards, lending additional depth to the game.\n\nBeating the game itself is relatively straightforward, though certain opponents will exploit weaknesses in your strategy, forcing you to take a second look at your deck. The real fun parts lie in trying to get the achievements, which really get you to closely examine the cards available to you and think about how you can combine them to achieve goals that seemed impossible at the start of the game.\n\nOutside the basic gameplay, the art style's pretty neat (though it's an acquired taste) and the music is pretty addictive. The story is really just there to lend some structure to the card battles, but the recurring cast of characters are at least endearing and goofy.

Part of that is that players only have 7 life and that maxes out at 10, beyond which more defence won't help, and the attacking player will also have the option to disable the defensive player's cards about as quickly as they can attempt to form combos. With a decent attack deck, you can easily deal a consistent 4-6 damage every 3 turns, with an occasional burst that's even higher if you get a nice hand. (It's possible to win on turn 3 before your opponent has a chance to even do anything.)\n\nI think it would be reasonable to increase the starting defence and to increase or remove the cap.\n\nI beat the game the first time through with an infinite win/loss ratio using essentially the same strategy the whole way, augmenting my deck with cards as I obtained them. But despite the fact that it's on the easy side in absolute terms it's still a lot of fun to play. It could use a New Game Plus sort of option, and it would also be nice if after you won the game, the bosses and other characters would all play cards, rather than just the few characters which offer booster packs.", "timestamp_created": 1393118851, "timestamp_updated": 1393118851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9225249": {"recommendationid": "9225249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075484342", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393110472}, "language": "english", "review": "Actuaaly fun XD \n\nYeah.it's not MTG but it isn't supposed to be.

And I enjoyed it. That isn't to say the game is perfect. It has a number of flaws, some inherent to being a single player card game, and others that are the problem with the game itself. I'll list the pros, cons, and things that are more up to a person's taste.\n\nPros:\n-Unique gameplay. Unlike a regular card game like MTG, this game is played on a 3x3 board and the cards have arrows on them. You must connect cards using the arrows and then use them for attack or defense (depending on the card symbols). I can't really think of a game that has utilized this style of gameplay, and the fresh take on the rather traditional style of card games is a nice break from the games that are more in the style of MTG. \n-References galore. If you played any of this dev's previous games, you'll probably get a heap of enjoyment out of all the references made. \n-Deck progression. I guess that's a good term for this. Traditional card games you usually end up just buying a number of cards, and you have a solid deck right off the bat. I enjoy the progression of a single player card game, replacing worse cards for better cards as you continue to play the game. \n-Cost. I purchased this for $2. Regular price is $4. You'll probably see it going on sale during the Summer/Winter sale for $1. I'm basing this review off the $2 price point. You won't be getting a full card game for $2 (not unless you're insanely good at Hearthstone's Arena). I bought it with money I made selling Steam Trading Cards. \n\nCons:\n-Very Easy. I didn't lose a single best of three or best of five. Even the final boss I beat with three wins in a row. They very much need to ramp up the AI. They make some very silly plays that have the put a card in a location where they are unable to connect to anything. \n-Weak story. To be fair, who expected a good story from a card game? Still, it's a con. \n-No multiplayer. For a $4 indie title, this isn't much of a surprise. I personally don't care, as I was looking for more of a single player experience, but plenty of people will definitely find this to be a black mark against the title.\n-Lack of variety. The card effects basically boil down to: attack, defense, disable, revive, rotate, remove, move. While the connect three mechanic helps make up for this overall, it does prevent the game from being more enjoyable. I like me some crazy card effects.\n\nUp to Personal Taste:\n-Art style. I'm neutral to the art style. That's generally how I am for most games. Look at the screenshots and decide for yourself if the art style is going to throw you off.\n-Humor. The game seems to be trying to go for some humor. I chuckled once, and that was it. However, I didn't find the humor to be intrusive to the experience. \n\nBtw, game took me 11 hours to beat. In my opinion, that's a solid amount of time for $2.\nAnybody who enjoyed the old Pokemon TCG game or the Yu-gi-oh Single-Player games, I'd very much recommend getting this. To people who enjoy card games, I'd suggest giving this a shot. The price is low enough that it really won't hurt to give it a try. I had fun with it, which is why I'm giving it the good old thumbs up. \n\nHope this helps with your purchasing decision! :D", "timestamp_created": 1393037704, "timestamp_updated": 1393037704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9211505": {"recommendationid": "9211505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023979468", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393464174}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a shortish offline single player ccg.

Just go buy the freaking game.)\nI would like to start out by saying that I have a lot of experience with TCG's. I played Magic: The Gathering for a while, and I liked it but I was never in love with it. The game that I really fell in love with was Yugioh- which, from about 2010 to early 2012, was the best card game of all time, no holds barred, perfect pacing, for most of those formats well balanced, all playstyles were represented, and most importantly a deep, deep, deep, DEEP card pool that constantly rewarded me for scrolling through lists of cards, pointing at a random one with weird subtext and saying \"I'm gonna make a deck around that one!\" But eventually, konami ruined everything, the game sped up until it was too fast, the power crept up until I couldn't build a creative deck and survive against anyone competent for more than a turn or two, and the community got even worse. The state that it was in was much akin to the happy accidents of \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" or \"Marvel vs. Capcom 2\" in that they probably didn't actually think about how the things they added affected the meta game, but eventually it somehow turned out fantastic. I'm saying all of this because Card City Nights reminds me of this era of yugioh. Very different gameplay, yes, but I'm not talking about the gameplay. There are two very important things that this game gets very right and other digital tcg's get very very wrong: card collection and deck building.\nWhen you play hearthstone, and even scrolls (despite mojang having no motive to do so since it already costs 20 bucks), you might notice that you get like, 1-2 packs a day. Even if you get really good at drafting in hearthstone, you get a good pack or two every hour- if you're really, really good and really, really lucky. Card city nights, on the other hand, gives you a pack like every 5 minutes. And then gives you the option to use your extra cards to get more packs. And then gives you a fusion system to get more cards. And gives you a large singles shop. Seriously, collecting all the cards available to you in their maximum usable quantities seems so doable in this game, whereas every other online tcg asks me to grind for weeks or months just to finish my damn deck!\nPerhaps the best part of the fact that Card City Nights gives you so many cards, is that the deck building involves a lot of creativity and strategy and is just overall fantastic. Deckbuilding in other games seems very one-dimensional compared to Card City Nights... Cards fit together in unique ways, and not only do you have to think about your strategy and what each card is contributing to your strategy and the synergies between them and all of that stuff, but you have to think about the synergy between their arrows, think about the combos you could make with this deck... it adds a lot of depth to deck building. I'm not entirely sure if it was intentional or a byproduct of the gameplay, but either way I love it. Other than that, for a game I spent $2 on, the card pool is impressive (with an implication of more cards coming at the end) and the cards are designed well, giving some good strategies and combinations to build decks around without enforcing them as cards that need to be used together.\nSo all this should come together to be a great card game, right? Well, this review unfortunately ends in tragedy, as Card City Nights lacks a key component to this equation- multiplayer. It practically ruins everything I've just said. I can build all these great decks and collect all these cards and it won't mean anything in the end, because there's no ultimate test of my deck against another and there's no one who cares about my innovation when it's all within a relatively easy single player game. However, it's not a stretch to say that, in the event that online is patched in, and more cards are released, and the game is balanced a bit for competitive play, this could become the best tcg on the market.\nIt has a good base and a fun singleplayer, even if it lacks some fundamental elements necessary for it to become really great. It's worth the price of admission, and it could eventually be worth 100 times that if the game's potential is explored. In the end I still had a great time with it, even if it never becomes more than it is.", "timestamp_created": 1392783487, "timestamp_updated": 1392783487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.971716", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9175358": {"recommendationid": "9175358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025105217", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392732887}, "language": "english", "review": "Some stuff happens... and then you win.

This genre of game is one of my favorites, as were Magic: the Gathering: Shandalar and Pokemon Trading Card Game for Game Boy Color. So few of these games are made nowadays that really, I'll take whatever I can get, so when I saw this game on sale for $2, I jumped on it.\n\nIn the card game, you place cards on a 3x3 grid. Link arrows on the cards to make combos, which can lock down your opponents cards, release your own, boost your life total, or hurt your opponent. You win by reducing your opponent to 0 or by making them unable to play by filling up their grid or depleting their deck. The nice thing is that the game is fairly elegant, and most of the game's strategies involve using relatively simple cards. The strategy in deck building comes from putting together a good theme and making sure you can get the arrows to line up properly. There are a lot of card with powerful abilities that are rendered near useless because they only have one arrow.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, it's clear that this game was meant to celebrate this developer's previous titles. The only one of those games I had played (or heard of) previously was the fairly good Zelda clone, Ittle Dew, so I got a few of the self-referential jokes. Even if you're not in on the references, though, and I doubt you will be, this game has a lot of goofy humor, between the bizarre characters and funny backgrounds. I thought the music in this game was fine, with the exception of one or two tracks thay annoyed me. The art style is very cartoony and drawn in very thick lines, and I think the graphics work well enough. I would have liked a few more choices for your avatar, though.\n\nOverall, Card City Nights is a pretty solid card game and an amazing bargain at $4. If you enjoy collectible card games, then this is definitely worth picking up and playing for a few hours.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1392741653, "timestamp_updated": 1392741653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9168191": {"recommendationid": "9168191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075207472", "num_games_owned": 1066, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397748629}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a pretty fun game for a few bucks, although it is pretty short (should be able to complete the game easily in less than 10 hours)", "timestamp_created": 1392737480, "timestamp_updated": 1392737480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9168071": {"recommendationid": "9168071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027303311", "num_games_owned": 573, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392735004}, "language": "japanese", "review": "3x3 \u306e\u5834\u306b\u3001\u77e2\u5370\u304c\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7f6e\u3044\u3066\u3044\u304f CCG \u3002\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u30aa\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u306e\u3067\u4ea4\u63db\u8981\u7d20\u7121\u3057\u3002\n\u3064\u306a\u3052\u305f\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\uff08\u56db\u7a2e\u985e\uff09\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u653b\u6483\u3001\u9632\u5fa1\uff08\u56de\u5fa9\uff09\u3001\u5834\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3001\u52b9\u679c\u7121\u3057\u306e\u3069\u308c\u304b\u304c\u767a\u52d5\u3002\n\u653b\u6483\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u76f8\u624b\u306e\u9632\u5fa1\u5024\uff08\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\uff09\u3092 0 \u306b\u3059\u308b\u304b\u3001\u76f8\u624b\u304c\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u7f6e\u3051\u306a\u3044\u72b6\u614b\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3089\u52dd\u3061\u3002\n\n\u653b\u6483\u306f\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u3092\u6e1b\u3089\u3059\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3001\u76f8\u624b\u306e\u5834\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3092\u653b\u6483\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u653b\u6483\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3068\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u7121\u52b9\u72b6\u614b\u3068\u306a\u308a\u3001\u3064\u306a\u3052\u3066\u3082\u6d88\u305b\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3002\u7121\u52b9\u72b6\u614b\u306f\u5fa9\u6d3b\u30a2\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u56de\u5fa9\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\n\n\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u306f\u308f\u308a\u3068\u5358\u7d14\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u610f\u5916\u3068\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u7a2e\u985e\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3066\u904a\u3079\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u7f6e\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3051\u3067\u3082\u52b9\u679c\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u7f6e\u3044\u305f\u5f8c\u52d5\u304d\u56de\u3063\u305f\u308a\u56de\u8ee2\u3059\u308b\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u3064\u306a\u3052\u308b\u3068\u52b9\u679c\u304c\u5897\u3048\u308b\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u306a\u3069\u306a\u3069\u3002\n\u6bb4\u308a\u5012\u3059\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3001\u69cb\u7bc9\u3082\u5e45\u5e83\u304f\u884c\u3048\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3002\uff08\u307e\u3060\u305d\u3053\u307e\u3067\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u591a\u304f\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u63a8\u5b9a\uff09\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u81ea\u4f53\u306f\u305f\u3076\u3093\u63a7\u3048\u3081\u300110 \u6642\u9593\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u7121\u3044\u306e\u304c\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u6b8b\u5ff5\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u624b\u8efd\u306a\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u3057\u3066\u697d\u3057\u3081\u307e\u3059\u3002\n", "timestamp_created": 1392736594, "timestamp_updated": 1392736594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500513", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9167654": {"recommendationid": "9167654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050783163", "num_games_owned": 864, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392676138}, "language": "english", "review": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIByzBe1jaM\n\nCard City Nights is a remarkable new take on the traditional \"connect-three\" genre, which has been brilliantly combined with trading card gameplay.

I've played a lot of YU-GI-OH back in the day and quite a lot of Magic the gathering and I'm familiar with a few other TCG's like Pok\u00e9mon and Duelmonsters and this game is really cheap. I'll admit right away that I didn't really like the game because this card game is not my cup of tea but I can imagine there are a lot of TCG fans out there that will like it.\n\nThe game pretty much is a card game, you battle opponents, gain boosterpacks to change your deck  and earn money to buy cards so you can take on stronger opponents. The game does have a storyline, all I know about it is that you have to collect the 8 legendary cards by defeating the holders of those cards so you can take on the champion of the game, but it's a card game so no need for a fancy story there anyway.\n\nIts kinda hard to explain how the card game works so it might be better looking up some gameplay videos but I'm gonna try anyway. Both players start with 7 shields (hp). You win the game if your opponent drops to 0 shields or if he can't play anymore cards. The playingfield consists of 3 by 3 spaces where you can play your cards, the goal is to create a combo of 3 cards and that will trigger a certain effect based on the types of the cards used in the combo which I'll explain later on. You must play one card a turn and you cannot remove any of the cards on the playingfield so if you donnot make combinations you'll run out of spaces and lose the game.\n\nThere are 4 types of cards: defensive, offensive, revive and neutral. If you make a combination using 3 defensive cards you gain 3 shields, if you make a combination using 3 offensive cards you can deal 3 damage to the shields of your opponent or disable one of his cards on the playingfield, if a card is disabled it cannot be used for combinations and it just stays on the playingfield. Use a combination of 3 revive cards and you can re-enable a disabled card and neutral cards don't have any effect and are just used for making combinations. The way combinations are made is rather interesting. You can combine all 4 types of cards in the combinations, for example you can use 2 offensive cards and 1 defensive card in a combination, but ony one effect can happen based on the most cards of a single type within the combination so that means this combo does damage but does not give you additional shields and because there are only 2 offensive cards in the combo it only does 2 damage. The position of the cards on the playingfield also plays a role, the playingfield consists of 3 by 3 spaces and there are arrows on every card indicating in what directions they can make combo's, for example you place a card in the centre of the playingfield and it has 2 arrows, 1 pointing up and 1 pointing left. That means it can only make a combination with cards placed above or on the left of this card if however that card also has an arrow pointing towards it. I hope that kind of explained how the game works.\n\nThe reason why I give the game a recomendation is because the card game is solid and I cannot deny that. Because it wasn't my cup of tea doesn't mean I cannot recomend it to others especially because it's cheap and solid.

I am a casual player and don't have the patience for anything \"hardcore\" or otherwise overly time consuming. So I usually play fairly shallow \"casual\" games and then figure out what the mechanics are and get bored, or I try deeper games and then the difficult ramps up too high for casual play.\n\nSo far this has been a game which I keep going back to because the difficulty ramps up gradually, introducing interesting variations on the core mechanic. For instance, I built an attack-heavy deck and was coasting through most battles until I got to an opponent that had a better attack-oriented deck than mine. I was at an impasse, but then one of the characters recommended that I try going for disabling cards instead of dealing direct damage. Great suggestion! Now I'm thinking future opponents will try this strategy on me and I'm considering adding more revival-type cards to my deck. What I appreciate about this game is that it's got me thinking about strategies without going into hardcore deck building territory. However, it's not a shallow game like you find with, for instance, most mobile games.

You have 5 cards in your hand at one time, and take turns with your opponent to place a card done on a grid.  Create combos of 3 or more by connecting arrows between cards. Place them carefully, as when you run out of spaces you'll lose the round.  Since HP is capped at 10 and there are penalties for running out of cards, each round goes fairly fast and you won't get into stalemate situations.  It may not be as strategically deep as other card games where you have to manage resources etc., but it's easy to pick up, and fun.  \n\nIn between card battles, you can organize your card decks, buy cards to augment your decks using virtual money (you can also get booster packs by battling, and there are no IAPs) and go around town to talk to other characters. The storyline is rather silly (but are you really playing a card game for the story?) and humourous.  The charmingly cartoony art fits the game well, as does the cheerful music.\n\nMy only drawback is that the AI appears to be on the easy side so far, but as I've not gotten too far yet this may be something that fixes itself later on.\n\nCard City Nights may not be a super-challenging card game, but it's good for a breezy time of card-battling fun. For casual fans of the trading card genre, this could well hit the spot.\n\nEDIT: as I've progressed, the game has indeed become a little more tricky.

The goal of duels is to either reduce your opponent to 0 health or to fill up your opponent's board. Combos are done by connecting at least three symbols through the arrows on the cards, and the highest type of symbol except for the empty symbol determines what kind of action you take from the combo, which is either attacking, gaining health back, or restoring one of your disabled cards. You can interact with your opponent's board mainly through disabling, which can be done by attacking the individual card, and rotating and removing their cards, which happens through specific card effects.\n\nThere are strictly better cards, but since there are varying card limits (5 of a common, 3 of a uncommon, 1 of a rare, and 1 legendary out of all legendaries), the inferior cards are sometimes still used to get the arrows needed to carry out combos. There's also a way to recycle excess cards.\n\nAI starts out dumb, but their decks and intelligence increases as you play. So far I haven't lost yet (though I have had plenty of challenging matches), but the decks may become much harder.\n\nMy one nitpick is that attack symbols are very strong because they do two things: lowering your opponent's health and disabling their cards. Defense symbols only gain you life, which alone won't let you win the game, and the restoration symbols which are very situational when your opponent actually disables one of your cards. The cards with attack symbols aren't much worse than other cards, so they will tend to dominate your deck. I wonder if combining the defense symbol and the restoration symbol would have helped the depth of deck building.\n\nAlso, the settings menu can only be access through the world map, which is strange. You also need to double click on some icons.\n\nA lot of the game resides in the deckbuilding and making sure the cards work with each other. The interactions are complex due to the directions for comboing on each card, as well as balancing the effects you need to survive against opponents. The dueling is fun and feels like a puzzle game in way.\n\nOverall, if card games and puzzle games seem interesting to you, I recommend trying it out. The cost of the game won't set you back much either.", "timestamp_created": 1392555208, "timestamp_updated": 1392555208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9137374": {"recommendationid": "9137374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007968458", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397584487}, "language": "polish", "review": "Wydaje si\u0119 prosta gra karciana ale jednak ma co\u015b w sobie.

So far its ok I have only played about one hour. The whole game is to make 3 cards touch arrows to either do damage or defense. The rules are a slightly more complicated but thats about the gist of the game not including the strange cards that turn some cards upside down and other strange cards. \n\nThe artwork is nice however the game features no animation in any of the boss battles or the people you meet or fight against. A little animation would have been nice, maybe moving a arm or having one of them wink something right now it feels like a comic book.  The music is very nice and relaxing and does fit the play style of the game. You can also talk to certain people in this game however its a very short conversation mostly just lets fight or tips on how to play so far.\n\nThe card battles are ok.  Bascially you have a deck of cards in your library and they shuffle them up and give you 5 of them and you have to be able to play at least one or you lose. The game does have potential however a few things hold it back for me. The game feels lifeless to me the people you meet are boring/lifeless and the card game while fun is kind of the same. The game is just dull over all. \n\nExamples the smashing sound when you hit an opponent  should be a Boom! instead you get pew pew the you win sign should be booming instead you get a sign saying win with little fanfare. I do like the art style of the cards. I really dont hate this game however like I have stated I find it kind of boring overall. I think a small part of it has to do with little to no animation in the game. The cards  are static, people are static the only \"action\" you do see on screen is the hits and a rotating circle sometimes. Again lifeless comes to mind for me a lot. I can find no fault but I dont find anything compelling about it as well .. A game should hook me and want me to play further and so far there just isnt a big enough hook. 5/10 is what I would rate this right now.

There's no description of this event but the game throws the hint right at the start if you know where to look. You get to pick your portrait and name and next thing you know you'll be battling your first few opponents. The story, because yes, there's a story, is barebones but this isn't a bad thing, quite the opposite. You want to win the Card City tournament because of reasons and get its prize but you need 8 legendary cards to even get to participate in it, so you must win those cards first. That's the whole story right there. It's nice to see a card game that doesn't take itself too serious and the story is a amusing distraction from the proceedings.\n\nThe game is incredibly simple to pick up, the tutorial is short but effective in telling you the principal mechanic of the game. \nEssentially, the game plays out in two 3 by 3 grid, one for you and another for your opponent. The cards you use have arrows on them pointing in any of 8 different ways and one or more of 4 symbols attached to it (attack, defense, neutral, revive). You PLAY the cards by placing them on your grid but you USE them by matching arrows and symbols, making combos. You need at least 3 symbols linked by arrows to make a combo. Meanwhile, your opponent is trying to do the same. There's a little bit more nuance to this but that's THE game right there.\n\nYou mix and match the cards in the deck(s) to your style of play, since there are no \"set\" decks. You edit them in any way you like on up to 6 different decks, using the cards you get via randomized booster packs that you win after defeating certain opponents. The total number of cards in the game is healthy enough to actually require some tough decisions as to what cards to actually put in the deck.\n\nThe battles themselves can be won in few different ways. Two examples would be, you can attack your opponents defence, bring it to zero or disable his cards with those same attacks for a grid lock, where he has no legal move. Either way, you win (or your opponent does). \n\nHowever, there is definitely some concern about balance. For example, you can have 3 uncommon cards and 5 common ones in a 40 card deck. In reality, while playing, you'll find that 3 uncommon  cards that are straight-up upgrades from common ones (as in, they have the same everything the common card has but with one extra bit, like an extra arrow and/or special ability) are much more worth having. \n\nThere's no real reason to keep common cards around because they will eventually just take up room from the more useful uncommon cards, unless you need A LOT of cards with arrows pointing the same way, which you won't, since it's counter-intuitive. And since uncommon become powerful on their own (like damaging the enemy just by placing them, for example), and booster packs are always available to be won, you can, with a little luck in the boosters while farming them, steamroll most opponents early on, if not for the entire duration. So this warants these two paragraphs.\n\nThe A.I. isn't particularly challenging but with more card variety, the possible moves it makes also increases, so it keeps you guessing the first or even the second time you battle a particular opponent, which is nice. There's no multiplayer, for those more inclined to battle humans, so this feature lacking is going to put off some people, which is understandable but it's not a major gripe, in my opinion, obviously.\n\nIn conclusion and to make a long story short, it's a casual card game that offers some solid gameplay with solid mechanics. It doesn't reinvent the wheel because it doesn't have to as far as card games are concerned but it stands out enough to warrant a look. And for it's price tag, it's a great steal.

I really like it so far, and plan on putting a good bit more time into it. I'm gonna try to give you a good idea of the game becuase not too much is explained here or anywhere online so bear with me.\n\n  It's a very simple little card game wrapped in a Yu-Gi-Oh-esque adventure shell. You go through different locations battling people, getting more cards, getting new decks, all in an effort to get the 8 legendary cards and become super cool and powerful and make mad bank at a tournament. \n\nThe gameplay itself is simple. There's a world map that you click locations on to go there and interact with or battle people (also, click around the environment to find hidden coins!).  The card game puts a heavy emphasis on positioning. All the cards have arrows on them, and you want to put your cards together so their arrows point at eachother. Connect (usually) 3 arrows and you can make a combo to either do damage, increase your defense(HP) or other effects. That's it. You win when your opponent has no defense or can't play another card.  After you win, you generally get a pack of cards to build your deck with, and some money to buy more packs.  Your deck must be at least 25 cards, but they can be bigger. \n\nI really like the story, well what little of it I've seen so far. It's basic, you know, get the best cards and be the best. That's good enough for me though, and it should satisfy anyone who grew up watcing shows about kids playing card games.  So far, it's bee pretty light-hearted, it's silly and kinda funny which I dig. The art style is childlike and well drawn in a good way, it fits the theme of the game very well. Now we move to the music, and goddamn do I love it. Seriously, I hope I can get the soundtrack, because it's probably my favorite part. \n\nThe last thing to mention is the price. It's 2 bucks right now. Yes, it's clearly a port of a tablet game. No, it doesn't have visual/sound options aside from a resolution changer and a window/fullscreen button. No, it does not have multiplayer. Let me bring this up again. IT'S 2 BUCKS. Even when it goes to full price at 4 bucks, it's still totally worth it. If you like card games, you should buy it. Even if you don't like card games, but cheap and charming games, buy it. Anyone can get into this, and you should get into it.", "timestamp_created": 1392425599, "timestamp_updated": 1392425849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695646", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9111161": {"recommendationid": "9111161", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978416407", "num_games_owned": 2291, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397683980}, "language": "english", "review": "Summary: The game is quite good, but it's not perfect. There are minor hints at mobile heritage, but nothing that would stop anyone who might like a computerized card game from having plenty of fun.\n\nProgress Disclosure: I finished the game and have every achievement. I didn't collect every card. That took about 14 hours. It could probably be done in 8-10 hours by someone hurrying.\n\nUpdates: It's over 2 months later, and this game is still getting free content additions.\n\nThe mechanics have clearly received attention and tuning; the basics work nicely on their own, and as more abilities are introduced they interact in interesting but not convoluted ways. The interface in general is good; however, it is full of tiny delays for animations and pointless confirmations of non-permanent actions. Combat animations can be set to anywhere between 100% and 200% speed in the options, at least.\n\nThe tutorial was good, even having heard and read nothing about the game except the store description before playing. The difficulty hasn't sharply spiked or stayed tutorial easy since; the AI can be observed getting steadily more competent in addition to having better cards. Most games are semi-close wins, and the occasional enemy provokes a new deck style. I have a win ratio around 5, and I doubt that's exceptional.\n\nDeck size is allowed to vary between 25-40 and failing to draw causes damage, so milling is a somewhat viable strategy with the right cards.\n\nThere's an deterministic, seemingly associative 2-input alchemy system. The vast majority of combinations are disallowed, and this is indicated by dimming incompatible cards; there's still a pretty large space of recipes, though. A little experimentation produced some deck-worthy but not ridiculous cards. As an example, two Pancakes gives a pretty good milling card. I didn't find a guide, so I'll warn that in my experience combining a alchemy-created card and one of the ingredients used to craft it is allowed but just gets the created back, effectively throwing a card away.\n\nThere are 6 icon-identified deck slots; a card can be used in multiple decks. The deck building interface is passable if imperfect; it lacks bulk management options, and the sorting options are deficient. It could use a tweak to show more cards on a PC screen. Cards used in decks are hidden on store and alchemy menus (for good reason).\n\nThe art style is pleasant. The dialogue is mildly humorous overall and better in parts; the optional dialogues are pretty extensive, as well.\n\nThe achievements look to be quite doable, so it would probably be good for 100%ers. The non-trivial ones (10+ attack and 9 combo) are easy enough to manage once you have a 6+ arrow card and deliberately try.\n\nAs described, there are no hidden in-game currency, card, or booster purchases.\n\nAccessibility: The game is fully turn-based with no time pressure ever. The interface doesn't require great precision, but it does require dragging. The interface is fully mouse-driven, except optionally entering your name. There are no vital sound-only cues. No lines are voiced; all dialogue is presented in text. Nothing relies purely on color for identification.

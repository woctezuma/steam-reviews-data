I only used the most general, or look at this row or square, and usually I missed something because I was so tired because this stupid game kept me up until the whee hours of the morning :D\n\nUpdate:  263 puzzles at 2:22 average per puzzle.

A lot like Sudoku in which you can only have a number appear once in every column and row. However, from there on out it has way more mechanics. In Sudoku, the 9x9 Grid is divided into 9 Boxes of 3x3, the Boxes themselves are arranged 3x3 as well. In SquareLogic the Boxes are called \"Cages\". And the cages aren't restricted to only on Mechanic either. In Sudoku, that Mechanic was that the 3x3 Box has to have 9 numbers in it, none of them repeating, and the Box had to be 3x3. In SquareLogic, the Cages can be any number of squares and in any shape. As for the Mechanics, there's a lot of them: For example, a 3 Square Cage has to have those 3 numbers add up to 8. So those 3 numbers(for the 3 squares in the Cage) could be 1+5+2, or 2+2+4, etc. You still have to make sure that numbers don't repeat in the same column and row, but numbers can repeat in the same cage, just not column and row. There's other Mechanics for cages too, mostly math, like all numbers subtracting to a certain value, multiplication, division, have number 3 numbers in consecutive order, etc.\n\nThe game introduces the Mechanics slowly, so you're not overwhelmed. You start with a few Mechanics on a 4x4 Grid, and work your way up to a whopping 8x8 Grid with a large amount of mechanics. There's plenty of convenience mechanics too. To make it easier to narrow down numbers, all numbers are listed in the Squares so you can just left click to input that number as the Squares choice, or right click that number to cross it out. You can use your keyboard as well. And when you input a number into a square, that number is automatically crossed out from all the other Squares in the Row and Column. \n\nThe hint system is great as well. It starts off with simple hints, then get's less subtle, then blatantly tells you the answer or just crosses off a number. The game can be solved with purely logic though. The Hints do a very good job of not making you feel like a moron and just nudging you in the proper direction.\n\nAs I'm sure you guessed by now, there's math involved. But you don't need to do any calculations if you don't want too. Let's say for example you're playing on a 8x8 Grid, which means you have numbers 1-8 to play with. Now let's say you're working on a 6 Square Cage in which all 6 numbers must multiply up to 560. You don't need to do any math at all, because when you highlight that Cage, the Solution List Mechanic pops up on the right. This list will show all possible combinations(remember that numbers can repeat within a Cage, just not row/column) in one easy to read list. If you've crossed out numbers your self or done automatically as you've filled in the rest of the puzzle, the Solution List will automatically factor out all numbers that can't be used anymore in that cage, whether it be due to crossed out numbers or simply because the Cages arrangement means numbers cant repeat themselves without being in the same row/column. Solutions that are still possible are Green, while Solutions that are no longer possible are Red.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the ridiculous amount of puzzles in the game. The game is divided up into 5 Regions. Each Region has around 6-8 Locations that must be done in order. Each Location has 12 Practice Puzzles and 1 Challenge Puzzle, in which completing the Challenge Puzzle Unlocks the next Location, and finishing all the Locations Unlocks the next Region. Usually each Location gives you a new Mechanic to play with, and once you complete a Locations 12 Practice Puzzles + 1 Challenge Puzzle, you unlock an additional 787(That's right, Seven Hundred and Eighty Seven) Puzzles that all include the Mechanic learned at that Location plus all previous locations. The 787 Additional Puzzles are divided into 3 difficulties settings: Easy, Medium, and Hard. So if you're having trouble with a Mechanic, there's PLENTY of puzzles to practice with. If we just go with a basic 6 Locations per Region, that's 30 Locations. 12 Practice Puzzles + 1 Challenge Puzzle + 787 Additional Puzzles = 800 Puzzles per Location. That's a bare minimum 24,000 Puzzles in SquareLogic.\n\nThere's more stuff to the game, such as other fun mechanics and convenience features, but I'll let you discover it. If you love puzzle games, I definitely recommend SquareLogic. If you love Sudoku I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND SquareLogic, especially if you're looking for more in your Sudoku.\n\n[b]Edit:[/b] For some reason I can't post large reviews in one go.

Don't be put off if you're not someone who loves Sudoku--even though the layout is similar, this isn't a straightforward Sudoku game, and there are many aspects of the game that make it easier and more interesting than regular Sudoku. For example, the game automatically removes numbers that will not satisfy the requirements of the grid, and notifies you if you have made a mistake. It also offers the option of displaying all of the possible mathematical operations that satisfy the conditions of the grid, but you can turn this off if you like more of a challenge.\n\nThe first puzzles are very easy, but the challenge gradually increases, and there is a variety of puzzles to keep things interesting. Sometimes there are \"Hidden Cage\" puzzles, where you have to work out for yourself which rules apply to which squares, and sometimes there are \"Double Board\" puzzles, where you work out the solution by comparing two boards. You're not always doing the same puzzle over and over. If you want to do that, though, there are literally hundreds of similar puzzles to keep you occupied if you don't feel like grappling with a new puzzle type yet. Each type of puzzle is available in Easy, Medium, or Hard.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is that it lets you take a \"challenge puzzle\" to unlock the next set of puzzles whenever you like.

Seemed too simplistic, wasn't sure if it would offer enough of a challenge and thought it might, maybe sit on my list unplayed and forgotten.  Months later, this has become my most played game on PC.  (Don't trust my 'hours played' number: I mostly play it on my laptop when I have no connection.)\n\nThere are THOUSANDS of puzzles for you to take on in this game.  They all work off of the same basic concept, with some fun little variations (such as working with two interconnected boards that share the same answers, but different formulas).  Each one offers a new challenge though and with time you pick up on the patterns and logical shortcuts that you may have missed before.\n\nAs for difficulty, you really can make it as easy or difficult as you want.  There is no \"real\" penalty for just guessing every single box.  So, if, for some bizarre reason, you want to just barrel through guessing the whole way, you can.  \n\nOr, if you're like me, you can aim to finish each puzzle WELL below the Par number of moves with no mistakes and only the bare minimum use of the right-click-to-hide-invalid-numbers function.  \n\nIf you're extremely sharp and/or have too much free time, you can also hide the box that shows the possible solution combinations.  Not an issue when you're dealing with two or three boxes, but at five or six it becomes a little more impractical; even with the solutions, you still have the challenge of figuring out the logical placement of everything.  You could be at a single puzzle for hours.\n\nIf you use a laptop like I do, you'll also probably appreciate the low demand it will place on your battery and system resources.

I've been playing for years (prior to purchasing it on Steam), and the discussions board is still pretty active. Those who play it, generally keep playing it.\n\nSo, with a name like \"Everyday Genius,\" it's pretty easy to be scared off; one could be forgiven for thinking this to be a hardcore math game. It isn't. It's more logic puzzle than anything else, although it remains unique. It is not like Sudoku, except that it uses numbers and the process of elimination to reach a solution. \n\nSimply put, you're presented with a single grid (to start). Inside each grid is a series of puzzle boxes that contain different mathematical symbols along with the numbers 1 through 4 (I said math isn't really needed, and I didn't lie; keep reading). An equal sign (for example \"4=\") inside a box simply means the answer is the number 4. Two boxes reading \"3+\" means that the answer will be 3, and it is achieved by adding two numbers together (1+2). Like Sudoku (which this really isn't), numbers can only be used once in each row or column. Each puzzle within the grid can be several boxes, and they are painted the same color so that you know they are one puzzle (for example, 1x2x3=6, might all be painted green). You get the idea.\n\nWhat keeps it from being less math and more logic is that mousing over any box will automatically show you all possible combinations for the solution. As you solve more puzzles inside each grid, these possible solutions will also change, due to process of elimination. Eliminated numbers will automatically disappear from each puzzle, and you can also manually remove them by right-clicking. Because of this, it really is possible to solve each grid without much math skill.\n\nThe variety offered here is stunning. You will use greater than and less than symbols; straights (3,4,5,6, etc); even / odd numbers; multiplication and division; and more. The real creativity comes when boxes arrive unpainted, leaving [i]you[/i] to color them in with the correct colors. Color them incorrectly, and you'll be solving puzzles that don't exist, meaning your entire grid will be incorrect! Some times, you may have puzzles without any equations; other times, an entire 9x9 grid may [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234521480]consist of nothing but less than or greater than symbols[/url]! The difficulty level amps up until you are solving two grids simultaneously, with factors up to 9.\n\nThere is no time limit, the colors are vibrant, and the music that is here is soothing and ambient. It's casual puzzle solving at its best. There is truly nothing else like it, and it remains a classic...for those of us who actually know about it. Some people, like myself, are still playing it years later, and you'll not solve the 20,000 included puzzles (not randomly generated, by the way) any time soon.  Even better, it can be played with one hand, for those times when my grandson falls asleep on my lap!\n\nAt less than $5 US, there is not a single puzzle game on Steam that offers this much game time per penny.

Again, you have a game inspired by an original, but taken to wholly higher levels with new gameplay mechanics.\n\nWith \"Pretentious Title: SquareLogic\" (thanks to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/breakfastcompanion/recommended/32150]Deluxe Breakfast Companion's review[/url] for that one...I had to stifle a giggle) you're taken beyond the scope of regular Sudoku as the board gets divided up into arbitrary sections, each with its own independent ruleset.  Then -- in contrast to Sudoku which starts you out with some cells already filled in -- you fill out the entire grid, using the rules for each section (in the game's terms, each \"cage\").  The result is a wide variety of puzzle times that don't get stale like regular Sudoku (for me, anyway).\n\nThe other nice thing about SquareLogic is its wide variety of assists.  You can configure it to immediately highlight errors, show you a list of possible combinations for the \"arithmetic cages\".  (SquareLogic is not a math game, but some basic arithmetic does organically result for this particular cage type.  We're talking adding and multiplying single-digit numbers.)  These two features can be turned on and off independently, and there's also a hint button (which you can choose not to click).  In addition, it's possible to \"cross off\" candidate numbers (for example, if you know a particular cell cannot contain a particular number); for an additional challenge, you can solve the puzzles without using this feature (easy enough in the beginning, but try that on a 9x9 grid!).\n\nThe background music -- I mean, it's not really music per se, more ambient soundscape -- suits the \"deep thought\" premise of the game nicely.  However, the audio is never part of the gameplay, so you can definitely play with any other tunes you like in the background (or silence).\n\nAt the end of the day, this seems like an obvious choice for a Sudoku fan who's looking to grow into something more -- I won't say more challenging, because the harder Sudoku puzzles I've found are certainly more than challenging enough for me at least -- varied.\n\nAs for replay value, if anybody ever finds out, let me know.  There are 20,670 puzzles in the game, so I'd hazard a guess that once you've completed the set, you can probably start over from the beginning and not remember the ones you've already solved.  :)\n\n[h1]If you like this game, check out...[/h1]\n[list]\n  [*] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/304410]Hexcells Infinite[/url]\n  [*] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/266010]LYNE[/url]\n  [*] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/33650]Puzzler World[/url]\n  [*] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/200130]Puzzler World 2[/url]\n  [*] [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/4900]Zen of Sudoku[/url]\n[/list]\n[h1]Review metadata[/h1]\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th]Date of update[/th]\n    [th]Time played[/th]\n    [th]How far in base game (estimate)?[/th]\n    [th]Cost[/th]\n    [th]Cost per hour[/th]\n    [th]Notes[/th]\n  [/tr][tr]\n    [td]2015-03-15 20:10[/td]\n    [td]204.9 hours[/td]\n    [td]100% main storyline/campaign complete with all achievements[/td]\n    [td]$4.99 USD[/td]\n    [td]$0.02 USD[/td]\n    [td]Initial review[/td]\n  [/tr][tr]\n    [td]2015-03-15 23:34[/td]\n    [td]204.9 hours[/td]\n    [td]100% main storyline/campaign complete with all achievements[/td]\n    [td]$4.99 USD[/td]\n    [td]$0.02 USD[/td]\n    [td]Cosmetic updates[/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1426480322, "timestamp_updated": 1426480490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14876842": {"recommendationid": "14876842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098624111", "num_games_owned": 1144, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423280918}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6d88\u78e8\u65f6\u95f4\u795e\u5668\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5173\u5361\u592a\u591a\u73a9\u4e45\u4e86\u4f1a\u89c9\u5f97\u5f88\u65e0\u804a\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1426311222, "timestamp_updated": 1426311222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14812510": {"recommendationid": "14812510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042568408", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426802666}, "language": "english", "review": "Omg this is soo good, relaxing puzzle with simple math problems (at least in the first region idk if gets harder) but its pretty fun!!!", "timestamp_created": 1425929576, "timestamp_updated": 1425929576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14372739": {"recommendationid": "14372739", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976287656", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449863235}, "language": "german", "review": "Genial", "timestamp_created": 1423332016, "timestamp_updated": 1423332016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14113015": {"recommendationid": "14113015", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973201961", "num_games_owned": 637, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494327186}, "language": "english", "review": "This is brilliant.

Auch hier gilt es, K\u00e4stchen mit Ziffern nach bestimmten Regeln zu bef\u00fcllen. Everyday Genius ist also nur eine weitere Umsetzung des Klassikers und erfindet nichts neu. Allerdings ist die Umsetzung sehr gelungen. \n\nEs gibt abertausende vordefinierter R\u00e4tsel im Spiel, die man sich St\u00fcck f\u00fcr St\u00fcck freischalten muss. Es gibt zu jedem neuen Schwierigkeitsgrad 12 R\u00e4tsel, gefolgt von einer \"Challenge\". Hat man dieses Challange-R\u00e4tsel gel\u00f6st schaltet man die restlichen R\u00e4tsel der Stufe frei. Es steht einem jederzeit frei, direkt zur Challenge zu springen, ein bisschen \u00dcbung zuvor schadet jedoch nie.\nDerzeit bin ich bei etwa 20 Stunden Spielzeit, und ich habe noch nicht alle R\u00e4tsel freigespielt, obwohl ich bisher immer nur die 12 + 1 gespielt habe.\n\nDie Hilfefunktion im Spiel ist angenehm dezent. Sie nimmt einem nicht den R\u00e4tselspa\u00df, indem sie einfach das Ergebnis nennt. Sie wei\u00dft lediglich auf die Felder hin, aus denen man mehr R\u00fcckschl\u00fcsse auf die L\u00f6sung ziehen kann. Kommt man trotzdem nicht drauf, kann man einen weiteren, etwas detaillierten Hinweis anfordern.\n\nAlle R\u00e4tsel sind komplett erschlie\u00dfbar ohne dass man raten muss. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist zu Beginn naturgem\u00e4\u00df sehr niedrig, steigt dann aber gut an, so dass man bei manchen R\u00e4tseln durchaus mal 15 Minuten br\u00fcten muss.\n\nF\u00fcr jemanden der KenKen kennt ist das Spiel auf jeden Fall eine Empfehlung wert, ebenso f\u00fcr Spieler, die sich gerne mit etwas Denksport verdingen.\nEinzig der Soundtrack k\u00f6nnte einem schlechten Horrorfilm entstammen.

Like sudoku, the goal is to fill a square grid such that the numbers appear only once in each column and row.\n\nSquareLogic's twist on the formula is in the cage system.  Instead of prepopulating the grid with enough numbers to solve the puzzle, SquareLogic divides the board into arbitrary chunks, called cages, and assigns a mathematical rule to each.  For instance, one cage may require its content to sum to 8, another may require its smaller value to divide the larger value 4 times.  Other cages impose inequality operators on the divisions between cages, indicating that one square must contain a larger or smaller number than its neighbor.  The puzzles have extra mechanics beyond the cages as well, including double-puzzles, where two grids contain the same solution but different cages, each providing too little to solve on its own, but enough to solve when paired with the other.  Other puzzle types may leave some cages unfinished and require the player to paint them in as they go.\n\nThis formula would likely be overwhelming and tedious, especially on full-sized 9x9 puzzles (the game ranges from 4x4 to 9x9).  However, the game automatically removes numbers from tiles when that number is used elsewhere in the column/row, and players can right click any number to remove it as a viable option.  This effectively automates the more menial part of the puzzle, leaving the logical problem solving front and center.  The game also highlights possible valid combinations for cages in a small window, so you don't have to constantly keep a calculator by your side to determine what factorizations are possible for a number set.  Because of these features, the puzzles go by quickly and rarely feel like they're ever wasting your time.\n\nSquareLogic isn't flawless though.  The 4x4 puzzles are almost comically easy due to their small size, while the 9x9 and some 8x8 puzzles can become frustrating and tedious because there is simply too much information to pore over.  It becomes less a game of applying logic and more of a mindless search for the next clue you can use.  Luckily, the game still has plenty of 6x6 and 7x7 puzzles, which feel extremely well paced.\n\nAnother problem is the immediate error highlighting feature.  When you first boot up the game, go into options and turn this setting off immediately.  This setting causes the game to tell you the very instant you make a mistake.  It's a feature that is quite literally too helpful, as it quietly encourages you to start guessing whenever you begin having trouble.  With this disabled though, there's still an incredibly nice hint feature to help you out of jams.  Rather than openly tell you what's wrong, it simply highlights a section of the grid where you should be able to either eliminate possibilites or find a correct number.  It's especially useful on the large puzzles where it's easy to have too many options to pore over.\n\nThe one last problem is somewhat debatable.  The game simply has too many puzzles.  It has 6 regions, each with a staggeringly large number of available puzzles.  The first area alone contains 4800.  That is not an exaggeration.  While it certainly means the game has incredible value, it can be a little disheartening to know that you're not likely to ever even come close to finishing all of the puzzles.  Oh, and anyone obsessed with achievements would do well to avoid this game for that reason, unless you want to solve all 4800 puzzles in the first region for a cheevo.\n\nOverall, for anyone who likes abstract logic puzzles, SquareLogic is pretty much top class.  It's fun, mostly well paced, has a ton of puzzles and lots of good mechanics.

Each colored area has a \"rule\" associated with it (you can see those in the screenshots also); for example you might have to make a 4-tiled \"L\" shape's numbers multiply all together and equal 36.  Or rule might be that the area can only contain even numbers. \n\nYou have to use each number once per column and once per row; once you fill in a tile it automatically removes that number from the rest of the row/column for you.   As the game gets harder the rules get a bit more complex, the areas get larger, some tiles won't have the color filled in, you'll have to use your brain to figure the colors/rules, THEN the numbers for each tile.  \n\nThere's really no penalty for putting the wrong number in a tile except for your \"shortest number of moves to complete this one\" personal best ego boost.  I also feel it does a very good job of explaining and working each new rule/aspect of gameplay as it is incorporated into the rising difficulty.  \n\nBy hovering over a tile, if the rule for it's area is known, all possible solutions are shown to you so you really don't have to be super good at math; this is a logic game that uses math as a tool not as a requirement to play.  I happen to like math so I never had to use the displayed possible solutions very often but I admit there were times when it saved me a headache and the game doesn't make you feel bad about it, it displays this for every tile you hover over on purpose so you don't have to feel the pressure of MATH.\n\nOverall a fun casual puzzle game that combines simple math, 'sudoku' style numberplay, and logical processes of elimination.

But beyond that:\n\n- Sudoku always subdivides the board into 9 equal squares.  SquareLogic subdivides the board in all sorts of crazy ways.  (And sometimes it doesn't even tell you where all the boundaries are.)\n\n- In Sudoku, each subdivision contains one of each number.  In SquareLogic, a subdivision has some rule about its contents, but there are many possible rules.  The contents may add to some total, or all be odd numbers, or have some ordering...\n\nThis sounds brain-exploding, but a nifty thing about SquareLogic is that it provides in-game tools for figuring out the possibilities.

The game consists of a sequence of small puzzles involving balls bouncing around the screen. The goal is to place the barriers in such a way that a ball gets into the exit. The puzzles range from easy to appropriately challenging, with 51 puzzles in the main game and 12 bonus challenges. New concepts are introduced slowly and build on previous concepts, allowing you to master one thing at a time. Completing the game takes a few hours in total, and overall the puzzles are medium difficulty.\n\nWhat really stands out, however, is the use of music and rhythm. Every puzzle mechanic is synchronized with the music: at the basic level the balls are created once every 8 beats, playing a tone, and then as they interact with the objects you place they produce tones and variations in the music. It is hard to describe why, but this really completes the game experience. In effect, you are solving the puzzle and composing a rhythmic music pattern at the same time.\n\nThe levels are color-coded -- most mechanics are specific to a certain color, and each color has its own music track and tones. This way the music does not get monotonous and continues to be satisfying. I also appreciated that the bonus levels were gimmicky and fun, rather than trying to be too difficult or complicated.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Micron. The puzzle design is good, but the musical synchronization makes it a unique gem.", "timestamp_created": 1501119482, "timestamp_updated": 1509293856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33705610": {"recommendationid": "33705610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356141989", "num_games_owned": 758, "num_reviews": 253, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513369638}, "language": "english", "review": "Puzzle/timing at its finest.

Guide at least one micron to the final exit, to complete each level while listening to the effect your placements have on the music. \n\nThis game was quite fun. New mechanics are introduced from time to time, and they have you master those before bringing in a new mechanic. When your microns 'hit' objects, they produce a sound effect that meshes directly into the background music. Musically inclined players will get hints in the harder levels if they are on the right track as the effects will confirm their ideas with proper inclusion in the background music. \n\nSound: The background music is very relaxing and is conducive to puzzle solving. Combined with the sound effects as your actions affect the microns, it's a very well done auditory experience. \n\nGraphics: Simple and elegant. Nothing overly elaborate, but again, unneeded for this type of game. Colorblindness was not an issue for me with the red/green in the game, so they must have been far enough apart. \n\nGameplay: Simplistic and easy, when using the mouse. I tried with the controller which it supports but the d-pad movement is too fast, and the analog is a bit slippery. Could be my controller. Keyboard mouse was much easier for this. Difficulty doesn't scale too quickly and you have 51 primary levels to beat. Beat those and there are an additional 12 levels to bang your head against.... while enjoying the music. \n\nOverall: 7.3/10 - If you like puzzle/logic games, this is a definite must have. Challenging in the later levels, and may take a few tries to really get it, but you will get there eventually. Price tag of $5 isn't too bad for what it is. Personally I like discounts and this has been in several bundles. Will likely reappear in one, so if you see it there, be sure to grab it. Or just pay for it.

However, Micron stands apart in a couple of ways:\n\n1. It doesn't get stupidly hard (see caveat below)\n2. It doesn't go on longer than it should\n3. Each level doesn't take too long to complete\n\nMost games of this time get to a point, and it's clear the developer's been holding back some painfully hard levels, and has run out of 'ramp up' levels, and all of a sudden drops you off a cliff.  You're sitting there looking a level thinking \"The last level took me 2 minutes, and I've been staring at this for more than 20. What happened?\" (I'm looking at you P.B. Winterbottom amongst others). This doesn't happen in Micron... The levels are iteratively harder, and many of the 'nice interlude' levels (as I think of them) give you a strong hint as to what the twist in the upcoming level is going to be, while being pretty easy in themselves.\n\nThere are some strategies you learn, and sometimes you just look at a level, the selection of pieces and it all just clicks.\n\nOkay, here comes the caveat. There are a couple of levels which require you to do something a tad differently to the levels around them: Bonus 9 comes to mind.   For those, there was no choice but to go have a look at a hint.  Every permutation I tried just wouldn't work.  In those cases, it's usually because you need to do something with precision timing, and Ijust hadn't experimented enough.\n\nI like the little tricks it plays with your assumptions on colours, and the ways it makes you think about stretching 'flight time' to synchronise events.\n\nThe game would have only taken me one evening to finish, if I'd played it in one sitting.  All in all, I think about 3 hours of playtime, which was perfect.   \n\nFor a quid or two, a nice little puzzler, perfect for a plane flight, train ride, or just whiling away a little time with a cup of tea.", "timestamp_created": 1453245613, "timestamp_updated": 1453245776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20576276": {"recommendationid": "20576276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025692854", "num_games_owned": 1662, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453002438}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little puzzler, although in later stages a little obtuse.", "timestamp_created": 1453002481, "timestamp_updated": 1453002481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20503148": {"recommendationid": "20503148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031885618", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452795240}, "language": "french", "review": "Un concept simple mais bien exploit\u00e9, on se prend vite au jeu.", "timestamp_created": 1452683844, "timestamp_updated": 1452683844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20422574": {"recommendationid": "20422574", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980514994", "num_games_owned": 710, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452369435}, "language": "english", "review": "Relaxing, enjoyable and rewarding.

The puzzles are never really actually that hugely difficult, there were a few that caused me a couple or so more minutes of thinking to solve, but there were only a few of these within a total of 63 levels (including the bonus levels). \n\nYour actual goal is basically guiding these different colored balls towards the goal of the level by placing down varying types of barriers that will, depending on their direction and orientation, bounce them in a different direction. More and more obstacles will eventually be added throughout the game the more levels you complete, like colored lasers that won't let any differently colored balls through. \n\nAdditionally, in various levels, you actually gain the ability to place portals to further influence your control on these various balls. While some of the latter levels are definitely far more complex than the early ones, I doubt a guide would be needed for most of the levels. Personally, for me, all of the main and bonus levels took me about an hour and a half in total to complete. While that's relatively a short amount of time, I enjoyed the puzzles, liked the look of the game, and especially enjoyed the music. Additionally, there are also Steam Workshop levels if one still wants to play Micron after they finish all the original levels. \n\nUltimately, Micron is a rather enjoyable although not frustratingly hard musical somewhat short puzzle game that I would say if puzzle games are your thing, is worth the five dollar price as long as you're fine that it's somewhat on the short side.

At its best, this system provided some gorgeously atmospheric soundscapes with sweetly tinging xylophones and triangles mixing with bass and drums or sometimes, just the gentle sound of rain. \n\nIt will take fourteen years for me to finish.\n", "timestamp_created": 1441976026, "timestamp_updated": 1441976026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17900942": {"recommendationid": "17900942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079551304", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444691342}, "language": "english", "review": "Challenging and entertaining puzzles (:", "timestamp_created": 1441487710, "timestamp_updated": 1441487710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17582123": {"recommendationid": "17582123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007817556", "num_games_owned": 1326, "num_reviews": 264, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483364920}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is great until near the end where you have to have genius level intellect in order to solve the puzzles.

However, the last few levels are pretty difficult and the bonus levels are extremely challenging to the point of frustration because you might find yourself trying to come up with a solution for hours and you simply can\u2019t find any. For those that want to obtain all the achievements in this game, this might be a bit annoying unless they resort to consulting a guide.\n\nAlso be warned that some of these puzzles are timed; you need to coordinate to the second the timing of placing the special blockers on the board. This again requires a lot of trial and error.\n\nI\u2019ve also tried a few levels from the workshop and they\u2019re nice and enjoyable; I appreciated that the game automatically downloads the workshop items that I\u2019ve subscribed to, without needing a restart.\n\n[quote]More reviews on the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/lillyscorner/curation]Lilly's Corner Curator page[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1426104048, "timestamp_updated": 1453061067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711758", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14802700": {"recommendationid": "14802700", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963550511", "num_games_owned": 9005, "num_reviews": 251, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425871493}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent enough puzzly game.

I would consider it purely average, providing good gameplay with fair polish, but treading familiar ground.\n\nI was expecting some rhythm elements, but they really don't exist. Each level has sounds associated with bullet reflections, which helps to generate the music. Nothing is really based on moving to the beat, and some puzzles require actions between the beats. Most levels don't require speed, but a few require timed actions to catch bullets at the right time. The difficulty curve varied widely due to these timing-based levels, forcing several restarts to complete. Still, the game is quite easy.\n\nThe music is fair, but is not a real gameplay element. Most levels are short and can only be solved in a certain way, so replayability only comes from Workshop levels. Puzzles were interesting but not hugely satisfying. Later levels became more frustrating, as one mistake meant a full restart. Once levels feature over 10 objects, I was wanting an Undo button instead of a full restart. Granted, it didn't take long, but the short game length could mean that 20% of your time is spent restarting and rebuilding levels.\n\nMicron didn't do anything bad, but didn't inspire me much. It's a decent game at a fair price, a nice way to spend a few hours but not really compelling you to challenge your mind. I would recommend a sale above 50%, below $2.50 USD is a good time-value.

With its simplistic design and musical sound effects I found it quite enjoyable and would highly recommend it.  The concept is simple.  Balls are shot from an opening and you must place angles and or portals to get it to open doors and get them to the end.  The difficulty is you must put them in the proper spot at the proper time to achieve your goal.\n\n    It is a great game for all ages however those under ten may need help to finish it unless they are unusually patient.  A great game to play with your children though.  Get their little problem solving wheels turning!  The game has some difficult levels but not overly so in my opinion.  I did however cheat on one of the bonus levels and look for the answer elsewhere.\n\n    There are a number of free levels for download in the steam workshop as well.  Just subscribe to them and they will be downloaded the next time you start the game.\n\n    I did not find any bugs and was not able to complete any level using less than the full complement of pieces provided.   Note: This is edited because I could not find the level editor. I did find the level editor it is in your steam files.\n\nIn my opinon it would be worth the full price of $4.99 or even better to purchase it on sale!

I accidentally left the game running for two days, so my real playtime is probably around 3-4 hours.\n\nMicron is a puzzle game where the goal is to guide streams of bullets towards the exit by placing pieces that the bullets can bounce off of. It's a very simple concept that is immediately understandable, but it turns out that some very interesting puzzles can be created with it.\n\nA number of obstacles present in the levels create the challenge of the game. Present in every level is a barrier that requires four bullets shots to destroy. These do not make much of a difference in the early levels, but create much of the challenge in the later levels where you are forced to cut off the source of your bullets in order to complete the level.\nGates which are initially closed also appear, and they must be opened by a bullet hitting the correspondingly colored switch. In levels with multiple switches of the same color, bullets must hit the similarly colored switches at the same time in order for the gate to open. Finally, there are barriers which only bullets of the same color can pass through.\n\nLater on in the game, portals which the bullets can travel through are introduced. These are a nice addition that add further complexity to the game, but they also make you wonder whether there is anything else that could be added to the game, as they are the only pieces you can place that aren't ones that the bullets bounce off of. Why not have a \"vortex\" piece that always makes a bullet turn left or right? How about a \"splitter\" piece that duplicates a bullet? There is a lot of potential for the concept of this game, and I feel that it is not always realized fully.\n\nThe game is also rather short, with only 51 main levels and 12 bonus levels. Most of these are easy and can be solved within a few minutes, although a select few of the later levels are quite difficult. Steam Workshop support helps alleviate this a bit, but currently there are not many user levels available.\n\nDespite this, for $4.99 ($1.49 in the current holiday sale), the game is cheap enough to warrant a purchase for any puzzle game fan interested.

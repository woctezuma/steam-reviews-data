Vanilla IC is unbalanced as all heck. Tellurian is amazingly balanced and [i]still[/i] being updated.\n\nThis game is perhaps the oddest RTS I\u2019ve ever seen. The defining feature of IC is that you can [i]create your own units[/i]. In the singleplayer campaign you can edit units on the fly but in skirmish and MP battles you have to pick an \u201carmy\u201d consisting of nine units \u2013 which isn\u2019t enough to cover all the roles that you can make, so you have to do some prioritising.\n\nThe unit creation consists of combining one creature with another and selecting which bodypart of which you want for the stats. You can\u2019t combine three creatures, only two. But there\u2019s more to this than just raw statistics \u2013 there are also quite a lot of special abilities. Some of these are passive (e.g. Horns, which reduces enemy defense, Poison Tip, which reduces enemy attack\u2026), and some are triggered (e.g. Stink Cloud, Infest, Electric Burst\u2026). These special abilities are not OP enough to mean that they\u2019re how the game is run, but they\u2019re also not so weak such that they\u2019re not worth it.\n\nSome nuances of the creature editor: [list]\n[*]Combining a Size 1 with a Size 5 animal will always result in a Size 5 animal \u2013 even if you have no bodyparts of the Size 5 animal.\n[*]Stats scale based on size so that\u2019s why a giant porcupine is more deadly (& more expensive) than a small porcupine\n[*] Combining two ranged attacks does nothing but combining two melee attacks means they stack \u2013 10 melee head damage + 10 melee tail damage = 20 damage total\n[*]The creature\u2019s overall strength determines its tier level[/list]\n\nNow, I mentioned the Tellurian mod. I only got IC about a year ago, where Tellurian (usually just called \u201cTel\u201d) had been the norm for quite some time. It was still being edited, adding a couple more creatures, adjusting existing ones, and upping the tier times considerably. Before Tellurian came out this game had been played [i]to death[/i] by those that stuck with it (the game was released in 2003) and as such the optimal combination for [i]everything[/i] was known.  As well as how stupidly OP some things were (lobsters, anti-air towers, hovering spam, barrier destroy, the really low Tier V upgrade cost...) Now that Tellurian\u2019s come along with new stuff there\u2019s new strats to try, new creatures to combine, and generally new things to do.\n\nOh, and Tellurian was nearly included with the Steam version by default. The reason it wasn\u2019t is because this would make it more difficult to update (source: lost to time so not [b]that[/b] reliable, but hey \u2013 it is very balanced and pretty much nobody plays without it)\n\nAs was said, for MP battles / non-campaign SP you can pick nine creatures to run with. Or swim with, or fly with \u2013 this RTS is one of the few to have a functional flying class. In fact, it has the oddest classing system I\u2019ve ever seen:[list]\n[*]Melee \n[*]Ranged \u2013 beats Melee and Fliers\n[*]Artillery \u2013 attacks with an area of effect, beats ranged\n[*]Sonic \u2013 beats anything bunched\n[*]Fliers \u2013 can only be attacked by ranged or artillery units[list]\n[*]Melee Fliers\n[*]Ranged Fliers \u2013 generally not worth it as they\u2019re more expensive\n[*]Artillery Fliers \u2013 somewhat broken as they counter ranged units which counter them so it becomes a spam-war[/list]\n[*]Amphibious combinations of any of the above[/list]\nAnd then of course you can start putting on special abilities \u2013 eg fliers with Electric Burst, such that you run in with ten crummy HP units and click Burst right above all the enemy henchemen! Or melee with Stink Cloud such that you can\u2019t be shot at with ranged units. There\u2019s also two types of stealth so you can use those too (upon attacking they become visible for ten seconds, so a lack of stealth detection isn\u2019t a disaster)\n\nMore ways in which this is a thoroughly odd RTS:[list]\n[*]One resource is solely generated (Electricity) and the other resource is solely mined (Coal), and the mined resource has a maximum rate per coal pile at which it can be mined (the recommended is 2 henchmen per coal pile)\n[*]Units train extraordinarily quickly \u2013 as such a game that goes on for an hour is quite long.\n[*]Rushing in Tier II (with Tel) is balanced\n[*]Tier II / Tier III units are thoroughly useless lategame unless they have some useful special ability. Unlike, say, AOE2, when you can upgrade Militia through to Champions, you can only get some generic \u201cincreased HP/attack/line of sight/etc\u201d upgrades and as such you\u2019ll just ignore your T2 / T3 units when you\u2019re in Tier V (the final tier).\n[*]The equivalent of your \u201cTown Center\u201d is your lab. You cannot build a second lab and if it is destroyed you are out of the game (fortunately it has pretty high HP as well as some special abilities of its own).\n[*]Defensive towers are pretty trash for their price (though the standard tower does have stealth detection\u2026)\n[*]Walls are [i]extremely[/i] trash and barely worth the micro to build (heck, there aren\u2019t even any gates!) [/list]\n\nOn the whole this game is about map control \u2013 securing the bonus coal piles for a faster gather rate, holding Geysers for more electricity, whacking your opponent\u2019s expansions, etc. It\u2019s not so much about individual unit-to-unit fighting \u2013 instead, it\u2019s about fighting for control of the map. If your enemy holds two thirds of the map and you hold one third he will be able to train twice the creatures you can \u2013 granted, with some clever micro and cunning unit selection & strats you can still survive or even win.\n\n\nAnyway, enough on the actual game and now what I think of it. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s one half of the RTS I\u2019ve dreamed about. (The other half is Medieval II: Total War, where you take a Grand Campaign and fight [i]all[/i] the battles (if you like) in an RTS fashion.) Impossible Creatures is extremely unique. I\u2019ve never seen any other RTS in which you can create your own units and as outlined above the uniqueness of IC doesn\u2019t stop there. The campaign is [i]extremely[/i] clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s not bad level design (most of the time), a good introduction into IC, and worth playing no more than twice. The AI is okay but not great & has some abuse tricks of its own (though the only reason it\u2019s a challenge is because on Hard and Expert it just cheats in bucketloads of resources). \n\nThe multiplayer community is very much alive and kicking. Not frequent, and if you enter the lobby randomly the chance is about 60% that there will be no-one else there. But they\u2019re still around and most of the organisation happens on their Discord (just make a post on the forum discussions asking \u201cwhere\u2019s the MP community at.\u201d) On the whole they\u2019re all pretty nice people, despite their tendency to spam \u201cxddddddd\u201d \u2013 funny that, the smaller the community [i]usually[/i] the nicer it is. Certainly they\u2019re helpful and prompt with their tech support (which 50% of the time is \u201cread the FAQ\u201d xddddd).\n\nThis game certainly isn\u2019t for everyone \u2013 if you\u2019re up for a more traditional RTS go get AOE2 retail (not HD, that\u2019s a mess) but the unit creation is both a novel and interesting idea that has been very well balanced in Tellurian. But it\u2019s certainly for me :D \n\n\n[i]One[/i] last word: there\u2019s not much of a reason to get the Steam edition when you can get [url=https://www.gog.com/game/impossible_creatures]the GOG version[/url]. The Steam edition has workshop support (but you can install mods manually) and standard Steamworks functionality, but the GOG version has famously no DRM so you can run a LAN party on all your machines at once. Oh, and this is one of the games that basically goes on a 75% off sale whenever due to being so old so you can snaffle it when it\u2019s cheap on both GOG and Steam and get the best of both worlds.", "timestamp_created": 1503958868, "timestamp_updated": 1503958868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765043", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34556950": {"recommendationid": "34556950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186298547", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506258529}, "language": "english", "review": "game sucks but graphics are 10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1503938073, "timestamp_updated": 1503938073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.358016", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34399478": {"recommendationid": "34399478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135362867", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507508405}, "language": "english", "review": "gg", "timestamp_created": 1503337155, "timestamp_updated": 1503337155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.377684", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34369607": {"recommendationid": "34369607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054473726", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456693157}, "language": "french", "review": "jeu plut\u00f4t cool", "timestamp_created": 1503222625, "timestamp_updated": 1503222625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492198", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34298088": {"recommendationid": "34298088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315981069", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508527932}, "language": "english", "review": "can anyone start a server im bored against ai\nto hard\n", "timestamp_created": 1502935766, "timestamp_updated": 1502935766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.405393", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34133537": {"recommendationid": "34133537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289422690", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 45426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1642, "last_played": 1514468820}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game i have ever earned, played it on Cd, played it on Steam, ive learned soo much, and my armies have gotten better.

The workers voice lines can be very obnoxious so I'd reccomend turning them down so that it doesnt detract from what this game does really great.\n\nI would compare the in-match gameplay to be similar to Warcraft or Starcraft, but definately a lot less complex as there's only one faction with an average number of different buildings that can be placed (About 14) and a max of 9 unit types for each army. The complexity in the game mostly come from the building of that 9 unit army, as there's TONS of different unit variations that actually make huge impacts on the gameplay. The game actually has a huge ammount of depth through this system and it inspires a lot of creativity. \n\nI've only encountered a few graphical bugs in the army creator that hurt nothing and one cumbersome issue.

I suppose the first thing I should say is that I own a hard copy of the original game, bought during 2001 or so. I can't really remember why I wanted the game as I was just a kid; I guess I saw some really weird creatures on the front and thought \"I want to play that game\". Probably one of the best gut decisions I've ever made in regards to video games. I used to play this constantly as a kid, and even after growing up I'd still take a few hours here and there testing a new combination or playing a match. It wasn't until last year that I stopped due to my new computer not being able to play IC after an update. Fast forward to the end of the year and I, a new Steam user, happened to stumble upon this game once more.\nImpossible Creatures is, as the Steam tags say, a RTS game through and through. However, it's a bit more complicated than that. As most of the game's page will point out, the units you control are all from your own design. Want a flying elephant? Just mix it with an owl. That not working out? Why not switch the elephant with a sperm whale? There 30-40+ animals for you to mix in match in this RTS to make the perfect 9 unit army. And if the base animal count isn't enough for you, there's plenty of mods out there for you to try and plenty of people to try these new creatures out on. Surprisingly, there's a lot of people still playing this game despite it being well over 10 years old, and thanks to Steam having a working online server, multiplayer battles are possible. Battles are pretty fluid, though perhaps a bit simple with more or less \"throw your units in certain directions\", but there's many ways to make a battle more interesting. If I were to summarize the game in general in 3 words, they'd be: simple, fun, and imaginative.\nSo I've been saying a lot of good about the game, but what's bad you might be asking. Well...not a lot, to be honest. The graphics are a bit dated (though they should be, this is an old game) but they don't look terribly bad. There's not much for solo play, but there is a single player mode and the base game has a short story mode which is nice. Also the units are a bit prone to lagging out (like they will take long pauses before doing something) if you have a lot of units in the world, but that's only in more extreme situations. Probably the biggest turn-off about the game is that not every unit is made equal; certain combinations are obviously better than others, but to an extent that makes sense. That isn't to say some unique combinations won't get you far and that tactics don't mean anything, but having certain combinations will definitely present you with an edge to the fight.\nSo what do I think about it? Certainly, it's a unique game in the RTS genre and certainly worth its price of $10. I recommend it to everyone. It's simple to pick-up and play, but you're really only limited in your ability to think up a creative way to solve a problem. And trust me there's many ways to solve problems here. This is a great game, and I (maybe foolishly) hope for the day I see Impossible Creatures 2 in development.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, I also forgot. This game comes with a side component called \"Mission Editor\" (referred to as Impossible Creature Editor on Steam). What does this do? It allows you to make your own maps for your playing pleasure! And it's a surprisingly modern world editor for being 15+ years old. Everything molds smoothly (well, unless you literally make a pointed mountain), objects are well organized, various methods to edit the terrain aside from standard increase/decrease/smoothing tools...it's really good! The only thing I don't like about it is that you have to paint cliffs...no seriously, if you make a mountain, you need to put on mountain side textures to make it look different than the rest of the terrain (that said, I'm lazy so I don't want to do that).\n\nSo let's review; with this game, you get: a pretty good standalone RTS game with a unique feature (which is dated mind you, but still really good), a map editor for free for said game, free DLC automatically downloaded into the game, additional user-made \"DLC\" on Steam or online, online multiplayer...There's not much bad! And for $10 (and this edit was made when there was a sale, so that $10 is even lower!)! One note of caution though, this is a RTS game and thus suffers from standard RTS problems (some things are always better than othersfor example), but the unique \"build-your-team\" element more than makes up for that if you learn and understand how to counter certain units. That said, once again, this is a game well worth it's price.", "timestamp_created": 1495676789, "timestamp_updated": 1499470647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702338", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31895468": {"recommendationid": "31895468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034390498", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452467126}, "language": "english", "review": "THE CRITTERS ARE UNDER ATTACK!", "timestamp_created": 1495426408, "timestamp_updated": 1495426408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31887772": {"recommendationid": "31887772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249012724", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511112802}, "language": "english", "review": "BEST GAME EVER \n", "timestamp_created": 1495389305, "timestamp_updated": 1495389305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474510", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31798859": {"recommendationid": "31798859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312785420", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511253294}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is so much fun but impossibly difficuly recomended if you like a challenge!", "timestamp_created": 1494995361, "timestamp_updated": 1494995361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31788681": {"recommendationid": "31788681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302513766", "num_games_owned": 1538, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495123231}, "language": "english", "review": "Very.

Generals provided a different way of playing RTS with less foucs on micromanagement and more focus on pummping out troops and getting into the actions asap.....\n\nImpossible Creatures follows this formula but with a twist! Frankensteining 2 creatures into a new unit! Want to mix a Elephant with a Ant? DONE! Want to mix a Praying Mantis with a Coyote? DONE! The list goes on and on! \n\nThis unique feature to the game gives the player hundreds of thousands of combinations that will customise your strategy and give you total freedom on how you want to play the game! \n\nCombining two creatures doesnt just enhance the looks of the unit, but planning is also required as each creature has its own unique stats. Being able to replace certain parts of a unit can enhance a specific stat. Size in this game doesnt matter! Even the smaller, cheaper units has their place in battle! Ive played around in the Army Builder portion of the game and it gives you the felxibility to create your units ahead of time and save them to play at a later date.\n The options are endless and I have already went back several times to retweak or replace units to give my ever changing strategy a boost or the ability to run with a new strategy.....If you think combining two of the best units in game will give you the advantage....think again! Everything is balanced to a way that even cheaper units can get the jump on tougher units as well.....you pay one way or the other when trying to make super units or just trying to invade with cheaper units....a balance is required and gives you the freedom to make those balances yourself!\n\nThe only drawbacks I can see with this game atm is it needs a serious remaster done to it! The game is absolutely fun and unique if you are a RTS fan....and even if you arent, it can easily draw in those with a more creative style of play.\nThe other is multiplayer based games. But, There is a Impossible Creatures Online group you can join herein Steam to get matches going. Its a pretty good size community and with lots of helpful players. \nI havent yet touched the Campaign portion of the game, I hear it maybe a little weak but still fun.\n\nAll in all, it was the best $10 I had spent on Steam thus far!

It's in line with other RTS' like Age of Mythology, so if that's your thing, then you're guaranteed to have at least a little bit of fun with this game (since so many RTS' are so alike). \n\nPros\n-----\n\n- Graphics are charming despite being dated.\n- Game runs perfectly fine on low end PC's.\n- Music sounds fine (RTS' aren't exactly known for their soundtracks anyways). \n- Making your own units is fun and done in an amusing way. Unique for the RTS genre. \n- Workshop adds some fun to the game. \n- Amusing campaign and such.\n- Voice overs for the characters are nice. \n- Seemingly a good while of content to keep you amused. \n\nCons\n------\n\n- Dated graphics (hardly a con). \n- Workshop quite literally only has one popular mod. \n- Failing a mission means you have to restart, which is tedious for 30 minute missions.\n\nOverall the game is really nice for a cheap sale purchase. The one problem though is the unit customization, which is a shame when it's the selling point of the game. While cool, it feels a bit stale. You tend to combine similar groups of animals and/or class types (tank, scout, offensive types) together all the time. It works by combining certain swappable parts of animals together which in turn provides you effects (kick attack for legs versus claw attack for clawed arms) or abilities based on the used parts of the certain animals. The problem lies in the fact that you're basically using 90% of one animal but only 10% of the other, as opposed to a 50/50 split to produce something crazy. If you need a fast creature, you're probably going to combine two fast creatures with slight differences together to try to make the most optimal fast creature. Combining anything else may give you another ability to use, but the stats on the animal will be weakly split in to two countering stats, which feels worse than just having that \"super fast cheetah / wolf mix that deals more damage while still being super fast.\" For example, you could combine that cheetah with that wolf to give it more damage while still being super fast, or you could combine that cheetah with that skunk to gain the skunk ability, but at the cost of all of the good stats either of them may/may not have, which feels worse than the optimal cheetah / wolf mix. \n\nThat all being said, the game's fine.

You can mix any two creatures that are in the game, choose which parts of which you want to incorporate, and then send it into battle. Different creatures and in-turn different parts of creatures will have different costs. In the campaign you can design them on-the-fly, but in multiplayer you need to design your army beforehand, so having multiple sitting around is handy for properly expecting every map.\n\nPros:\n\nSolid gameplay.\n\nPrice isn't bad at all.\n\nMod support, even if the workshop integration is very finicky.\n\n\nCons:\n\nSteam port is a little buggy, especially around the workshop.\n\nThis game was made in 2003, it just simply isn't going to stack up to modern games in terms of graphics.\n\nThe availability of creatures is misleading, at least aesthetically. While you have a lot of animals to choose from, and it does in fact allow you to create very diverse armys, most of them look similar. By this I mean there probably almost a dozen big cat species, why. And almost every creature is a quadruped, excluding arthropods and snakes.

I've been playing it since it was first released, but there's plenty more to it than nostalgia.\n\nPros:\n-Creature Customization: You can design a completely distinct army of up to nine combined creatures. These creatures can range from high-level tanks to flying units to fully aquatic units. The only limit to army design is your own creativity.\n-Graphics: Even though the game released in the early 2000s the graphics still hold up reasonably well to this day. Yeah some of the designs may be blocky and the textures can look awkward, but considering the time it was made the graphics are pretty good.\n-Balanced Combat: Unless you or your opponent have a very OP creature, combat is pretty balanced. You just have to be strategic in how you play the game.\n\nMixed:\n-Campaign Play: The campaign story in the game is something I personally enjoy because of the nostalgia but it could be off-putting to some people. The characters are all interesting and the villains are intimidating (Dr. Ganglion comes to mind right away), but the campaign is very short, you can easily get through it in a few hours if you know what you're doing and the payoff at the end isn't as exciting as it was built up to be.\n-Resource Management: The two resources in the game can be tricky to manage properly. Electricity is unlimited provided you have enough generators/lightening rods, but coal is finite and during the campaign once all the coal is used up there's no way to get any more. You can exchange electricity for coal in freeplay, but that still won't make up for mining. Resource attrition can be a useful strategy while playing but it can also be a huge annoyance.\n-High Level Research and Creatures: Going along with the resource management issue is the problem of high-level resorces and creatures. While it's very useful it can easily drain you of coal and electricity. High-level creatures can easily drain your resources as well, a sperm whale x any level III or higher land animal will cost over 500 coal.", "timestamp_created": 1479941866, "timestamp_updated": 1479941866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26928657": {"recommendationid": "26928657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009026881", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448356906}, "language": "english", "review": "Old and always amazing... without a doubt always my number one wish for a remake or sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1479941119, "timestamp_updated": 1479941119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26844837": {"recommendationid": "26844837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112986842", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503595426}, "language": "english", "review": "When you get an rts, animals and you can mix them you get that.

Es increiblemente facil de aprender (Solo hay 2 recursos que recojer y todos tienen las mismas mejoras y edificios), pero muy dificil de dominar (cada uno tendra un ejercito propio con habilidades muy diversas)\n\nLa creacion de animales es facil de usar, se basa en juntar 3 o mas partes (dependiendo del animal) de 2 animales, y dependiendo de la parte que sea esto cambiara el costo del animal,su forma de atacar (mordiendo, lanzando veneno...) ,sus habilidades (cavar, regenaraci\u00f3n, camuflage, lanza telara\u00f1as...) y su forma de desplazamiento. Cada ejercito tiene 9 criaturas.\nLos animales se ordenan en edades del 1 al 5 dependiedo de su fuerza,cuando juegas empiezas en el primer nivel cuanto mas rapido subas de nivel antes podras usar las criaturas tochas. La cantidad de posibilidades que ofrece el editor de criaturas es impresionante, y puedes tener incluso mas si le instalas mods.\n\nIC tiene 3 modos de juego:\n-Historia: Una campa\u00f1a de 15 misiones con una historia interesante y llena de humor, en este modo empezaras sin animales y tendras que conseguirlos disparandoles dardos a animales salvajes para obtener su ADN. Cada vez que consigas el ADN de un animal nuevo te explicaran las mejores formas de combinarlo, cosa que biene muy bien. La campa\u00f1a en general me a gustado pero tiene un par de cosas malas. Si la IA o tu os quedais sin carbon sera imposible avanzar y que en algunos mapas. Avanzar en un par de niveles se vuelve muy tedioso por la forma en la que esta hecho.\n-Escaramuza: Elige un mapa,ejercito, IA o IAs enemigas,dificultad, modificalo la partida, y a destruir el laboratorio del enemigo. Hay muchos mapas y se puede jugar por equipos. La IA no es lo mejorcito, pero aun cumple. \n-Multijugador: Igual que el modo escaramuza pero ademas de con bots, con jugadores online, si juegas solo con gente puedes jugar a 2 modos de juego mas. Estos son: destruir todo lo que tenga el enemigo y cazar a Rex. En el modo cazar a Rex cada jugador tendra a Rex Chance como unidad que se regenera, envenena y dispara dardos y tiene que acabar con el rex enemigo.\n\nEl juego tamb\u00e9n incluye un editor de mapas para acerte mapas para cualquier modo y otro editor para crear mods principalmente animales nuevos, aunque esta herramienta es mucho mas dificiles de usar.\n\nEn muchas partidas te acaba sobrando mucha electricidad y apenas te queda carbon, pero eso se soluciona con la expansi\u00f3n Insect Invasion (que viene incluida), no tiene campa\u00f1a pero mejora mucho el modo multijugador y escaramuza, con nuevos animales,nuevas tecnologias, nuevos mapas y mas usos de la electricidad, como transformarla en carbon o activar un modo de fuego especial en la torreta.\n\nEl modo historia esta bien, pero el modo multijugador y escaramuza seran a las que mas horas jueges. La cantidad de estrategias que puedes hacer es alucinante.\n\nLa version de steam viene con multijugador funcional, soporte para ordenadores modernos, la expansion, workshop, steam cloud y unas cuantas guias y entrevistas dentro de los archivos del juego.\n\nTambi\u00e9n cabe destacar que el juego tiene un peque\u00f1o toque de humor que se agradece, entre las voces de los humanos y ver a Elefantesara\u00f1a peleandose con Tiburonesvoladores.\n\nLa musica del juego depende de el mapa en el que estes jugando (selva , hielo, pantando) y de el estado de la partida, si te atacan la musica cambiara a un tema mucho mas fuerte y animado, y si no pasa nada, cambiara a un tono mas relajado. Ademas de que la musica del menu es una obra maestra.\n\nNo todo es perfecto, tiene algun que otro error:\n-Lo que e mencionado antes de la campa\u00f1a, si te quedas sin carb\u00f3n es muy dificil hacer nada\n-La IA cumple pero puede volverse algo predecible\n-Algunas combinaciones de animales son mucho mas buenas que otras, osea algun desbalanceo.\n-Se echa de menos algun modo de juego extra a la hora de jugar el multijugador\n-El numero de unidades maximo es algo bajo, solo puedes tener 75 unidades a la vez.\n-Las alertas del juego cansan un poco, ya que hay muy pocas voces, oiras cientos de veces: !The creatures are under attack! \n\nA mi me a parecido un juegazo, una pena que lo conozca tan poca gente\n\nMi nota personal: Un 8,5\n\nPor ultimo me gustaria recomendar un mod de la comunidad llamado Tellurian http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=655968653 que usa la expansion insect invasion y a\u00f1ade nuevos mapas, sube el maximo de unidades a 250, a\u00f1ade nuevos animales y balancea mejor las criaturas.

I've not yet put many hours into the steam version, but Impossible Creatures featured in the better part of my childhood and this version still holds up toit's past self (as I remember it).  It's not the most unique game now or the one with the best plot, sure, but it is one in which experimenting, with the slightly odd to the somewhat disturbed, down right crazy is not only fun but productive.  I've spent many hours before assembling the wonkiest creatures I could and sending them out to fight (often to great effect) and I plan to do so again.\n\nSo far, from what I've seen, this version is exactly the same as before, which is great, except for a few minor details I'd hoped would be fixed, when I'd heard this game was out: \n\nFirst and most minor, the black picture, When taking pictures of your creations in the old IC, sometimes the thumbnails would turn out black, especially if you moved the camera.  This could be fixed by taking lots of pictures, but you might not get that neat post you'd wanted.  Now if anything, this aspect seems a little worse than I remember.\n\nSecond, connection drops.  Now, I haven't tried ICO yet (odd bit of trouble with that, did IP connection instead), but when playing, at any point, start to end, you risk being dropped.  Kinda annoying at the start, REALLY annoying if you're about to win (it's not the other player's fault, happens when we fight computers together too).\n\nThird, probably more a fault of my own than the creators.  Almost my games seem to come down to whoever get's the most coal fastest and overwhealms to enemy in one swift stroke, ending it quickly, or whoever runs out of coal last and picks off the remaining enemies dragging on and on.  It feels like there's no middle ground, no area control exchange, no games just long enough to comfortably slide into things but short enough not to get bored. \n\nThat being said, this game is still one of my favourites, and will continue to be.

Being able to create creatures by combining their positive adaptations within life, and ruleing out their cons, is fun; but commanding them to attack one another as if they were units of war, is a whole-nother story. Creatures can be created in the creature chamber and assigned to 'Armies' for use within battle. The Story is good, and the Characters have a good, vivid personality. Not into campaign? Well then Skirmish or Online (if its even still avaliable) are for you! Picking a map to fight on, send creations after anothers artocitys.

The game crashed once in the first hour (I never had it crash while playing the disc version for thousands of hours).  The unit icons in game often came up as completely black, which makes it difficult to see which unit you are creating and undercuts the point of a thought-based strategy game.  Furthermore, during the sixth mission the endgame trigger did not occur after completing all objectives.  Had to restart the entire mission.  All of this happened in not even two hours played (yes I got through that many missions in two hours because I'm a boss).  I expect there will be more glitches if I continue.  I asked for a refund.  These are not HUGE problems, and you will still be able to experience this fantastic game.  But this is clearly a sloppy port designed for quick profit and I refuse to support a publisher who does this.\n\nI will keep looking for updates and will change my review if the developer fixes these issues.\n\nEDIT:  Developer seems to be aware of issues and is updating the game.  Most recent update was March 30, just a day ago.  One of the improvements is \"reduce the chance of glitch where game does not end after completing objectives.\"  Reduce?  How about fix?  Or how about not putting a game on Steam without having ironed out the bugs, especially if they are significant?\n\nEDIT:  November 27 - Still no more updates\n\nEDIT:  January 19 - Publisher seems to have abandoned this project.

Managing your resources to create these creatures is also important , as running out is sure fire to you losing. The game is centered around Rex Chance heading to a group of fictional islands in the South Pacific to find his missing father, Dr. Erik Chanikov. However, things take a turn for the worst when Rex meets Upton Julius, a wealthy madman who plans to use the Sigma Technology that Dr. Chanikov created to take over the world. Luckily, Rex meets Lucy Willing, Dr. Chanikov's right-hand assistant. Rex and Lucy work together to take down both Upton and his goons to find his father. As you play the campaign, you unlock more creatures, buildings, and abilities to use. (By abilities, I'm talking about the two main characters.) The game works around a level system. There are 5 levels, each one allows for stronger creatures than the last, and a few add buildings. Level 1 features basic creatures, while Level 5 can feature massive beasts to overwhelm the enemy. The game works extremely well, and they're even adding workshop support to allow hundreds of new maps and mods to be added to the game. At this point, Nordic said they might begin work on a sequel. Again, I recommend this game for all players, even if you don't like the RTS genre. It's a great place for beginners, and an amazing point for veterans. It's worth every penny put into it. I own the original disc copy from the old site Xplosion, but I'm glad this gem finally made it's way back.

The campaign may not be the most amazing thing ever but it adds an extra level in the army building. You actually have to find animals in the game and get DNA to unlock new animals.

So, in December '02 I got in touch with Dick Smith and managed to reserve a copy. My first pre order.\n\n[h1]AESTHETIC[/h1]\nWhen the game was released, we had to buy a new PC to run it because not only was it one of the very first games able to run on DX9, it [i]required[/i] it to run smoothly and look gorgeous. And when I say gorgeous, I'm not kidding. The game still holds up its art style today and looks better than some new Steam releases out there. Inject ENBSeries (you're best with San Andreas 0.73) into this and if you're up to it see if you can't enhance the textures with Photoshop [b]and good lord in heaven is it [i]beautiful[/i][/b]. The soundtrack in this helps to bring the mood of the game out and I could easily listen to it outside of playing the game. The in-game sound effects are not only fitting tothe game's theme but each provide absolute clarity to the function or state of a unit or structure, while the general foley heightens immersion. To top it off, the noir inspired cutscenes and voice acting are intentionally cheesy, to the point where the initially irritating \"The critters are under attack!\" soundbite becomes endearing. It's a very pretty game whose visual and aural design has stood the test of time. \n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nGameplay itself is also [i]surprisingly[/i] well maintained: There was and still is almost no sign of glitching, and anything that does occur is insignificant or caused by third party mods. I think I even enjoyed one glitch that occurs so much that I'd rather a player discover it for themselves: [spoiler]combining some creatures results in their running animation speed up to like ten times the original[/spoiler]. Instead of the standard of using an intricate resource system and combining it with a simplistic preset army, there are only two (easily interchangable) resources and the way a player uses them is defined by how their army is not only produced but initially built: there are previously made creatures from some of the example armies and campaign character armies but the best way to have fun with this game is dive head first into its main feature: the creation of a unit by combining two animals and choosing its specialisation by selecting which physical segment of each creature the resulting amalgam receives. Each animal has a set of internal stats, abilities and physical attacks associated with each segment. A player must be cautious: they must balance cost with offensive capability, special abilities and various key points. The game even has an army analyser to help players create units that will tough it out, hopefully to victory. One of the game's protags says it best: balance is the key to versatility, and versatility will allow you to be prepared for anything. Sadly, I do have to say that Relic did a [i]very[/i] poor job with balancing, or at least overlooked the side effects that combination would have on balance. In an RTS game, it's possibly one of the worst things to be caught off guard by. Luckily, most mods fix this issue with ease.\n\n[h1]CUSTOMISATION[/h1]\n[b]Good lord[/b]. It's a shame that the game's source code was never released [i](hint hint)[/i]because it made modding particularly frustrating, especially when it caused modders to be forced to retexture and reshape the wolf unit in Blender so not to have too few or too many polygons, disallowed the ability to customise map flags, made creating campaigns particularly tiresome, and as a result putting a chokehold on the limits of the modding scene. In spite of this, the modding community have really outdone themselves and in spirit of the original dev team's demonstartion of pushing the framework beyond what was expected delivered one of the greatest and fun showcase of mods out there: Creature Chaos, Shadow, [i]Tellurian[/i], hell, even Invasion Of The Killer Ants smooth out a number of areas where gameplay is lacking. I personally feel that the game's small but hardcore fanbase would not have survived as long as it has without people like Revan, Doggiedoodle, Delirium, Puglin, and so many more incredibly dedicated players behind the game, pushing it to its limits. I for one would greatly enjoy seeing Workshop integration to see what fresh ideas a wider audience can bring to the table.\n\n[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]\nThis game has stood the test of time. And for good reasons. I feel that had it not been for some unfortunate circumstances, it would be as recognised and celebrated as Age of Empires, Rise of Nations or Red Alert. It was and [i]still[/i] is worth the hundred bucks I paid for it almost thirteen years ago. I look forward to seeing it renewed by a fresh community, and wish for it to regrow above and beyond what it's ever been, because this game is simply one of the best Real Time Strategies available, and personally one of the best games I have ever played.\n\n[h1]FINAL RATING: [b]8.5/10[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1449132152, "timestamp_updated": 1449132250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773261", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19428372": {"recommendationid": "19428372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053703986", "num_games_owned": 544, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461827888}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0430\u0432\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c=)", "timestamp_created": 1449023947, "timestamp_updated": 1449023947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19422411": {"recommendationid": "19422411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053775618", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454696563}, "language": "english", "review": "I think that impossible creatures is very good game cause in the bathtube i dont play it but in the computer i do and then its really good i play it so much IC ftw.\nWhen I win in the bathtube its weird cuz i dont playin bathtube.

I used to play the original game a lot as a teenager.\n\nImpossible Creatures is an RTS created by Relic Entertainment, the same company that produced the Warhammer 40K Dawn of War games, and later Company of Heroes. The main Gimmick here, however, is Steampunk mad scientist shenanigans.\n\nEssentially, the game revolves around fusing different animals together (say a girrafe and a cobra, for example) to combine traits and strengths of different animals together. Each animal is put into a class from 1 to 5, one being least powerful, five being more powerful. The better and more powerful the animals are when they are combined, the higher class they become. However, you have to level up your base, and get new buildings in order to access level 5 animals, and the animals are also more resource intensive.\n\nThere is a campaign that slowly introduces the mechanics, while also telling a cheesy 1930's sci-fi story, but the meat of the game is the skirmish mode, single and multiplayer. When you start a game, you have to develop your army (or choose a prebuilt one) by combining two animals together, filling 9 slots, while balancing less powerful units with more powerful ones. From there, you play a fairly standard RTS game with resource gathering, micromanagement and battles. I'm not very good at RTS's so I can't comment on the AI, but I feel the gimmick and the gameplay is enough to make the game fun.\n\nSo yeah.

I truly believe this game had the potential to reach League of Legends and DOTA 2s caliber. It was an original RTS with online gameplay which players enjoyed tremendously. There are two major reasons the original release of this game failed.\n\n1.) The developer and published had a legal dispute over another situation. They never worked with each other again, although Impossible Creatures 2 was in development phase. Due to their falling out, everything about IC was put on hold. It was no longer updated nor maintained. Eventually the online server was taken down. The community had some amazing people in it. Many people worked together to keep the game alive. There are some people who developed amazing mods for the game. The mods balanced out the game, created new content, and kept people playing through Hamachi.\n\n2.) The game had limited advertising on release. They didn\u2019t advertise this game nearly enough. It had thousands of players to begin with, but it slowly died off without people being aware of its existence.\n\n  If you\u2019re looking for an incredibly fun multiplayer RTS game, with unlimited possibility for strategic gameplay and skill. Look no further. This game will test your mind with rough competition online.\n\nThese ratings are based on steam release, not the original release.\n\nBalance: 5 (Fixed with the proper mods)\nGraphics: 5\nMusic: 4\nCinematics: 7\nStory: 7\nContent: 5\nControls: 9\nGameplay: 10\n\n[b]Overall: 6.5[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1448205207, "timestamp_updated": 1448365001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545278", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19207762": {"recommendationid": "19207762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170175515", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510454419}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried to make an army full of lemming hybrids, they were so underpowered that it would take 20 of them to kill one of my enemy's creatures so I'm docking points away from that.

Not just saying that due to the nostalgia value of remembering when I was a wee laddy, peeking over my dad's desk watching him play this on his computer. No, unlike many other memories of my childhood, this game withstood the test of time and is actually [b]good[/b]. What makes it so good? It's main pull, gimmick, and attraction: combining creatures to make specific units with various abilities.\n\nThe pull of this game is its freeform army builder. The builder allows you to construct 9 units by mix-and-matching various body parts and pieces from two different animals to create a whole new unit. It's an incredible simple system that actually has quite a lot of meaning and strategy built in. Almost every part you swap; torso, head, front legs, back legs, etc, has some sort of statistical affect or grants a new ability. Simply changing one part can change the creature's role in a drastic way. And the best part? That creature's role is entirely up to you. You can make an army suited to your turtling playstyle. Or an army filled with fast, aggressive creatures designed for hit and run tactics. It's completely up to you.\n\nThe level of strategy in this game is deceptively deep. While on the outside someone might assume the game is fairly cut and dry; make creatures and throw 'em at each other, Impossible Creatures will surprise you with a hidden level of strategy. Where it differs from most RTS games is not only do you not know what your enemy might be doing, you dont even have a clue what his units even [i]are[/i]. Is he going to be using Stealth? Maybe burrowing? Does he have amphibious units? Are his creatures mainly melee? Or are they ranged? You may have built an army of massive powerhouses only to find that you forgot to give any of them Immunity. And sure enough, here comes your enemy with an army chock-full of poisonous beasties.\n\nThe campaign? It's not terrible, and I liked it, but some may not share the same sentiment. Impossible Creatures in general has a very diesel/steampunk feel to it which I absolutely adored and believe contributed to the game's unique success in a way. The game makes up for it with an engaging army builder that you can spend literal hours in making your army juuuuuust right, and a skirmish mode which you can face down bots and the like to practice your skills and test your army. With the Steam Version, Multiplayer is back and alive and from the few times I've been on, it seems to have a decent playerbase. Despite being made in the early 2000's, the game still looks very good.\n\nAll in all, for $10, it's completely worth it.

Se me han empa\u00f1ado los ojos al volver a oir la del men\u00fa, creo que se me ha metido algo dentro...\n\nLos controles no necesitan presentaci\u00f3n: bot\u00f3n izquierdo para seleccionar, bot\u00f3n izquierdo y arrastrar para selecci\u00f3n m\u00faltiple, bot\u00f3n izquierdo para atacar...m\u00e1s cl\u00e1sico y sencillo, imposible.\n\nHe probado a ir alternando del juego normal al dlc dentro del men\u00fa y todo va de perlas. Sin problemas tampoco para ejecutarlo y me he hecho el tutorial de un tir\u00f3n para probarlo todo y va de f\u00e1bula.\n\nHe le\u00eddo que a algunas personas les da un error justo al darle al bot\u00f3n de salir al escritorio, pero a mi no me ha pasado (lo he hecho 5 veces seguidas s\u00f3lo para poder escribir esto). Lo \u00fanico que s\u00ed he notado es que la barra de herramientas se me ha quedado tonta y no se oculta autom\u00e1ticamente, sospecho que alg\u00fan proceso se queda atontado por ah\u00ed de fondo al ejecutar el juego. Una vez que he acabado de jugar, he tenido que cerrar el proceso explorer.exe y abrirlo de nuevo para solucionarlo. Aparte de esa tonter\u00eda, ni un solo problema.\n\nResumen: Si no te importa jugar a algo con gr\u00e1ficos de aquella \u00e9poca (estilo Jedi Outcast, por ejemplo) y te van los RTS cl\u00e1sicos, esto es una verdadera maravilla. Adem\u00e1s, estando en la oferta de salida, me ha costado menos de 6 euros. No se puede pedir m\u00e1s.

Then you make them fight others. It's genius. There are a ridiculous number of combinations to try out, and some are just amazing. Need a creature to scout for you? Stick a giraffe's head and neck on a cheetah. Tortoise/electric eel combo? Live tesla tank.\n\nGraphics: 7 - Obviously they've dated but they're perfectly acceptable.\n\nMusic: 8 - Different music for each level/environment, creates a nice atmosphere.\n\nStory: 6 - It's ok, not great, but you'll be too busy splicing a crocodile head ontp a cheetah to care.\n\nGameplay: 9 - All the controls makes sense. It's a classic RTS layout. I never lose track of where my creatures are or what's going on in my base.

The ability to customize your units adds another level of strategy to the game. Do you want a wolf with the head of a chameleon? Done. Great white and a tiger? Easy. Flying monkeys? Why not?\nThe campaign is also enjoyable, and gradually unlocking creatures forces the player to experiment with their army, which in my opinion is a good thing.  \nOf course, the game is not without fault. 9 creatures can be a bit limiting if you want an army that is strong at all stages of the game. Pathing can be a little buggy, and can (and WILL) mess up your creatures' positions (ranged units in front, melee in back, that kind of thing).\nOverall, though, I give this game a solid 9/10.

You can strategically pick animals with unique powers such as lizzard's regeneration or lion's leap attack to create creature that has both . Messing around in the creature lab is almost a game of its own and finding strong combinations is a rewarding experience .\n\nDespite very original nature of the game it has good tutorial and it won't take you long to learn it. If you are a player who enjoys single player campaign this game has a good story and professional voice acting . There are also several well designed evil enemy characters whom you will enjoy beating .\n\nHuge ammount of possible animal combinations adds a lot of value to skirmish multiplayer . Knowing how to create well balanced army is just as important as playing well . You could pick a premade set of animals but lets be honest its much funner to do your own . When you get more expieriance with the game you will be able to get more value out of your animals for the same $ by finding strong combos .\n\nIC Online multiplayer option is functional . You can create account in about 30 seconds and there are couple people playing most of the day .\n\nThis version of the game comes with all DLC content right away such as \"Insect Expension\" so you won't have to pay extra .\n\nImpossible Creatures is slightly dated toward graphics but it was pretty good back then .

From the cheetahs with lobster claws to the chimpanzees with lobster claws, everything I remember about lobster claws is there. In fact, it includes many animals I didn't realize had no lobster claws. I know some of my childhood friends (who had no lobster claws themselves) traded rumors about hammerhead sharks without lobster claws, but all the hammerheads I saw from my beach villa had lobster claws. The musk oxen grazing along the beach didn't have lobster claws, thankfully -- otherwise we'd have needed to reinforce all our homes with lobster claws cast in gold. Musk oxen were always charging buildings, but they didn't cause much harm because they didn't have lobster claws, which greatly increase the damage inflicted on buildings. Getting back to hammerhead sharks, I learned that they sometimes possess primate forelimbs (in lieu of lobster claws), and they can hurl small rocks a considerable distance. Despite their excellent vision radius, the giraffes with lobster claws were never able to throw things very well because lobster claws are not suited to ballistic activity. Speaking of giraffes, if you ever come across one with a lupine torso, don't bother running. It's got crazy endurance and will be in tip-top shape when you're panting and wheezing and collapsed on the ground. Even though it has no lobster claws, the giraffe can easily stomp you with its hooves or maul you with its non-lobster claws. Be very careful around giraffes, their appetite for the flesh of creatures without lobster claws is insatiable.

But then, one day, Nordic Games approached us few survivors and told us of their plan to re-release the game on Steam; we jumped onboard as beta testers, and the day has finally come for release!\n\nSo yes-- basically, I'm not the most impartial of sources. But it's important for me to point out that Nordic has in no way asked or cajoled me to provide this review, nor have they had any input into its content. I'm just a fan of the game. In fact, I know the game inside and out, and that's why you should listen when I say: holy shit, Impossible Creatures is amazing.\n\nLook, let's get the honest criticism out of the way early on-- this game came out in the very early 2000's. It does not look like Skyrim. The models are fairly low-detail (watch the trailer and look at the screenshots) and a lot of the gameplay elements-- build gatherers, gather resources, build buildings, tech up-- won't blow anyone's mind in a modern context. But that's not why this game is important; it's important because of its quirky, brilliant central idea-- its gimmick, if you will. Because as you no doubt have already noticed, Impossible Creatures gives you the ability to send into battle units of your own creation-- magnificent (or hilarious, or both) mixtures of stock animals combined to most efficiently wreak havoc on your opponent. And that's obviously where the game shines.\n\nDon't get me wrong-- other parts of IC are phenomenal. For instance, the lush, beautifully painted maps, or the tactile, atmospheric soundtrack; all symptoms of a sumptuous, absorbing and vibrant style that has sadly gone out of fashion. This isn't the kind of game that strives to be edgy and dark; rather, it presents an experience you can actually enjoy, visually, audibly and emotionally. But the main reason you should buy Impossible Creatures is its depth of gameplay. The depth to this game is remarkable. That's why my people and I have been playing it for [commence italics] thirteen years [end italics]. Do you want to sneak into an enemy base and disrupt his resource gathering? Heck yes, son, chameleons crossed with cheetahs. Is there a mob of power-melee units trampling towards your coal mine? Mix some dragonflies with sharks and rain toothy hell on them from above. Perhaps you're the kind of strategist who prefers to turtle? Well, you're in luck! You can do that! Literally! With turtles! Or, hey, screw it-- if you prefer a more direct approach, why not just crush your opponents with a horde of elephants waving lobster claws? So with this in mind, there's obviously a huge scope for a variety of exotic and wonderful strategies-- and all of them can be successful, if you make good enough creatures and play with enough skill. If you have a playstyle, you can make it work. But this is all macro stuff.\n\nIt's the finer details that really make the game stand out. Even within overarching strategies there is an almost infinite scope for variation. For example, a fairly standard addition to any army is a level 3 melee unit-- a standard, versatile, mid-level grunt. But it's not like there's only one level 3 melee unit. Maybe you want something fast and poisonous, to inflict stings or bites and then retreat to a safe distance while the venom deals damage over time? Maybe you want something tough and powerful that forms herds and regenerates its health? Maybe your opponent crushed you last game with low-damage, high-health units en masse-- well, you can take a jaunt to the army builder and cook up something to deal with that; combine a wasp with a lioness and assassinate those meatshields into oblivion! \n\nThis variation on a fine, precise level is what turns Impossible Creatures into an art form. It's baffling just what people come up with-- and phenomenal to see it work for them. A friend of mine named Matt, for instance, once fielded a musk ox with the head of a condor. It didn't have wings, just a condor head sticking out the front of this beefy ox body. It was called \"accept me as your king\", and we all thought it was hilarious, because it was.\n\nThen it won a battle. Then it won another battle. Then Matt won the game. \n\nThe combination of musk ox defense and cheap, large, low-melee condor parts just happened to result in a strangely optimal creature-- it was cheap enough that Matt could spam it, but tough enough to hold its own. This is why you should play IC; just when you think you've seen it all, a new strategy comes along that completely switches the metagame.\n\nBut, naturally, even a game as diverse and clever as Impossible Creatures has gameplay issues. Mostly these relate to balance. Sadly, when Relic stopped supporting IC, it wasn't perfect (nor can it ever really be). As it stands, the base IC package includes the Insect Invasion mod-- Relic's last attempt at balancing the game (which adds a lot of very fun and interesting mechanics). II was released an incredibly long time ago-- long enough that players have been able to essentially solve the game, and find the truly optimal combination of creatures to use in any given situation. Suddenly, all the depth and variety in the game began to disappear. Which is why myself, Matt, Steve, Phil and Byam-- the original core modding team-- decided to make an add-on mod for IC called Tellurian. \n\nSince we started, we've added 20 stock creatures to the game. It's the only mod still being maintained, balanced, and patched (as a matter of fact, 2.03 is almost ready for release). It's free (not for profit!), it's fun, and it comes with a bunch of maps-- so if you ever get tired of moose lobsters and baboon sperm whales at level 5 (spoilers), visit this page:\n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/tellurian/\n\n... And try out giant squids crossed with panthers. Or blue whales crossed with scorpions. Or pistol shrimp horses-- just get the mod, you'll love it, and every download is a little more incentive to keep the project alive. \n\nImpossible Creatures lives anew-- buy it, download it! And let's be honest, for its incredibly reasonable price, even if you hate the gameplay you can still get your money's worth making daffy combinations in the army builder (yes, I know, komodo dragon crossed with a skunk becomes a \"komodo drunk\", everybody finds that one eventually).", "timestamp_created": 1447328186, "timestamp_updated": 1459337893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 242, "votes_funny": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919093", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19030093": {"recommendationid": "19030093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038486889", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 225, "last_played": 1513913712}, "language": "english", "review": "Barring a few blocky character models, this game has aged remarkably well and has such a great use of colour and style that it's still a joy to look at today. The soundtrack is mostly atmospheric but adds so much to the charm of the game.\n\nIt's fairly standard RTS fare but for the ability to create your own armies - you may take parts from two of the many stock animals to create a combined creature, and then take nine of these combined creatures into any game you play. The range of strategies is far more impressive than I think the developers could ever have hoped for, with creatures of various sizes, stats and abilities available to each player.\n\nThe only downsides I found with the original game were with the balance - some creatures are inherently better when combined with certain stock animals, thus making others effectively redundant but for their novelty value. In the past few years this has been addressed by player-made mods such as Tellurian, which also adds a range of new creatures to play with. It's nice to see that these mods are still compatible with the Steam edition.\n\nAll in all, I reccommend this :D\n\nEDIT: I've nominated this for the Steam \"Test of Time\" award!", "timestamp_created": 1447323920, "timestamp_updated": 1479986134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19029794": {"recommendationid": "19029794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117929065", "num_games_owned": 706, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447283061}, "language": "english", "review": "The return of an \"Old time classic\"!

Seriously, if I remember someone ask Relic Entertainment to put Impossible Creatures on Steam, that was really long time ago, now finally my dream is become true!!\n\n\nAbout this game that you need to create or own creatures and fights your enemy base, yes I'd say its a \"Strategy\" game.\nCustom army is the best part of this game! You can choose two animals and modfied its body parts whatever you like and make them looks like its your pet lol. \nThere's many of ways you can try out many different animals to combine it! That is your own imagination. You don't like some certain animals? Make it wrose! Its your world.\nStory mode is great, trust me, I never ever finish on that part lol. So I like to play custom game more, even I am alone. \n\n\nThere is a packages come out for Steam Edition, update patchs, Insect Invasion Expansion, Level Editor, and SDK (Source Development Kit) for create a new mod even you can make a new animals, so far. I don't really use it much since I just met the modding community, but I was used to playing with someone's mods.

I too, have clocked in over 1000 hours prior to the steam release. \n\nLet me tell you about this amazing game, Impossible Creatures.\n\n[b]Campaign[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Fairly intriguing story for an old RTS\n[*] Good progression, although difficulty ramps up fairly quickly for newbies\n[*] Memorable characters \n[*] Decent length, depends on player skill\n[*] No difficulty slider however\n\n[/list]\n\n[b] Creature Combining[/b]\n\nI've been playing this game for a long, long time, and I still find new interesting combinations. The standard game has 50 stock animals, and with Insect Invasion, 10 bonus animals and the Tellurian mod this brings it up to about 95 creatures you can combine. And this isn't just straight up hybrids, oh no - you can choose exactly which body parts are from which animal. That's a lot of possible combinations.\n\nSome things to note about this style of RTS and unit creation\n\n [list]\n[*] Holy f*cking variety! You can make very varied armies (of 9 combined creatures) which are still viable in multiplayer\n[*] Meta isn't as set in stone, there's counters for pretty much everything, naturally.\n[*] Creatures have special abilities - such as electric burst with the eel, or camouflage with the chameleon. \n[*] Totally messed up and funny combinations can sometimes be pretty good\n[*] You can name your own creatures\n[*] Komodo Dragon + Skunk = Komodo Drunk :)\n[/list]\n\n\n[b] Multiplayer[/b]\n\nInevitably, the thing that'll keep you coming back is the multiplayer. Now, back when this was my childhood, I mainly stuck to Player vs Computer, but having played a fair bit of multiplayer now I can tell you it's really damn fun.\n\n[list]\n[*] Up to 6 players, free for all, teams or various game modes\n[*] AI isn't half bad for an old game\n[*] Absolutely insane battles with 6 players on large maps\n[*] Games may range from 30 minutes - 4 hours (cough, Bikini Atoll, cough)\n[*] Custom maps, mods (get Tellurian!) = Massive replayability\n[*] Quite fast paced, something of a skill ramp but not crazy like Starcraft. Casuals will still have fun games with other casuals.\n[/list]\n\n\n[b] RTS Elements[/b]\nIt's still your standard RTS fair, except making your own units is the big awesome part of it.\n\n[list]\n[*] Two resources: Coal and Electricity. Getting a steady supply and managing resources is key.\n[*] Expand with Workshops to other parts of the map, upgrade worker henchmen with Research Clinic and improve your creatures' stats with the Genetic Amplifier\n[*] Higher level creatures (Levels range from I -> V) require research at your Lab (home base)\n[*] Units may be land, water, amphibious or flyers\n[*] Creature combinations will generally be either Melee or Range, but special abilities mix it up a bit\n[*] You want to research up to higher level creatures ASAP, and have your army balanced so you can ward off rushes at earlier levels\n[*] Defensive structures: Soundbeam towers for land creatures and Anti-Air towers for flyers\n[*] Gyrocopter! \n[/list]\n\nTl;Dr: Awesome game, RTS lovers or even casuals will have a good time.

Parfois on se marre \u00e0 voir des arm\u00e9es compl\u00e8tement What the fuck des adversaires !

Est-ce que je dois axer ma puissance sur l\u2019early ou le late game ? Dois-je opter pour des grosses cr\u00e9atures tenaces ou des cr\u00e9atures rapides qui attaquent \u00e0 distance ? A vous de voir. Vous avez 8 slots pour combiner les diff\u00e9rents animaux pr\u00e9sents.

From playing the campaign, all the way to making your own custom army that you then take onto the battlefield!!! Insert 300 reference here.\n\n2. It is creative. I think the whole over 50.000 possible combinations and the presence of a level editor say everything.\n\n3.It is challenging. Boy this one is so true. Especially if you are playing multiplayer. THERE IS NO MERCY ON THE FIGHTING GROUND. IN THIS GAME YOU EITHER WRECK FACE OR GET YOUR FACE REKT. Well...\nyou know...\nit depends on who you're up against.Either way, before you hop into online play, it's best that you know how to play the game the slightest bit.

Hold on just a little longer.)\n\n[b] Graphics = 9 [/b]\nBefore you go and tell everybody that the graphics suck, just take in consideration the year this game was made. This was revolutionary back then!

Nothing else to say here. Move on.\n\n[b] Creativity / Originality = 10 [/b]\nYou can slap wings on a snake.\n\n[b] Story = 7 [/b]\nI personally didn't like the story that much : P . Multiplayer, army making and skirmishes agaisnt the AI make up for it.\n\n[b] Gameplay = 10 [/b]\nThe Multiplayer matches can be either fast-paced or slow-paced. There is no way to tell what kind of creature combinations your enemy has got in their armies, so it really depends on the game style of the players. A lot of maps that further increase the diversity of the games. They are either ground based maps, or water based maps.

Oh yes, this goes way into B-Movie territory, which makes sense considering the major feature of the game is building up an army of creatres that have been genetically spliced to create new and terrible creatures that borrow abilities off others.

You recieve a letter from your estranged father, but as you arrive you find not only his lab has been left unattended for so long, but you get attacked by Wolf scorpions. You're saved by your father's assistant and discover the project he was working on and help by using your rifle to gather DNA of various creatures to add to your ever growing Library to give you a wider range of animans to splice level after level.\n\nThe game balanaces this out by having each species have a research level catagory, so you can't start off producing the nasiest thing you can develope, but there is also a handy little library option to save creatures to so that if you only have high rank creatures in your selection screen, you can trade them out.\n\nIt's a very fun RTS and I've been loving the B-Movie feel from it too.

This is dating back to 2003-2005. Hi 8ball, Relic_OMO, Vintage_OMO, Timeless_OMO,, Geezer_OMO, and many others (I\u2019m kENDON/Flashback!).\n\nAs for the game, it was far, far ahead of its time, the character generation system, to this day, is unique. Of course there are optimal creatures, but the delightful thing is there are more than you can fit into your army, so strategy is needed before you even play a game.\n\nThe campaign is lots of fun, it\u2019s also difficult and thought-provoking. You have to play strategically in order to circumvent many of the cunning traps the AI has in store. It\u2019s most enjoyable.\n\nMultiplayer is where the game really shines(shone). Excelled map choices from two-player to eight. IC Multiplayer is fantastic for teaching you the basics of RTS, that gathering resources is super important, that it\u2019s essential to expand ASAP, and perhaps the biggest lesson of all - scouting your opponents\u2019 base and possible expansion locations. You should go into a game with a clearly defined strategy in your head, and your army choice should reflect this. A rush strategy requires a significantly different setup than a team game where you can boom expand like crazy and feed your allies resources.\n\nDuring the games golden years, I was one of the most elite players. So much so, that myself and another player, 8ball, wrote and produced, and coded a complete balance structure for EVERY base creature in the game, after the deva stuffed the game and made it unplayable.

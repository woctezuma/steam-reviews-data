Doesn't make it bad.\n\nIf you're not familiar with that developer, gist of those games is: arcade-like, very simple and quick. Well done and fun. Rest of the review will just be complaining, so go get the game (or better yet, grab Orbt XL which is better). It comes from a place of love though - I like the game, but see how much better it could be and it bothers me.\n\nSome of the issues here were also present in BitBlaster XL, but weren't as important, as BitBlaster felt \"less endless\". It felt like a game that one could be eventually done with and fine with that. This is a bit like super hexagon (or Orbt XL), meaning you will want to replay it a lot more.\n\nControl: there's something wrong with how the controls work. Pressing buttons while transferring between nodes affects your speed, which is somewhat not intuitive in some scenarios (eg. when you are going right, but want to go up soon if you press up before hitting the node you'll slow down. If you press left, you somehow won't).\n\nSimplicity: It's just not very simple, the concept feels either forced or not fleshed out enough. Games like this work, because they have very simple rules. Think super hexagon. Move right/left and don't hit stuff. This one has aspects that took me 1h of play to discover. Granted, this is because it's fast paced and you tend to not pay attention - it's still rather simple.\n\nContent: this game ends too soon. I get the strategy behind this: it's a $.5 game that makes everyone happy. But I want something that will push me to actually get good with it. Be it achievements or unlocks. After 1h of play you have to motivate yourself. This is very much true for all Nickervision games and I see that it's a viable strategy - everyone gets a nice feeling of completing the game and it's hard to justify a negative score for something that cheap. And I'm still recommending it, cause yeah, the price is right and the game is fun. It just could be so much more.\n\nProgression: This is the same issue as Bit Blaster XL. You just get better stuff. Once you unlock the next thing, you won't ever have a reason to go back. I can't stop myself from feeling like this was intentional to serve the part of the audience that maybe isn't that great at games but they want all the achievements nevertheless. You grinded enough, you get the best player character, best is better than what you've been using, better high score, yay progression. I think that's a bit patronizing to gamers and super hard games like super hexagon made big bucks to prove my point. I'd rather see skins, like in Orbt XL.\n\nOverall I feel like the concept isn't all it could be. The game is still good. I think the pricing is very sane (some indie companies would sell a game like this for a lot more - I feel like Nicks sale quantities prove them wrong). I like the sound and the visuals. I love that it works flawlessly on linux (well, the leaderboards don't work but who cares).", "timestamp_created": 1514635694, "timestamp_updated": 1514635853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38817491": {"recommendationid": "38817491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202542754", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 185, "last_played": 1514731471}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein sehr sehr sch\u00f6nes Spiel zum warten oder einfach f\u00fcr zwischen durch.\nIst ein kauf im Angebot aufjedenfall wert!", "timestamp_created": 1514551926, "timestamp_updated": 1514551926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38809392": {"recommendationid": "38809392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120760214", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1514606526}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is REALLY fun!

Diamo XL steps up as their next title falling right in line with the arcade design that I enjoyed so much before, but this time, it may be missing a little of the magic that made Bit Blaster XL and Orbt XL so enjoyable. \n\n[h1]A diamond in the rough[/h1]\n\nDiamo XL's core premise is essentially to trace the lines of the diamond shape on screen with a gamepad (or keyboard) controlled cursor.  Once you cover all of the lines, you'll be awarded five base points which can be multiplied by a modifier that increases as you continue moving the cursor.  The obstacles are a series of red squares that come hurdling in from all sides to collide with your cursor and end the run.  As you progress, additional enemies appear that do things like temporarily destroy a line in the shape or make a corner inaccessible.  You increase your potential score by maintaining your movement, but too much movement can have you colliding with obstacles much more frequently and ending your run.\n\nOne thing that Diamo does very similar to its predecessors is limit player control.  Bit Blaster had it so you could only turn your ship without controlling thrust. Orbt only let you raise or lower the orbit of your cursor while you maintained your movement in orbit. In Diamo, once you've committed to moving down a line to a corner, you can't stop \u2013 you can only increase your speed by pushing the button for that direction.  This is actually where I find my biggest issue with the game.  The problem is that you're working primarily with a 'diamond' shape, though the center is filled with a perpendicular crossing.  When using a controller, it's often difficult to use the d-pad to move on the diagonal lines.  It's possible to use \u201cup\u201d to go diagonal and upward to the right or left depending on which side you're on, but logically you try to press the d-pad diagonally which can often register as a press either to the left or up.  This could potentially be resolved by just using a keyboard to dissuade yourself from even having access to a \u201cdiagonal,\u201d but I just like I can react faster using a gamepad.  \n\n[h1]Third time isn't always a charm...[/h1]\n\nI can't really say that Diamo XL is bad, but I can say that it doesn't really live up to its predecessors on a number of levels.  Even beyond the control issue, it just doesn't seem quite as fun as Bit Blaster or as engaging as Orbt.  I'm not sure what exactly is missing from the experience, but I can say that when I do lose a run, I am nowhere near as compelled to restart and try again.  However, in general, it's a solid game for its minuscule price, and certainly one worth recommending as a time killer.  I'm sure a future sale could easily take this down to 50 cents and grabbing all three titles in the \u201cArcade Bundle\u201d is still definitely something I suggest doing.  I just hope that whatever Nickervision has planned for the future has more of what made the their first two titles such enjoyable games.\n\n\nIf you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EndyoGaming#curation", "timestamp_created": 1511240652, "timestamp_updated": 1512816870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36558115": {"recommendationid": "36558115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257225827", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513545412}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is quite well put together, with simple rules and controls that are difficult to master.

Once you have traced all the outlines you will get more points which are, points. No description needed because I assume that everyone knows what a point is. After you have been moving for a bit, you\u2019ll notice the amount of points you get exponentially increases. This is dependant on the multiplier. You earn a higher multiplier by constantly moving around the diamond and staying alive. \n\nThere are achievements, and I speculate the developers will soon add Trading Cards to the game as they did with Orbt.XL and BitBlaster.XL. Either way, the game is very enjoyable. When you hear the words \u201carcade\u2019style\u201d or \u201csimplistic\u201d you might think of a boring 2d shooter game just like all the other ones out there. But Diamo XL is so much more than \u201cthe other games.\u201d It provides a ton of fun, encourages short gaming sessions yet many of those short gaming sessions [to me. It might be different for you.] and the achievements are difficult to get, meaning that you will spend a decent amount of time before you have achieved everything.\n\nThe gameplay reminds me of something from a retro arcade in the 1990\u2019s. Something that just keeps you entertained no matter how many times you play. It\u2019s not like a campaign game that will fade in interest over time, it\u2019s something that you will continue to click on months, maybe even years, from now when you\u2019re looking for something to do.\n\nVideo review and gameplay coming soon on my youtube channel, which you can find on my profile in the \u201cvideos section\u201d.

While bit blaster focused on shooters of yester-year in the arcades, \nthis focuses on a more original idea.  You are drawing lines to form a diamond while dodging enemies and raising your score. The game still feels like an arcade machine as you try \nand get a high score by drawing a pattern and destroying enemies. At first it seems too \nsimple as you move around and collect points. But as you keep playing and getting your \nscore higher and keep your multiplier up you get sucked in. Enemies also evolve a bit and\ndestroy certain paths and block cross roads(temporaraly). Keeping your speed up without \ndying is challenging and addicting. \n\nThe graphics and sound are minimalistic and don't draw you in, but this isn't a bad thing \nas I felt it allowed you to focus on the gameplay. The controls are fine, any mistake you make will be your fault as things get chaotic and you make a mistake in a panic. There are unlockable characters with different stats and sizes to vary things up a bit, though this does bring me to my one critsism. Unlocking characters are cool but the gameplay really could use more stages (or patterens so to speak). There is only one and yes this game is cheap, but thats how much I enjoyed it. Having more would be really sweet and give the game more meat. But again this game is cheap so i'm not gonna criticize this too much. But I do hope the developer expands on this game. It was a nice suprise and like \"bit blaster\" it's fun, addictive, and nails the feel of being back in the arcades of the 90's.", "timestamp_created": 1508383104, "timestamp_updated": 1508383405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35830030": {"recommendationid": "35830030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202384334", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508799104}, "language": "english", "review": "Do yourself a fovor. \n\nScroll back up a bit, and buy \"Arcade Bundle - Nickervision Studios Bundle\". \n\n[spoiler]go down a bit for an actual review[/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk now, on to the review of this game.\n\nDiamo XL is a very simple game. That's not a bad thing. That's actually a GOOD thing.\n\nIn this game, you move a square around a diamond with two intersecting lines going through the middle to form four right triangles. Once you start moving from a point, you cannot stop until you get to the next point. The only thing you can do is slow down by letting go of whatever button you're using to move or speed up by holding it down. Red shapes will come from the sides of the screen and go towards the diamond shape that you can move on. As you may have guessed, these are enemies and touching one will kill you. When you move across a line, it turns blue. If you turn all of the lines blue, you get a relatively large score bonus. Running into small blue circles will also give you points. You can earn a score multiplier of up to 5x by constantly being in motion. Stopping for more than about a second will cause your score multyiplier to quickly go down.\n\nThat's everything I can think of on how to play. That's it. Just a few sentences. A medium-sized paragraph sums up the entiree game.\n\nBut trust me. The game's fun. Simple isn't bad. In Pac-Man, you moved a yellow circle around a maze and got small white dots. That game is still played today. \n\nRecommended, strongly recommended, and that's all I have to say.", "timestamp_created": 1508375658, "timestamp_updated": 1508375658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

You gain points for covering every line that makes up the diamond, near misses, and touching dots which also randomly appear and move along said lines.\n\nThe challenge comes from the progressively more varied and numerous projectiles, some of which can even destroy lines. The longer you last, the higher your multiplier, and the faster you move (or so it seems,) the higher your score.\n\nIt's an incredibly easy to learn yet difficult to master game, equal parts imminently casual, and maddeningly challenging as you go on. You can unlock different player icons by achieving specific objectives, much like Orbt XL.\n\nMy sole criticism of the game is that movement in the desired direction seems to be most easily achieved by using up, down, left, and right, despite four of the lines being diagonal. Moreover, since (on a controller at least,) those directions are most precisely hit using the D-pad versus the analog stick, I do at times find that the direction I press is not the direction I move in, frequently leading to premature failures. This is a minor criticism however, since a) it could simply be my D-Pad, and b) keyboard controls are also available.\n\nAll in all, fun, affordable game.", "timestamp_created": 1508131086, "timestamp_updated": 1508131086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35764425": {"recommendationid": "35764425", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994853244", "num_games_owned": 600, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1514443078}, "language": "english", "review": "EDITED REVIEW: So I wrote what I thought was a \"hilarious\" review about this game, but didn't mention how the game was thoughtfully, so I will write a sincere review of this game.\n\nDiamo XL is a simplistic arcade puzzle game where you have to draw lines within a 4 sided diamond shape, with 4 rectangles in it.

Complete with an optional tutorial and an immediate restart option upon game over, the game's pace and flow is steady and consistent. \n\nThe gameplay is simple; using the four directional inputs (up, down, left, right), you guide your character to a point on the diamond grid. Once you start moving, you can't stop until you reach the next node, so timing is needed to avoid the enemy projectiles. The goal of the game is to traverse all 8 paths of the diamond grid to score points, then repeat the process indefinitely while avoiding red enemy projectiles that hover over the map. After game over, you're presented with numerous detailed statistics about your playthrough, such as amount of time spent idle, number of diamonds completed, close calls, etc. as well as the option to tweet your score, compare your score to others on the global leaderboard, try again or return to the main menu.\n\nThe game rewards you with a higher score multiplier the longer you go without moving, and there's a cooldown for said combo multiplier as to not make the gameplay feel too rushed or hectic. Similar to Bit Blaster and Orbt, the difficulty starts out easy then scales to be more difficult the higher your score gets; more enemy projectiles on screen, new enemies that disable sections of the grid for a short period of time, etc. The game also rewards you with different \"characters\" to choose from, and they're unlocked simply by playing the game; the more you play, the more points you earn, and each character's unlocking criterion (i.e. Earn X points in total) is shown in the character select screen.\n\nI played this game with my Xbox360 Afterglow USB controller and had no issues, and there's an option to disable controller rumble in the options. If the catchy music track isn't to your liking or you're getting tired of it, you can also disable it (and sound effects) in the options menu and just play your own music in the background instead. \n\nIn conclusion, Diamo XL plays exactly how it's presented.

Collect points before the enemies smash them and keep moving to keep your multiplier high. Fill in the four triangles to complete the Diamond and get bonus points. Simply holding any of the four directional buttons allows your player to move around the Diamonds zones at a high rate of speed, if you just tap the direction your player will move at half the speed.\"\n\nThe ability too control the speed of movement  is what sets this out for me, as it makes the game fairly strategic, not even including the decision on which score point to pick up, and wether u should risk completing a triangle or the whole diamond by ur movements.\n\nLooking forward to playing this more tommorow:)\n\nPS: Also reccomend picking up the other games on sale atm, as I have played them extensively on mobile and found them very addicite also.

In practice though, that's what unexpectedly trips up the player, because every mistake is either an assessment fault or rash twitch reaction. There's more than enough time to estimate the speed and timing of the obstacles and sometimes, especially at higher scores, it's even advisable to stay put for half a second or more. Waiting at the right time is tougher than it seems if the game pushes a constant movement flow and punishes stalling.\n\nThere's only one minor annoyance where obstacles layered on top of each other are hard to distinguish and keep track of. It's still doable but potentially unfair within a perfect storm sequence. Also, with the mouse brain I have, every now and then it's confusing to quickly determine the right direction with the arrow keys on a diamond shape.\n\nWith polished visuals and a good use of tempo in the music, Diamo XL is an unequivocally recommendable arcade gem.\n\nHeads up though: My Xbox 360 wired controller did not work as intended with this game.

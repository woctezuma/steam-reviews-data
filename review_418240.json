Otherwise, please watch some video reviews and gameplays. [b]This may not be your game!!![/b]\n\nQuick review averages:\n[list][*][b]General:[/b]\n[list][*][b]Mechanics: 7.5/10.[/b] Mostly good. Sometimes you'll get frustrated with some miss clicks, but the game does have the feedbacks. It could be improved tho.\n\n[*][b] Graphics: 7.5/10.[/b] Great, optimized, with cartoon shader. Biggest let down that I can't zoom too close tho. Probably because of the graphic quality, characters may look low poly from really close up. \n\n[*][b]Content/Surprises: 7/10.[/b] So far, not many surprises, but a lot of new content introduced every stage. Been kept entertained. [b]\u26a0Bear in mind that I have not beat the game yet.\u26a0[/b]\n\n[*][b]Lore/Story: 7/10[/b] Nice Edo Japan story. Well set, I read almost every main dialogue. I'm usually not even attracted to stories in general, so this in one is good. But nothing extremely amazing so far.[b]\u26a0Bear in mind that I have not beat the game yet.\u26a0[/b]\n\n[*][b]Music/Sound: 7/10.[/b] It's hard for a game to have a music that does not bore after 10 hours. I consider this an average.\n[/list]\n\n[*]Plus and Cons:\n\n[list]\n[*][b]+Voice acting: 8.5/10.[/b] Voice acting is so amazing, pushing this game score up. Just wish there was subtitles even for the random chatter characters say when you give them actions. Soldiers have limited voices, but only noticeable if you're picky (like me).\n\n[*][b]-Scum saving: 6/10.[/b] Let's be fair: Most of the coolest games you've played after 2007 are prone to scum saving, and most of the time, because we want something to go extremely perfect. This game it's not that hard to actually make you scum save, but if you want a situation to go down exactly how you picture it, you'll F5/F8 a lot.\n[/list]\n[/list]\n[h1]I recommend buying it...\n[list]\n[*]If you're into the tags mentioned above.\n[*]If the game's on sale, and you liked it, but does not have the money.\n[/list]\nDont buy it...\n[list]\n[*]If you're not into the tags, or is just curious.

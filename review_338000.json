Even less are numbers of those who can get it working, and the fewest are those who can run the games like \"Echoes classic\" on their oscilloscope screens. So, it is really geeky stuff we're talking about.\n\nNow, just like the other game from the same developer, Echoes+ is a very narrow-focused project, made for people who love 2d twin-stick shooters like they were in the 80's. You just thrash about in some locked screen, shooting and dodging, dodging and shooting. I do hate such rigid gameplay, but, that was not the case for the downvote. After all, it is a freeware game, fairly made and well described on the store. If someone don't get it... he can just drop it and live long after, right?\n\nWell, but I've started it After the other game, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/639650/1982]1982[/url]. Some details for those games are similar, some are different, but, alas, while Echoes+ basically looking more promising, with 5 different modes to play and all... it's far less stable, than \"1982\" project. I've witnessed too many crushes for the time I've played, and too many of my records were erased because of those. And it is something I don't want to take lightly. You see, it is the game where every level wants to kill you. And the game is always succeeds in that. The only thing you can change is the HiScore. Amount of the time you've been able to hold the pressure. It is really high-adrenaline stuff, and imagine my feelings when I just beat the world record on the highest difficulty, and then game goes down, without recording anything!\n\nEven more strange thing, somehow it once deleted itself from my disk space! Yesterday I was playing it, come back to get some more punishment... and had to download it again!\n\nSo, my mark is 5/10, and I'm not recommending that freeware project to anyone, but the beardy lovers-of-the-old, with the nerves of steel and faster-than-lighting reflexes. This is supreme, but not really awarding challenge, with the very possible damage to your eyesight (due to constantly blinking screen and small fast-moving objects all around)...", "timestamp_created": 1517572898, "timestamp_updated": 1517573179, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.731704", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39769217": {"recommendationid": "39769217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133693009", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517582667}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Otimo Game.", "timestamp_created": 1517496548, "timestamp_updated": 1517496548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39082381": {"recommendationid": "39082381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163977279", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514497048}, "language": "turkish", "review": "1982 kadar olmasada g\u00fczel bir oyun.Tek eksi\u011fi can\u0131 fazla vermesi.", "timestamp_created": 1515156190, "timestamp_updated": 1515156190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38958590": {"recommendationid": "38958590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043346855", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 343, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514860028}, "language": "english", "review": "Nausea-inducing graphics with the developer's trademark fire-and-forget action create a mostly forgettable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1514860115, "timestamp_updated": 1514860115, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38730912": {"recommendationid": "38730912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138917668", "num_games_owned": 1071, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422973425}, "language": "japanese", "review": " \u30f3\u30ae\u30e2\u30c2\u30a4\u30a4", "timestamp_created": 1514366994, "timestamp_updated": 1514366994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38674735": {"recommendationid": "38674735", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972444376", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514240255}, "language": "english", "review": "great", "timestamp_created": 1514240281, "timestamp_updated": 1514240281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38585655": {"recommendationid": "38585655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143337879", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513293997}, "language": "spanish", "review": "+", "timestamp_created": 1514047087, "timestamp_updated": 1514047087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38336273": {"recommendationid": "38336273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427123796", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519082575}, "language": "english", "review": "Great action shooter type game that tests your skills.

Its one of those games that you can play in order to kill time if your just waiting around or bored out of your mind. The only complaint I can make about this game is that the controls could have been better thoughtout just a bit more I mean you use the keyboard and mouse why not just use the mouse? Move your mouse around and click to shoot, makes the controls less confusing. Basically when you press W you shoot up, press D you shoot left, so on.

There are five modes that are well described on the store page. My personal favorites are Meteor Storm, where a line of astroids come from one side of the screen and your strategy is to dodge them and rack up multipliers, and the standard Echoes modes, which puts you in a rectangular arena where you are shooting against various sizes and types of asteroids while increasing your weapon power and score and trying to avoid damage or restore health from pick ups. I've never cared for Time Attack/Survival modes in most games, so I don't care for them here either, and the Asteroid Belts Mode (where snake like strings of rocks home in on you) features my most hated \"enemy\" of the game - so simply don't like it.\n\nYou can do worse for free on Steam and you can probably learn a bit about game development by opening this in AppGameKit.

There are Multiplier Pick-Ups that increase the score you get per hit, and Weapon Pick-Ups that increase the amount of bullets shot at a time. There are also a bunch game mode variations to the classic Geometry Wars type formula. And finally \"Trials\" which is the in-game non-steam achievements. There are 200 Trials, and while some require you to play in certain game modes, they can be done on any difficulty(easy, normal, hard, insane), but each difficulty awards a different percentage to the 100%, and only the highest difficulty counts, so to get 100% you need to do all on Insane Difficulty.\n\nIf you like Twin Stick Shooter and/or Bullet Hell type games like Geometry Wars, then download this free game, which is easily worth $5-$10 in my opinion.

It is an evolved version of Asteroids with improved graphics and colors. The game sort of reminds me of PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX since it has a retro feel but fits the graphics of the modern era. For a free to play game, it is well made and comes with a variety of game modes. The music is pretty good but the controls are a bit sluggish. WASD moves your ship, and your mouse aims the blasters. The problem is that your ship feels like it's moving through mud, and the gun doesn't sensitively respond to your movement. Another issue is the overload of explosions that are simultaneously on screen in later levels. The screen gets to a point where you can't really see where your ship is, especially with the time delay I was talking about earlier. Other than these two problems, the game is a space shooter that does it's job of being a space shooter.

Many different modes to choose from and of course a lot more complex than Asteroids as well, but you can play old school Asteroids too.

I am not one of those who enjoy playing against highscores. I find it too repetative and a \"scam\" to add \"playability\".\n\nPros and cons:\n\nCons: \nFullscreen only. No windowed mode, no resolution options, no nothing of that sorts.\nOptions/settings menu is barebones.\nLimited controls-Playing with mouse and keyboard, or keyboard only. You can only shoot directional, and not 360 degrees. Only: Up, Down, Left, and Right.(Though there is controller/joystick support. But I have a hunch it will be the same limitations)\nArt style is too similar to Geometry Wars.\nNot many features. Only 6 game modes + \"Challenges\". 4 difficulties.

Back (old man alert!) when I was a kid, I didn't get more than 2 or 3 games a year, the rest had to be rentals. Nowadays, we have access to hundreds of thousands of games. Once you take into account the indie bundles, the incredible discounts, the F2P MMOs, the freeware, all the \"free\" games made possible via emulators, you get several times more bang for your buck than ever before.\n\nEchoes+ is a free game, no strings attached either. You're not obligated to pay for the full game, there aren't any microtransactions, and it isn't free because nobody in their right mind would play it let alone pay for it. Echoes+ is simply free, and pretty dang good.\n\nThe best description I can come up with this game is that it's a twin-stick-not-quite-asteroids shooter. Yes, I'm well aware that it's not the catchiest term but whatever. Basically the goal is to survive as long as possible and get the high-score. You survive by dodging rocks, and you score high by shooting everything and collecting multiplier bonuses. There are multiple difficulties for ever-increasing rock intensity and a variety of modes. Limited leaderboards (top 10 only) and non-Steam achievements round out the package. There's even a more traditional Asteroids clone. \n\nUnlike most twin-stick shooters, you actually get a health meter in this game. This tends to result in longer attempts than most 1-3 life games. However, as you progress there are about 300 rocks for every health pick-up you'll find, and whenever you take damage you lose a number of weapon power-ups. Well actually they get scattered, so while you can pick them up again, it just adds to the chaos. In short, you can get hit, but you shouldn't get hit. That sounds sensible enough doesn't it? After a certain point it becomes seemingly impossible to not take damage. This is about where the \"git gud wall\" makes its appearance. You can't have a classic arcade game, without an invisible wall that forces you to step your game up to the next level. \n\nI'm not sure where I'd rank Echoes+ in the great pantheon of free videogames, but it is good enough to check out. It's challenging enough, has the right hooks and incentives to keep you playing, and is competently designed and executed. I've certainly paid for worse games.", "timestamp_created": 1422370773, "timestamp_updated": 1422370897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505993", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14188322": {"recommendationid": "14188322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070078489", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421464684}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoy this game, its a ton of fun and becomes harder the longer you stay alive.

While your aiming options are limited it works will for the way Echoes is designed. It turns into a game of juking and jiving around the board with your mouse while spraying destruction at what you're kiting away from.\n\nThere are two bummers however when going from Echoes to Echoes plus. First you can't aim diagonally. It might be an issue from keyboard to keyboard but I can aim diagonally on my old version of Echoes and I can't aim with what's on Steam. Second, the old version had the ability to customize what you aimed and shot with. i.e. move with mouse and aim with joystick; really the optimal setup. Or with me being an ESDF player, I'd really appreciate the option to customize what you use with up,down,left,right.

Also, sometimes in the middle of gameplay I experience a 1.5-second moment of lag, during which I apparently collide with and bounce off the edge, taking minor damage. However, I do currently have, um... let's go with a \"shitaki mushroom\" of a laptop, so.... That might be why it's slightly buggy for me. So, not for lower-end computers if you're a gamer who simply cannot take even just a bit of lag during an action game. Otherwise it is playable on lower-end computers. Just expect lower-end scores if you play on lower-end computers. ;P\n\nWhile the game does appear to be susceptable to hacking for a high-score (for a moment while I was playing there were high-score banners about this \"HackMan\" person getting ~10-18 times higher score than the 'second'-place people, which did not at all seem legit), scores resulting from that behavior are quickly removed (like every single score made by that \"HackMan\" person was probably not even 5 minutes after I first noticed it), which shows that there is a team keeping an eye on things. So don't HackMan- that won't get ya anywhere. ;P After all, we're shooting neon asteroids, not eating humorously-mispelled words and running from ghosts.

Each round of the game gets more difficult, as more obstacles, such as black holes, homing asteroids, and the sun try to reduce your life down to zero.\n\nThere are many modes to try in this game, such as survival (live as long as you can), time attack (get as many points in the time limit), asteroid belt (where the homing meteors chase you down until you die), meteor storm (where waves come any side until you die) and classic (based on the inspiration, Asteroids). Each of these modes has four difficulties: easy, normal, hard, and insane.\n\nThere are three different control schemes for the game: mouse (with wasd shooting), a gamepad, and the keyboard (where wasd moves and the arrows shoot). I found the keyboard method to be clunky and unresponsive to use, and I didn't try out the game pad. Luckily, the mouse worked fine for me, especially since you can adjust the speed of it in the options menu.\n\nThe soundtrack is very good, especially since it is free.

Pretty Decent Free Game, Even if It's Designed to Show Off Tech.[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Genre: Bullet Hell Arcade Game.\n[*]Developed & Published by: Binary Zoo & The Game Creators & The Game Creators Ltd\n[*]Platform: Windows, Mac\n[*]Business Model: Base Game\n[*][i][strike]Copy Purchased by Myself[/strike][/i] \n[/list]\n[b]Overall Gameplay Thoughts[/b]\nThis is a competent title considering for a Free-to-Play twin stick shooter. This isn't my genre of choice, hence why there's very little play time for this one. But I had to give it a look and see if it was even worth installing. Generally, I find that twin-sticks are overly difficult for my tastes (and this one isn't any different) and I don't find getting the highest score possible all that compelling. You'll find six different game modes ranging from time attack, survival, 10-level campaign to classic asteroids play. Each adding some diversity. \n\n[b]PC Settings[/b]\nPC options are pretty bare-boned. All you can change are audio levels and movement speed. (No resolution, fullscreen/windowed or other graphical options). You can play either the game's music or your own songs. You can also use either a controller, mouse or keyboard though the controller is the better way to go. \n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nMusic is decently up beat, graphics are nice and retro but big surprise there and combat has a decent amount of feedback. Though I feel like the only way you lose is by being overwhelmed. That just might be my awfulness with this genre. It's hard to argue with a good free game, even if it's advertising a game development kit. Solid action, decent variety and fun gameplay make it a recommend from me. If this is your genre of interest, it seems to be worth giving a look.\n\n[url=http://kingisaaclinksr.com/2015/01/16/a-paladins-steam-review-echoes/]Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1421458611, "timestamp_updated": 1450745574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532710", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14022017": {"recommendationid": "14022017", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973512485", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426898644}, "language": "english", "review": "Control scheme for keyboard and mouse suck.

There are also different kinds of space rocks, like ones that spawn in a big line on one side of the screen, then sweep across.. or ones that form a snake-like chain and chase you.\n\nControls are simple.. I played on a 360 pad, and one stick moves me around, while the other stick shoots in whatever direction I push it.  A or RT detonates a bomb that destroys a lot of the stuff on the screen.  There are pickups that restore your health, improve your weapons, etc.\n\nThere's a lot of movement on the screen, lots of color and everything gets pretty insane after a while.. there isn't a whole lot of excessive flashing lights and stuff, but just in case, if you have epilepsy, be careful about this one..

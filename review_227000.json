A lot of twists and turns, a lot more than meets the eye!\n\nThe characters too, were excellent. A lot of character, even if they seemed simple and one-dimensional, they evolved depth throughout the game, and developed into a lot more nuanced characters. However keep in mind that the game is quite short, and as such the developlemt is limited to that time frame. I would have liked for a bit more personally, but the game works well with the time it has.\n\nI, personally, stayed mainly for the characters. Your floating assistant is f*cking hilarious, and the protagonist and him play off each other so nicely, it's worth playing the game for those two alone. My favourite character has got to be Clarity though, I just kind of like her personality I guess.\n\nThe gameplay was frustrating for me though. I have never been a big point and click fan, and as such a lot of Point and Click elements frustrated me greatly. Some of the puzzles were very clever and rewarding, but a lot of them also basically couldn't be solved by any other way than by walkthrough or blind clicking. I could just be stupid, but that was my general experience. There were too many of these in my opinion.\n\nThe audio work is excellent! The music isn't phenomenal on it's own, but it blends in perfectly with the atmosphere and setting. The voice acting too is excellent, the game wouldn't be nearly as interesting if it was missing. The actors doing the voices really did a great job here.\n\nTL;DR:\n6/10 - Above average, but not worth the current price, pick up on sale. \n\nThe game was good, but WAY too short for it's price tag, honestly seems like such a waste of such a great environment.

The premise is pretty standard, you are on a journey to reclaim what was taken from you, but the execution is where the game truly shines. Primordia's world is devoid of life, and yet a few machines persist in carrying out what functions were once prescribed to them. Primordia's world, however, is not devoid of feeling or emotion.\n\nThe dialog in Primordia is very strong. From Crispin's snarky remarks to Primer's street poetry, every single character in the game is charismatic, memorable, and interesting to interact with. For example, Clarity, a character you meet in the later half of the game, has some fairly amusing dialog. The writer for Primordia, Mark Yohalem, works in the legal field, and Clarity is a robot built with little to no error margin when it comes to matters of law and justice. She is rigid, uncompromising, and she lays the absolute legal beatdown on poor Horatio on matters of property ownership. It was also not surprising that Horatio had to resolve some unrelated ownership disputes later on, but I digress.\n\nPrimordia's main antagonist is another example of a well-written character; it truly believes that it is doing the right thing, and in a way, it is. In a world devoid of humanity, right and wrong are just words, and ideals are worth clinging on to. I have to commend the voice work in the game, too, as it is spot-on. Logan Canningham, of the Bastion fame, voices Horatio. Horatio is appropriately raspy, somber, the perfect tone for a religious leading man. Others are similarly well cast, such as Crispin's upbeat attitude that doesn't wane throughout the game, the Legionbuilt, and so on. There is more to mention about the characters in Primordia, but suffice to say, the game strikes gold when it comes to characterization. \n\nThe story, which is fairly short, is satisfying: there are emotional moments, there are moments of idle banter that flesh-out the world and the machines \u201cliving\u201d in it, and there is an inevitable conclusion that changes everything. There are several endings to Primordia, and I don't think any of them are weak or abrupt, and it was cool to see how certain plot elements were referenced or expanded on. I felt satisfied viewing each individual ending, and that's not something I can say about the majority of games that have multiple endings. My only real concern about the story is that it could have been a little longer, perhaps utilizing some of the cut content, but it's not a big deal. I was just sad that it was over.\n\nThe mechanics, on the other hand, I do have some issues with. The game has a really low screen resolution, and while the pixel-styled graphics lend well to the desolate world of Primordia, alt-tabbing or using the Steam overlay can be really jarring on modern systems. On several instances the game would auto-skip all dialog and sound after alt-tabbing or using the overlay; not game breaking, but a little annoying. Another problem, I feel, is that because of the game's screen resolution, item-hunting can be a pain. This really goes for the point-n-click genre in general, but finding stuff on screen can be a chore when you can't highlight everything you can interact with. That said, if you're a veteran of the genre, this shouldn't be much of a problem.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, I never felt like Primordia was unfairly obtuse or poorly designed. Crispin, Horatio's sidekick, can provide some valuable information if you're stuck, though his advice can be fairly vague at times. I did scratch my head several times, completely oblivious to a puzzle's solution, but prevailed eventually. As with other games, trying everything usually resolves the problem in the end. Also, I feel it salient to mention that certain puzzles in Primordia can be failed and the game can proceed regardless. This doesn't have much of an impact other than modifying one ending sequence\u2014the only exception occurs early on in the game, and failing this puzzle locks you out of future content. Keeping several save-states as you're playing through is recommended.\n\nMark Yohalem originally recommended that I play through Primordia, and I am certainly glad that I did (after much delay though). The dialog, and some of the atmosphere, actually reminded me of Star Control II, probably one of my all-time favorite video games: a game that combines humor, melancholy, and strong characterization. While the gameplay elements may lack in some way or other, the overall experience is rewarding and worth the time. If you've been eying the game, give Primordia a try.

My reactions were more 'Ohhh, I see!

It does fantastically with art, voice acting and plotting but falls a little short with design and original story. Still it is a fantastic game worth your time.\n\nWadjet has the production quality down.  While the visuals are still pixel-art, the quality and detail rich world are superb. Visual design is reminiscent of Mad Max, the world is a dystopian nomadic future. However, the color palette does leave you wanting as the game is entirely brown and gray.  This is understandable due to the setting being a post-apocalyptic world, but it makes places feel smaller and objects in the scene indistinguishable from one another.  That said the world is actually full of characters. NPCs move freely about with their own purpose, unrelated to the story but framing the world. \n\nGame design is closer to standard point and click than Wadjet\u2019s previous Blackwell series.  You find objects, rub two of them together and get a new object. But there are a few problems.  Pixel hunting in this game is abundant.  I had to refer to a guide multiple times only to find out there was some inconspicuous spot on screen that was clickable. This is not just a failing of the art but a failing of design. If something is vital for game progression it should be noticeable inside the massively detailed visuals. With the abundances of clickable spots and NPCs that do nothing it is easy for little things to get lost in the details. There are also some awkward quizzes that kind of pop up out of nowhere, but they are mainly for achievements. But despite that there are some interesting choices.  You have multiple solutions to problems. Some are just for variety, but others actually affect the possible endings in the game. With that in mind, choice matter, so save often.\n\nThe first part of the story plays out like a dystopian techno-fantasy, but once the setting changes to the city the style changes somewhat sharply.  The second part of the story resembles Raymond Chandler novel.  A gruff character minding his own business gets pulled into a conspiracy that only he can sort out. Also there is a dame and a bunch noir-esque characters. Overall, the themes are nothing new, you can see similar from Planet of the Apes, Mad Max, or Wall-E. Despite the un-originality of the plot, it is well written. The main character Horatio Nullbuilt has a few interesting parallels to the Shakespearian Horatio, but this time playing the lead and foil to man.  The multiple endings are quite varied.  The Characters ultimate choice for his sense of justice is entirely up to the player.  \n\nPrimordia suffers a bit from pixel hunting but overall is a fantastic game. It has great visuals, great voice acting and an interesting story where choices matter.\n", "timestamp_created": 1505578800, "timestamp_updated": 1505578800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34992195": {"recommendationid": "34992195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052805146", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505576963}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.....my mistake was that I`v waited to long to buy this....it takes you back...way back :)", "timestamp_created": 1505554466, "timestamp_updated": 1505554466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34964065": {"recommendationid": "34964065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085072474", "num_games_owned": 640, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505450504}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Point and Click adventure game.

It has an interesting beginning, a well handled middle and an ending ( and a pretty good one at that, although that depends on which ending you get). \n\nBesides been good or bad, it's always satisfying to see that the creator of the game has put as much dedication to the ending(s) of the game as the beginning. The game has a good flow all around and it (almost) never comes down. It's 97% good, which is a rare thing in itself.\nThe game has a late 1990s graphic adventure style, although it is from 2012. You can either take it or leave it. I know that's not the reason why i was interested in playing this game, and i'm really not nostalgic at all for playing a game like that.\n\nThat being said, there is a certain time for \"getting used to\" the low res graphics and full screen style, but once you are past that and well into the game, it is a very interesting story, you will forget about everything else. \nAnd that's only because the story is good, the voice acting is also good, the script is well written and feels right and compelling. And the design of the game is as much original and though out as the script, you really feel like looking, if not at least reading a visual novel of the future.\n\nHumans have disappeared from the earth. All that survives are machines built by machines from the past, the Primordium. And you are a loner, a robot living in the dunes outside the city in a broken ship that you are fixing, hoping one day,  it will fly away... but all those dreams are put on hold when suddenly one day your ship is sabotaged and the power core stolen from it. You face a slow death until your energy drains out, so you are forced to go out of your comfort zone and into the big city Metropol, in search of your missing link.\n\nIt really feels like it could work for any good movie or even a AAA game. The music also fits very nice within the game.\n\nThe puzzles are very original, as the story and for the most part are very fun when you find the solution. There are one or two exceptions, especially one certain  game of words....which at least in my case, needed and external reference to be completed, and of course that's not good at all when you have to, go looking for a clue outside the game, that's a total killer, but besides that all the rest of the puzzles are very good.\n\nThe pace of the game is very fluid, and the inclusion of a hint system built into your sidekick works very organically without ruining the game experience and the satisfaction of figuring out most of the things by yourself.\nThe story has even time to be not only serious, and funny, but also a little philosophical , posing real science fiction questions about time , technology and the future of human society.", "timestamp_created": 1503780324, "timestamp_updated": 1504418332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666796", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34467464": {"recommendationid": "34467464", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998608535", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500483780}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful story.

You're probably questioning why I would look for a walkthrough after getting so far, or actually using a walkthrough in general, and my answer is because Primordia gave me a feeling of determination, of wanting to complete the game and find out more about what's going on. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat making you desire more info, how to solve things and figure out what the outcome will be. While I did not fully enjoy the OST, I can say that it was fitting for the atmosphere of the game, and finally, the characters were well done and not boring/stale personality wise.

The Pixelation made it hard to Identify a number of things, and some of the puzzles were rather illogical.\n\nThat being said, I would recommend this game to someone who had not played it, but I would also give them a URL to a good guide because it offers few hints to aid in progression.", "timestamp_created": 1500377228, "timestamp_updated": 1500377228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33619162": {"recommendationid": "33619162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027347705", "num_games_owned": 667, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500336995}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435, \u0447\u0435\u043c \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434. \u041f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434 \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044c; \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0443\u0433\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u044d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0438, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0441\u044e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0432\u044b \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0440\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0435 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e-\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e; \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0449\u043d\u044b, \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435 \u0432 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439, \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044c \u0441 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c. \u0422\u044b \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0441\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430?

I purchased Primordia initially just because I was captivated by the games art style and aesthetic that I saw on the steam store page. The murky, decayed and organic (almost HR Giger-esque in places) qualities of the scenes and designs caught my eye immediately.\n\nIn short summary Primordia is a world run by robots - man has vanished. Everything is slowly decaying and power - the lifeblood of the machines and robots who inhabit this world - is running low.\n\nWhat first struck me when I first played the game beyond the look of it was the quality of the voice acting - especially of the lead character Horatio Nullbuilt (played by Logan Cunningham who also voice acted the narrator in Bastion). Other stand outs for me included your limb challenged sidekick good ol' Crispin, and my personal favourite the medieval old English speaking Ever-Faithful Leobuilt.\n\nThere are some deep theological questions and revelations in this game centring around the relationship between man and machine that I won't spoil here. That there are subtle parallels to our own world I also found to be clever and well executed. \n\nAlthough the tone of the game is pretty depressing, it is counterbalanced by a ton of humour - usually provided by your best friend and ever complaining sidekick Crispin. Listening to some his dialogue genuinely made me laugh (which is an achievement in itself since I'm generally a miserable b'sod).\n\nAs it is a point and click adventure game I best mention the puzzles. On the whole they are fine and make sense with a bit of lateral thinking although I did have to resort to a guide once to get past a particularly tricky one. However, in this genre of game I would accuse the developer of not making it hard enough if I wasn't having at least one instance of  being completely at a loss! I reckon it builds character...\n\nThe game has multiple ways of solving particular puzzles and also multiple ending which is nice. If you're anything like me you'll want to play through a couple of times at least to see them all.\n\nIn conclusion, I would rate Primordia as one of the best point and click adventure games I've ever played and up there right beside one of my other favourites [b] The Dig [/b]. More than that though I would rate it as one of the most enjoyable and involving games I've played for the last couple of years. I just wish there was a sequel in the works! The world, setting and characters of Primordia are too good not to revisit.\n\nIn the words of the sad robot:\n\n[i] I AM WAITING [/i]", "timestamp_created": 1500129068, "timestamp_updated": 1500151343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33544688": {"recommendationid": "33544688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282930244", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499726639}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend this game: it has endearingly well-written characters with witty lines, nice puzzles, and it's set in a universe that truly draws you in.", "timestamp_created": 1500065811, "timestamp_updated": 1500065811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33533842": {"recommendationid": "33533842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292547483", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500023962}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u201c\u98ce\u5473\u201d\u7684\u5c0f\u54c1\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u79cd\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u9519\u8fc7\u3002\n\n\u914d\u97f3\u90fd\u5f88\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e00\u76f4\u56e0\u4e3a\u6ca1\u6709\u624b\u800c\u788e\u788e\u5ff5\u7684\u5410\u69fd\u62c5\u5f53\u2014\u2014Crispin\u541b\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4e2d\u9014\u770b\u5230 abacus \u65f6\uff0c\u987f\u65f6\u611f\u89c9\u5f53\u5e74GRE\u7ea2\u5b9d\u4e66\u6ca1\u767d\u80cc\u554a\u3002\n\n\u5176\u5b9e\u5bf9\u82f1\u8bed\u8981\u6c42\u4e0d\u9ad8\u3002\u53ea\u662f\u6709\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4e0d\u505c\u987f\uff0c\u5c31\u5bb9\u6613\u6765\u4e0d\u53ca\u6d88\u5316\u3002\n\n\u653b\u7565\u662f\u5fc5\u9700\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u3002\u63a8\u8350 \u7a7a\u68a6\u6b8b\u6708in\u5e1d\u90fd \u5236\u4f5c\u7684 [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385618294]Primordia \u5168\u6210\u5c31\u6d41\u7a0b\u653b\u7565[/url]\n\n\u6211\u5728\u8fd9\u7bc7\u653b\u7565\u540e\u7684\u51e0\u6bb5\u7559\u8a00\uff0c\u5927\u5bb6\u4e5f\u8bb0\u5f97\u770b\u770b\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u6211\u5c31\u4e0d\u91cd\u590d\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u6253\u6298\u65f6\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684\uff0c\u89c9\u5f97\u5f88\u503c\u3002\n\n= \u66f4\u65b0 =\n\n\u5728\u672c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7684\u7559\u8a00\u533a\u91cc\uff0c\u8be5\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u6211\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u591a\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1500031351, "timestamp_updated": 1500085746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": "16", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33512924": {"recommendationid": "33512924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156501083", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499995961}, "language": "english", "review": "This little game is an absolute masterpiece!

Como ya habr\u00e1s visto el arte del juego es excepcional. El estilo y la calidad se mantienen a lo largo de todo el juego. La m\u00fasica no es tan llamativa, pero combina perfectamente con el arte para crear una atm\u00f3sfera l\u00fagubre, desoladora y confortable a la vez.\n\n\nAhora deber\u00e1s estar pensando \"todo muy lindo, pero \u00bfqu\u00e9 hay de la jugabilidad?\". En mi opini\u00f3n es excelente. Los puzzles son razonables pero no obvios, de manera que puede llevarte un rato darte cuenta de qu\u00e9 debes hacer, y nunca ser\u00e1 algo descabellado como en algunos juegos de anta\u00f1o. No puedes morir ni quedarte trabado, aunque ciertas acciones bloquean o habilitan distintos finales. De cualquier forma, no te olvides de que como en cualquier Point & Click en alg\u00fan momento pasar\u00e1s algo por alto y estar\u00e1s bastante tiempo hasta darte cuenta de que la soluci\u00f3n estaba a simple vista. Yo creo que esto \u00faltimo es un problema del g\u00e9nero y no del juego, y solo me sucedi\u00f3 una vez durante toda la aventura.\n\nY hablando de aventura, prep\u00e1rate para una de las mejores de tu vida. Primordia no tiene escenas de acci\u00f3n deslumbrantes ni efectos especiales, pero tiene una de las mejores historias en de ciencia ficci\u00f3n jam\u00e1s contada. Cada lugar que visitas y cada personaje que conoces dejar\u00e1 una impresi\u00f3n en ti. Al principio no hay mucho, el juego te da a conocer el ambiente y a los personajes principales, pero dale tiempo y terminar\u00e1s tan enganchado que no te sacar\u00e1n de la silla ni con una gr\u00faa.\n\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo? \u00bfA\u00fan no est\u00e1s convencido? Yo no puedo hacer mucho m\u00e1s, pero Primordia s\u00ed. La p\u00e1gina oficial del juego ofrece un demo gratis. Este abarca poco de la historia, pero creo que te dar\u00e1 la impresi\u00f3n necesaria para hacerte comprarlo. \u00bfNo sabes ingl\u00e9s o andas medio flojo?

More than a few games have speculated on the synthetic future but few are as grim a vision as Primordia. Not even the worst of the brown military shooters can match the muddy wastes and rusting towers of this title. As unappealing as that might sound it's all by design, to make the colorful characters of this adventure shine even brighter against a dim backdrop. And as long as you can get past the dark overtones, you'll find that it really is a brilliant journey.\n\nIn the barren wastes of a far-future world we find Horatio Nullbuilt, a humanoid robot who could be mistaken for a tusken raider animatronic. He and his faithful hovering companion, Crispin Horatiobuilt, reside in the ruins of an ancient aircraft that Horatio is intent on restoring to service. Those plans are interrupted in a dramatic way that leads the duo to Metropol, a decaying city of robots in service to an unseen despot. By the end of their adventure, Horatio and Crispin find themselves at the center of a social and political conflict that will determine the fate of the city.\n\nRight away, it should be apparent how much thought went into conceiving of this mechanical world. The naming conventions, the manners of speech, and even the robot designs themselves indicate a deeply developed and stylized world without humans. These robotic denizens define themselves by the builders and functions, and their personalities match to a T. Their digs are just as interesting, with wrecks and ruins re-purposed into mechanized living spaces. It's a living, breathing world of machines that don't even breathe, and the differences are striking and apparent once you get past the pleasant familiarity of the characters.\n\nI really can't say enough good things about the writing, but Lord knows I'm about to try. Plenty of adventure games stumble over stiff scripts and unnatural characters but you'll get none of that in Primordia. Horatio is an excellent mix of gruff and kindly, and his sidekick bubbles and prods in just the right ways to play off of him (and others) without becoming grating. Just the first few scenes should be enough to ingratiate them to you, an important hurdle for any character-driven game. And the supporting cast is delightfully varied and colorful as well, spanning the full range of devout mystics, shift traders, duty-bound servants, and adorable beeping things. There's creativity here that I haven't seen since Planescape: Torment which did a lot to keep me invested in the plot.\n\nOn the mechanical side, Primordia again does everything it needs to to keep the puzzles clever and moving. Your inventory allows you to examine and combine items, often with Horatio or Crispin voicing little hints about how an object can best be used. Crispin himself pulls double-duty as a source of hints and a usable object, something you would be wise to remember anytime you spot an item just out of reach. There's also a PDA-type device that tracks important puzzle info and provides a handy map, and while the display is absolutely tiny it gets the job done and is used in some clever ways on its own. At no point did I ever get stuck on any of the puzzles, despite a few that taxed my brain in unexpected ways. There's a really good logic puzzle and a tricky text parser sequence that stood out as high points in the genre, though the overall spread of puzzles is well above average.\n\nThere's not much I can level against Primordia, honestly. I mentioned that it's a grim and muddy future but the characters elevate it above that and keep all the gloom to the periphery. While the scope of the game is just as grand as it needs to be, it plays out over a pretty small number of scenes so it might feel smaller than it should. There are also some political overtones that you might not agree with when the multiple endings roll around, which is to be expected from a game whose plot is so steeped in robo-sociology but nevertheless might rub the wrong way. I'm absolutely not going to knock the art, intensely low-res though it is, because the far-future designs of the robots and their environs are absolutely fascinating to behold. The sound design is far more reserved but does what it needs to, and in particular provides some excellent voice acting throughout. Primordia is the total package, an adventure game that challenges and inspires in every aspect from its characters to its puzzles.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

I feel a great franchise could be borne from this excellent title. \n\nIf you enjoy point-and-click adventure games you really owe it to yourself to try Primordia. \n\nMy only minor complaint is that the developer did not implement a point system, like the old Sierra games had, to aid in achieving 100% completion.

As for gameplay, it's a classic point and click adventure with puzzles that generally make sense, which is much appreciated in this genre and will take you around 5 hours to complete. That might seem a bit short but I often find myself wanting to return to Primordia and, while I think there is more than enough here for you, find myself wanting more.

The puzzles were quite a challenge and getting all achievements can be tricky, but possible with only one gameplay (as is getting all the endings) but only if you save often.\n\nPlayers should check everything in the area, try to merge items in their inventories, and listen closely to Crispin's dialogues and hints. \n\nAs for the story, Primordia is very amusing game, with a very great humor and sass, fantastic voice acting and the choice of multiply endings. Not to mention that all the endings have that unique \"I did not see that coming\" aura, and getting them all had been experience. The only thing that players should really pay attention to are dialogues. They contain hints to the future and past events, and only if you listen closely (sometimes they literally tell you what is going on, and you might not even notice it). \n\nAll of the characters are unique.

In case you are interested in why this is important to be mentioned, you can find the original review below. But first for the important point:\n\nThis game has the nicest developer I have ever heard of, in my entire life. Although I couldn't enjoy this awesome game as much as I should have, he was friendly and really supportive. This review was intended to be a negative one, but after I was responded it's really not fair to give him a negativ rating. So yes, this is basically a review for the developer, not for Primordia, but I just have to point that out. If you don't believe me, check the other reviews. He literally responded to every single one, even after more than four years of service. ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989271430]Go check him out[/url])\n\nHowever, so far for this review, every single line under here is what matters according to my view on the game. Thanks for reading until here. [/quote]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[quote=Titanic21][/quote]\n[quote]You may hate me for this review, just as a warning.[/quote]\n[quote]I know that the pixelart style was created on purpose, but a game doesn\u00b4t get good by looking like it\u00b4s retro or whatever they meant to. I don\u00b4t mean that it\u00b4s a bad game, please no, Primordia has a rich story, good gameplay and awesome sound design. But also... bad graphics. I am conscious about this game was intended to look like this and I don\u00b4t want to say that Primordia requires cinematic graphics. Point and Click games usually don\u00b4t look astonishing, that\u00b4s not important for the genre. But in this case it\u00b4s a little worse. I am almost sorry that I have to complain about this game, which is nice in all other aspects, but the graphics are what makes Primordia really less enjoyable. Eventually it\u00b4s NOT helpful for solving puzzles when all objects look the same and you have to find them by slowly moving your cursor all over the screen, as if this was a hidden-object-game. It\u00b4s hard to even recognize the textures and by looking closer you\u00b4ll get more confused than you already are. I bought this because I like point \u00b4n click games a lot, and I have to admit that Primordia looked a lot better in the trailer. I wish the developers would have designed this more like Daedalic would have done, instead of Lucas Arts\u00b4 way, so that I could enjoy the game. The harder I try, the more I see how pointless it is. Playing such an awesome game is exhausting if you can\u00b4t clearly detect important elements.

Syberia is a great example of this, though it fails in other regards)\n\nb)  Puzzles that are challenging, but intuitive (point-n-clicks RARELY get the 'intuitive part'...I'm looking at you Longest Journey).\n\nc) Good voice acting (if they are not text-based) and dialogue.\n\nd) Memorable characters (yes Myst...your puzzles were lovely, but there was no one there!!!)\n\ne) A cool mechanic (you know, like the time-turning or the pill-popping\u2026ala Fran Bow and others)\n\nf) Consequences (if not, choices are meaningless, and point-n-clicks are the perfect medium for giving players choices that matter).\n\nGiven these personal metrics, I must give this game high marks in all categories.  \n\na) 9/10.  Many folks may disagree. I admit, I was skeptical when I saw screen shots of the game...it looked dated and drab.  But the music and the voice-work mixed with the pixelated brown and reds...somehow it worked beautifully. The style perfectly suited the story.  I thought it was an absolutely beautiful game, with its own unique atmosphere.  Nothing else is quite like it.\n\nb) 8/10 \u2013 Seriously, this is the first point and click game where I said \u201cwell, if I really had these things, this is what I would do\u201d and lo and behold\u2026it was the solution!!!  Plus, there was a fun mix of number-based, logic-based, and text-based puzzles.  The only downside is that I wish there were more!!  And to be fair, not all were challenging\u2026it is a pretty easy game.  But I was never bored or frustrated, so I consider it a win!\n\nc) 10/10 \u2013 loved every single voice.  And\u2026I mean\u2026they are robots.  And somehow, this game had better voice acting than 90% of the games out there!\n\nd) 8/10 \u2013 Loved the leads, loved the sides, loved that one lone guy (*sniff*).  More interaction would have allowed better character development for side characters\u2026but it is just a point and click game after all.  The banter is spot-on!\n\ne) 6/10 \u2013 you get a sidekick who helps you out. Nothing to write home about\u2026although\u2026to be fair\u2026he is a really awesome sidekick personality-wise!! \n\nf) Yup.  Consequences and multiple endings.  Woohoo!! (I don\u2019t want to score this part\u2026just wanted to cheer for the effort!)\n\nCons?  Not much.  It is a good time for the price. It is a little short\u2026but it is not \u201cempty\u201d.

There is a way to \"resize\" the original 300xsomething resolution and get a nice 1200xsth window without losing quality of detail. (Settings are changed using a separate exe file located in the installation folder)\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is fantastic. You immerse yourself into a beautifully done post-apocalyptic world filled with dust, junk and characters with their own personalities, thoughts, beliefs and so on. It is a well-thought world based on one of the possible continuations of mankind's history. The game offers multiple completely different endings affected by your interpretation of the world and events around you.\n\nThe puzzles are fun to solve, you can get hints if you get stuck and there is only a couple of moments when the solution felt not 100% logical to me personally.

To be short, I believe this game is more than worth the price and provides enough to be recommended to veterans of the genre and people unfamiliar with point-and-clicks alike. Without further ado, let's dive into it.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\n[i]\"Man built us to build, Crispin.\" -Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5.[/i]\n\nThe world of Primordia is one of the most original sci-fi settings I've seen in video games thus far. Humanity is long gone and the almost uninhabitable Earth is populated with robots built by other robots. Very few, if any, remember who humans were. Some worship \"Man, the All-Builder\" in their memory, others believe they were just a myth. Power is scarce in the wasteland and those who still function must do what they can to survive. The nature of the world is shown very well and sets an unforgettable mood for the whole adventure.\n\n[i]\"All of this for a b'soding power core!\" -Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5.[/i]\n\nThe plot starts simply: you, Horatio Nullbuilt, lose the power core of your ship to a mysterious intruder. Facing certain death from slowly running out of power, you pursue the thief and get involved in mysteries far beyond your understanding. The adventure is quite interesting and, while the plot twists are somewhat predictable and the mystery isn't too hard to solve, the tension and tone of the game keep you on your toes, wanting to explore the mysteries of insane ancient robots, Man himself, and a city of glass and light whose promises of free power seem just too good to be true.\n\n[i]\"Why is everyone we meet crazy?\" -Crispin Horatiobuilt, version 1[/i]\n\nThe characters are by far the most interesting part of the story. Despite being robots, pretty much all of them are relatable and believable. From our sarcastic sidekick Crispin and a devout Humanist preacher named Ever-Faithful to a pair of upper-class robots trying to settle a legal dispute and a warbot who encrypted his own logic to deal with the horrors of the war, the cast is diverse to say the least. There were a few who I've found to be a bit bland and one-sided (Clarity and the main villain for example), but those were few and far between.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\n[i]\"Are you really trying to build us an energy sensor from a bunch of garbage?\"\n\"Crispin, I built [b]you[/b] from a bunch of garbage.\"\n\"From spare parts, boss! Spare parts!\"\n-Crispin and Horatio[/i]\n\nThe gameplay is standard for the genre: pick up stuff, combine stuff, use stuff to solve puzzles. In addition to that, when you can't reach something yourself or simply need some help, you can use your floating companion Crispin, who also acts as the game's hint system. Perhaps the biggest strength of the game here is that the puzzles integrate well into the story. The hints make sense as actual conversation, the solutions are usually as straight-forward and practical as possible, and the characters react adequately during these situations. There were only one or two cases of \"pixel hunting\" in the whole game so that is a big plus as well.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n\n[i]\"Look at all those lights! It's amazing boss!\"\n\"It's trouble. Trust me.\"\n\"Sweet, sweet trouble.\"\n-Crispin and Horatio[/i]\n\nThe world and the characters are both beautifully crafted. There are many games these days that use pixel art, but Primordia took it as a challenge rather than a cop out. The game is simply gorgeous. The only negative thing I can say about its look is that the characters have very few sprite animations and the reuse becomes noticeable in a few scripted events. The music is similarly amazing. I still remember the track that plays when you read the Gospel of Man. Finally, the voice acting. In case you haven't noticed from the trailer, the voice of Horatio Nullbuilt is Logan Cunningham, the main voice actor in Transistor and Bastion. His work is as top notch as it is in those games and the other VAs are quite good as well. All in all, presentation is one of the game's strongest points, perhaps even more so than the story.\n\n[h1]Possible negatives[/h1]\n\n[i]\"It jes needs a little fixin' up, tyro.\" -L.S.[/i]\n\n- The game is quite short. Depending on how much you explore and how quick you are with the puzzles, it will most likely take you between 6 and 10 hours to complete.\n- There are some technical difficulties. The game forces you to a pretty low resolution due to the engine limitations and alt-tabbing can cause voice over to break. Also some of the achievements may be bugged. A few people reported not getting achievements when they should, I on the other hand got a final achievement while still missing two very important parts of the ending.\n- You can solve a few of the puzzles in a multitude of ways, but these \"choices\" may have long-lasting consequences that are not properly telegraphed.\n- Most puzzles are logical but a few are still obscure. For example, the game never tells you that something inside your inventory can be disassembled.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAll in all, Primordia is a great game with a fantastic story and amazing presentation. The not too difficult gameplay might leave a few veterans of the genre slightly disappointed, but it makes the game accessible for people not usually interested in point-and-clicks as well, and the story more than makes up for it anyway. While the game is short, the price is very generous and I'd say Primordia uses the play time it does have very well. This one is a definite recommendation from me.\n\n[i]\"Farewell, farewell, linger not for my sake. Your mission is calling!

One of my favorites is a fairly minor character that speaks in a religious cadence, and it's just such a cool little scene, it really stuck with me.\n-The characters are diverse and incredibly easy to become attached to. They are so well written, that you could name a character from hearing just a TINY snippet of their dialogue.\n-There are some truly genius puzzles here that absolutely blew me away. \n-The art is pretty breathtaking. The whole game feels alien and strange, but a familiar shadow seems to hang over it. It's just fucking great.\n\nMeh:\n-The voice acting for both Horatio and Crispin, the two main characters, is a little...off. Horatio I kind of got used to, and his monotone drone ended up being more part of his personality than anything, but Crispin has some pretty well-written lines that are delivered pretty awkwardly, and I found him pulling me back out of the game a little bit every so often. That being said, Crispin is delightful, if a tad annoying.\n-Some of the puzzles are absolutely rediculous, with some of them being outright pixelhunting. With as intelligent as the rest of the game is, it makes these puzzles even HARDER, because you expect the answer to make more sense. For instance (No spoilers here, don't worry.)\n     There is a part of the game where your path is impeded, and the answer is the first thing that comes to your mind: \"Crispin should just move that.\" And that is, indeed, the answer to that quandry.\n     There's a part where you need to find an item, but you aren't told where it can be found or where to start. Had to resort to a walkthrough on this one, because the answer lay in a very cluttered, dark area of the screen. You never think \"This game will resort to pixel hunting\", because the rest of the game is just...too well thought out.\n\nSo most of my complaints are \"Come on, Primordia, you're BETTER than this!\", which should absolutely tell you something. How this isn't a HUGELY known game is beyond me.\n\nIn conclusion: Buy it, you son of a bitch.", "timestamp_created": 1483508784, "timestamp_updated": 1483508784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28984116": {"recommendationid": "28984116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134826622", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483469089}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u044f \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433 \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043b\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 0/10", "timestamp_created": 1483469229, "timestamp_updated": 1483469229, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.134411", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28967326": {"recommendationid": "28967326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117485389", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483390644}, "language": "english", "review": "Primordia has an expansive world, engrossing story, and characters that are endearing.

My heater was broken, it was freezing outside. But this wonderful adventure had hooked me. The world is one of the best-presented I've ever seen. The characters are very well presented to make you curious for more. I just wanted to spend more time exploring this world. It's also filled with humor that lightens up the somber setting, it's difficult to explain just how well the combination works.\n\nThe puzzles themselves vary in quality, with some doing a great job in feeling like you're just solving problems that would exist in the world rather than an arbitrary roadblock by the developers. Others... Not so much. One particular puzzle stands out as an example of this problem (slight spoiler warning, though I won't give the answer)\n\nYou need two different objects that can obstruct a vent. The first is easily gained by cutting off the tip of a robot's finger. However, the game doesn't allow you to cut off the tip of another finger for the second item. This is a frustrating limitation, and can easily lead to resenting the puzzle. The fact that important objects are often indistinguishable from the background only adds to the frustration.\n\nHOWEVER, and I can't stress this enough, while this kind of uneven quality in puzzles should suck the fun out of an adventure game... It doesn't. The rest of the world is too entrancing. It single-handedly rekindled my love of adventure games. I bring up these drawbacks to help emphasize how truly great the rest of the experience is, that even these issues don't sour it.\n\nTLDR; If you're considering buying this game, do so. Do it now.

As a fan of both, I was very satisfied. It's a smart story excellently told with top-notch writing and art. Kudos to the devs for having the game run in super-low resolution - no accidental ruining of the retro feel by hi-res glows or particle effects. You want retro? This is retro. The art direction is consistent right down to the screen resolution.\n\nAs a game... not so much. See, it's an adventure game, and that means exactly what you think it means. Personally, I bought it for half-off and after the first 40 minutes or so I opened up a guide - so much more enjoyable! The writing is witty, the world-building is amazing, the story unfolds with perfect timing... why be bogged down with \"find the hidden active zone in the dozen screens you have access to\" or \"use X on Y in order to use X, Y, and Z together, no other combination works\"? Those games are dumb. When you actually have all the items and clues the puzzles are usually not stupid, but you never really know if you do - the fundamental failing of adventure games. Don't put yourself through that just to get at the good stuff. Keep a walkthrough open and peek at it any time you're starting to get the slightest doubt on how to proceed.\n\nI am not the kind of person who usually goes into games for storytelling, but I am a sucker for sci-fi and an even bigger sucker for noir, so this was totally worth it.

It's smart, well-illustrated, and presents a compelling story. The writers took care to build an internally consistent world complete with mythology and believable motives. It's a world I would not be dissappointed to return to in a follow-up title. \n\nThere is an obvious retro-feel that permeates not only the art style, but also the story and game-mechanic. Primordia's writing reminds me of 1980s robot sci-fi including a few text-based games from that era. The art is clearly influenced by visual work from that period including Lynch's Dune. There are multiple endings, and I enjoyed that the best of them still presented a dark and morally clouded set of choices for the main character.\n\nThe only criticism I have of Primordia is the same criticism I have of similar point-and-click games; many of the inventory combinations and item uses are not intuitive and are occassionally inconsistent. Also, while the side-kick character was a wise choice for an in-game hint system, his personality occassionally feels out of place.

It could be a little bit longer maybe but I guess I can still give it a second run later - with the developer commentary turned on and with trying to find out the solution for a few \"side stories\" i missed.  Puzzles and solutions did make sense which was quite refreshing. In a whole game there was only one point where I really needed to look the solution up*.\n\nSometimes the game engine is a little choppy, especially in scenes with parallax scrolling attempts, which is funny with all the power computers have nowadays. I see the 320*200 -ish resolution is kind of intentional \"retro style\" but the engine does not have to :). After seeing some concept art which obviously was not low-res I even wonder whether it would harm the game If it was made in high resolution... The current result is still fine. So, I guess it was not the worst decision anyway.\n\nAll in all, a very good adventure game. With the current Steam sale price any adventure games lover should give it a try.\n\n* [spoiler]The kiosk \"puzzle\": Art? Seriously, ART?

Each dialogue feels thought out and unique.\n\nThe graphics are very reminiscent to those of Fallout 1: pixelated and low-resolution with dark brownish tones, which is tolerable since they seemed to be aiming for the retro theme. The only exception is the handful of brief cutscenes presenting very detailled close-ups of the action, which help with the immersion. The soundtrack is atmospheric and blends well with the setting. The voice acting is truely amazing.\n\nThere's even some replayability value for those who wish try the commentary mode.\n\n[b]So in short;[/b] for a 7 hour game with a good storyline and challenging puzzles paired with immersive soundtrack and great voice-acting, the pricetag is well worth the experience.", "timestamp_created": 1482992451, "timestamp_updated": 1482992451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28768529": {"recommendationid": "28768529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034172959", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511554415}, "language": "english", "review": "Primordia is a point 'n click developed by Wormwood Studios which provides a good storyline, well-written dialogues, old-school graphics, an atmosphere somewhere between Machinarium and Blade Runner and a cool soundtrack by Nathaniel Chambers.

Die Handlung entwickelt sich durch das L\u00f6sen von R\u00e4tseln, kombinieren von n\u00fctzlichen Gegenst\u00e4nden, sowie den Entscheidungen \u00fcber das falsche oder richtige Handeln. \n\nWorum gehts?\nDer mysteri\u00f6se Android Horatio und sein kleiner Gehilfe Crispin durchstreifen ein postapokalyptisches Szenario in einer W\u00fcste. Woher sie kommen und welches Ziel sie verfolgen bleibt ungekl\u00e4rt. Was ist mit dieser ehemals fortschrittlichen Welt passiert, von der nur Ruinen \u00fcbrig geblieben sind?

Die Dialoge haben mich oft zum lachen gebracht weil Horatio und Crispin ein wunderbares Team sind (was sich liebt das neckt sich). Als alter Hase darf ich das sagen: die 90er Atmosph\u00e4re wirkt NICHT aufgesetzt, ganz im Gegenteil. Ich habe mich dabei erwischt wie ich das Release Datums des Spiels \u00fcberpr\u00fcft habe, um sicher zu gehen. \nDas einzige was mich frustriert hat waren die kn\u00fcppelharten R\u00e4tsel. Nachdem ich Stunden umher geirrt bin habe ich einen Blick in die Ausl\u00f6sung geworfen nur um fest zu stellen dass ich da wohl nie selbst drauf gekommen w\u00e4re... dies ist jedoch ein sehr pers\u00f6nlicher Kritikpunkt. \nWer also auf dystopische gruselige Sci-Fi Geschichten mit schwarzen Humor steht sollte vielleicht ein paar ruhige Abende investieren um die Welt von Primordia zu erforschen.

But wow, I wasn't expecting it to be [i]that[/i] great, either.\n\nObviously, most of the reviewers around here have already described the game much better than a non-native English speaker ever could, though it never hurts to praise a masterpiece. And as with any other masterpiece, it doesn't seem necessary to break it down to individual components and discuss whether the mechanics lack gunplay. The only thing that matters here is the feeling, what it's like to live through the story of Primordia.\n\nYou know when you're close to finishing a book so good you almost don't want to read the last few pages? It's as if a significant part of your life is about to be taken, and you try to savor every single word there's left. Oh boy, I still remember the devastation I felt as a kid when 'Pippi Longstocking' ended. [spoiler](don't judge me, I love that book)[/spoiler] A horrible yet extremely satisfying moment of experiencing something beautiful and important. And it's exactly what a quality adventure game should be \u2013 a book you will never forget.\n\nPrimordia bears this very feeling in its core logic. Its world, consisting of rust and despair, might not be of the attractive kind, but the minute you dive into it, you'll have enough reasons to stay. It is surprisingly smart, detailed, vivid and, even less expectedly, highly amusing thanks to the characters populating it. Despite the depressing tones, the amount of intelligent humour makes it one of the most likeable worlds in the recent adventure games history.\n\nNo wonder leaving it is incredibly hard. I found myself thinking, \"This is not enough! Why would you end it so soon? I want more!\" and loading random saves to listen to random dialogues once again. But while Primordia surely is a short experience, I doubt making it longer would've made any difference. You just can't have enough of worlds like this one. \n\nPrimordia is indeed a hidden gem of the genre. Well, not really hidden anymore, but it definitely is something that deserves more attention. Every piece of attention you can afford, to be precise.\n\nThank you, Mark.

[/h1]\n\n[i] Primordia [/i] is here to answer that question. This amazing point-and-click game takes place on a dystopian Earth at an unspecified point in history. The few humans that remain have fled underground, living in low-g bunkers and looking at a once-green Earth through pictures and little garden chambers. Over the years, we have faded into myth, and now the Earth is ruled by our creations, some of who worship our memory as a creed called \"Humanism.\"\n\nYou are Horatio Nullbuilt, a wasteland-dwelling robot of undeterminate origin whose only companion is Crispin Horatiobuilt, a floating, armless robot with an endless supply of sarcastic remarks. Together, they lived a pretty uneventful life. They were trying to fix up a crashed airship, a relic of the long-forgotten War of the Four Cities, so they could at last fly away from the Dunes and go wherever they want. Unfortunately, their progress is halted when a mysterious robot named Scraper shows up and \"plunders\" their power core--an item they cannot survive without. When trying to find power in the Dunes fails, they have no choice but to travel to Metropol, the last city, where their power core has been taken. To make matters worse, an anceint robot named MetroMind has claimed your power core for the betterment of the city, since it is crumbling under her inept rule and she needs all the power she can get.\n\nFrom there, it is up to you how the story ends. Choose carefully, your every move has consequences.\n\nThe voice-acting is masterfully done. Every character is unique and full of personality. The story and lore are very well-crafted as well. Unraveling the mystery of the world you're in never fails to be fascinating, and if you play through it just right, the ending is beautiful and cathartic.\n\nLike my review?

It is a classic point & click adventure game set a in post-apocalyptic world with stunning and handcrafted pixel art, outstanding narration and one of the most atmospheric soundtracks you will ever encounter.[/b]\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1] Each place you visit during the game offers very well-drawn and thematic pixel art with a good animation quality. More importantly, everything offers a feel of authenticity, which keeps you immersed in this post-apocalyptic sci-fi world.\n\n[h1]Sound, Music & Voice:[/h1] The soundeffects are very decent for a point & click game. What really outshines all else are the soundtrack and the narration. The soundtrack is the most immersive and fitting I've ever encountered in this genre. It has around 40 (!) different tracks, which is very rare to see for such a game. The narration of the two main characters is very well done and their lines vary between fitting, serene and often amusing. In fact, it was so well done that I had to listen to the hints despite having solved a puzzle, just to hear all they had to say!\n\n[h1]Gameplay & Story:[/h1] You control two robot companions, stranded in a post-apocalyptic world, where man has perished and become a myth. Your task is to solve different puzzles in the typical point & click style. Your goal is to repair your broken down ship and leave this world. You will visit different locations within the gameworld to find objects and solve puzzles which consist in many cases of applying one or two items to a certain location. Many of the puzzles are challenging but fair. Only for a few I had to go 'pixel hunting' and click everything on the screen to find what I was looking for. Should you have trouble solving a puzzle, your trusty robot companion at your side will always have a few hints for you ready!\nThe world is incredibly well built and the story kept me glued to the screen until I reached one of the many endings after around 12 hours.\n\n[h1]Funfactor:[/h1] I enjoyed this game more than any other point & click adventure game I have ever played. In my opinion it even outshines the well praised Machinarium. Minor gripes were some technical issue while trying to launch the game for the first time.\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1][b]MUST BUY![/b] Amazing world, story, pixel art, narration and soundtrack.

Couple spots you might still need pen and paper to work something out, though.\n>Hot keys for menu stuff\n>Does a good job getting into your thought processes - a few puzzles with multiple solutions, some puzzles animated to let you try something even though it doesn't actually work.\n>Flavor text - if you like subtle characterization and banter, you can look at most everything for description stuff.\n>Multiple saves - Save whenever you want however much you like.\n\nCons:\n>Can't easily get out of item use - have to go into inventory to get your regular cursor back (hot key makes it bearable)\n>Some pixel hunting - at least one puzzle where you need to notice a small, muddy colored item in a dark, muddy colored area\n>Hints aren't always helpful - sometimes it hints what you know you need to find, not how or where to find it. Other times it's so obtuse that it's really no help at all.\n>One or two puzzles that use a game feature only once - ran into one that required using the describe feature, which I didn't know was there and which had never been necessary to get info about items or progress puzzles before then.\n>Loading issue - due to the chosen game engine, can't load saves past your 20th most recent save.

One time you try to search the junk and your character says there's nothing in there of interest, next time you find something in there. When I get told: \"This is all crap\", then I dont expect this to magically transform suddenly to the puzzle solution. Games usually separate between useless and useful. The useless is for decoration mostly. These NPCs are called \"workers\", so there's not much to gain from them, but one of them has a name, so the player knows he's useful to progress in the story. These items are used to progress, others are just junk, decoration and so on. Usually the main character makes clear quickly what they are. You know you can look at them but never use them. I hate when a game shits on this and abuses well etablished ways for orientation as some kind of puzzle.\n\nLots of the stuff in the inventory looks like the weird crap it is, how do I know how I am supposed to use it? So I just try everything with everything until something works, and if nothing does, I just try everything in my inventory on everything in the outside world, which sometimes is a problem because the developers thought it's fun to search for hot spots.\n\nUsually adventure games have a button to reveal them, not here though. I don't like pixelhunting at all, and I think old games, especially adventures, were mostly way too cryptic and way too complicated. I don't even call it hard, for me it's simply bad game design when you are clueless of what to do next once again. I wouldn't use bad game design as example of how to make a game unnecessarily complicated.\n\nUsually in games you can figure out by some logical thinking - where do I go from here? What can I try? What item could go with which item? What am I doing AT ALL and WHY? Why am I accessing a giant robot again? Why like this? Why do I have to access a bomb again that also is a religious shrine somehow AND a powercore? Why again do I have to attach graphite to a cat with granny's panty hose to blow up a mailbox?? \n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. I've played games where every next step makes sense through the WHOLE GAME and not only a few parts. It's not that the puzzles in Primordia are super hard to solve, it's just an overload of stuff. Especially of numbers. I think using plenty of numbers/codes is the lame way to create difficulty. Add some annoying minigames, like power cord connection and machine assembling. Ugh. Hand me the walkthrough! \n\n\nDespite that, the game has great atmosphere, really good voice acting, I like the humor and sound design, and I'd still recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1476052708, "timestamp_updated": 1476053983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25956955": {"recommendationid": "25956955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071417386", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476052003}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice story :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1476052107, "timestamp_updated": 1476052107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25956281": {"recommendationid": "25956281", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972249735", "num_games_owned": 644, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476059068}, "language": "english", "review": "This is actually a pretty decent game with a decent story - about robots!\n\nI only have two gripes: it doesn't have a sufficiently high resolution for my monitor, and 2 or 3 times I got a bug where the conversations were just flickering up (though this was easily resolved by reloading the autosave).", "timestamp_created": 1476049227, "timestamp_updated": 1477339815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25956166": {"recommendationid": "25956166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106342518", "num_games_owned": 847, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479989914}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome! 10/10 for me.

I'm terrible to review the story part.\n\n= glitchs and bugs\nthere are some minor bugs and glitch on this game, but it's not severe or annoying, it's just there and it wont stop you to continue to play this game, just some quick freezing that you almost don't notice all the time and other rare glitches.\n\nCONS\n- Games length\nI do admit, it does make the game longer since you have to figure out the puzzles, but when you finish the game on first time, you just know almost all of it and you can just blow this game maybe almost under of hour, unless you think there is still something missing in it.\n\nCONCLUSION\nI really like this game, too bad it is short, but it did took me over 5 hour to pass it first time and it is pretty addicting since I did played nonstop from 22:00 PM to 4:30 AM.\nIt has only one cons in my opinion and that is not even a huge problem and I think this game pretty great since art style is beautiful and progression interesting on it.\n\nIn other words, this game is worth for your attention if you like point and click games.\n\nWelp, that's all for now.\n\nDoktor Greenman, logging out.", "timestamp_created": 1475890287, "timestamp_updated": 1475890287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25914585": {"recommendationid": "25914585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083576124", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475884205}, "language": "english", "review": "a very good and enjoyable game with very challenging yet satisfying puzzles ...\n\n... if you keep in mind that:\n- there is a balkony to the right in engineering\n- there is an area to right of cars\n- you need to RIGHT click the tower door (left wont cut it)", "timestamp_created": 1475885360, "timestamp_updated": 1475885360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25912872": {"recommendationid": "25912872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126868637", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484858581}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a little late on this one but I just felt the need to leave a review on it.\n\nI grew up playing point&click adventure games, and I played pretty much all of the 90's classics, so unfortunatly nowadays it can be quite hard for me to find a game that keeps up with the expectations I have for this kind of games but I can tell you that Primordia is on par with the best games of this genre. \nIt's a blast of joy and nostalgia to play a title like this that makes me feel like a kid again exploring a new awesome unknown world.\n\nPrimordia has a Beneath a Steel Sky vibe to it that instantly got me hooked, but even if you didn't play any of the older point&click titles Primordia would be a great place to start because it's so damn charming!\n\nThe story of the game is engaging and well-written, the soundtrack and voice-acting is great, the characters are memorable and make you feel attached to them.\nThe game puzzles are not too hard but they offer a good challenge, although this may vary from person to person depending on the experience you have with this genre.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is that the game is a bit short but the multiple endings and achievements give Primordia a good degree of replayabilty that other games lack.\n\nThis game is a MUST-PLAY, and I just want to thank Wormwood Studios and Wadjet Eye Games for this amazing experience.", "timestamp_created": 1475877978, "timestamp_updated": 1480108858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584906", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25912626": {"recommendationid": "25912626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034086983", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475992953}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic", "timestamp_created": 1475877087, "timestamp_updated": 1475877087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25906652": {"recommendationid": "25906652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018042499", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475811809}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was surprisingly amazing.

The past years I haven't had much patience for these kinds of games (even though I used to love them) mostly because I can rarely get engaged enough with the story and characters to keep playing and paying attention to long conversations. In Primordia every single piece of dialogue is very interesting and mysterious, revealing more about the world and its history, or it's just plain witty and funny. The puzzles are great too, very intuitive most of the time. The hint system is pretty good too, not breaking immersion and sometimes just the right push in the right direction.

A tem\u00e1tica do jogo \u00e9 p\u00f3s-apocal\u00edptica, toda a humanidade foi exterminada da face da terra e tudo o que sobrou foram os rob\u00f4s que os seres humanos constru\u00edram, e tamb\u00e9m os rob\u00f4s que foram constru\u00eddos por outros rob\u00f4s. Os pr\u00f3prios rob\u00f4s s\u00e3o a \u00fanica for\u00e7a na terra que os mant\u00e9m sobre opera\u00e7\u00e3o, eles se auto reparam e at\u00e9 constroem outros rob\u00f4s a partir de partes de coletadas dos escombros e lixo do mundo. Como o menos complexo e menos avan\u00e7ado n\u00e3o pode gerar o mais complexo e  mais avan\u00e7ado, isso gera uma cadeia de degenera\u00e7\u00e3o em que os rob\u00f4s v\u00e3o ficando mais decr\u00e9pitos e desgastados com cada gera\u00e7\u00e3o conforme eles pr\u00f3prios caminham, lentamente, para serem tamb\u00e9m finalmente apagados da exist\u00eancia junto de seus criadores humanos.\n\nVoc\u00ea experiencia a est\u00f3ria atrav\u00e9s dos olhos de (Ou o termo correto seriam receptores oculares?) Horatio Nullbuilt, um rob\u00f4 eremita que habita uma aeronave destru\u00edda no meio do deserto. O objetivo de Horatio \u00e9 restaurar sua nave, ele tem o sonho de voar, mas o n\u00facleo de for\u00e7a da nave \u00e9 roubado de Horatio por um rob\u00f4 coletador; Scrapper. Nisso Horatio \u00e9 for\u00e7ado a perseguir esse inimigo para tentar recuperar seu n\u00facleo de for\u00e7a, vital para tanto o funcionamento da nave como para o abastecimento de energia do pr\u00f3prio Horatio, sem o n\u00facleo Horatio pararia de funcionar.\n\nO jogo tem um ambiente pesado e triste, a arte do jogo tem uma qualidade muito alta; os personagens e o plano de fundo dos ambientes s\u00e3o todos muito bem desenhados, o jogo tem toda uma est\u00e9tica bem original e muito bonita. Toda essa qualidade nas ilustra\u00e7\u00f5es do jogo refor\u00e7am a atmosfera s\u00f3lida de tristeza e desola\u00e7\u00e3o que o jogo exala.\n\nEssa qualidade est\u00e9tica do jogo sofre, todavia, n\u00e3o por erros do desenhista das sprites e background arts; mas sim por limites relacionados a engine do jogo. Como eu mencionei, Primordia foi feito na Adventure Game Studio e essa engine \u00e9 muito antiga e tem limita\u00e7\u00f5es muito extremas para os padr\u00f5es atuais, a mais gritante delas sendo a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o de tela muito baixa. Durante as cutscenes em que o foco se aproxima mais do personagens \u00e9 poss\u00edvel ver claramente como a qualidade da arte do jogo \u00e9 muito maior do que a baixa resolu\u00e7\u00e3o nativa nos permite enxergar.\n\nApesar da premissa deprimente de Primordia, o tom geral dele \u00e9 muito menos \"pra baixo\" do que ele poderia ter sido. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m muitos momentos c\u00f4micos entrela\u00e7ados na hist\u00f3ria gra\u00e7as aos di\u00e1logos entre o personagem principal, Horatio, e o seu fiel companheiro que ele pr\u00f3prio construiu; Crispin. Enquanto Horatio faz o papel do personagem mais s\u00e9rio, Crispin \u00e9 o personagem mais engra\u00e7ado que faz varios coment\u00e1rios engra\u00e7ados sobre os eventos e outros personagens os quais os nossos her\u00f3is encontram durante sua aventura. Esse tom de com\u00e9dia ajuda muito a aliviar o peso da premissa do jogo, tanto para o bem e para mal que isso implica.\n\nOs personagens do jogo s\u00e3o todos eles muito interessantes e bem escritos. Crispin, por exemplo, recebe atrav\u00e9s do arco de sua hist\u00f3ria majoritariamente marcada por momentos engra\u00e7ados um desenvolvimento surpreendentemente s\u00e9rio e heroico no final. A pr\u00f3pria antagonista do jogo \u00e9 um personagem bem equilibrado no sentido de que, apesar de suas a\u00e7\u00f5es parecerem mal\u00e9volas a primeira vista, ela tem raz\u00f5es l\u00f3gicas e razo\u00e1veis para agir da forma que age e faz v\u00e1rios argumentos at\u00e9 bem fundados.\n\nExistem muitos outros personagens \u00fanicos e memor\u00e1veis no jogo tamb\u00e9m, mas o que pessoalmente mais me cativou foi um que participou muito pouco da hist\u00f3ria, o apropriadamente nomeado; Sad Robot. Ele \u00e9 um rob\u00f4 de programa\u00e7\u00e3o aparentemente corrompida, ou extremamente simpl\u00f3ria, que espera solit\u00e1rio e paciente por algo que nunca vai acontecer e \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel fazer ele perceber e entender isto. Achei ele algo metaf\u00f3rico da condi\u00e7\u00e3o humana.\n\nDe fato os personagens que povoam o mundo do jogo brilham tanto que ofuscam o personagem principal. O Horatio, personagem principal, em si pode at\u00e9 n\u00e3o ser o personagem mais interessante da trama, mas enquanto protagonista; enquanto her\u00f3i, a\u00ed sim ele pode ser tamb\u00e9m visto sobre angulos interessantes quando comparado com os her\u00f3is de outros v\u00eddeo games. Horatio \u00e9 quase um anti-her\u00f3i, ele n\u00e3o est\u00e1 afim de aventura, ele n\u00e3o quer salvar o mundo, ele n\u00e3o usa da for\u00e7a bruta e nunca parte pra briga, ele n\u00e3o tem interesse em matar nenhum vil\u00e3o; ele \u00e9 simplesmente algu\u00e9m que quer sobreviver e restaurar a sua aeronave, para completar ambos esses objetivos ele precisa resgatar um item que lhe foi roubado.\n\nA est\u00f3ria do jogo \u00e9 definitivamente o ponto mais forte, ela \u00e9 marcada por personagens carism\u00e1ticos e \u00fanicos. A atmosfera do jogo \u00e9 segurada bem firmemente pela alta qualidade da m\u00fasica e da arte visual e do voice acting, e o conjunto desses elementos \u00e9 algo que fortalece ainda mais o efeito de uma est\u00f3ria que por si s\u00f3 j\u00e1 \u00e9 interessante e bem escrita. Analisando ela do come\u00e7o ao fim \u00e9 poss\u00edvel ver como ela foi bem pensada e tamb\u00e9m bem realizada, os eventos s\u00e3o amarrados de maneira muito boa atrav\u00e9s da trama, coisas que os personagens dizem no come\u00e7o da aventura se tornam muito mais significantes \u00e0 luz dos eventos no final do jogo. Os mon\u00f3logos que os personagens lan\u00e7am nos v\u00e1rios finais poss\u00edveis s\u00e3o altamente reflexivos e bem escritos e refletem bem a perspetiva dos personagens atrav\u00e9s dos eventos que se passaram. Se trata obviamente de uma est\u00f3ria que foi escrita com muito amor e esmero.\n\nOs \u00fanicos pontos verdadeiramente negativos que eu tenho contra o game est\u00e3o contidos no seu gameplay: At\u00e9 os melhores games point-and-click sempre tem esse ou aquele quebra-cabe\u00e7a que n\u00e3o faz sentido absolutamente nenhum, geralmente resultado de o jogador ter que usar de uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o que requer uma l\u00f3gica totalmente absurda que s\u00f3 fez sentido na cabe\u00e7a do designer. \u00c9 nesse quebra-cabe\u00e7a maldito em que voc\u00ea vai agarrar e n\u00e3o conseguir progredir mais na hist\u00f3ria sem consultar um 'walkthrough' na internet. Quando voc\u00ea tem que fazer isso, voc\u00ea inevitavelmente se sente menos investido no gameplay do jogo. O Primordia em si faz at\u00e9 um bom trabalho em impedir que o jogador tenha que consultar a internet para se desagarrar de um puzzle, faz isso usando um sistema de dicas atrelado ao seu parceiro Crispin. Todavia, houve um puzzle relacionado a um terminal em que eu simplesmente n\u00e3o vi l\u00f3gica absolutamente nenhuma e a dica que o Crispin deu em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a ele foi praticamente in\u00fatil, mesmo depois de ter olhado a solu\u00e7\u00e3o na internet eu ainda fiquei sem ver como \u00e9 que o designer do puzzle esperava que eu fosse adivinhar a solu\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nPrimordia definitivamente tem a minha recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o, se trata de um cl\u00e1ssico moderno dos point-and-click, mas o que mais brilha nele n\u00e3o \u00e9 qualquer coisa inerente ao g\u00eanero point-and-click ou mesmo aos video games, o que brilha nele \u00e9 o seu enredo; ele conta uma hist\u00f3ria que seria ador\u00e1vel em qualquer meio. \u00c9 um jogo que \"passa por baixo do radar\", n\u00e3o recebe o reconhecimento e aten\u00e7\u00e3o que realmente merece, mas os poucos que conhecem ele sabem que se trata de uma obra-prima, um cult-classic (n\u00e3o \u00e9 atoa que o mesmo est\u00e1 entre os 100 jogos mais bem avaliados da Steam). Primordia, apesar de n\u00e3o ser t\u00e3o conhecido hoje, sem d\u00favida ser\u00e1 vindicado pela hist\u00f3ria. Daqui a vinte anos muitos poucos se lembrar\u00e3o dos jogos de grandes t\u00edtulos que hoje muito vendem tais como Halo ou Gears of War, mas quem jogou Primordia, dele se lembrar\u00e1.", "timestamp_created": 1475722707, "timestamp_updated": 1475722707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25875414": {"recommendationid": "25875414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102007334", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479995067}, "language": "english", "review": "Primordia.. \nThe most incredible adventure i've ever had.

You will guide Horatio Nullbuilt through the futuristic, rusty dystopian wasteland known as Primordia. Horatio, and his floating comic-relief sidekick Crispin, need to get their stolen power core back; either that, or face death when their charges run dry and they shut down. They soon find out that getting their power core back is the least of their worries, as there's an entire city known as Metropol that's run by a corrupted master computer.\n\nAs you wander the lonely, desolate landscape of Primordia, you will come across many robots to interact with. Some of them are self-aware, some of them utter their pre-programmed responses, some will become friends, and some will be enemies. Man has ceased to exist for many years, though the exact timeframe is undetermined, but long enough for them to have vanished into legend. Horatio is a believer in Humanism, a religion that sees man as god; he even carries his copy of the Gospel of Man with him. The story is absolutely stunning, and the same can be said for the dialogue; I will forego delving any further into either so that you may truly enjoy the experience for yourself.\n\nThis is another point and click title that is obscure in its puzzle solving. There are many times that you will need an item which is hidden in a place that you'd never think to look. For people like me that completely suck with even the simple point and clicks, a guide will absolutely be necessary. However, for more advanced enthusiasts of the genre, you're in for a real challenge and treat. Every puzzle is a \"think outside the box\" type, and very few are expected or familiar. Even a large portion of the achievements are enigmatic. With a guide, you're looking at about 5-6 hours of playtime, without one you'll easily approach 10 hours.\n\nThe artwork of Primordia is done in a monochromatic rusty theme, for the most part consisting of dark browns and dirty oranges. There are subtle glimpses of neon reds and blues, and some places that are steel grey, but they're few and far between. The art does a fantastic job in bringing out the feeling that everything is coated in thick layers of rust, dirt, and sand, and that humans have been dead for centuries. Likewise, the pockmarks on Horatio and many other characters and places conveys the likelihood of near-constant acid rain. The melancholic, dismal, void-of-life atmosphere of the title is both exceedingly strong and somehow calming. The soundtrack is comprised of ambient, semi-industrial tracks that compliment the art wonderfully.\n\nIf you've been holding off on grabbing Primordia, stop waiting and just go for it. You simply cannot rob yourself of a detailed, highly immersive experience such as this one. Truly one of the greatest point and click adventure games of the modern era, Primordia is the complete package; visuals, audio, enjoyable characters, story, dialogue, and challenging gameplay. Even though it's a steal at $10.99 CAD, you can also find it on sale for $2.19 CAD at times, either one is a huge bargain.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]5.0/5.0[/b] - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "timestamp_created": 1475684137, "timestamp_updated": 1513693411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509927", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25863759": {"recommendationid": "25863759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126374161", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493498903}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game is a Unreguarded gem thought it may have pixel bit graphics it still gives\nNestalgia to thoughs who have played games like Kings quest 5, 6, and so on.

But it didn't. \n\nIt's somewhat ironic, that game so \"retro\" - from it's visual form, through mechanics, to themes - feels so fresh. After playing so many contemporary adventure and semi-adventure games it's nice to see that there are people who don't see stories just as shiny boxes filled with emotions. Instead of killing some characters who got a lot of screen time to make viewer shed a tear and considering job well done, Primordia focuses on building an atmosphere, allowing emotions to occur naturally, and, what is recently rare in storytelling, tells a story. Rather than having a bunch of characters hoping from place to place pushed by expendable plot, the game has a topic which it wills to explore.\n\nI might say, that Primordia is philosophical, that it's meditating upon metaphysical themes, but we may not quite understand each other, since the meaning of word \"philosophical\" has devalued. The game isn't trying to make some \"social commentary\" or present a political concept, but it asks fundamental questions, questions that, one may say, are ancient. But, as a (great) poet once said, only weighty ideals live long enough to be called ancient.\n\nEvery element of Primoridia harmonizes with each other. Unique and rich world isn't original only for originality's sake - a wasteland world where robot's seek their raison d'\u00eatre, a city ideologically based on vague and hollow Progress, a court where the judge has two advisers - justice and mercy, the Gospel of Man which was given to robots by their creators... Primordia becomes more like a biblical parable than a typical belletristic story.\n\nThe meaning of life, the wonder of existence, presence of evil in the world, relationship between creation and creator, between robots and man, between man and God - Primordia not only mentions these themes, but also discusses them.

Also, the logic in this game is solid. There are no moments where you use a rubber band and a rock to make a rocket ship or anything. It all made sense as i played through it, and when i was stuck, i was still invested enough to want to keep going.\nAlso multiple endings that are really awesome.

The world and characters are expertly crafted and for once it seems the game doesn't treat you like an idiot. What I mean by that is holding your hand throughout the game and telling you what to do. You figure it out, however long that takes and I have to say that it makes the game much more rewarding. Many points allow you different ways of continuing on that have different impacts. You can even mess up at things and make certain little side quests uncompleteable. But trust me when I say it doesn't ruin the experience.\n\nI actually felt invested in the characters and I lost a few friends during the game. When I care enough that I stop playing for a minute to just take it in when something big happens, I know the game has done what I wanted of it.

Much like in the movie Tron, the main character is a robot with a mission he forgot. A mission given by his own creator, Man.\n\nPrimordia is a point-and-click adventure game by Wormwood Studios. The main character is a robot with amnesia, but made for a very significant purpose. It is still his choice to fulfill this purpose. He can be a faithful warrior that defeats the evil progressive mind and unites the robots, or he can run away from it. In the game, the robots live under a totalitarian secularist regime, where the belief that the machines were created by a mysterious being called Man is forbidden. His faith in Man keeps the protagonist alive. It is a very interesting twist for the cyberpunk genre.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, as well as the soundtrack. The voice acting is complete and very well done. The voice of Crispin is the best. The dialogues are funny and the developers opted for a more dynamic gameplay, allowing the player to engage in the story without huge dialogues.\n\nOne of the advantages is a map that saves the player a good time that would be wasted wandering around. Another advantage is the \"automatic notes\", which saves you the trouble of writing down important information. There are several ways to solve the puzzles, and the developers sought to avoid puzzles that are incoherent with the setting. There is a great internal system for tips, preventing players from getting stuck.\n\nIf you like games like Beneath a Steel Sky, or games that allow you to immerse in an engaging and deep atmosphere with unique and intriguing stories, you should give a chance to Primordia.\n\nPositive points\n* Amazing setting.\n* Good writing and voice-acting.\n\nNegative points\n* The engine is limited.", "timestamp_created": 1470123525, "timestamp_updated": 1470123525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24628532": {"recommendationid": "24628532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042721313", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469945635}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great adventure game from Wadjet Eye Games and props to the developers Wormwood Studios.

Beautiful. The puzzles interesting and fun. I liked Technobabylon more though. Those fucking crashes ruined it for me to an extent...\n\nThe end was just...hm. I miss the feeling of a final closure to the beautiful story. I revolted against MetroMind to the very end but the story ending was like....like the authors wished to finish the game early and stopped caring about the script. \n\nI sensed considerable laziness from the developers in the game, here and there, mainly in the story development. Not in the puzzles though, some of them were sure tough to solve - the kiosk was the worst hurdle and figuring out some codes literally hurt my head. \n\nAlso, the puzzle where you need to answer two robots in answering three questions is broken...in the second question only though. You are asked which of selected statements MUST be true but all of the statements DO NOT NEED TO BE true so I had to find the answer online.\n\nAlso, I'm not a good puzzle solver.\n\nAll in all...this game DEFINITELY needs more story into it. And the story parts of \"Humans destroyed themselves\"? Cmon...that's lame. Human destroyed themselves / robots destroyed humans / wars between robots and humans....it's just not original. I mean: the Gospel of man, that is so beautifully written, I swear I read it many times. That is poetic. That was ART!! So was the philosophical laments of the MEMORIUS in the Kiosk. And Crispin! The Dunes! The Goliath!! All beautiful and very original, at least to me. \n\nHonestly, reading the gospel of man at the start of the game hyped me incredibly. I expected that the game was going to be preseting very hard, unsettling, maybe existential questions in its story. Conflict of religious beliefs among postapocalyptic robots? With philosophical insights and two-sided arguments I can relate to? \nI dig that. \nAfter reading the gospel of man at the start of the game, I realized that not only the author means the story, he is actually capable of meaning it! But...the story does not really go fully in this direction and remains a \"beautiful adventure game\" with a great story plot.

This game is as close to flawless as an adventure game can ever be.  It has the best writing and the best soundtrack of any video game I've played and has a surprisingly deep setting and lore to it, which is impressive considering the small size of the game world.  With just a few locations, it creates a realistic world that had me immersed for hours.\n\nThe story and atmosphere of the game did a remarkable job of drawing me in and building tension, but where I believe the game stands out the most is in its setting.  The game takes place in a future in which life has long been extinct and Man has become a mythical deity worshipped by the remaining robots that now wander the lifeless desert that covers the earth, or even dismissed altogether as nothing more than legend.  Glass and light have become precious resources and what little remains of human invention is constantly scrapped to build new robots.  This is the kind of creativity that is lacking in most adventure games, and the subtlety with which it was presented was refreshing.\n\nIt was surprising to see a post-apocalyptic setting in which humans take only a background role and the nature of the world before is long forgotten.  Rather than barrage the player with the history of the world, Primordia puts the story and gameplay first while allowing players to discover the lore on their own, avoiding many (though not quite all) of the tropes that plague post-apocalyptic, dystopian, and robotic science fiction settings.\n\nThe game takes itself seriously and the comic relief exists for the amusement of the characters rather than that of the player, which is a skillful way of keeping the story believable, though Crispin's lines did make me cringe in more than a few points.  The primary cause of the chaotic dystopia is the degradation and corruption of the robots' programming, which becomes increasingly apparent as more of them are encountered.  All of the robots from the days of the humans are dead, insane, or rebuilt to the point of having no memories of the previous era, and the world inhabited by the rusting automotons that remain of civilization is chaotic, unpredictable, and bleak.  The dramatic irony of many characters' situations as well as the limited color palette contribute a depressing and hopeless tone that makes this an especially memorable experience.\n\nPrimordia is an essential contribution to the adventure genre of computer games, and one that I will gladly recommend to anyone who has an interest in interactive stories.  If you are considering getting Primordia, then please do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake I made of waiting for several years before buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1469159072, "timestamp_updated": 1469231297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24452075": {"recommendationid": "24452075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003708563", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468895462}, "language": "english", "review": "The story told in Primordia is as deep as the story that is untold. This is a sign of very good quality writting and I cannot reccomend enough to give it a try. The voice acting coupled with a few sound effects, and a very good soundtrack helps the story telling a lot.\n\nGameplay wise, there isn't much to say as the point and click adventure game nature kinda limits its possibilities. However, I noticed that some puzzle have several solutions, you can sometime use you sidekick to do things for you or just left click on him for a hint.\n\nLoved it !", "timestamp_created": 1469152660, "timestamp_updated": 1469152660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24423290": {"recommendationid": "24423290", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987746377", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469010975}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5927\u6226\u4e89\u3067\u4eba\u985e\u306f\u6b7b\u306b\u7d76\u3048\u3001\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u305f\u3061\u3060\u3051\u304c\u751f\u304d\u6b8b\u3063\u305f\u3002\u305d\u3093\u306a\u5f7c\u3089\u304c\u3053\u306e\u8352\u5ec3\u3057\u6b7b\u306b\u3086\u304f\u5730\u3067\u793e\u4f1a\u3092\u7bc9\u3044\u305f\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u7269\u8a9e\u3002\n\u300c\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u3068\u5149\u306e\u8857\u300dMetropol\u304b\u3089\u9060\u304f\u96e2\u308c\u305f\u7802\u4e18\u3067\u3001\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u306eHoratio Nulbuilt Ver.5\u3068\u5f7c\u304c\u9020\u3063\u305f\u76f8\u68d2Crispin Horatiobuilt Ver.1\u306f\u3001\u4eca\u65e5\u3082\u30ac\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u3092\u6f01\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089\u4f4f\u51e6\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u58ca\u308c\u305f\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u3092\u3061\u307e\u3061\u307e\u76f4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\u3042\u308b\u65e5\u3001\u4f4f\u51e6\u306b\u8b0e\u306e\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u8972\u6483\u3057\u3001\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u6e90\u3067\u3042\u308b\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30b3\u30a2\u3092\u5f37\u596a\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3002\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30b3\u30a2\u304c\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u8239\u306e\u4fee\u7406\u306f\u304a\u308d\u304b\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u305f\u3061\u306e\u751f\u547d\u3082\u5371\u3046\u3044\u3002\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u8ffd\u8de1\u3057\u3001\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30b3\u30a2\u3092\u4f55\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3082\u53d6\u308a\u623b\u305d\u3046\uff01\n\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u81ea\u4f53\u306f\u666e\u901a\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\uff06\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30afADV\u3060\u3051\u3069\u4f5c\u308a\u3053\u307f\u304c\u3084\u3070\u3044\u3002\u7d9a\u7de8\u3064\u304f\u3063\u3066\u3002\n\u666e\u6bb5\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u5b9f\u7e3e\u306b\u5168\u304f\u8208\u5473\u306e\u306a\u3044\u4ffa\u3082\u3001\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u5168\u5b9f\u7e3e\u89e3\u9664\u3059\u308b\u304f\u3089\u3044\u5927\u597d\u304d\u3002\u306d\u3048\u307e\u3058\u7d9a\u7de8\u3064\u304f\u3063\u3066\u3002\n\u5f15\u304d\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u308b\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u306b\u6df1\u3044\u4e16\u754c\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3001\u76f8\u68d2Crispin\u3068[strike]\u30a4\u30ab\u308c\u305f[/strike]\u6109\u5feb\u306a\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u305f\u3061\u3068\u306e\u4f1a\u8a71\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3002\u7d9a\u7de8\u7121\u7406\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u304b\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u304b\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\n\n\u552f\u4e00\u306b\u3057\u3066\u81f4\u547d\u7684\u6b20\u70b9\u306f\u76f8\u5f53\u306a\u82f1\u8a9e\u529b\u304c\u3044\u308b\u3002\u3076\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3051\u4ffa\u3082\u3068\u3066\u3082\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u304c\u7d50\u69cb\u7406\u89e3\u3057\u304d\u308c\u306a\u3044\u70b9\u304c\u591a\u3044\u3002\u6a5f\u68b0\u793e\u4f1a\u7279\u6709\u306e\u8a00\u8449\u3084\u6163\u7fd2\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3057\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u82f1\u8a9e\u3084\u3084\u305f\u3089\u97fb\u3092\u8e0f\u3080\u5974\u3068\u304b\u3082\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3089\u4f59\u8a08\u308f\u304b\u308a\u3065\u3089\u3044\u3002\u73fe\u5730\u70b9\u3067\u65e5\u672c\u8a9eMOD\u3082\u306a\u3057\u3002\n\u305d\u306e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb\u304c\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u306a\u3089\u30de\u30b9\u30c8\u30d0\u30a4\u3002\n\u7d9a\u7de8\u306f\u3088\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1469012291, "timestamp_updated": 1469012291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781327", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24420313": {"recommendationid": "24420313", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987156904", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468992036}, "language": "english", "review": "Great art, engaging story. However, the game has a critical flaw that permeates the entire experience: discovering how to progress is less an exercise in logic and more an exercise in clicking and walking the world. Many of the components of each puzzle are only tangentially related, oftentimes only in the most esoteric ways. Progression is further  hindered by the game's lack of robust programming. Sometimes you will try something that should work, only to find out that you were supposed to perform that action through slightly different mechanisms. \n\nThe game also does not handle choices well. Now, there aren't many story-altering choices to make in this game, but the creators should have given the player more indications of what the effects of their actions would be, as well as more indication that certain paths could have been taken. I felt cheated out of the ending I would have chosen because of the problem I mentioned above. I clicked on something, nothing happened, and I went on my way, not realizing that I could have performed the intended action.

At the time of this review, I just finished my first playthrough. I refused to use wiki, and this game made a fool out of me. All of my friends died and I ultimately was outsmarted. Going into my next playthrough, I know of several things I will do differently, hopefully to get a better outcome. I am possessed with the desire to outsmart metromind and beat the system. My advice to anyone who plays this game is to be patient and try to solve problems without looking up the walkthrough. The solutions do make sense, but sometimes it takes a while to figure it out.

These have varied wildly in quality, but in more recent years indie studios such as Wadjet Eye Games have managed to churn out charming retro games with regularity.  They generally strike the right balance in difficulty, the hand-painted art is often beautiful, and the stories are often interesting.  These games are not for everyone, of course, as games of this sort may seem \"dated\" or slow to modern gamers\n\nTo me, Primordia exemplifies the best aspects of most retro adventure games, with wonderful graphics (again, in a low res way that some appreciate more than others) and classic point and click exploration.  Primordia, however, distances itself from its peers through superior story, characters, and story structure.  The basic premise is an interesting one, and game designer and writer Mark Yohalem develops that premise expertly and meticulously.  The world unfolds naturally as you join Horatio and Crispin on their adventure.  The themes are more complex and nuanced than what you will see in most games.  The puzzles feel true to the world rather than thrown in just because you have to have them.\n\nThis is, in my opinion, the best game published by Wadjet Eye, and one of the best adventure games in recent memory.  If you're interested in going out on a limb and try an adventure game, consider trying this one.  If you're already a fan of retro games or thoughtful sci-fi, this is a no-brainer.", "timestamp_created": 1466737385, "timestamp_updated": 1466737385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643129", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23731236": {"recommendationid": "23731236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089805112", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466705455}, "language": "english", "review": "A whimsical tale of mystery and discovery about a robot and his companion forging a path as fate would have it to uncover the blurred grey line between myth and truth through difficult choices, puzzles, and a rich and compelling story line. take a pixelated adventure into Primordia; one of the best games ive played in years.\nbuy it. you wont be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1466707299, "timestamp_updated": 1466707299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23675268": {"recommendationid": "23675268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071154757", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458984045}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't add much.

I haven't played very many of them, and I usually get frustrated with the puzzles and either look up a guide (which kind of defeats the point) or quit. \n\nI LOVED Primordia. Maybe it scratched the right itch at the right time, but I enjoyed every second of this game. The puzzles are challenging, but not frustrating (the only times that I had to look something up were just because I didn't realize I could scroll down on my data pack, for example, or that I could interact with an object in a certain way. For everything else, Crispin's hints were more than enough). It's gorgeous and thought-provoking. The voice acting was excellent and really brought all of the characters to life. The world is endlessly interesting. Looking at the achievements after my first playthrough, it also seems that there is a great deal to discover that I missed my first time around, which is good, because in my desire to experience more of this world I will probably play through it at least one more time. \n\nA lot of reviews have commented on it feeling a bit short, and I'm tempted to agree. The second half of the game in particular feels a bit rushed, but it seems to have more to do with there being lots of questions to answer, and they all get answered in a shotgun blast at once that seems to detract from the feeling of discovery that permiates the rest of the game. However, if the only bad thing I have to say about a game is \"I wanted more...\" is it really a bad thing after all?\n\nPrimordia is very literary. It's a game about the preservation of individuality within an increasingly communist society. It's about one's \"design,\" and whether or not it's possible to act against it. It's about friendship, religion, creation, preservation, degeneration, and hope.\n\nDo yourself a favor and play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1464716348, "timestamp_updated": 1464716348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541985", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23298159": {"recommendationid": "23298159", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976257774", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464642275}, "language": "english", "review": "Primordia is excellent.

In the far future, Man is no more and is worshiped as an ancient god that was the perfect machine that built the first robots (in the era called primodium). These manbuilt robots built more robots and they are now the only sentience that populates the post-apocalyptic world. The robots believe that Man will return once more to start a second primordium. Meanwhile, they go about \"maintaining\" the world and preach the gospel of man. Horatio Nullbuilt and his levitating companion Crispin Horatiobuilt are two such robots that live out in the dunes, far away from the robot city of Metropol. When a giant robot with lasers \"takes\" their power core, they are forced on an adventure that takes them to Metropol and uncovers everything from Horatio's past to the fate of the last humans.\n\nThe music sets the tone perfectly for this world. What struck me most was the intricacy with which this world was constructed: every little trinket of knowledge about this universe fits so seamlessly with every other tidbit. So, the writers did a fantastic job and obviously put a lot of thought into their work. The visuals, music and puzzles served to elevate that writing.

There are few negative things to say so I'll start there.\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\nStarting with the only downsides I can think of, it was bothersome finding the right settings so the game would scale perfectly and look sharp on an HD display, but it worked fine once that was taken care of. \nGameplay is somewhat akin to classic point and click with character displacement handled like any old 2D RPG, but it sometimes isn't clear which items are to be interacted with, or even whether it is possible. This was sometimes annoying but can be considered inherent to the game genre.\nIt's too short. Don't get me wrong, the length of the game is appropriate but the mood and story are so enticing by the end you'll definitely be left wanting more.\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\nThe art. I'll come out with a bit of an unpopular opinion by saying gameplay is not a good reason to buy this game. Its geatest asset is without a question the art. Not only is the style 100% distinctive from anything I've seen before, the devs actually pulled it off perfectly. While it resembles moody postapocalyptic or cyberpunk art commonly seen in high-res online, the low pixel count makes it particularly impressive. Combining intricate convoluted shapes with pixel-art is just something I didn't think was possible until playing Primordia. The dark and brown color tones used and occasional neon accents really set the atmosphere as a surrealist cyberpunk universe. I can't stress enough there is nothing else like this.\nOn top of the visual aspects, the soundtrack is just great. Maybe I wouldn't listen to the ambient sounds on their own but they really do a great job of accenting both the story and environment.\nLast comes the story. Oh boy. Not only was I surprised at every turn by a creative plot, but the character development is the cherry on the cake. Whoever wrote the story really knows how to blend humor, mystery, and tragedy in a story that never left me bored (except when I got stuck desperately looking for some object to interact with).\n\nI won't oversimplify by rating this game with a number, but I'll say this:\nSince I was about eight years old not a single day has gone by without me reading a novel. I have watched thousands of movies, played literally hudreds of games, and amidst all the classics, the worldwide hits, the big budget productions, all the various forms of entertainment, this comes out easily as one of the favorite stories of my lifetime. If you can sit through a few tedious puzzles and don't mind spending half an hour looking for items in a pile of trash, then I recommend this game wholeheartedly.

Even though the characters in the game are robots they retain many human properties that makes them quite relatable. To add to this, their human traits are merged with some very interesting quirks based on what purposes they were coded for. This makes almost every character you meet really interesting and memorable, and also drives a lot humor in the game. In particular, the bond between the playable character Horatio and his creation and best friend Crispin is consistently entertaining thoughtout the whole game. It's not just the setting that's great though, the writing and story in general is fantastic, and the voice acting is amazing.\n\nThe gameplay draws really well from the setting too. Scavenging for spare parts and pieceing machines together might feel pretty familiar to anyone who has played an adventure game before, but because of the setting and design of the game all of this feels really organic and fluid. It helps that there are core items in the game aren't simply used once and then thrown away, but instead you are gathering an array of tools (Your friend Crispin being one of them!) that you will keep reusing throughout the whole game. There is still the odd puzzle that had solutions I wouldn't have thought of and got me turning to a guide, but I would put this down to my own impatience rather than design faults of the game. I never really took the time to think things out completely as I was too compelled to move forward with the story!\n\nLong story short, I would strongly recommend this game.

I really did, which is a rare occasion for me in this genre.\n\nI'm the kind of person who usually buys huge batches of cheap new indies and revamps of old adventure games, starts point-and-clickers excited but leaves them even before half-way, bored of the theme, disillusioned by the lack of immersion, redundant puzzles and all. Somehow it all gets diluted into a non-engaging mess. But this was not the case with Primordia; I played it through twice, once genuinely without any help, and then second time with a walkthrough / achievement guide to see what I had missed. \n\nI loved the dystopian atmosphere. The writing was excellent, as well as the characters. The graphics were surprisingly fitting - somehow the artists filled just the right amount of atmospheric detail in \"cinematics\", and the gameplay was fluent enough. Puzzles did involve every once in a while some actual thinking and not just random inventory combo-womboing, and once I even took pen and paper to solve a key puzzle. I must commend that the narration for Horatio, Crispin, as well some other key characters (without spoilers) were excellently done, which played a huge part on why the game was so immersive for me.\n\nOn the down-side, some of the puzzles were kinda redundant pixel searching, as one might expect. Luckily the hint system was just on the correct level for a guy like me, who doesn't like hunting for pixels for eternities, and might dismiss an \"obvious\" clue every here and then. I never felt stuck, and I always had a sense of progression in my first playthrough. Without spoiling too much, there isn't that much of difference in the endings or how your choices end up as consequences, but second playthrough (with a walkthrough) did reveal more of the lore and modest alternatives that I had missed. I must also admit that dystopia/sci-fi as a genre is probably my favorite (1984, Brave New World, Neuromancer, you name it), so I am biased to liking this game.\n\nOverall, I can highly recommend this excellent adventure-novel to anybody that can overcome the barrier of point-and-click, and instead enjoy a ride of well fitting retro graphics, excellent narrative, good writing, and a neatly packaged ~4-6h adventure in a single playthrough - all for a very modest price.

It happens to be my favorite game in the world, but that is a subjective assessment and I intend for this to be an objective review so I will explain WHY my opinon has formed the way it has.\n\nFirst: the world is unique.  The spectacularly different setting in which the protagonist finds himself is interesting and deeply realized. I found that as I played this game I wanted to learn more and more about the backstory, the reason things were the way they were. It is likely that not everyone will have this response but I found that the somehow quite human cyberpunk characters drew me in. The robotic population of this game have dreams, hopes, and problems which make them relatable, but also special. They are obviously not human, but the similarities between them and humanity are evident in many portions of the game. That, however, is not to say there are no differences. Indeed some of the differences are what drove me to be more industrious in my exploration of the world.\n\nSecond: the voice acting is stellar. While the voice acting is not particularly flashy, it has an underplayed value in making the protagonist and his little helper come to life. Throughout it gives simple but essential relatability with the main character, putting the player in his shoes so to speak. The voices are diverse and unique and this additionally draws the player into the world, which now not only has depth, but also seems broad.\n\nThird: the art is dead center with the rest of the game's feel. Though robotic, many tubes and unique shapes cascade through the art design, giving the machines an organic feel (this is not the only game I've seen do this but this game does it well). Most of the tones are dead-feeling beiges and browns but there are many glowing lights throughout the game that give the overall impression of a world with a soul beneath all the lifeless metal. Again this fits perfectly with the world's history and vibe.\n\nFourth: the audio is wonderfully immersive. The sound is electronic with a common use of ethnic sounding pad synths. Deep, slow rhythms give the game a dark and somber feel which meshes perfectly with the mechanized art and characters. There is at least one old record you can listen to, which deepens the games portrayal of the world's past.\n\nFifth: the gameplay is solid. The puzzles are not hard, but they have an obvious digital slant that only increases immersion and interest. Each one is unique, although each of thier formats is fairly standard for point and click games. If this game had to have a weakness it would be the puzzles, if you don't play this game for the story and immersion, I think you're not playing to the game's amazing strengths. If you don't like stories/worlds that you can lose yourself in and just want hard puzzles, don't play this. However, if you've ever been interested in a cyberpunk world, or a fantasy story, or even basic philosophy/worldviews, let this game tell you a story. It does it well.\n\nSixth: no spoilers in this review but I will say the ending I found was amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1454564596, "timestamp_updated": 1454564596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20925835": {"recommendationid": "20925835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061457618", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451544262}, "language": "english", "review": "There's about ten endings and they all suck.\n\nOther than that this game is flawless.", "timestamp_created": 1454477191, "timestamp_updated": 1454477191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20914220": {"recommendationid": "20914220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144593917", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454383610}, "language": "english", "review": "I thought Primordia was a very good game, and I would recommend it both in terms of mechanics and story. I am a big fan of the Blackwell games, and this game has many of the same strengths.\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent story. There's legitimately a lot to think about in this game, including political, religious, and social commentary. The game is set in a world where humans are extinct and only robots are left. We see how the society they create is a very clever mirror of our own, with plenty of parody of our own flaws along the way.\n+ The point and click puzzles are solid. They are somewhat difficult, but solvable without having to consult a walkthrough because the solutions make sense once you get them. To me, this is one of the most important things about gameplay in a point and click. You have to use your brain to solve the puzzles.\n+ If you do start struggling, you can get hints by talking to people (especially your sidekick Crispin), which again means you don't need to consult the internet to get a nudge in the right direction. Normally, he will give you a clue about which area you should be searching, or which object you should be fiddling with.\n+ The art and aesthetics in the game are good. The characters are interesting-looking, and the world is very neat.\n+ The game is paced well. It does a nice job of moving you from place to place, advancing the story and revealing the mysteries by steps.\n\nCons:\n- Hard to think of any.

Take notes.  (Most of which actually happens for you with the in-game \"data-pad\".)  Solve puzzles with said notes.  \n\nThe game runs at 640x400 resolution - which can be off-putting to some, but really lends to the retro-adventure feel of the game, and I've come to love it.  (On my 1080p tv, it won't actually fill up the whole screen, but it doesn't really bother me.)  That said - I highly recommend going into the options menu and chosing the \"DX\" display mode as opposed to D3D if it works for you - the sprites mesh with the backgrounds much better this way in my opinion.  DOS nostalgia!\n\nWhat really shines in Primordia is the story - and the art.  They come together to create a fascinating atmosphere that makes me want to revisit the game again and again - and the developer commentary is great on a second or third playthrough.  The excellent voice acting and seven or so potential endings don't hurt, either.  (The narrator from Bastion plays the main character - and the sidekick that follows you through the game is entertaining at every turn.)  The music and sound mesh well with the art to create an engrossing atmosphere - despite the retro low-res graphics.  \n\nThere aren't many puzzles in the \"puzzle game\" sense - but there is plenty of puzzling to be done in the game in terms of figuring out how things fit together, what things mean, and what the significance of certain items or pieces of information may be.  The story is mostly linear, but there are a few opportunities to take different approaches to solve situations - especially near the end.  Observation and careful contemplation are rewarded.\n\nThe setting is in the distant future in a post-human world - no organic life is to be found anywhere - even the bugs and little things swimming in the sewers are machines - but make no mistake, they have lives and thoughts of their own, and are no less interesting than any human character.  And for the robot fan, there are references to other robots from both popular and obscure culture everywhere - along with a videogame reference or two.  MST3K, Short Circuit, Metropolis, and Fallout - just to name a few.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to any fan of classic graphic adventures, narrative-driven games, or robots.", "timestamp_created": 1453862746, "timestamp_updated": 1453863542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20760256": {"recommendationid": "20760256", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965738791", "num_games_owned": 634, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455384280}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR: I absolutely recommned this game for a fun casual (and funny) adventure!!\n\nYou're in for a quarky funny adventure.

The puzzles are good without ever being too challenging and the story is tightly knit, with only about 10-11 locations and about 15 characters in the entire game. It's concise without any red herrings. Actually, because the game is so tightly knit, some important secrets are left out in plain sight, which makes it interesting to replay. \n\nWhat I also like about the puzzles in this game are that there's dialouge if the game understands what you were trying to do with a puzzle, but you were using the wrong piece and there's multiple ways to solve several of the puzzles. In fact, the biggest and longest puzzle of the game can literally be bypassed from the moment you enter the second act. \n\nMy only complaint with the game would be the antagonist. The antagonist has a trait that they can \"never lie\" but then you manage to catch them in lies several times and when confronted with this, the antagonist says \"no player, you must be mistaken because I am not\". In a game where the entire second act is about logic, it just seems silly. Additionally, my other problem with the antagonist is that at one point the antagonist just says \"I know you have a lot of questions about the world and history of this game world, so let me answer all of them for you\". \n\nHowever, that small gripe aside, this game had me engaged and immersed the whole time, trying to figure out its secrets and lore (until the minute that it got bored and laid out its cards on the table).", "timestamp_created": 1452806434, "timestamp_updated": 1452806434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20527236": {"recommendationid": "20527236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002480220", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452735793}, "language": "english", "review": "Great art style and atmosphere.

We had a walkthrough since neither of us could understand English. Since then I have gone mostly to other genres but the adventuring spark were left in me somewhere. That\u2019s why I have bought a great many point-and-click games but every time I play one the same thing happens: I click around for a while and get bored. They just don\u2019t get a grip on me. That was until Primordia.\n\nThe player takes role of Horatio and his sidekick Crispin, who live in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. What seems like a peaceful existence is interrupted when a robot crashes through their wall and steals a power core that is keeping the two alive. The game is a quest to find and get back the power core. The mood is melancholic and sad but is lighten up by Crispin\u2019s surprisingly funny dialog. Every other character was also fascinating and had some personality to them.\n\nThis was the first ever adventure game that I completed without looking at a walkthrough. Most of the puzzles are logical in a sense that if you have an item that might fit it most likely does. Every solution made sense. The puzzles are quite varied: There are use-item-on-item puzzles but also drawing, memorization, code breaking and so on. I was surprised at how many different kind of obstacles the creators had thought out. It took 7 hours to complete the game, though length varies greatly depending on how fast you solve the puzzles. There appears to be different endings and outcomes since I only got half of the achievements on single playthrough.\n\nThe graphics in this are amazing. Everything is a post-apocalyptic bleak wasteland but the world that was destroyed has this art deco kind of style (think Bioshock) that is really nice. The game actually runs at the tiniest of resolutions but is stretched to full screen. Not a lot of pixels to work with but what has been achieved is wonderful. I\u2019d love to see full resolution images of the art since it\u2019s so great. This is also why the game probably runs on pretty much any potato as long as there is electricity. For some strange reason in one room, after certain thing happens, my fps dropped to single digits but it was solved after I got out of the room. You cannot die and there is no rush so it doesn\u2019t matter. Even better than the visuals is the sound and music. I think the voice acting is great but, together with the art, it\u2019s the music that shines the most. \n\nIf you have any interest in point-and-click Primordia is a must play, no doubt about that. For someone new to the genre it\u2019s also a good place to start since it\u2019s not as far-out weird with its puzzles as some games in the genre.

Although, to make it better, the mood is nostalgic and bittersweet rather than oppressive.\n\n> The plot is itself quite good.\n\n> I found most characters to be very well crafted. The protagonist's companion deserves a mention of his own: not only he fulfills his Sassy Sidekick role and provides the humor this otherwise grim tale needs, he's also part of a very comprehensive hint system (and seamlessly integrated into the narrative)\n\n> The puzzles themselves are quite intuitive, and the few that may be too obscure are enlightened by the hint system. Several puzzles have multiple solutions, too (I finished the game without solving every puzzle), and at least a few of them affect the endings of the story.\n\n\"Primordia\" (as other adventure games) may feel a bit too short when comparing the playtime/cost ratio with other genres, but IMHO it's the price of well crafted plot & characters... and, perhaps more important, of setting and themes you keep thinking about even after finishing the game.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED.", "timestamp_created": 1450877666, "timestamp_updated": 1450877728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19866543": {"recommendationid": "19866543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014197372", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450796740}, "language": "italian", "review": "Senza dubbio un'ottima avventura grafica che metter\u00e0 a dura prova il vostro ingegno, senza per\u00f2 scadere mai nel frustrante.\n\nLa storia di suo ha una belle profondit\u00e0, trama e intreccio sono ben fatti, cos\u00ec come i risvolti e le possibilit\u00e0 di scelta che generano nell'avanzare del gioco.\n\nStile grafico coraggioso, d'impatto e di tutto rispetto sopratutto.\n\nInsomma, davvero un bel gioco come non se ne vedevano da un po', almeno nel suo genere: la sua ambientazione e l'anima poetica vi cattureranno.", "timestamp_created": 1450861043, "timestamp_updated": 1450861043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19844069": {"recommendationid": "19844069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002977327", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451101375}, "language": "english", "review": "==New Review\nI've written a new review on completing the game. First I still think the warning applies: it should be made clearer that it runs 640x400.** That's not a full screen size image in the video**. However I found it best to turn on x4 anti-aliasing, this is the best option.\n\nThis is a great story, nice main character and side kick, good voice acting, setting is interesting. I only got stuck a couple of times, and you know when you do in these games it's because you've missed something obvious or not so obvious on the screen. I'm not a fan of searching the screen for a clue and there is'nt  too much of that, but if you get stuck chances are it's that. The memorious puzzle was in fact a bit oblique to me, like I'd forgotten something in a trunk.\n\nI'd also say this is the type of game where even though the in game data collection works fine you will need a pen and paper for a couple of the code and logic puzzles but that's it. Mostly because getting it wrong the first time locks you out of achieving some of the achievements, though this does give you incentive to play again.  \n\nIt has multiple endings so there's some replayability to it at the end. \nI'd compare the setting to Machinarium, but story style wise and feel more Beneth a steel sky. I happen to think those are two top games.\n\nTo dev: I dont think a sequel would be possible *right now* but maybe a prequel  would fit really well here. Do a Star Wars and make a trilogy and jump around the timeline.\nHaving read the Fallen pdf it did give me much more of a sense of story, I can see how things would be missing with out it. I'd put a link on the store page for download if it's not already there. Add the setting to right click change settings to the library entry.\n\nTop Rating\n\n=== old review\nI bought a bunch of point and clicks at the same time, and when I got this I really didnt realise it ran this size. It's too fiddly and post stamp size. I'm aware I can scale it up x4 but then it becomes quite hard to discern things in the picture, which is annoying.\nI don't have a problem with pixel art, and in some cases that's easier for finding things on screen rather than a high res style, but the art style here makes it too difficult to recognise things. I played through Techno Babylon no problem, which is at a larger resolution but something about that game has cleaner lines where as Primordia has a lot of detail. I'd compare this more to Machinarium style but pixelated.\nThis could really benefit the clarity it has at 640x400 at a larger frame. I know that won't be possible without remaking it, but that might actually be worth doing...\nAt the moment im in two minds about it and getting a refund.\nWhich is a pity because im pretty sure it is good. \nDepends if you can live with that size. edit: use 4x anti-aliasing, it goes a bit dream like looking but it's certainly better. cheers\n===", "timestamp_created": 1450796229, "timestamp_updated": 1451143862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512899", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19811422": {"recommendationid": "19811422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066143262", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450643660}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really amazing.

I really enjoyed playing through this, unlike other point and click adventure games. The themes are also pretty dark, but very satisfying and aided in keeping me playing. I tend to put these kind of games down because I get bored or suck. I hated mine sweeper as a kid and randomly clicking around the screen got tiresome.

Plus CYBERPUNK! PLUS POST APOCALYPTIC WASTELANDS!\n\nSPOILERS!!!!--------\n\nThere are multiple endings. I assure you, saving right before the big confontation helps you experience them all! Each is pretty cool, but even some optional items can have an impact on the ending. Mainly items belonging to your companions. Also certain events may occur that have an impact on your endings. Save different files often as kind of a bookmark so you can go back and attempt for different outcomes. I had about 17 so I could see everything with three files for all the endings (confrontation save)  \n\nFor example, there's a situation where you can corner a rogue AI. Save before you attempt! Trapping him gives you an item that aids in the true ending, but killing him changes the ending of that chapter. So if you want to experience both chapter endings, you'll need 2 saves, but after that, the two paths merge and continues normally. \n\nALSO! SPOILERS!\n\nHave Crispin talk to the lanterns.

Through your searches, you managed to find a power source capable of helping you re-build a derelict spacecraft. All seems well until an unknown assailant ambushes you and steals the power source, forcing you to chase after it or face a slow death in the desert wastes. Thankfully you have your witty and sarcastic sidekick, Crispin, to help you make your way through the various obstacles you will inevitably face.\n\nBeing a point-and-click adventure game, most of the gameplay will revolve around you combining items with other items or using them on various places to solve puzzles and progress the plot. You also get a special button for using Crispin on things, either to help you out or just to hear more of his banter. At any point in the game you can also click on him for idle chatter where he will reveal clues about what you should do next. The game also offers a data pouch to help save critical information (so you don\u2019t need to write much down) as well as a map for fast travel.\n\nMost of the puzzles in Primordia are pretty straightforward and Horatio will give you obvious clues whenever you get close to solving one. The only part I found to be particularly tricky was a text-parser based puzzle that required you to stumble through various typos, secret phrases, and acronyms using your keyboard to input queries. But even that was pretty simple once you figured out the trick behind it. \n\nOne thing I really liked about this game was the overall cozy atmosphere observed through the calming visuals and music. It kind of reminds me of old 70s/80s era sci-fi animated movies in scenes where the character would be walking through some trippy landscape to a synth-heavy soundtrack. Most of the voices are pretty well done too (for such a small studio). \n\nAs a whole, Primordia is entertaining without being overly hard on the player and is worth looking into for anyone who is a fan of classic adventure games and sci-fi.\n", "timestamp_created": 1445299176, "timestamp_updated": 1445299176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18556491": {"recommendationid": "18556491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214883224", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445199030}, "language": "english", "review": "Challenging puzzles with a gripping story, go play it now if you like point and click adventures!", "timestamp_created": 1445199217, "timestamp_updated": 1445199217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18543340": {"recommendationid": "18543340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029879585", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444595875}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0434\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442-\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0435\u0442\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438, \u0438 \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b. \u041f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c \u044f\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0438 \u043a \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0435 (\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0439: Planescape: Torment). \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u044e\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a.  \u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e!", "timestamp_created": 1445153397, "timestamp_updated": 1445153397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18507589": {"recommendationid": "18507589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014797699", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499000903}, "language": "french", "review": "Ne vous laissez pas berner par son aspect vieillot et l'impression de lenteur dans la vid\u00e9o!

You will gather, combine, and use items found throughout the world to solve problems, and you will be asked to solve the occasional riddle.\n\nYou take on the role of Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot who lives in the wasteland, salvaging parts to repair a derelict flying ship. The game begins when a strange robot cuts his way into the side of your ship, shoots you, and steals your vital power core. Without a power source to recharge your body you will surely die, so you and your companion (a floating, armless sidekick named Crispin Horatiobuilt) set out to recover your core, or at least to find a suitable replacement.\n\nThe game is divided into two major parts: first, you wander the wasteland searching for a power core, then eventually you leave the wasteland for a second location. Once you transition to the second area, you will no longer be able to access the wasteland portion of the game. Along the way, you will meet many strange robots, unravel mysteries about your world and your own past, and uncover a sinister plot.\n\nStorytelling is Primordia's greatest strength. Once the narrative picks up (beginning about halfway through the wasteland section), the story really engages the player. The cast of characters (most of which are found in the game's second area) are surprisingly well realized. Each has a distinct personality and a clear motivation. Your relationships with each of them feel genuine, and even your enemies feel well rounded.\n\nThe game's setting and art style combine with the well realized characters to create a compelling sense of place. Despite the low resolution environments and sprites, Primordia's world feels bigger than the screen it plays out on. Stellar voice acting and a droning ambient soundtrack put the finishing touches on a beautifully desolate world.\n\nFor all its strengths, though, Primordia's downfall is the gameplay. In the 80s and early 90s, point and click adventures were among the best represented genres in PC gaming. Since the rise of 3D graphics and the emergence of new styles of adventure game, they have retreated to the niche and indie markets. My memories of those old adventure games are pleasant, and it takes a game like Primordia to clear the fogged lenses of time. Simply put, even the best made adventure games tend to have puzzles whose solution only seemed apparent to the designer. And Primordia is far from the best made adventure game.\n\nThe first issue is that puzzles in Primordia often have nonsensical solutions, or worse, do not permit you to use the most obvious solution. One puzzle early on asked me to plug a pair of ventilation ducts. The first I plugged easily with a piece of scrap cut from a nearby structure, but despite there being three more identical pieces of scrap to cut from, the game would not permit me to do so, and instead demanded I locate an unrelated item that did not seem to fit (according to the visual representations in the game). And these logical disconnects are such frequent occurrances, you will soon find yourself simply trying to use every item in your inventory on each puzzle in the hope that a solution will present itself.\n\nThe second issue is the way the game arbitrarily cuts you off from certain areas, objectives, and even major plot threads. It is even possible to lock yourself out of \"winning\" the game (you can still complete the game and achieve one of the \"bad\" endings) through a blindly made choice in the first 30 minutes of play.\n\nLastly (and this is a small complaint), the inclusion of achievements seems to undermine the freedom built into the game's choices. When there are three ways to resolve a puzzle, but one awards an achievement, there is a real sense that there is a \"right way\" to play, stifling any sense of freedom the system might have otherwise provided.\n\nThese serious and frankly unforgivable design flaws sour what might have been an excellent game. Die hard point and click adventure fans will probably push right through, but if you are an average modern gamer with fond memories of classic adventure games, prepare to be reminded of all the bad mechanics that made those games such a frustrating experience.", "timestamp_created": 1444022628, "timestamp_updated": 1444023654, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 142, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684489", "comment_count": "22", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18309342": {"recommendationid": "18309342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136843720", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441203207}, "language": "english", "review": "The moment when you get to the bus-stop robot and hear the somber \"I am waiting\" with Blade Runneresque music in the background is priceless.

I could tell just from looking at the trailer and screenshots of this game that it looked interesting, and that \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" next to the user reviews made it seem like a no-brainer. So, finally I picked up this game and boy, I am not disappointed.\n\nLet's get the bad out of the way first.\n\nThis game runs in a very small resolution, at least for most modern monitors. The highest resolution possible is 1280x800, which looks best in a window. It was also a bit annoying that the only way I could find to change these settings was by a launcher in the actual folder containing the game files. I only found that much by perusing the game forum when I was disappointed with the resolution.\n\nThere isn't much replayability. I can definitely see myself trying this game again to do a few things different, but overall it is a story-driven and therefore linear experience. It has several endings, but most of those endings are decided at your own whim by how you play out the final scenes.\n\nNow, the good.\n\nThe obvious first thing you'll notice about this game is that artwork. I found it to be very cool to look at and definitely gives you that feeling of despair - a world wasting away around you as you desperately try to rebuild what you can. You also have atmospheric music that adds to these scenes but mostly stays in the background. It adds a lot, but doesn't overtake it. Instead, it's all just working together to give you an experience.\n\nThe voice acting is likewise excellent. The main character and his sidekick both do most of the talking, so it's great to see them so well performed. It's easy to pick up on their personalities and they're both likeable.\n\nI'm always a bit bad at puzzles in games, but I thought the ones here were challenging but always possible. Nothing ever felt frustrating or beyond my abilities to figure out. I did get \"stuck\" in a few places where I had no idea what to do, but it usually came down to me not thinking about the situation well enough or remembering details that I simply overlooked. It's worth saying, almost everything matters in this game. There are few things that are superfluous.\n\nOverall it took me about six hours to complete this game. I would have liked for it to be longer, but I could say that for any good game.\n\nIf you're interested in this game at all, check it out.", "timestamp_created": 1440300622, "timestamp_updated": 1440300622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17645728": {"recommendationid": "17645728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051745954", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440087127}, "language": "turkish", "review": "8 bit grafikleri var fakat nedense ho\u015fuma gitti.Hikayesi g\u00fczel.Puzzleleri de ayriyetten ho\u015f.Seslendirmeleri de \u00e7ok ho\u015f.Hikayesi cidden \u00e7ok iyi.Oynaman\u0131z\u0131 ve bitirmenizi tavsiye ederim", "timestamp_created": 1440170066, "timestamp_updated": 1440170066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17636848": {"recommendationid": "17636848", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995129384", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440113301}, "language": "english", "review": "A thoughtful adventure game with stunning voicework and interesting characters.

My favorite part about these games, as a kid, was that they whisked you away to a completely different, and foreign place. Though many adventure games seek to do this, few fall short, and end up feeling like \"just another point and click\" derived of any rich narrative. Primordia is not one of those games that falls short at all.\n\nI should admit before I go any further that I've only played the opening sequence of this game thus far, and am extremely excited to get back to it after this review, but this particular summary will be noting the aesthetic, and initial response of Primordia.\n\nI absolutely love post-apocalypse. It's not an uncommon scenario, thankfully, so there's lots of material to dig through on the subject. Unfortunately, there's quite a lot of BAD post-apocalypse games out there, and so with some hesitation, I bought this game, and sat down with some skepticism. For ten bucks, I was hoping it was going to deliver, and the reviews spoke for themselves.\n\nPrimordia does something a lot of post-apocalyptic stories don't, and removes humans altogether from the character roster. You begin the game as Horatio Nullbuilt (the surname meaning some dude presumeably named 'Null' built him, which is a common theme throughout the game), the 5th version to be precise, and are accompanied by Crispin Horatiobuilt, your custom companion and comic relief. The world around you is an age-old Earth, looking very barren and very post-war. A strange robot cuts down your door one day and steals your power core, without which you can not charge your own batteries (nor Crispin's). Since that simply won't do, you venture out into the world in order to find the strange robot and reclaim your power core. \n\nEasier said than done. What follows are scenes common to Adventure/Point+Click games: You meet hosts of interesting robots, travel to new and exciting places, and spend a good deal of time trying to combine every single item in your inventory to see if it does something cool. Excellent (okay... MOSTLY excellent) voice acting, a (so far) riveting and comedic script, beautiful artwork, and intriguing characters make this one of my favorite Adventure games to date, and I've barely even started it.\n\nShould you get it? I mean, it's a point and click. You know what you're getting. The deciding factor, in most cases, is the story and artwork, and both deliver wholeheartedly. Even this early, the story is already showing to be incredibly promising, with twists and turns, and dark comedy as only robots can deliver. The script, as mentioned, is really quite good, and I don't find myself simply reading through the subtitles and clicking through in order to progress, but rather relishing the lines and the delivery. The art, while simple and \"retro\" in style, does not detract at all from the story, but actually enhances it with far-off vistas, incredible robot designs, and teeming robot cities, both very alive, and strangely dead. \n\nFans of point and clicks, this is another excellent addition to your collection, reminding me of titles like Deponia, Riven, and (of course) Monkey Island. Fans of sci-fi, post apocalyptic fiction will also love this game. All in all, I think it's one of those rare games on Steam where I feel like I absolutely got what I paid for, and then some.\n\nAnd I haven't even finished it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1436957603, "timestamp_updated": 1436957603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17016343": {"recommendationid": "17016343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068649736", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436731838}, "language": "english", "review": "I couldnt pull myself away from this game!

There are some very unique things that set this game apart from other point-and-click adventure games.\n     One element that is so different about Primordia is the surprisingly large amount of dialogue that is incorporated into it, unlike most other games of the genre.\n     Another characteristic that adds to the game is Crispin, the protagonist's \"sidekick\" if you would call him that. He adds a sense of humour to the game (although sometimes rather corny) and can offer hints to the player that are valuable, but not always completely revealing of the next course of action that must be taken. Crispin is an often uplifting character in this post-apocalytic setting.\n     Another trait that won me over is the atmosphere in the game. It seems realistic in the post-apocalyptic setting, and it is one of my favorite things about this game. The backrounds always seem beautifully made.\n     The puzzles in this game are very engaging and are not always clear-cut which may seem like a bad thing, but I personally enjoy the extra challenge. Not every puzzle is as simple as clicking on one thing and then another. They often include various items and/or certain actions to be taken. This is a huge difference between Primordia and other point-and-click adventure games.\n     The only complaint I really have about this game is that it seems to include a few creationist concepts that I personally do not agree with. It is brought up through the concept of humanism in the game which is symbolic of today's major religions that believe that a god created humans.\n     Another piece of this game that I am not fully content with is the way the protagonist moves. It can sometimes seem somewhat clumsy, but I won't be critical about it seeing as how that is how it is with most other point-and-click adventure games.\n     Overall, I would give this game an 8.5/10. It is definitely a worthwhile play for those who like games such as machinarium or other big point-and-click adventure games because of the unique elements it includes.\n     One last thing I would like to address is that it sometimes has multiple choices that can be made, leading to different outcomes. They do not alwyas have a huge effect on the story, but it adds a sense of independence in the game.\nI highly recommend that you all look into playing this game :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1436486644, "timestamp_updated": 1436486644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16962150": {"recommendationid": "16962150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039580049", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 267, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436533015}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't played a point & click adventure game for a long time now (my last game was the second \"Broken Sword\" game, which came out in 1997).

It was quite entertaining. Solving the puzzles felt good and the story (though not character driven) evolved in a way that made sense. \nThere was only one major flaw in the game - a puzzle that required the player to know a different language!

Et pour couronner le tout, les univers post-apocalyptiques sont plut\u00f4t ma tasse de th\u00e9. Pour moi, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que j'allais passer un bon moment avec Primordia !\n\nIl y a beaucoup d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments pour faire un bon jeu dans Primordia !\nH\u00e9las, malgr\u00e9 tous mes bons \u00e0-prioris et ma volont\u00e9 de m'amuser, je n'ai jamais r\u00e9ussi.\n\nHistoire en r\u00e9sum\u00e9:\nL'humanit\u00e9 a disparu compl\u00e8tement depuis des lustres et ses seuls h\u00e9ritiers peuplant la Terre sont les robots, qui ont reconstruit une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bien \u00e0 eux, h\u00e9ritant toutes les tares de leurs cr\u00e9ateurs. L'Homme n'est aujourd'hui plus qu'une l\u00e9gende, certains robots y croient, et d'autres non. Horatio, le h\u00e9ros, vit en ermite dans le d\u00e9sert et se fait voler la pi\u00e8ce ma\u00eetresse de son vaisseau par un robot mena\u00e7ant. Aid\u00e9 par son petit assistant Crispin, il se lance \u00e0 la poursuite du voleur, ce qui l'entra\u00eenera dans diverses p\u00e9rip\u00e9ties...\n\nPremi\u00e8res constatations : les graphismes sont d\u00e9licieusement mornes et d\u00e9primants, et la musique est du plus bel effet.\nLes doublages sont pas mal, m\u00eame si l'intonation des personnages (robots) est constamment monocorde, et que leur voix est souvent distordue, ce qui se r\u00e9v\u00e8le un peu fatiguant \u00e0 la longue. On retrouve l'ami Abe Goldfarb, qui doublait Joey dans les Blackwell, et qui se cantonne ici encore au r\u00f4le de l'assistant du h\u00e9ros, Crispin. Mais \u00e7a fait toujours plaisir de le retrouver !\n\nPlus on avance, plus on se rend compte que l'histoire et l'ambiance sont tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieuses. Les quelques traits d'humour sont surtout des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de geek (jeux vid\u00e9o comme half life, fallout, etc) et des blagues d'informaticien, bref, tout ce que je d\u00e9teste. Dommage !\nLe rythme est lent et je me suis demand\u00e9 de nombreuses fois quand l'intrigue allait finir par d\u00e9coller, ou quand les choses allaient vraiment bouger. Ca vient peut-\u00eatre aussi de l'ambiance pesante ou simplement de l'univers assez fig\u00e9 et monotone. C'est s\u00fbrement voulu, mais du coup, \u00e0 aucun moment je ne me suis amus\u00e9 sur ce jeu. Je ne me suis jamais senti non plus emport\u00e9 par l'intrigue, qui passe rapidement de retrouver la pi\u00e8ce du vaisseau \u00e0 sauver une ville enti\u00e8re. Un rebondissement un peu trop classique dans le genre.\nDifficile de se sentir impliqu\u00e9 lorsque cette ville est peupl\u00e9e de seulement quelques robots. En effet, avec le recul, vous n'int\u00e9ragirez pas avec beaucoup de personnages : ceux avec lesquels le h\u00e9ros peut vraiment dialoguer de fa\u00e7on \u00e9labor\u00e9e (hormis son compagnon) ne sont pas nombreux.\nLes dialogues montrent \u00e0 quel point les robots du coin sont compl\u00e8tement tordus / bugg\u00e9s, ce qui peut \u00eatre amusant. Vers la fin, le h\u00e9ros affirme qu'il en consid\u00e8re certains comme ses amis alors qu'au bout du compte, ils se sont crois\u00e9s dans la journ\u00e9e et n'ont eu que des \u00e9changes assez limit\u00e9s (hormis avec Crispin, encore une fois). C'est assez bizarrement amen\u00e9. Mis \u00e0 part Horatio, les personnages ont un background assez peu d\u00e9velopp\u00e9, ce qui ne permet pas de s'y attacher vraiment. Leur (non) charisme n'aide pas beaucoup non plus, mis \u00e0 part Crispin, qui fait de son mieux pour caser des blagues et des remarques cyniques quand il peut.\n\nReste alors les \u00e9nigmes. \nCertaines sont plut\u00f4t originales (le branchement des c\u00e2bles par exemple), certaines sont juste usantes. Avec le recul, encore une fois, je me rends compte que j'ai pass\u00e9 une bonne partie de mon temps \u00e0 trouver des codes et \u00e0 jongler avec pour ouvrir des portes / r\u00e9parer des trucs. Le reste du temps, je l'ai pass\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver des objets pour les donner \u00e0 un gus X ou Y qui m'en refile un autre en \u00e9change, et ainsi de suite. La forme est parfois vari\u00e9e mais le fond ne l'est pas du tout. Le peu qu'il reste se compose d'\u00e9nigmes de r\u00e9paration et de dialogues de type questions-r\u00e9ponses - vrai/faux selon ce que vous avez retenu du dialogue.\n\nL'outil qui r\u00e9cup\u00e8re les donn\u00e9es part d'une bonne intention puisqu'il vous permet de stocker les infos et de les garder sous la main \u00e0 tout moment pour r\u00e9soudre les \u00e9nigmes, comme une sorte de calepin. Le probl\u00e8me, c'est qu'il stocke \u00e0 la fois des informations cruciales et des trucs compl\u00e8tement inutiles ou dont vous ne vous servirez plus jamais (il n'efface pas automatiquement les infos qui correspondent \u00e0 des \u00e9nigmes r\u00e9solues depuis belle lurette), ce qui vous oblige \u00e0 faire d\u00e9filer tout un tas de pages sans int\u00e9r\u00eat avant de retrouver celle qui vous int\u00e9resse. A quoi \u00e7a sert ?\n\nPoint appr\u00e9ciable cela dit : aucune erreur / mauvais choix n'est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un \u00e9chec dans le jeu. Vous pouvez tout \u00e0 fait foirer une sc\u00e8ne, le jeu consid\u00e8rera toujours qu'il s'agit de votre mani\u00e8re \u00e0 vous de faire avancer l'histoire. Ca vous laisse donc de nombreuses possibilit\u00e9s de d\u00e9bloquer des situations. Autre point positif qui en d\u00e9coule directement : de nombreuses fins sont disponibles !\n\nAu bout du compte, le jeu est plut\u00f4t court (entre 4 et 6h), sauf si vous comptez le recommencer pour tester toutes les solutions et les fins. L'histoire est assez t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9e, et plut\u00f4t basique sur le sujet Science-fiction / robots.\n\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9 :\nSi vous aimez beaucoup les point and click, les ambiances post-apocalyptiques, la science fiction, les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences geek, les robots, et surtout, si vous \u00eates un grand nostalgique, vous appr\u00e9cierez sans doute ce jeu, en plus le prix est plut\u00f4t correct.\nSeulement voil\u00e0, ces crit\u00e8res sont g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, et cette critique refl\u00e8te uniquement mon avis personnel. Oui, il est possible d'\u00eatre d\u00e9\u00e7u par ce jeu, il s'agit plus d'une mise en garde. Si les points n\u00e9gatifs que j'ai mentionn\u00e9s sont importants pour vous, donc si vous avez plus ou moins les m\u00eames exigences que moi, r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissez bien.\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re que ceux qui se laisseront tenter l'appr\u00e9cieront, car j'adore ce studio et j'ai beaucoup de respect pour le travail qu'ils accomplissent habituellement.", "timestamp_created": 1435403552, "timestamp_updated": 1435403552, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561630", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16733479": {"recommendationid": "16733479", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998136902", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435380658}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing. \n\nFallout+Machinarium+Awesome Companion=Primordia", "timestamp_created": 1435382505, "timestamp_updated": 1435382505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16718609": {"recommendationid": "16718609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028911545", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435049134}, "language": "english", "review": "Silly humour and neat story, really enjoyed it.\n\nI'm not sure on their decision to making a game in this day and age for a 320x200 CRT screen though, and have to upscale it on you screen.

During the first 20 minutes I was pushing myself to continue based only on the positive reputation of the title. I\u2019m glad I stuck with it, because when it gets going it\u2019s an admirable game. The world and the story has as much rigorous thought and attention put to it as you could ever demand of a title. \n\nMy only problem with the game (apart from the slow start) is the puzzles. I don\u2019t mind slow paced games, or solving puzzles. But there\u2019s something with the point-and-click form that makes me lose patience faster than 3d puzzle games like Portal or Antichamber. There\u2019s always walkthroughs to help out players like me, but I don\u2019t like going that route. There\u2019s puzzles in Primordia where I have no idea how I would have ever solved them, like in my entire life, without looking up the solution. I want to see what happens next in the story, that\u2019s my primary interest in these titles. But the designers thought otherwise, and because they thought this was a good idea, I\u2019m not going to think ill of anyone who likes the puzzles. It\u2019s just not for me. And I guess it\u2019s \u201cnot really a problem\u201d because faqs exist. But I wish there was something else that could be done with this type of game. Of all the point-and-click games I\u2019ve played there\u2019s only a couple where I haven\u2019t hit a wall because of pixel hunting. Those moments always make me wonder what the point is.\n\nDespite that rambling second paragraph I would absolutely recommend Primordia to anyone who likes the look of it. It\u2019s superb sci-fi, of the kind that\u2019s not just rare in games, but rare anywhere. It treats its characters and the world with intelligence and respect. What made the first 20 minutes a bit dull was that I couldn't tell how ambitious it was going to be with the setting. I mean I've seen a ton of stories start out like this with lonely scavengers in the desert. But when it started dropping hints about what the game would really be about it made me increasingly excited. It takes a serious stab at exploring what life as a machine in a world run by machines would be like. What their religions and laws could be. Echoes of their human ancestors, now adapted for their style of thinking. And it does this without any attempt at dumbing it down for a wide audience.

The only thing left is their own invention: machine. Machine that prospered and slowly became just like human, with their own ideas and vices. Even if they're limited by their programming, they could still interact with others like normal folk. Taking the reigns of Horatio Nullbuilt and Crispin, what starts as a simple retrieval turns into a full blown adventure, albeit a somewhat short trip.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]: The game itself follows the point and click style of gameplay, so its hard to screw that part up. That said, it does a good enough job being difficult and leaving you wondering \"what the hell do I do now?\" Thankfully, Crispin has a built in hint-o-tron to give you tips on what you could do or should do if you're ever stumped. The puzzles themselves are, in my opinion, pretty darn easy. The only difficult ones would be where you meet your unfriendly thief again or when you need access to a certain place with a long string of code. Other than that, it's pretty straight forward. Then again, I play puzzles for kicks so take that with a grain of salt. \n\nThere [i]are[/i] some puzzles with different methods of completion, usually a good and bad way. Sometimes the bad way is the only obvious way, where the good way will require a save here and there to help you out should you pull an oopsie. By the way, you'll probably be doing this often. Puzzles do have \"soft-fail\" states, which can be pretty infuriating, so save often! The actual game itself is, unfortunately, pretty damn short. You could probably finish the entire game within 5 hours or so (after knowing everything and everyone and all the choices). There is [i]A TON[/i] of going back and forth. No joke, you'll probably find yourself going back and forth between robots, trying everything, for a good 10 minutes until something works. It can get annoying fast. There are also a few references sprinkled here and there to earn a few chuckles. Some more obvious than others.\n\n[b]Art[/b]: Holy hell, this art style. While a mess of browns, it works so damn well together. Not to mention Horatio and Crispin always seem to stand out from the environment whenever possible, so that's also a plus. Unfortunately, the overwhelming abundance of browns makes finding some robots or items kinda difficult. Had to pull the hover method to find a few things sometimes. I understand its supposed to be post-apocalyptia, but sometimes you have to look away and rub your eyes.\n\n[b]Music[/b]: It's amazing. Done.\n\n[b]Acting[/b]: The VA in this game are beautiful and, at the same time, somewhat phoned in. Sometimes you can tell the lines are being read from the script. Other times you feel it from the heart. It is, overall, a very good experience to feel the voices actually try when they do. Funnily enough, it was the side characters that, in my opinion, had the best acting compared to our main characters.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that loves a good point and click adventure with a fanfuckingtastic sound track.", "timestamp_created": 1432790352, "timestamp_updated": 1432790352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16005580": {"recommendationid": "16005580", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961367991", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459816510}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great!

Primordia does so many things right, stuff that should be common in every game of this genre, like multiple solutions to puzzles, branching paths and multiple endings.\n\nBoth the story and atmosphere are great, and Crispin, the sidekick, serves not only as a great jokester, but also as a nice hint system that ensures that we are not left wandering aimlessly, like in many old adventure games. \n\nThe game is quite short, but it\u2019s better for it, as it doesn\u2019t suffer from overreach, and it achieves the goal of telling a good story and exploring interesting themes.\n\nThere\u2019s not many downsides to this game, but one particular puzzle, near the end of the game (involving a kiosk), annoyed me, and didn\u2019t played by the same rules as the rest of the game. I also thought that the voice of Horatio never felt appropriate for a robot (it\u2019s the same actor as the main character of Gemini Rue, but in that case it fit great) , but it\u2019s just a minor quibble.

This is their only commercial release to date but they did do two games for Indie Speed Run 2013 called Like a Raisin in the Sun and Salt. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where all the humans are gone and you play a robot named Horatio Nullbuilt.  You have a broken down ship that you live in and another robot breaks in shoots you and steals your power core. Now you are on a mission to get it back.\n\nGameplay:\n\tIt plays just like a typical point & click adventure game. Finding objects to use and figure out puzzles to progress further in the game. Puzzles were a little challenging for me but were fun to figure out. They require some logic and can have multiple ways to figure them out. Choices you make in the game can change things later in the game. If you\u2019ve played other adventure games then you\u2019ll have no trouble playing this.\n\nStory:\n\tIt kept me interested and curious to dig deeper. It all starts out over a power core but there\u2019s a deeper secret you can uncover if you make the right choices in the game. Great supporting cast which brought some comedy to the game. I really enjoyed the banter from Crispin your little sidekick throughout the game. There\u2019s also seven different endings to the story if you care to see them all.\n\nVisuals & Sound:\n\tIt has retro style graphics with some great looking hand drawn rooms. They did a great job of showing you a dark and grim world. An easy to use interface, and great voice acting. You can also change it to text only if you are one who just wants to read it all.\n\nOverall:\n\tPrimordia was a fun and enjoyable game. The story was a little slow in the beginning but picks up a little ways in. I laughed at times and even felt a little sad at times. It\u2019s well worth playing if you enjoy point & click adventure games or a good story and it won\u2019t take you to long to beat.", "timestamp_created": 1428966992, "timestamp_updated": 1428966992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15315355": {"recommendationid": "15315355", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969331425", "num_games_owned": 808, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428801760}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic story and puzzles.

That \"bit\" more turned into hours and hours of continuously playing this game. This game just throws at you the mix of a great story line + good caracther development + Not too hard to figure out but still good puzzles and great comedy. It doesn't have the same funny tone all the time however\n\nWhen Horatio and Crispin fail to find a power source in the wastelands they are forced to head to Metropol, the self proclamed city of glass and light. \"Free power for one and all\" is what they advertise and they do have power for everyone, but it does come with a price. When Horatio and Crispin step out of the red line train, Horatio finds a robot who collects 1 megacycle from him. At the time, Horatio has no idea of what a megacycle is, but he does find out eventually that the megacycles are brain power, we could also call it processing power. Anyways, the story goes along and Horatio finds out that his power core is stored on the big tower where Metromind is. He then goes on to try and get it back and that's when things take a darker turn.

The story back drop is extremely enticing and will make you want to do some playable digging to find out more about the story and the characters. The puzzles are not as easy as they look and decision making trees offer differing outcomes to the story. As an added plus you get to know and love these characters and in some small way emotionally invest in them within a relatively short time. You\u2019ll laugh at their jokes, good and bad, and you\u2019ll care whether or not they succeed in their endeavors.

Your actions define the end of the game, from early choices all the way down to the final and last choice you make, all add to overall feeling of completion when you see the ending cutscene.\n\nThe soundtrack is no slouch and helps build atmosphere and keeps a very \"Wizards\" end of the world vibe throughout.

See Conclusion[/h1]\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nPrimordia is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Wormwood Studios and made available on Steam through the Greenlight system.  It features a fully voice-acted cast with a retro graphical art style that pays homage to the classical age of gaming.\n\n[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers):[/h1]\nThe story of Primordia takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where machines have taken over the world after the human race fought itself into extinction.  You follow the adventures of a self-aware android named Horatio Nullbuilt and his companion Crispin Horatiobuilt both residing inside a crashed ship called 'The UNNIIC'.  When a mysterious and powerful robot steals their power source, both Horatio and Crispin embark on a quest to seek out a new power source which eventually leads them to the mechanical city of Metropol.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ Good Retro Art Style\n+ Great character writing and developments\n+ Good story with an interesting back-story\n+ Atmospheric environment and world design\n+ Consequence-based choices that can affect the final outcome of the story\n+ Fully voice-acted characters\n+ Healthy game time of at least 6-8 hours depending on how quickly the player solves the puzzles\n+ Steam cloud support\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- No 'HD' or Widescreen Support, in which the game opts instead for a pitiful 320x200 resolution which, frankly speaking, makes my eyes hurt.\n- The game has a fetish for the color brown\n- Puzzles are sometimes irritatingly difficult\n- Does not expand much on the back-story which, in my opinion, is far more interesting than the main story\n- The game's humor is a hit and miss\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n[b]GREAT POINT-AND-CLICK EXPERIENCE.[/b]  I Green-lit this game when it showed up in my Queue because I was very interested in its concept, setting, and back-story, and once it was released I purchased it and found a fun and absorbing point-and-click game with homage to the classical style of the genre. \n\n[h1]WORTH IT?[/h1]\nOverall, Primordia is a great point-and-click adventure game that provides at least 6-8 hours\u2019 worth of game time. In addition, for only $10 (or your regional equivalent), it is definitely worth a look especially if you're a fan of the genre.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

The most notable ones (namely, those by LucasArts) were before my time, so my only games in this genre I\u2019ve played are the new Sam and Max games and this one.\n\nThis genre greatly focuses on its writing and story, and I feel Primorida does well in that regard. What starts as a simple story of tracking a robot who stole your stuff turns into a one with many hints about the world and why it\u2019s in the state it is, and Horatio\u2019s role in it. Each character, from the straight-laced and practical main character Horatio, to his perpetually floating, snarky sidekick Crispin, and everyone else you interact with is written with enough skill to give them unique personalities without falling into two-dimensional archetypes. While many NPCs fall into some stereotypes of their characters (ex: a soldier robot speaks how you\u2019d expect him to, likewise with a robot with a monocle), they get moments where they flesh out their character and have some very clever lines.\n\nThe overall plot kept me guessing all the way to the end, but stayed mostly clear about what was going on the whole way through. The story is straightforward in that regard, although the littering of hints of the details behind the game world really helped the story shine when it revealed big plot elements.\n\nHowever, I NEED to talk about the gameplay. It\u2019s your typical adventure game fare of solving puzzles by figuring out how items interact with each other, listening to context clues, etc. The game doesn\u2019t go too crazy with the solutions.\n\nThat being said, I will be honest and say I had to use a walkthrough for this game. This is most likely due to my inexperience with the genre, but many times I felt clueless on what to do. Furthermore, when I looked up the solution, I felt like the game gave me little to no inclination that what I was supposed to do may be the answer.\n\nPUZZLE SPOILERS\n\nOne of the most \u201chow was I supposed to do that\u201d moments was when I needed to figure out how to remove rust from gears so I could open a door. I hadn\u2019t met anyone who was a cleaning robot or the like, and I had no items on me that implied they could clean. It turns out that in one segment, there are underwater \u201csubmersible\u201d robots who, when I dunked the gears underwater where they were, cleaned the gears. When I clicked on them normally, the main character said NOTHING about their potential cleaning ability.\n\nAnother annoying one was a moment of \u201cI didn\u2019t know I could do that\u201d. I had to inspect a door in order to solve a puzzle, but left-clicking it gave me a quote that didn\u2019t help me. However, right-clicking it gave me a different one relevant to the puzzle. I know that could right-click on items to hear a description of them in my inventory, but I didn\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t just left-click this door to hear the contextually-important quote for this puzzle.\n\nEND PUZZLE SPOILERS\n\nSo overall, I\u2019d say that you should not feel ashamed if you need a walkthrough for certain puzzles in this game. The second half of this game has quite a few rather obtuse ones, which is a shame since they can halt the progression of what is otherwise a really cool story.\n\nMy other problem is a technical one: this game has no resolution options! It can only either run in fullscreen (which I think is 1024x768!!!) or windowed which has a default size that is most suitable for ants. Thankfully you can turn the \u201cscaling\u201d up, which means increasing the size of the internal resolution (window size in windowed mode increases with this), but the lack of proper resolution options just strikes me as lazy to me.\n\nLastly, and this is sort of a nitpick, but this isn\u2019t Logan Cunningham\u2019s best work. He does a decent job not sounding bored in his lines and emoting properly when necessary, but either due to sound engineering, low quality audio files, or otherwise not as much strength in his voice work, he isn\u2019t as memorable as he was in Bastion. I felt the sidekick Crispin out-did him in passionately delivering his lines. It doesn\u2019t detract from the game at all really, I\u2019m more just feeling like he could have done better.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nI strongly suggest you guys pick up Primorida. It\u2019s got an interesting plot inside a unique atmosphere of a post-human world, and the writing does those both justice. The puzzles can be result in premature baldness due to hair-pulling difficulty, but they didn\u2019t stop me from enjoying the game.", "timestamp_created": 1420685322, "timestamp_updated": 1420685322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13887601": {"recommendationid": "13887601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021378479", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420677482}, "language": "english", "review": "Another Point & Click masterpiece from Wadjet Eye. \nSmart, quirky, mature dialogue and story.\nA haunting post-apocalyptic cyberpunk atmosphere reminicent of \"I have no mouth and i must scream\".\nLogical and streamlined puzzles, yet very challenging.

From the first 10 minutes of playing I discovered an involving Sci-Fi story. This, compounded with the nostalgic, low resolution graphics, fired my imagination. Now I am eager to learn what lies in store for the main protagonist and his delightfully snarky side-kick.\n\n.

My primary interest was the visual style, which reminded me somewhat of Machinarium, a lovely adventure puzzler I played a few years back. Primordia is more a traditional adventure game however and I wasn't prepared for how fully it sucked me in once I began playing.\n\nIt all begins with a robot named Horatio ... Horatio Nullbuilt v. 5 to be precise. Horatio has a problem, the power core to his fixer-upper airship the UNNIIC has just been stolen by a badass bruiser bot and without it, he and his floating companion Crispin will die a slow death out in the dunes, unable to recharge their batteries or get anywhere that they can do so in time. Thus begins this rather unassuming, but ultimately rather epic point-and-click adventure game.\n\nMy few problems with Primordia are the same I have with most retro-style adventure games, those being the combination of low res graphics and archaic systems making it difficult to know what is clickable and what is not. Playing \"hunt the pixel\" along with environments filled with \"flavor\" clickables, meant I missed a few crucial objects here and there, leading to a bit of frustration. Other than that however, the puzzles of Primordia are mostly logical, with only a few moments of \"how was I supposed to know that?\" or where a lack of full understanding of all that Horatio and Crispin together could do kept me confused.\n\nThe story and world building in Primordia more than make up for any shortcomings however. Set in a world populated only by robots, where \"Man\" is nothing more than a myth for all but a few devoted \"Humanists\", Primordia frames the typical post-apocalyptic dystopia in a fresh light. While at times predictable, the interactions between characters makes even a conclusion you've already jumped to a joy to behold. The dialog in Primordia oozes with personality, especially between the stoic Horatio and the sardonic Crispin. While oft-times broadly drawn, getting to know the denizens of the world of Primordia is half the fun, especially learning the quirks of their robotic society. There is plenty of lore to uncover as well throughout the game, fleshing out the periphery of the world and ultimately contributing to the main story in interesting ways.\n\nBy the time all is said and done, you'll have explored a rich world in Primordia, made choices that actually matter, and experienced one of several endings, some of which are locked by key decisions earlier in the game.

Critics have said that some of the puzzles to this game are too difficult and require a walkthrough,,, no, they don't, they require a pencil, a scrap of paper, and an attention span longer than someone who would give a Call of Duty game an 8.5 out of 10 on their website.\nI managed this game without a walkthrough, granted one numerical puzzle was tough but not impossible, the general idea is that you're a fucking robot so of course you're going to end up doing some goddam computing. As soon as you start writing all of the relevant information to the puzzle on paper you begin to see the rules and elements of the puzzle exposed and ready for solving. YOU DO NOT NEED A WALKTHROUGH let the game grant you the satisfaction of completing it yourself.\nThis pen and paper style comes into play multiple times throughout and really rewards the player for paying attention to the environment around them.\n\nThis is an absolutely beautiful game that mostly airs around these cozy melancholic hub-worlds and takes the occasional incursion into the deep dank dark unknown.

What really draws you in is the unique story and interesting dialogue along with the sci-fi, post apocalyptic setting.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game, but there are definitely a few things that could have been improved. The game setup before you launch the game can only be accessed in the game folder and can't be launched in game or through steam. When the setup is run it's somewhat confusing and I always felt as if the graphics weren't set up right. Watching the trailer for the game confirms this when I see crisp, clean graphics on the store page and fuzzy, muddy graphics on mine and changing to higher settings just seemed to make it look worse. It seems though that that developers are continuing to make improvements, so maybe this can be fixed in the future.\n\nBalance in the game seemed a bit lacking as solving puzzles became an effort in frustration at times. Having your sidekick Crispin give you clues helped quite a bit, but even with his help some areas required random trial and error because you had no clue what to do. Without a little help from a guide I probably wouldn't have finished the game. \n\nMinor gripes aside though, I had a great time playing this game. With a quality soundtrack, voice acting and funny dialogue it was well worth it. Multiple endings helped keep it interesting a bit as well with radically different results to the storyline.

The graphics and music create an eerie setting. Upon entering the city of Metropol, I immediately felt a disease with everything around me.

The knowledge that the bad guy is watching your every move and is intelligent enough to start planning hundreds of steps ahead makes me shiver.\n\nThe puzzles are what you'd expect in a robot apocolypse: very technological, a strict sense of rules behind each one. All give off an extra feeling that speaks to me as \"yep. Puzzles caused by robots alright.\"\n\nBy the end though, I didn't feel particularly emotionally affected. Which was weird because I did feel for the characters. I gasped at plot twists, I shivered at the Big Bad, and my heart felt like it was stepped on when spoiler stuff happened. But I suppose it was just brief moments of emotions rather than a lasting impact. Maybe apocolypse stuff isn't my thing. Maybe it was that the darkness of the plot sort of negated any victory.

The graphics are pixellated, but not in the sense often used by amateur indie designers as an obvious cost-cutting measure. This is pixel art at its finest: lovingly crafted details in every background and most characters show that the game's artist took their work extremely seriously. That effort paid off in spades.\n\nThe second thing you will probably notice about Primordia is that almost everything about it is bleak. This is not the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout, where things have gone to hell but black comedy keeps things from getting too dark. There is humor in the game, but it works in spite of the world being broken, not because of it. Humanity is extinct, its robotic creations and their creations in turn forming what qualifies for society in Primordia's shattered world. Energy is life, and power is running out.\n\n\nThe third thing you will notice is that often the game works in a far more logical way than others in its genre might lead you to expect. Early on you see a lantern on a high shelf your character cannot reach. The solution? Ask your hovering robot sidekick to push it down. There are a lot of moments like that in Primordia, where logic prevails over the typical adventure game \"must be as drunk as the original designer to comprehend\" school of puzzles. \n\n\nThat said, there are still moments where you may not figure out on your own. I had to look things up at least a couple times in my playthrough to advance. Not everyone will, and I would discourage players from reading up except as a last resort.

Ein \u00fcberragendes Spiel, verpackt als klassisches Adventure.

Das Inventar bleibt w\u00e4hrend des gesamten Spiels \u00fcberschaubar, wilde Kombinationen und unlogische Puzzles gibt es nicht.

The biggest flaw is that the game occasionally has pixel-hunting puzzles, which are never good. Bad developers. Only time in the game I looked at guides was when I was missing something from pixel hunting (random LCD screen, bah, random floating junk, what even?)\nThe palette's also a bit dull overall; I get the point of having so much brown but it gets a little tiring to look at after a while, though the game's gorgeous looking otherwise.\nThat aside, only the postitives left. The two protagonist characters each have quite a bit of personality to them and play off each other well for plenty of amusing moments, though the game still keeps a fairly serious and dark tone throughout. The other various characters are all quite unique and memorable and serve the overall plot in interesting ways, usually having their own mini-arcs. The backstory and worldbuilding is also very rich, not outright saying a lot but leaving the pieces scattered for the player to put together. \nThe puzzles are also generally good. Plenty of the standard item-trading things but there's no moon logic present there. And there's straight up logic puzzles on occasion, too, which are probably the most fun. There's no need to memorize strings of numbers or information, either; the game auto-saves all relevant data in the main character's datapouch, as well as providing a map for quick travel. It's got a lot of old-school adventure game design with a more modern feel to it, making it both well-crafted and elegant in execution.\nThere's a lot to like here and little to dislike, I heavily recommend it to, well, pretty much anyone really, but especially point-and-click enthusiasts, because this is certainly top-tier in that regard.", "timestamp_created": 1412314813, "timestamp_updated": 1412314813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12295147": {"recommendationid": "12295147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039843270", "num_games_owned": 530, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465265280}, "language": "english", "review": "What an amazing game! \n\nIf you are a point & click adventure lover, like myself, you'll feel good with this game. :D\nIf you are not into adventure games, but appreciates good stories and atmospheres, you'll like it also.\n\nIt reminds me of Beneath A Steel Sky, another amazing cyberpunk adventure, but Primordia is darker.  \n\nWorth mentioning:\n - Awesome atmosphere (what can I say?

I don't like to hear \"IF we ever do another patch.\"  A bug in an adventure game isn't like most other games.  You don't always know there is a problem.

It is thoughtful and meaningful, and addresses some serious theological and philosophical points, while remaining mysterious and exciting (most of the time).  However, I found the gameplay to be very lacking, in a number of ways.  I'm now going to complain about all the things I need to complain about, but do please recall that I actually enjoyed this game :)\n\nThe puzzles in this game were difficult, and not in a good way.  While many of them had \"cool\" solutions - which would be awesome in a movie, for example - they were often not cleanly solvable, in the sense that they were the only plausible solution and made everything \"make sense\" when you figured it out.  For me, a lot of the reason I want to play a puzzle game is for that awesome feeling of everything coming together when I figure it out.  This is not the sort of game that does that for me.  Here's a few of the problems that I saw:\n\n1. Trying to create a clever solution rather than a good puzzle.  The solutions to puzzles are often the sort of zany solutions that are fun to watch heroes think of in movies, but not reasonable to force the player to think of.  In other words, they don't feel like THE solution, just A solution (and yet in the confines of the game, they are THE solution).\n2. Tooooo many items.  Unlike a lot of games, in Primordia you almost never get an item taken out of your inventory when you are done using it.  By the end of the game, I have so much stuff in my inventory that the task of getting through a locked door has dozens of reasonable-sounding solutions - crowbar, plasma torch, signal transmitter to pick the lock, etc, etc - but only one of them is right (and it's probably none of the standard things I've learned how to do throughout the game, because that would be to easy).\n3. Generic, reusable items.  This is one of my pet peeves in puzzle games.  When you have a generic item like a hammer, there's a trillion and five ways that the player can think of to use this item.  Even if the game designer could think of all of those, allowing those solutions would make many of their puzzles too easy.  Anyway, this game is full of generic items that you use again and again throughout the game (but are never allowed to use when you think of it).\n4. Confusing items.  I had a whole bunch of electronic gadgets and doodads that it took me a long time to figure out how they worked - a signal transmitter, a decryption device, a memory reader, etc.  All of these could be used only in very specific circumstances (i.e. as far as I can tell, the memory reader can only be used to access memories from a severed robot head - which you encounter in this game a lot more than you would think!), but this information is never explicitly told to you (I never really figured out what the rules for the decryption device were).\n5. Just too much going on at once.  The game is basically divided into two parts.  During each part, you slowly unlock more areas, and then can travel freely between all areas that you have unlocked during that part, which by the end of each part results in a huge environment in which to look for a small number of remains tasks.\n\nThe end result of all of this was that I played the game with a walkthrough constantly ready.  And I do not regret it :)  Most of the things I had to get help on (\"most\" because I started getting lazy near the end), I think I would have felt frustrated rather than satisfied if I took the time to solve myself.\n\nThe interface is unfathomably archaic and unintuitive.  For example, the process of using an item - one of the most base necessities of a point and click game - requires (1) hovering near the top of the screen to open the tool bar, (2) selecting the inventory button to open your inventory, (3) selecting the item from the inventory, (4) clicking outside the inventory to close it, then finally (5) clicking on the thing in the world that you want to use the item on.  On all the interfaces mentioned, there are also many confusing and sometimes unnecessary/duplicate buttons.  The datachron (which automatically takes notes on things you have learned) has a horrific interface that looks something like an old school gameboy, with giant text on a tiny screen, and buttons (that you have to click with your mouse) for scolling up and down.  Similarly, the signal transmitter - on which you frequently need to set a 4-digit number to transmit - is pretty obnoxious, requiring you to click on the left and right sides of two dials (not even buttons that you can see, so it's hard to find the sweet spot to actually click on) - one to cycle through numbers, and one to cycle through DIGITS.  DIGITS.\n\nAll that being said, however, I think this game is definitely worth playing for the story alone, which like I said is fantastic.", "timestamp_created": 1410401845, "timestamp_updated": 1410401845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12046519": {"recommendationid": "12046519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010334329", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410309420}, "language": "english", "review": "Play it.

I even had a Developer helped me to get the game up and running.\n- Art isn't up to my standard.\n- A bit short game (approx 5 hours), but for 2.5 USD when discounted/on sale (or bundled), well... I guess  can't be helped.\n\nThe gameplay is just another point and click adventure. You pick up one object, deliver it to one character, get another item to unlock another area... rinse and repeat. You also are required to pay attention to hints collected. Not so much new invention in this aspect.\n\nStory, well, I can't say much without spoiling anything, but the story is interesting enough. In fact, I wouldn't have completed the game had the story been bad. It's like, again, The Cat Lady - light story in the beginning and developing slowly until the finale.\n\nSoundtrack is so-so, not that good but not that bad. Voice actors, however, are top notch. They really portray the characters well. Oh yes, don't forget about hilarious exchanges between Horatio and Chrispin throughout the game.

I liked it, but there came a time when i said enough was enough. I gave up on the game not because it's broken, no because the stories bad, and not because it's a bad game. I stopped because i couldn't stand some design choices made by the developer. If you don't have a problem with some of the issues i have with this game, then it might be a better game then i let on.\n\nThis game is good, the stories a bit so-so (i am not a sci-fi fan, so this may not be the case for you), but there is a depth to the world that makes exploration satisfying. For an adventure game (and a sci-fi), it's not bad. Adventure games are usually sold based on their stroy, or their atmosphere and world; this one falls squarely with the interesting world brand of adventure games. It takes a serious stance to its story, so if you wanted another monkey island-ish adventure game, keep looking. The visuals are solid, and what humor there is (mainly in the form of referenceses, such as the crowbar) isn't very satisfying, but it's harmless. \n\nWhere the game lost me is its choice on puzzle design. There comes a time when you have to do some tasks, like convince 2 robots to stop arguing. The problem i have with it is they don't give you the information for long, so you either have to write it down or memorize it. Only after writing it down can you try to solve the riddle. It's a bit backwards, where you have to work around outdated, missing, or omited mechanics to get to the puzzle before you've even had a chance to ponder it. There is a device that records important pieces of information, but what it deems as important can be hit or miss sometimes (such as the robot diologue riddles, where the riddles aren't written down). \n\nThe game also does a very poor job of giving hints if your stuck. This problem, and a few others, are indicitive of the genre. One such problem is having puzzles where you have to guess at what the developer wanted you to use to progress. An example would be ruining soup in some adventure game, where you have mud, shoe polish, and a rat. Only one will ruin the soup, despite all of them being viable in a realist sense. \n\nIn the end, this is an adventure game, so replayability is already low. I'd rather not waste my time reruning the same diologue trees over and over, which is what i found i had to do for the robot riddle puzzles. If I couldn't write fast enough (cus memorizing the jargen and name drops was not easy), i would have to guess and restart. There are i believe 5 riddles or so, so having to restart from the 4th on can be annoying to say the least. At this point, the game felt more like work then fun, so i gave up on it. I didn't want to put in that much effort for what i felt was not enough in return. \n\nYou are expected to bring a lot to the table to get through the game. Good memory, write stuff down, and replay the same section over if you experiment. You will find that trying to force your way through diologue puzzles is very time consuming. If you get stuck and fall back on this, you might feel inticed to cheat (as i was). When i feel like i have to resort to a walkthrough to make progress, the game begins to feels like a chore. It's not fun when you have to use a walkthrough for an adventure game, because relying on it really takes you out of the world. Personally, i call it quits at that point, as i did here\n\nTo reiterate, this is not a bad game. It's a game with a vision that i fell outside of. If you played a lot of old-school adventure games, or you're a sci-fi fan, you might find a lot to like. If you find you didn't like older adventure games (or Daedelic's brand of adventure games, like The Dark Eye or Memoria), or you gravitate towards newer games like the Telltale brand of adventure games, this game may not be to you're liking.\n\nIf an old-school sci-fi adventure game with some of the problems of older games, as well a bit unforgiving approach to game design (in that you will solve problems for yourself, without more help then the developer deems nessassary) sound good to you, then this might be a game you will enjoy.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf anyone should wonder why the developer of the game commented on this review (i was very suprised about it, personally), it's because he questioned some of my reasons for quiting, as well as questioning why i would post a review of a game i played so little of. After being initially pissed, i thought a lot about the review and realized how many assuptions i had taken as fact. I heavily edited the review after i thought about it, namely because the initial review didn't convey what i wanted it to; this game was not for me, for the reasons listed above, but it might be the game for you depending on your tastes. \n\nThe developer didn't harrass me (though initially i thought he had), and i am changing this review because i feel like it. Mark was a decent guy, and he responded more calmly and professionally then i thought he would. I made the changes i did because i was initially wrong, the developer earned my respect, and i had gone back over the review and found it unsatisfactory. If you think this makes my review less reliable, then so be it.

Tough, but (almost always) fair, puzzles? Done. A compelling narrative? Oh yeah. This game has all of two downsides - first, that clues are sprinkled into the dialogue, but there isn't a way to reexamine or replay it, so sometimes you're left guessing. Second, the game is short - but this is more of a nitpick than anything, because its actual length belies the completeness which the game concludes with.

Visually it all works and the music pleasantly chugs along - Along with some humour from Horatio and Crispin.\n\nHere's the problem though; Just as the game allows you to get more comfortable and eager to explore the story more, it stops becoming fun. The middle section of the game has some painful 'swap this for that' puzzle sequences that become a chore, and you are only driven to continue because of the story, and trust me, you will be looking at a walkthrough at some point, some of the puzzles are too obtuse.\n\nIt also ends far too soon - overall only having 2 main environments in the whole game is not that satisfying at all, and what could have been quite atmospheric starts to feel a little brownwashed. The character development was never built up long enough for me to feel any emotional connections with the characters, and there were some uninspired and cliched plot turns. Beneath A Steel Sky never varied too much in environment either but at least it stayed enjoyable right to the end. There are multiple paths in the game to take which will lead to different endings - but it really depends on whether you enjoyed the first run to want to do this, and I'm not entirely sure if I want to play this game again for a while.

It's dark and grim. It's about \"Horatio Nullbuilt\", a somewhat stoic and secretive humanoid robot living alone in some long-stranded organic-looking airship in the middle of some barren brown desert. Humans are long gone, only machines remain, some worship them - or their legacy - in a secluded and lonesome manner as Horatio does. He has a self-built low-grade flying companion robot, \"Crispin Horatiobuilt\", who is an obvious sidekick, who keeps refering to himself as that and who is supposed to be a constant contrast to his builder for he is not as nearly withdrawn as him but more humorous, even on a meta-like level for example when he comments your futile efforts to do the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\n\nThere are more interesting characters to see. All kinds of machines who inhabit the few remaining places in the world. Be it a bomb from some long-past war that never detonated and which is worshipped for it is a creation of man, the remains of colossal titan robots buried deep within the desert or old human cities maintained by robots just enough not to collapse totally.\n\nPrimorida is a middle-scaled adventure for what I can tell. It has an interesting story, great characters, powerful voice acting (every character is voiced - and those robots who cannot talk bleep around in their own manner) and a significant amount of puzzling too. If I remember right I had to look up a walkthrough a few times, though I guess I was just blind on one eye for the solutions seemed reasonable afterwards. There are several endings, they all seem fitting and interesting in their way, and while the decision which you will see is made very lately in the game it is still somewhat relevant what you do mid-game. \n\nThere is a significant amount of lore background. You will meet characters who share their stories and views on the world. You will learn more about them, their motivations and failures. There is a robot society that kinda imitates human society. It has it's own leadership and entities. However barely anything about is perfect. It is in demise, and Horatio is trying to find his way through. He is connected to the world around him more than he admits, and getting to know him better was done very well I think, from robots remembering him to data logs hidden within the places he visits. The art is nice, there are some great dark or soothing music tunes, everything seemed crafted together well and I thought I was satisfied with all aspects of the game even though it has been a long while since I've played it.

Una gran ambientaci\u00f3n, una comicidad que te puede recordar a las antiguas aventuras gr\u00e1ficas de lucas arts. \nUn apartado sonoro correcto, una musica que te sumerge.

Nothing like I had always heard point and click games can be, with solutions that are so removed from reality you pretty much have to have a walkthrough to beat it unless you are supremely patient.\n\nthe fact that there is several endings as well as a way to alter the best ending slightly by how you play is quite wonderful.\n\nAll told the game shouldnt take you very long.   4-5 hours give or take allowing for some time to get stuck on what to do next I think.

However, I really could not get through this game. Some problems' solutions were just nonsensical and when I finally figured them out (a few took over 30 minutes of me just randomly clicking and searching), I was even more frustrated by the fact that they were supposed to be solved in that manner.\n\nTo give specific examples, [spoiler] the oil on the table that Oswald is drinking was extremely misleading. Crispin tells you that he saw oil in that area to clean the gears and that's the only oil you can actually interact with. Horatio says that Oswald won't let you take it, so it leads you to believe that you must do something to obtain it. However, you are supposed to give the gears to the shopkeeper, even though Horatio says something along the lines of, \"There's no point in talking to him.\" It took me about half an hour to finally stumble upon the idea of giving it to the shopkeeper arm, because I had done just about everything else possible. Additionally, the floating pile of junk in the underworks that contains Oswald's chain and the Gospel of Man is hardly distinguishable from the gunk around it. It would be nice if the pile shined every few seconds or something to indicate that it's not just another collection of useless garbage in the Underworks. Or you could even have Crispin say something like \"I thought I saw something shiny by the bridge where Clarity shot that husk.\" Also, the transmission code that you have to send to Factor \"0518\" was quite confusing considering you were given the code \"518\" and you only have a 4-digit transmitter. Of course, \"0518\" seems like the sensible first thing to do, but previously in the game when you were given a 3-digit code, you had to find the prefix number for it; \"0XXX\" would not work. My final gripe, where I stopped in this most recent playthrough, is the \"Redlien\" haiku in the kiosk terminal. Not only is it obscure and seemingly meaningless, Crispin's 'advice' is something similar to [i] it seemed like you could read that Redline poem in two different ways [/i], as if that helps at all. It didn't. I think I spent another 30 minutes on the \"Redlien\" puzzle, just rereading it and clicking on Crispin a bunch of times to no avail. [/spoiler] I eventually decided I wasn't having any fun and I should just stop. I should mention that I really enjoy the story as well as the writing. Horatio and Crispin are extremely likeable when they aren't repeating 'clues' that don't help with the puzzles. I [i] really [/i] wanted to enjoy this game; if I didn't I wouldn't have replayed it. I simply couldn't get over the confusing puzzles. Maybe I would recommend this for someone who doesn't mind reading a walkthrough every step of the way, but I just didn't have much fun playing this.\n\n \n\nOriginal Review (June 2014):\nPrimordia is a point and click game that has beautiful artwork and immersive music. The story is enjoyable and I encountered zero bugs. The characters are well-developed and the occasional humor is pretty funny. Sounds awesome, right? Well, there's just one problem: I didn't have fun. As I played I felt more annoyed by the puzzles than I felt happy that I completed them. Because as soon as you fix a problem, PLOP new thing for you to fix! At first, Crispin's (your comedic companion) hints helped but when you get farther he seems to just tell you what you already know. The items you must obtain are typically in places that you wouldn't expect, and the hitboxes for them are typically small. This game just drives you to the point where you try to use every item on every object, even if it doesn't make sense, to see if that will work. I found myself sitting there trying to combine my crowbar with my memory pouch. What will that do? Nothing. But I HAD to try it because I've done everything else. And then it turns out all you had to do was something simple but there was no way you could have known about it. This game has so many amazing qualities; I wanted to like it so bad. But I just couldn't. It's just not fun. Overall, I just found this game more frustrating than satisfying. If you've got the ten bucks and you LOVE point and click puzzle adventures, go for it. You might like it. But for the average gamer, I cannot recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1402903704, "timestamp_updated": 1497125650, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532591", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10478192": {"recommendationid": "10478192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050219817", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402807369}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego.

It has a LucasArts Loom vibe to it, with the protagonist Horation NullBuilt conjuring up an idea of what Bobin Threadbare would be if he was competent and decided to use his amnesia to his advantage. Yes, both characters have amnesia, have lost their home communities, and the fabric of society quite literally rests on their creations. Elements of the story definitely seem similar. The setting of Primordia is more exciting. It's a colorful combination of dystopia, cyberpunk, and steampunk. While that mix is becoming more and more common these days, finding 'good' games in that genre is still rare.\n\nI mentioned the writing: the story is captivating if only to explore the lore, and the main plot-arc is mediocre. The dialog writing is where the game shines; Horatio's sidekick levitating robot Crispin is a very well written NPC that integrates into the game nicely. The character is used to solve some puzzles, though not too much, and offers rather direct walkthrough-type tips if the protagonist is stuck.\n\nWith it's marvelous writing, I wanted Primordia to feature more NPCs and dialog quests. A particular stand-out quest involves a logic puzzle attempting to legally assign the surname of a pet robot. While the logic is difficult to follow without pen and paper handy, the writing and voice-acting attempts to seduce the player away from choosing the logical option and I was tempted to go down a logically-flawed path (which the game teased would result in different endings and impact late-game quests). Rarely does game-dialog inspire this anymore, and it is where indie games such as Primordia stand a cut above the rest.\n\nThe game has a relatively short playthrough and the puzzles become more difficult, sometimes to the level of ridiculousness, later in the game. This is caused by the game too early allowing me to use multiple items for different quests, and in the late game suffering through trying every permutation of item combination to solve the puzzles.

I can't really say how without spoiling, unfortunately. Let's just say that I expected some pretty grand moments that the game never even came close to delivering. But I would still recommend this game, as parts of the story are pretty interesting and some of the puzzles and conversations are cool.\n\nI do have to talk about Crispin though. It feels like they tried to make a Wheatley-esque character who follows you everywhere, and is kind of annoying but also endearing and adorable. Unfortunately they made Crispin too much of a smartass, so he comes off as not very endearing, not even remotely adorable, but still quite annoying. His lines also get very tiresome, as they are often just lame puns and jokes, and he doesn't have a very large number of them. And aside from scripted scenes, his comedic presence didn't change in response to the increasingly minatory plot, which often ruined the tone.\n\nLastly, the voice-acting generally isn't very good. The villain probably has the best voice-acting. The voices themselves? Very good, well-chosen, well-suited to their characters. But the acting itself wasn't very good.

As in all adventure games, things start innocently (loosely applied) enough as a giant robot looking like the mobile version of HAL crossed with a lobster (I know, right?) invades your home on a derelict ship and steals your power core.  You, Horatio, from a long line of previous Horatios, must now find a way to retrieve it.  It should be mentioned that everyone in this game, including you, is a robot, and as you begin to explore the world and meet its denizens, you'll find yourself wrapped in a robot existentialist's wetware runtime environment, rolling around in what amounts to be the robotic version of a Kafka story... okay, maybe not that weighty.  There's just something about the ending (of which there are many) that just never seems satisfying, even if you take all the steps to do the 'good' one.  That being said, Primordia still manages to tell its story with care and it's delivered in perfectly-bleak dialogue for a perfectly-bleak world.\n\nTechnically, the game suffers a little bit from a few questionable design decisions.  Being (I assume) an homage to the point 'n' click (PNC) games of yesteryear, the developer insisted on a low-res, 2D game - which is great - but instead of doing what most modern games do which is make a hi-res game look low-res, this game is actually 800x600.  This isn't really that big a deal until you notice that often the character sprites don't 'belong' to the scene.  In classic adventure games, different sprites were created depending on where the character is supposed to be standing; in Primordia, the technique used instead is simply scaling down the larger sprite with the end result being a much crisper sprite on a purposely-blocky background.  Not a dealbreaker, but it can be a little bit distracting.\n\nOther design decisions that were made are quite inexcusable in a modern PNC game.  Despite the genre being declared 'dead' for years, the truth is that the genre has thrived (loosely applied) throughout the decades and made many advances, all of which are ignored by Primordia.  For instance, in most modern PNCs, there's a hotspot-highlight button to speed along play; Primordia does not have that.  In most modern PNCs, you can usually double-click an exit to skip the slow plod of the character walking offscreen; Primordia does not have that.  To be fair, it -does- have a map system for quick travel.\n\nFinally, there is what is known as adventure-game-logic and Primordia is rife with it.  If you're unfamiliar with the term, it is a criticism of classic adventure game puzzle solutions and how they often make little logical sense.  For example, if you needed to sharpen a pencil, logic would dictate you find a pencil sharpener, but older adventure games were known for instead making you combine a stick with a piece of glass and some tape in order to whittle the pencil... while you stand in front of a pencil sharpener.  While the puzzles in Primordia aren't quite so asinine, two extremely dense puzzles spring to mind that are just bad ideas.  Like older adventure games, you could totally sit there and work it out and feel that ego boost, but I find it hard to believe that most players won't be looking for a walkthrough when they encounter them.  That being said, most of the game is paced out well so long as you can get your head into that mindframe of the 90s and just tough it out.\n\nAll in all, Primordia is an accomplished title and a lot of love went into it, especially in the art department.  For a game entirely populated by artificial beings, there is a sort of haunting organic decay that pierces almost every piece of art in the game.  Similarly, the voice direction is quite good and despite Crispin - your sidekick floaty robot buddy - sounding a hell of a lot like Otacon from Metal Gear Solid (it doesn't fit, believe me), every one of the actors gets what the director is trying to accomplish and paints a beautiful, if desolate, piece of work.\n\nBy all accounts, I did not enjoy (but did not dislike) Primordia particularly because I found a lot of the puzzles to be purposely obtuse and the story was not one that resonated with me.  However, that does not make this a bad game and so I cannot possibly give it a thumbs down.  For some people, the story is a mindblowing, harrowing look at the nature of existence, life, its foundations, and its possible future.  It is a fascinating perspective, to be sure, but I was left unsatisfied.\n\nThus, if you're looking for a new PNC game, there's no reason to steer clear from this one.  What I present above are not detractions, but warnings.  PNC veterans will not bat an eye at anything that goes on in this game, but fans of modern PNC games might find a lot of things in Primordia to be frustrating.  Stick with it and it mostly rewards you - just remember that it's more about the journey than the destination in this one.", "timestamp_created": 1399258565, "timestamp_updated": 1399258565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10002466": {"recommendationid": "10002466", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964292875", "num_games_owned": 536, "num_reviews": 176, "playtime_forever": 3013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1399079186}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent adventure post-apoc neo-noir robot adventure game about the world without humans.

You end up really caring for the characters and the atmosphere really draws you in. First tip though: if youre like me you will immensely hate your sidekick at first.

You'll be looking up guides for sure. Although there are a few times it seems impossible anyone can figure it out without cheating, it at least makes sense. Example: Move the cat off the couch without entering the room. other games: put the phone in the microwave which god knows why you wanted to, but it scared the cat and now hes gone.

[/url][/b]\n\nSynopsis: A fantastically simple little adventure game. Explore the ruins of Earth to find the fiend that stole your power crystal, the device you need survive. In the process, find out what happened to man, and your surprising role in the end of the world. Make choices that change the final results of the game, and tackle puzzles that can be, at times, a bit too challenging. Enjoy the humorous back and forth between the main character (voiced by the narrator for Bastion) and his flying sidekick. A great game to play in short bursts if you tend to get stuck, or in a longer sitting if you have the fundamentals of combining items in you inventory together to form the key piece you need.\n\nMultiple playthroughs, or saving at critical moments, are required in order to see all possible endings, of which, there are at least 7, but what happens after those possible ending scenarios depends on what you accomplished during the game - who  you saved, who you let die, etc. Took me about 7 hours during the first playthrough, largely because some of the puzzles are a bit tricky (oh, wait, I can use the Signal Transmitter on that blue light to solve this puzzle...huh.). A second playthrough took about a third of that time.

Some puzzles actually have multiple solutions and the game has multiple endings. There is a built in hint system that you have the option of using. The hints gently nudge you in the correct direction but do not give obvious answers. I liked how the story pokes fun/satirizes modern day society and its views on religion without making it overly obvious. It was done subtley and in good taste. The story is just really well done; it is one of my favorites and certainly memorable. Primordia isn't just a well designed game; it is also beautiful, sad, and poetic. Overall, definitely another great title from Wadjet Eye. \n\nSide note - There is an option to turn on commentary from the writers.

But you can tell from the screenshots that this game really shines visually.\n\nAudio : The real beauty of this game : the voice-over. The voice actor for Bastion's Narrator is the main character here, and he doesn't disappoint! And neither do the other characters! Each and every robot has a unique personality, and I loved just examining every little detail just for more of the voice talent. There's even a robot that only speaks in rhyming riddles! And the music, simply entrancing. When you play this, be sure to put up the volume!\n\nStory : As usual, you are an amnesiac and you live with your faithful companion Crispin. While short, the adventure is really gripping, and charming- despite the post-apocalyptic setting. Similar to Machinarium, the world is only populated by robots, and they live in a big city of lights! There's two main sections to the story : exploring the desert, discovering various different areas, and exploring the city, which sadly wasn't that big. Unlike the desert, which had a map with a few area markers you could jump to, the city was only a few connected screens, which blocked you with puzzles. Despite the city being a bit small and the story short, it ends (according to the good ending) on a good note and offers the possibility of a sequel. \n\nAt least... I hope...\n\nI give this game a 9/10, with frustrating puzzles as the only negative point. Try it out! Don't worry, there's plenty of comic relief thanks to Crispin :)", "timestamp_created": 1388197088, "timestamp_updated": 1388197088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8348267": {"recommendationid": "8348267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002171450", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458275069}, "language": "english", "review": "If anyone is looking for a good old-fashioned point-and-click game with a beautiful environment, a interesting storyline, and puzzles with multiple solutions, Primordia has all of those and more.", "timestamp_created": 1388184312, "timestamp_updated": 1388184312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8309460": {"recommendationid": "8309460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031435693", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419163632}, "language": "english", "review": "In two words: tiny gem. \nThe story is quite short and simple but the world, game characters and overall atmosphere is outstanding.

The story is set in a sci-fi world, where all humans have died and only robots remain.

The world looked interesting with its post-apocalyptic look, but often the graphics were quite low-res, which is unfortunate. \n\nMusic was pretty nice although I didn't pay much attention to it. However, I thought the voice acting was pretty bad even though most reviews online say it's great. The voices didn't seem to fit the characters, which made me dislike some of them. Especially the voice of the droid companion was kinda annoying.\n\nThe puzzles were kinda hard, because they weren't very logical and sometimes required you to backtrack to a previous area to get an item that wasn't available there before. It would have been fine, if you had to use a certain item to get that other item i.e. the item was there, but you couldn't get it yet. The \"appearance\" of the needed item wasn't indicated in any way.

And what a welcome blast from the past it is indeed.  Following the travels and trials of Horatio and Crispin, this game tells an amazing story with all the conventions of the P&C genre.  But it's not QUITE to same as the games of old, such as King's Quest, or Broken Sword.\n\nFor starters, the game tells you outright that you cannot die, or can you take an action that renders the game \"unwinnable\", a flaw that made many of the classic staples of point-and-click, like King's Quest 5, atrocities of game design.  The locales don't require meticulous pixel hunts to find that one item you need in order to progress.  Travelling the maps is expidited by a fast-travel system that easily lets you jump from place to place.  Combining items is no longer a nonsensical MacGuyver mish-mash of parts, it's all explained and makes perfect sense.  No longer do you need a notebook to take down vital information, a handy item in-game records all the most relevant information for you, and your helper will at times offer a light nudge towards the next possible objective.\n\nAnd that's just the mechanics.  The game's art and sound, two of the major foundations of point-and-click, which lives and thrives (or fails and dies) off it's atmosphere, are in full force.  The discoloration of the game's settings isn't just to be \"realistic\", it's a compliment to the setting and aesthetic.  And the music is highly atmospheric.  From the haunting melody of the game's menu theme \"Primordia\" to the tune of \"The City of Glass and Light\", the music compliments the setting as much as the color palette.  The characters are all fully voiced, and the voice work is clean and quality, with voices befitting each character and role.\n\nOf course, Primordia isn't perfect.  For starters, the biggest and possibly most glaring flaw, is just how SHORT the game is.  Even if the puzzles make you spend extra time (and at first, they will), you'll likely only wind up spending 5-7 hours on this game.  It's basically over before it seems to really begin.  While it follows the classic story-telling formula, the climax of the story seems to be on you before you know it.  A point in the game that feels like the 50% is more like the 75% mark instead.  And before you know it, you're already at the final scene.  Even with multiple endings (which can be achieved by just reloading and making a different choice) the game feels painfully short-lived.  You'll be left wanting to hear and see more.\n\nThe music, while perfectly fitting the mood, never seems to stick with the player much.  I couldn't tell you a moment in the game and point out the music for it, besides the music at the main menu.  Which isn't to say the music is bad, because it's not.  But it's not catchy much.  Or very present.  The music mostly serves as a background to the game, ambience.  And it does it's part amazingly well.  I just wish that perhaps the music felt a bit more powerful at certain scenes.  Speaking of sound, the voice-acting and sound effects are a bit off as well.  Some scenes would have effects, like gunshots, with NO sound accompanying them, which removed something important to the scene.  And the voice actors themselves, while very good, still felt a bit rough.  Horatio's voice actor in particular, either does a stellar job, or seems a bit too stoic when you'd think a situation would call for a more forceful, emotional or venomous delivery.\n\nOverall though, Primordia definitely feels like it was a game that SHOULD have existed back in the Golden Age of the adventure genre of PC gaming.  It feels like a game that I missed from my childhood and I'm just getting to sit down and enjoy it now for the first time in years, and it's not even that old!  But it takes me back to that time in gaming that I've almost forgotten and reminded me of what games I use to partake of, and that's a feeling I can't being to say how much I enjoy.  If you are a person who enjoys the point-and-click genre, grew up in that era, or want a relaxing, easy-paced game that can still deliver a great story, Primordia is worth every possible virtual cent you pay for it.", "timestamp_created": 1385677288, "timestamp_updated": 1385677288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7789329": {"recommendationid": "7789329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029882737", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1383187519}, "language": "english", "review": "Another fine offering from Wadjet Eye Games, a haunting yet disappointingly brief excursion through a post-apocalyptic landscape.

Although I haven't really read books or played other games on this topic, I think it does a pretty good take on the setting, enough so to spark some creative interest of my own.  The characters and full-game voicework are for the most part fairly well done but dialogue kind of falls flat in a few places, mostly because of the script writing and not because of the voice actors.  The story is fairly cohesive and events therein are weighty and interesting, but in a few places I feel like the scenes were not given -enough- weight.  This is especially true of all the alternate endings and post-game cinematics, which although included to give the player some logical options, needed a bit more fleshing out.  It is also interesting to point out, it is impossible to game over although some decisions can change your endings.\n\nThe visual aesthetic of the game is quite nice, as is the music.  While pleasant to listen to and not annoying in any way, none of the tunes were especially catchy or easily memorable, and in a few of the dramatic scenes a stronger musical touch would have gone a long way.  Sound effects are unfortunately fairly weak, lacking thematic when operating devices and having little oomph when explosions occur, and in some places the game seems bugged and plays no sound effect at all.  The voice work has a nice robotic emulation added, although some characters seem to exhibit multiple variances in recording quality or style that doesn't seem to be a character quirk.\n\nPerformance-wise the game runs fine.  Although it resizes itself and forces fullscreen (thus making dual-monitor setups a little wonky), the resolution is not a complaint.  I never had pathing issues or pixel-hunts (just me being blind).  The game interface is functional and unobtrusive, as well as autosaving.  There are some included commentaries as well in the options menu.\n\nAll in all, I really did enjoy the game despite some of its flaws.  Its not very expensive, and it's about 7 hours of gameplay for one playthrough, with low replayability.  The setting is done very nicely and the story is good, what's there to complain about is mostly some rough edges and needed spitshining.  It doesn't ruin the game at all.

Man, also known as \u2018The perfect machine\u2019 were the builders from which sentient robots sprang into \u2018life\u2019. You play Horatio, a humanoid robot searching for his power core which was stolen by a \u2018big robot with claws that shoots lasers\u2019. You have a companion along the way, Crispin. He\u2019s a cocky little robot, full of witty banter and useful advice (although, that advice can be hard to coax out of the little guy at times).\n\nBut I digress, back to the story. All I can say is, \u2018Wow\u2019. Ok, so it starts a little slow, but once you start learning about you character and his past the game really opens up. Playing as \u2018Horatio Nullbuilt V.5\u2019, your character has four versions of prior history of which the data has become fragmented and corrupted. You\u2019ll meet robots along the way that seem to know you, but you haven\u2019t much recollection of them! On top of the world that you are set exploring, this story mechanic really draws you in and makes you hungry for more. I remember thinking that if this game was a book, I\u2019d read the hell out of it! It\u2019d be one of those books that you can\u2019t put down despite having to work early the next day! And in truth, I couldn\u2019t put this game down. Thanks Wormwood Studios, my daughter finally gets to sleep, and instead of capitalising on this moment of rest that I could be having, I decide to turn on my PC and play a little more Primordia!\n\nThe music and sounds effects really help to bring this game to life. The background music can be haunting at times, and other times it can be so subtle to lift the mood of a scene that you hardly notice it has changed. The voices of the many robots that populate the world have a slight tinny, and sometimes electronic sound to them, each different from the last. Being how it\u2019s set in a world of robots, Wormwood Studios could have simply hired the same vocal artist and applied filters to his/her voice, but they haven\u2019t gone this route thankfully. Every robot you meet oozes personality, and the voice acting is top notch, adding real character and a human touch to these robots that were, at least in the past, touched by humanity.\n\nDespite all the things that make Primordia such a wonderful game, there are a couple of things that bugged me whilst playing through it. The first thing is the heads up display, or HUD for short. The HUD is located at the top of the screen, and when you drag your mouse up to the top it will pop down, allowing access to the various menu\u2019s and inventory. Sometimes it can get in the way though, as it\u2019s not located at the upper most pixel, and sometimes when you are on the lookout for that next pick-up, or you want to exit to another area, the HUD can slide down, thus breaking the immersion ever so slightly. It\u2019s not a deal breaker by any means, but it can be a slight annoyance at times.\n\nThe second thing that got to me the whole time was the graphics. Don\u2019t get me wrong here, I absolutely adore the art style. This game looks great, my problem is that it could have looked amazing. This game isn\u2019t HD, you can set the resolution higher, but you then have to apply a filter to smooth out the jaggies as the game wasn\u2019t designed to run at high resolutions! This results in the image being a little washed out when you play full screen. This wouldn\u2019t be as noticeable on a smaller monitor, but on my 22\u201d screen it was a slight issue.\n\nGripes aside, Primordia is a polished and lively world with a great story that compels you to finish the game. Clocking in at around 4-5 hours, it\u2019s a journey so full of history and lore that you can\u2019t help but be fascinated by it, the world they have created is really captivating. The central character and his companion guide you through this gritty world, and even though Crispin can be a little on the sarcastic side, you become attached to all you companions, and enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1385469564, "timestamp_updated": 1385469564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7762205": {"recommendationid": "7762205", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992417633", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1359532800}, "language": "french", "review": "J'ai ador\u00e9 ce jeu : ses ambiances musicales et graphiques, les th\u00e8mes qui sont abord\u00e9s dans les dialogues, le tout avec une jouabilit\u00e9 aux petits oignons.

The NPC robots who inhabit the world are all distinctive and have personality, but the real centrepieces are the two main characters. Horatio, the playable protagonist, plays the straight man to Crispin, his robot sidekick who I personally found kind of annoying. However, Crispin's sarcasm and jokes do a lot to lighten the mood established by the setting. Primordia takes place in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited entirely by robots. As a crucial and interesting element of this world, some of the robots worship humanity, who they view as their creators and the originators of the world. The world itself is interesting to look at and there are some really striking setpieces in several of the stages. I won't really discuss the story, but I will say that the \"good\" ending resolves much more than any of the other ones. Though you have to be careful as there are a couple decisions in the game that can lock you out of getting what seems to be the only ending that gives you some sense of closure. \n\nThe graphics are done in a retro, psuedo-16 bit style that can occasionally make it difficult to determine which objects are in the background and which are interactive objects. Furthermore, my biggest problem with the game comes when you try to use these objects. Several times in the game you have to use Crispin to retrieve objects that are out of reach but the things he can do and the types of objects he can get aren't consistent.

So I gave it a try, and was blown away by how much I absolutely enjoyed it. It's your standard point-and-click; you collect items, open your inventory, and can combine items or use them on characters or objects in the world to progress. So there's little to mess up when it comes to controls, and Primordia succeeds there. \nThe game is set some ambiguous number of years in the future. The world is inhabited by robots, no sign of organic life anywhere. You play as Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot designed to build and repair. While aboard your ship, the Uniic, you are attacked by a strange robot and stripped of your ship's power core. Left without transportation and limited power keeping you running, you are left with no other option but to wander out into the world, trying to track down a power source, or as a last resort, enter the city of Metropol, \"the city of glass and light.\" Not much is known about Metropol, other than there is supposedly unlimited power for everyone. Still, Horatio has his reserves about entering the city; despite his logic-driven robot nature, he doesn't trust the place.\nAs I mentioned, the art style was much of what first intrigued me, and it's prevalent throughout the game. It's designed to look very old-school and pixelated, but the amount of detail that can be projected by so few pixels is astounding, not to mention the general apocalyptic dystopian feel it gives off, which as a fan of Fallout, I enjoyed all too much. \nOverall this was one of those games that gave me that feel of reading a really good book; I'd sit down and play and not want to put it down until I found out what happened next. The only problems I had were a few vague or confusing puzzles, in which I had to resort to the old \"try everything with everything on everything\" play method common to point-and-click games. Aside from that, the game offers multiple endings, some far more underwhelming than others, which left me feeling a tad unsatisfied. Still, the game was extremely enjoyable, and one of the few games that I'd almost like to forget playing so I could enjoy it all over again.", "timestamp_created": 1379141185, "timestamp_updated": 1385407224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "6507031": {"recommendationid": "6507031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067747282", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 1233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1380455274}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub85c\ubd07\uc758 \ubaa8\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c 1984\uc7ac\ud604\ud558\uae30 - \uc778\ub958\uac00 \uba78\ub9dd\ud558\uace0 \ub85c\ubd07\ub4e4\uc774 \ubb38\uba85\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uba74\uc11c \uc0ac\ub78c\uacfc \ub611\uac19\uc544 \uc9c0\ub294 \ubaa8\uc2b5\uc744 \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.  \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc9e7\uc740 \ud3b8\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ub4b7 \uc124\uc815\ub4e4\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc77d\ub294\uac8c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc5b4\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc624\ub798\ud55c\uac70 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ucc38\uace0\ub85c \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c\ub370 \uae68\uc54c\uac19\uc740 \uac1c\uadf8\ub4e4\uc744 \ubcf4\ub294 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uac00 \uc3e0\uc3e0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

however, the story is much more than this basic premise. One of the central questions the player wants answered is what exactly happened to the humans who presumably once inhabited this Earth and created the robots left behind. Added to this is a tapestry of moral and philosopical themes such as the meaning and existence of free will, individuality, progress, and what constitutes the 'greater good'. These sometimes rather heavy themes are pulled off through excellent writing, and are offset by a quirky humour that runs through the whole game. This off-beat humour and occasional breaking of the fourth wall are reminiscent of some of my favourite, genuinely old-school games such as Simon the Sorcerer, and I think anyone who was playing this kind of thing in the early 90's will appreciate it. The worldbuilding and background detail is fantastic - my one gripe is that the game just doesn't go far enough. There are hints of exciting other locations that we don't get to visit, and the larger philosophical themes are never fully explored. \n\nAs this is a game and not just a visual novel, I should probably mention a bit about the gameplay - it's pretty much standard of point & click games, and uses the traditional inventory system. Nothing stood out as unique, but equally nothing was inconvenient or jarring. The puzzles are not particularly challenging, and there's plenty of hints on hand from Crispin if one chooses to press him for them (it's also pretty fun to hear him getting annoyed and snarky when you try and use him too many times). I prefer simpler puzzles so the flow of the story doesn't stall, but others might find this game too easy. \n\nIn terms of visuals, the pixel art is gorgeous, and the colour palette of browns, rusts and muted golds perfectly realizes the dusty, disued world. The audio content is also great, from the music to the voice acting. Even minor characters are voiced, and the robot voice effects are pretty cool.\n\nOverall an 9/10 for this game. The presentation is beautiful both visually and aurally, and beneath this is a solid story rooted in a world that feels like it really could be our future. Horatio and Crispin are likeable and memorable characters to journey through this tale with, and their easy banter creates the emotional anchor to this crumbling planet. Points are lost for the sense that the game could have been bigger both in terms of the number of locations, and the philosophical ideas that never seem to be explored quite as far as you hope.

In [i]Primordia[/i], building a robot is the equivalent of birthing one. To oil cogs into a machine's first breath is a labor of love. However, just as much as human birth can blossom from a seed of spite, machines too can click and clank about as the result of nothing short of duty and necessity. \n\nPlaying as Horatio Nullbuilt (built by [i]null[/i]), wistfulness is your paragon; humanity, your faith. \n\nWith that premise, [i]Primordia[/i] may prove not be a game for everyone \u2013 even if such thing did exist. On the other hand, its infinite amount of excellently delivered wisdom make the game quickly and universally take root within every heart brave enough to play it. \n\nIn that sense, I believe there has never been a point and click game quite like [i]Primordia[/i]. Although it stands atop of a hill with the classics \u2013 the [i]Monkey Island[/i] series, The [i]Broken Sword[/i] series, [i]The Longest Journey[/i], etc. \u2013 it holds something that few of its older peers have: it has the vision, the eloquence and the language of modern day games. It takes the best if its genre and holds it close to its heart, while tossing away the majority of what so many people have always disliked about it \u2013 like not knowing when or in what order to combine items or being stuck in convoluted puzzles \u2013 and from that, it draws its strength and appeal. \n\nHowever, [i]Primordia[/i]'s strongest trait lies elsewhere: in its story. The universe it weaves is one that begs you to belong to it. Which is quite the accomplishment, considering how the vast majority of said universe is tarnished by decay and, upon a first glance, seems wholeheartedly uninviting and cold. \n\nAnd yet, as my last decision of the game dawned to an epic close, I didn't want to leave. That scrap of the Earth deemed as its most crude and barren shell felt like home, and Horatio Nullbuilt and Crispin Horatiobuilt felt like family.\n\nThere are, out there, creative births that make us wonder how far we can stretch the definition of 'art'.

And a b'sodding good one at that. I don't have an all too extensive history with point-and-click games, but I felt that Primordia was unique (UNNIIC?).\n \nThe story of Primordia takes place in what seems like a distant future, where humanity is but a bleak and redundant memory in the most ancient of machines. Biological life has been eradicated and solely machines roam the surface of the dying planet. We, the player, follow Horatio Nullbuilt V.5 and his companion - Crispin Horatiobuilt V.1 - in a quest to retrieve the power core of their ship that has been stolen. The duo search the dunes in the first arc, but soon arrive at Metropol. The Last City. The City of Glass and Light. Though they soon discover that their expectations were wildy inaccurate...\n\nIn my opinion, the plot of Primordia is quite intriguing. Morality [spoiler] and the preservation of mankind and machines [/spoiler] is discussed [spoiler] in an excerpt from the files of Horus and conversations with MetroMind [/spoiler] and we encounter myriads of wacky characters all with their own personalities, motives and backgrounds. There are several endings, although most can be achieved by [spoiler] going back to a save from the last scene in the Tower [/spoiler].\n\nOverall, the game covers the adventure of a machine suffering from partial amnesia (not a medical term) who is dragged into intrigues and conspirations and who is forced to realize his identity in a abysmal post-singularity world. Will you save your friends? Will you save Metropol from descending into chaos and ruin? Will you fulfill your [spoiler] ancient mission or your [/spoiler] dream? Is there even hope for the Last of the Four Cities?\n\nArt: What can one say but simply [i]astounding[/i]?\n\nMusic/Soundtrack and SFX: Really quite atmospheric. Fully voice acted.\n\nStory: Solid \n\nGameplay: There isn't too much 'gameplay', but it runs smoothly. Minor graphic glitches and movement errors. \nI suggest that fullscreen mode should be added for increased immersion, but sadly, the game likely won't be getting any updates. \n\nSome issues I had included text being shown at a ridiculously rapid pace [spoiler] and my inability to steal Oswald's oil before Clarity started accompanying Horatio and Crispin [/spoiler].  \n\nPrimordia isn't all too replayable, but the first playthrough will be fascinating for the player.

As an old graphic adventure's player and a experienced gamer in many genres i must say im impressed with every single part of this game since i buyed and completed it. \n\nThe music ambient songs fit with every enviroment of the game and this last ones make the player get involved in the actions of the game. I liked the puzzles and map exploration of the game as well as Horatio and Crispin comments and jokes in the decissions and findings.\n\nAlso i've seen Crispin's comments and advices make the game easier, wich is not a bad thing for unexperienced graphic adventures players who want help, because you can choose not to ask Crispin for advice, so the game maintains its dificulty and makes you think.\n\nThe art is fantastic, a perfect example of decayed futurist world with an own and original style that i believe every graphic adventure fan and game art fan will love.\n\nBy the way I've read some negative comments about this game complaining about the ease or difficulty of the puzzles and also the \"pixel hunter\" expresion refering to the map exploration and its secrets and i can't less than ask myself: isn't that part of the game genre? why whould it have to be that easy? aren't the graphic adventures about thinking the different puzzles and ways to get the final satisfaction of completing the story? I understand the \"i'm stuck\" problem, i've lived it many times in this genre, but it's not an excuse to make developers responsible for \"not making the game as easy as i want to\". I think the game is perfectly complete and does not need facilities but mindful players who must apreciate the details and think more when doing the puzzles, wich are created to think and resolve them.\n\nAt last i must say the only thing i dont like about the game just to help devs: the Metropol city robots. The robots make a constant walk along the maps you can explore into the city, and i liked the way how diferent robots appear and leave when you change of map and in the different parts of the game, but the ones moving constantly into the maps just go nowhere turning at the end of the roads and coming back the same way. That gives you a kick in the city involve sense(if you know what i mean).\n\nTo end this reviwew I definitely recommend this game... no... this piece of digital art to every single person who's searching for an adventure with a great story, many ends depending on decissions and a impressive way to get involved on it.\nThanks to Primordia developers for this story, i wont lie, i want more and me like others in this community would like to see more games like this soon.", "timestamp_created": 1515008067, "timestamp_updated": 1515008418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39000664": {"recommendationid": "39000664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249048284", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511418618}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a wonderful classic point-and-click adventure that anyone who is a fan of post-apocalyptic, dystopian tales will enjoy.

Second part is my actual review on the game. They're separated by lines, so use that to skip ahead if you just want to know more about the game itself. Forwarning: I'm not an avid point and click adventure player so I can't compare this to other games in the same genre - If that's what you're looking for my review probably won't be helpful to you.\n\n\n\nIf you're not a fan of point and click adventures, and stories aren't drawing factors for you for whether a not a game is worth playing (despite gameplay that may or may not suit your tastes) then this game isn't blowing anything out of the waters with its gameplay enough for me to consider you buying it.\n\nHOWEVER, if your into stories at all and the point and click formula is even slightly tolerable (or curious to you) this is a must buy.\n\nPrice wise unless if you get profoundly more stuck then I did at certain sections (about 10 hours for me to beat it and look over each ending - reloading is fast) and the time to cost ratio is worrying to you (or your more skeptical at the base price) wait for a sale. I bought this for $2 on sale and I'd STILL recommend the game at base price despite the time to cost ratio because of how good the story of the game is itself.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nI was hooked on the art style before I was hooked onto the description. You generally shouldn't judge a book by it's cover but I'm an absolute SUCKER for pixelated games of any nature.\n\nI'm also a sucker for sentient robots and post apocalyptic scenarios that don't involve zombies.\n\nThis game was gorgeous enough just from the screen shots that despite it being a point and click I considered it. The deciding factor was the rating of the reviews and the fact that it was on sale so I said \"even if I end up not liking it it's 2 bucks I can't be mad\".\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nAgain coming from someone who doesn't like the genre, gameplay was better then I was expecting it to be. Beginning lead you through a lot more easily then I would have thought a point and click would have put into a \"tutorial\" section of the game and (at least for the early areas) I only had one real nag point and it was the one section of your ship home that I didn't realize you could walk out onto by walking through a wall that didn't seem at all (to me, anyway) to be a door.\n\nAnd the point and click puzzles towards the end are generally me being frustrated from not seeing clues that are kinda slapped into your face once you realize what they were (which is it's own kind of annoying but I digress). Dialogue can't be repeated, and EVERY bit of dialogue needs to be listened to. You're given very few hints from your companion Crispin and in some sections they aren't even helpful. \"Do this thing you already know you need to be doing\" Yes, Crispin, but [i]how[/i]. \n\nI won't lie the amount of times I skimmed or had an NPCs comment fly over my head to be stuck for an hour wondering what I was doing wrong only made everything harder. There are brief but unreliable auto saves -- it's better if you save before talking to people so if you need to you can listen to their dialogue again.\n\nIf you like thinking there are a lot of challenging puzzles that put your mind to work though. Not too much, but just enough to make you feel smart for getting it. The only hard part is figuring out what pieces you need to solve things, if you're missing anything at all.\n\nAs a side note this game is not friendly to pick back up after a couple of days or a week. You might as well restart from the beginning - you don't really get a feel for what you were doing previously at all unless if you have a good memory.\n\n\n[h1]Story Story Story (and art)[/h1]\n\nBefore I actually start this out, can I just point out that this game has voice acting? Yeah, [i]voice acting.[/i] I was taken by surprise but pleasantly so - it was great work and generally fit the game well.\n\n\nWhen I say this game has the background story building of games like Horizon Zero Dawn I'm not kidding. You're given a world and a small objective to begin with, before being given an area that might as well have jumped out of the past. That past area at a superficial glance is nothing much but then it becomes SO much more after just a little delving. The art, meanwhile, draws your curiosity in and really settles you down into the games atmosphere and how the world really does seem to be crumbling into nothing but rust.\n\nAs you keep exploring the story goes from your first objective to a much more intense objective and then all the pieces of the old world slowly come together. Getting clues from ones left behind in the age of man, figuring out what exactly happened who your character actually was (or IS) was intense and the multiple different endings that can spur from it being a point and click adventure game where your mind is the only limiting factor in what ending you go for HONESTLY has given the genre some pointers in that regard for story alone. It wont be as easy for me to pass over them in the future, and it's definitely earned this game a spot among my favorite games (including but not limited to Aragami, Breath Of The Wild, Horizon Zero Dawn, Ori and the Blind Forest, etc).\n\nThe only thing I found extremely disappointing about this game was that there wasn't more. I'll definitely be chewing on this story for weeks to come.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTLDR: Story's amazing enough that even if you're not a fan of the game genre I'd recommend it, even at base price.", "timestamp_created": 1516427389, "timestamp_updated": 1516428214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39586493": {"recommendationid": "39586493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013115853", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 469, "last_played": 1516816853}, "language": "english", "review": "While probably far from the best point and click adventure by puzzle and mechanics, the story in this game is worth it's price alone.", "timestamp_created": 1516817018, "timestamp_updated": 1516817018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39585969": {"recommendationid": "39585969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137973418", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 543, "last_played": 1516814521}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego a lo vieja escuela point and click de ciencia ficcion con una historia interesante y complicada, tienes que tener un nivelazo de ingles o poner el mod en espa\u00f1ol, los puzzles son dificiles, algunos me han parecido imposibles y he tirado de gu\u00eda mas de la mitad del juego...... porque soy un paquete, porque no tengo paciencia y porque me ha gustado la ambientaci\u00f3n y el arte sci fi.

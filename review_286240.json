Here is my take on what can you expect.[/h1]\n\nThe game is simple arcade with a mix of even simplier managment features. I had it wishlisted a while ago, and after suffering through some annoying youtube let's plays (where the person was more interested in petting the dogs than playing the game), I've decided to try it out myself, and I've very much enjoyed it.\n\n[b]General overview[/b]\n\nThe 2 main parts consist of racing and dog management. Make no mistake though, the racing is really the main thing you'll end up doing. That's not to say that the management has no depth, but it's a tool to get to higher races - the racing is where you'll have most fun, and through proper lead experience the best moments with your dogs overcoming the odds - it always very enjoyable to be in control and seeing your dogs just kicking a\u206ds\u206ds. The difficulty seems to be balanced just fine - there are different consequences for your failures, the worst that can happen is for you to waste some time and lose some dogs, which you can recover later anyways, so there is really no way to lose the game. You can keep trying, so don't worry that you'll end up in a dead end. You have to take proper care of your dogs between matches, they gain experience and different skills, and it requires a bit of insight from you to understand how to make them most effective. The game has a mostly decent guide that fills you with information, some of them weren't exactly helpful, but you'll get a proper amout of information through playing as well, I would say that it's decently balanced between you having to observe how things work and educating yourself through written word.\n\n[b]Story and progress[/b]\n\nThe game has a \"campaign\", which I'm using very generously, nothing really happens aside from having rivalry with a fellow dou\u206dchebag racer and an old man telling you story over the course of the game. It's better than nothing, but could've been much more - your dogs for example aren't featured in the \"story\" in any way, most of the time you just get short bits of the story talking about a legendary doggo called Aurora. Oh, and there is a last entry in your diary that nobody seems to know how to unlock. Other than that, it's mostly about getting to better leagues, controlling more dogs and feeling like a bada.s.s overcoming the challenges on the top races. The journal progression seems to be somewhat odd and screwed as well, for example I haven't unlocked few very basic journal entries, like one from racing, which should be all unlocked - I can understand some skills being available later, but these are the very basics of the game.\n\n[b]Controls and navigation[/b]\n\nControls are fine, I can't think of anything that I would really change in that regard. I've played only with mouse, only afterwars I've found out you can use gamepad as well, but I don't know how it works with it. In the late game, a certain amout of precision is required, so I can't say I would recommend playing the game only with touchpad. You'll need to use your eyes and ears, so it's not recommended to listen to something else on the background, or least in the advanced races with 5 dogs, where you really need to focus. It is clear that the game was intended primarily as a mobile release, which is fine for most parts, but the interface could've been adjusted for desktop. There is no need to have gigantic icons in a menu that you the have to scroll down, in general, it just feels silly to look at massive simplistic pixel art on my 27\" monitor. And you have to scroll through the journal, there are no tabs. Why?\n\n[i]There is also some confusion as to how to use the interface, for example - if you happen to click away from the race screen, you don't need to proceed to another day and skipping it, just add dogs to your racer and select race - this is the only time where you'll even be able to select race. Just clicking on dogs on the race screen switches them between other dogs in your roster, before figuring that out, I had no idea how to choose between dogs that weren't present on the screen. Then there are little things like realizing you can cancel your throw by right clicking on the mouse, but the interface should be clearer on what you can do. I don't mind learning things on my own, but keep that to gameplay.[/i]\n\n\n[b]Graphics and sound[/b]\n\nThe game looks decent, and has some great music, my only regret is that music seems to be picked without any regard to what kind of race you'll be doing, for example, more energetic tracks would be fitting for the more difficult races, but you can get something like a lullaby, which isn't exactly fitting to the holiday massacre that might ensue. The ability to pick your own songs for a race would be welcome - when games 15 years old could do that (Supreme Snowboarding has that feature), surely this one could as well.\n\n[b]How long will the game last, and what else is there?[/b]\n\nUnfortunately, it lacks any more depth - after you get to the latest league, that's it. The game can still offer challenge, you can continue racing and breed new dogs as you wish, but that's on your initiative. It's a bit dissapointing, since there were supposed to be different challenges and quests (related to fame for example, which in the end doesn't really do anything, only unlocks better sponsorship deals). The breeding and in general care about dogs is trivial and it lacks any meaningful progress, you won't be unlocking stronger dogs or more epic challenges through it, you can make a \"perfect\" dog with just the right abilities, but you can succeed at any race with any dogs, given they're experienced enough and in good shape, that's what really counts, the skills are helpful, but you can get an excellent roster through just hiring the dogs and don't ever have to touch the breeding. Really, it's there just if you for some reason want to get more attached to your pixelated doggos, or you really want the best of best, but the difference is negligent.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nYou'll get around 5-10 hours of content before you reach the end, and then you can continue with the sandbox gameplay where you get random \"top\" races, but aside from new dogs, the progression is over, unless you want to create challenges for yourself, which you certainly can, especially when you're training new dogs. It's certainly worth the price in my eyes, but don't expect something with amazing value like Stardew Valley. It's a fun little game that can be picked up any time and played for a short time, or if you feel like it, hours to your heart's content.", "timestamp_created": 1511854508, "timestamp_updated": 1511855018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638920", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37848834": {"recommendationid": "37848834", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991699268", "num_games_owned": 10112, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502774508}, "language": "english", "review": "Nominated for 'THE WORLD IS GRIM ENOUGH LETS JUST ALL GET ALONG' award.

It might look like a silly, simple game, but there's a lot here to sink your teeth into. It isn't perfect and has some flaws, but it's still worth your time.\n\nFirst off, despite the presence of dogs, snow, and sleds, it doesn't feature sledding in the traditional sense. Esentially your dogs will pull a sled, and you're in charge of tossing them dog biscuits to keep their energy up. Throws have to be well timed as perfect throws will help boost the stamina of your dogs, and hazards will come up like high winds, trees, etc.\n\nThe basic concept of the game is to go through these races, collect money, and advance to the next league for harder races and more money. But there is a lot else at play. For instance, each dog has certain specializations making them suited to lead, to take the rear, or be in the middle. The dogs will get tired after each race, and you need to devote time to helping them rest but also take time to train them to make them better. There's multiple breeds of dogs, a multitude fo faults and special abilities the dogs can have, employees to hire to help with care and training, earning fame for your dogs by completing special actions mid-race, getting sponsorships to improve your racing from their fame, the ability to build a larger kennel and even dog breeding.\n\nYes, there's a lot.\n\nMain drawbacks of the game come from its story, or lack thereof. For the first year you get regular updates from your mentor about a dog named Aurora who helped inspire the people of the town you're in, Mount St. Something. However, while you'd think you would eventually meet or recruit this legendary animal, nothing ever comes out of it. More to the point you cannot speak with said mentor unless you come across something new, and even then the 'talk' is just him adding an entry to your notebook. You never physically leave your kennel in the game, at all. Plus, after the first year there's really nothing outside of the rivalry you have with another popular racer, literally named \"The Jerk\". Seriously, near the end-game you can beat him in a race and hire him, and he is literally listed as \"The Jerk\". \n\nAnother issue of the game results in said end-game. The 6th and 7th leagues are incredibly tough at times, even with really good items from sponsorship. But the money requirements can be tight, especially if you end up with a lot of dogs and hire two employees. One bad race will mean you won't be able to pay dues, and will have to drop down one league until you get work back up. As such, as of this writing I have 30 hours in the game and have yet to reach the 7th league for the listed reasons. \n\nAll that being said, for what you get out of the game and the price of it, it is still worth the purchase. So go pick it up and forge your own sledding saga.", "timestamp_created": 1511417369, "timestamp_updated": 1511417369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36935162": {"recommendationid": "36935162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071013578", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507339548}, "language": "english", "review": "This is just such a wholesome game, but more than that it's actually a really good game.

A great way to relax, I love dogs, it's super cute, the music is catchy, and it's just engaging enough to be able to hold my attention for an hour or more a night after work. Also big points to any game that lets me pet animals or put hats on characters, so this game is 1/2 in that respect (waiting for the hat patch tbh). This game is really simple and fun, just because the races at the higher leagues will actually be pretty challenging if you don't know your 'team' that well, and if you don't cater dogs to be with each other, like I have a primary and a secondary team. I love that you can make puppies with some of your best dogs to get good traits, and have different levels of effieciency based on the traits of your pooches. That's probably the best part of this game, is the fact that you can make different team compositions with different dogs. Sometimes it's beneficial to pay attention to that, because the races do get pretty hard, and sometimes it doesn't matter because your team is already supposedly at the top of their respective league. \n\nThe only thing I wish for more from this game would be that your opponents would have some sort of advantage of disadvantage throughout each race. I guess it's supposed to be super casual, but it would be awesome if your nameless, background opponents say, did better with fog, or didn't have to worry about trees, or jumps, or something like that.

Here is one thing I will tell you though...this game is for people who like the thrill of leveling up, and winning stuff. This really isn't an RPG game and not so much of an adventure one either.

However, I would say it is worth full price! It is a cute, fast-paced, fun and addicting game. You start the game and have to build your team, so you choose three dogs to hire. I got lucky with my three choices, since one is a great Lead dog, one is a great Middle dog, and one is a great Wheel dog. Perfect. You race, earn money, and can spend that money on hiring extra dogs, hiring extra help, expanding your kennel, and even breeding your dogs. Don't forget to pay your bills though! The more dogs you have, the higher the league you're in, and if you have any help, will increase your bills each \"month.\" It did start to get tough and I went into the negative balance for a few days. I tried to find a guide online, which said I could take dogs off my team, but I didn't want to do that. I love my virtual doggies! So I stuck to my guns and won race, after race, after race. Then, I just ignored the messages to hire help, hire dogs, or change leagues. I just kept winning races until I had a nice amount of in-game money and then I decided to move forward. I now have nine dogs, two that I bred. Speaking of breeding, it isn't detailed. You choose two dogs you would like to breed, and pay a fee to the breeder. Those two dogs will be gone for a bit, so don't be surprised. In about 2 weeks, I think, in game time, you get the parents back, and you learn what the puppy is...boy or girl, and their breed. Yes, if you breed a Labrador Retriever and an Alaskan Malamute, you will get either one or the other, not a mix. You then have a couple more weeks to try to get their traits (which is randomly assigned from either parent). After that, they arrive in your kennel and you train and race them as you would your hired dogs.

Oikein ajoitetut heitot nettoavat sek\u00e4 koirien kiintymyst\u00e4, kokemusta sek\u00e4 julkisuutta. Huippuunsa treenattu ja kuuluisa koira on todellinen voimanpes\u00e4 joka ei hetkess\u00e4 uuvu. T\u00e4m\u00e4 lis\u00e4ksi koirien kehitykseen kuuluu my\u00f6s niiden paikan oppiminen, toiset koirat ovat parempia k\u00e4rjess\u00e4 ja toiset per\u00e4ll\u00e4. Se on s\u00e4\u00e4li ett\u00e4 n\u00e4it\u00e4 ei t\u00e4ysin saa itse p\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4\u00e4.\nKoiria voi kuitenkin kustomoida haluamallaan tavalla, p\u00e4\u00e4asiassa vain valjasten v\u00e4ri ja nimi, mutta se on loppuviimeksi aika paljon.\n\nToinen osa pelist\u00e4 on talouden hallinta. Kerran kuussa tulee laskuja riippuen siit\u00e4 mit\u00e4 kaikkea pelaaja on hankkinut itselleen. Eri tasoilla on eri vaatimuksia ja eri etuuksia. Esimerkiksi kolmostasolle ei p\u00e4\u00e4se ennenkuin koiria on valjakossa nelj\u00e4. Voisi luulla ett\u00e4 nelj\u00e4 koiraa ei ole haastavuudessaan sen enemp\u00e4\u00e4 kuin kolme, mutta kyll\u00e4 se nelj\u00e4s koira tuo yll\u00e4tt\u00e4v\u00e4n paljon enemm\u00e4n haastetta peliin.\n\nDog Sled Saga ei ole varsinaisesti vaikea peli, mutta se on haastava. Rahaa on syyt\u00e4 s\u00e4\u00e4st\u00e4\u00e4 my\u00f6s pahan p\u00e4iv\u00e4n varalle, sill\u00e4 vaikka rahaa saakin voitoista enemm\u00e4n mit\u00e4 ylemm\u00e4ll\u00e4 tasolla on, niin ne menot tuppaavat my\u00f6s lis\u00e4\u00e4ntym\u00e4\u00e4n, etenkin jos hankkii lis\u00e4\u00e4 henkil\u00f6kuntaa. Sponsorien suhteen on siis oltava valikoiva, toiset tarjoavat enemm\u00e4n keksej\u00e4 pelaajalle, toiset paremman reen ja jotkut tarjoutuvat maksamaan osan kustannuksista. On pelaajasta itsest\u00e4\u00e4n kiinni mihin panostaa, sill\u00e4 kaikissa on jotakin hyv\u00e4\u00e4 mutta valikoimalla tietyn sponsorien, et v\u00e4ltt\u00e4m\u00e4tt\u00e4 pysty ottamaan sit\u00e4 toista eritt\u00e4in hyv\u00e4\u00e4.\n\nHaastavuus on se mik\u00e4 tuo peliin sit\u00e4 pituutta huomattavasti lis\u00e4\u00e4. T\u00e4m\u00e4 ei ole pelin jonka voi nopeasti puskea l\u00e4pi, sill\u00e4 k\u00e4rsiv\u00e4llisyys palkitaan. Kun koira oppii tietyn paikan ja kehittyy siin\u00e4, niin sit\u00e4 paremmaksi se tulee. Keksienheittelyss\u00e4 oikea ajoitus vet\u00e4\u00e4 enemm\u00e4n kuuluisuutta puoleensa, mik\u00e4 mahdollistaa koirien kehittymisen entisest\u00e4\u00e4n. Variaatiota ja muuttua riitt\u00e4\u00e4 todella paljon ja \u00e4kkiselt\u00e4\u00e4n se kaikki voi tuntua eritt\u00e4in monimutkaiselta, mutta siksi t\u00e4t\u00e4 peli\u00e4 kannattaakin pelata k\u00e4rsiv\u00e4llisyydell\u00e4 ja rauhallisella etenemisell\u00e4. Sill\u00e4 tavalla varmistaa rahan riitt\u00e4vyyden ja koirien kehittymisen. Se kuullostaa omaankin korvaani todella kovalta grindaamiselta, mutta se ei loppuviimeksi tunnu silt\u00e4 kisoissa, sill\u00e4 t\u00e4ss\u00e4 peliss\u00e4 tuntuu olevan sit\u00e4 jotakin mik\u00e4 saa vain innostaa kehittym\u00e4\u00e4n ja p\u00e4rj\u00e4\u00e4m\u00e4\u00e4n.\n\nKoiraihmisen\u00e4 saan t\u00e4st\u00e4 v\u00e4h\u00e4n enemm\u00e4n irti, mutta er\u00e4s asia mik\u00e4 vet\u00e4\u00e4 my\u00f6s v\u00e4h\u00e4n enemm\u00e4n t\u00e4m\u00e4n pelin pariin on se, ett\u00e4 koirat saa nimet\u00e4 itse. Olisi tosin ollut kiva saada v\u00e4h\u00e4n lis\u00e4\u00e4 kustomointia. Koirarotuja on useita ja niiden saatavuus on t\u00e4sin kiinni sattumasta ja samoin se, ett\u00e4 mihin rooliin ne parhaiten sopivat. Itse olisin niin halunut itselleni k\u00e4rkikoiraksi seefferin, mutta se oli voimakoirana paljon tehokkaampi. N\u00e4m\u00e4 ovat niit\u00e4 asioita joihin ei voi vaikuttaa, mutta ne ovat niit\u00e4 satunnaisia heikkouksia t\u00e4ss\u00e4 muuten varsin mainiossa peliss\u00e4.\n\nKokonaisuutena Koirareki saaga on todella hyvin tehty peli joka kaikessa yksinkertaisuudessaan tarjoaa melko paljon haastetta, mutta my\u00f6s sen verran hyv\u00e4n pelattavuuden, joka yksinkertaisella alulla onnistuu koukuttamaan mukaan niin hyvin, ett\u00e4 t\u00e4h\u00e4n peliin kyll\u00e4 tyk\u00e4styy.\n\n\n+ Koirat\n+ Simppeli mutta monipuolinen pelattavuus\n+ Tietty koukuttavuus\n\n- Koiria olisi kiva pysty\u00e4 kustomoimaan enemm\u00e4n\n- Tuntuu ajoittain etenev\u00e4n turhan hitaasti\n\n\nArvosana: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1495912476, "timestamp_updated": 1495912476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32002006": {"recommendationid": "32002006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077925304", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490698120}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uadc0\uc5ec\uc6c0", "timestamp_created": 1495907289, "timestamp_updated": 1495907289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31927639": {"recommendationid": "31927639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117493929", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513984515}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive and adorable game!

What should it be called??\" *Bob is working on saint benards* \"SAINT SOMETHING!\"\n-I like the story behind it. \n\nCons:\n-League six.\n-It gets a little boring and repetative after an hour or so.\n-There are no yorkshire terriers!

Once you get the hang of it, you will finish every race in 1st place if you are a PC gamer of any experience. As implied by my reference to iPads, it's easy to tell that this game is designed for mobile, as every action is either left clicking, left dragging, or holding left click and releasing. No right clicking, no keyboard needed.\n\nMuch of the enjoyment comes from strictly-unnecessary \"cute\" features such as petting the dogs, silly hero-shot close-up portraits of the dogs when they level up, cute sound effects, and the dog happiness system. If you have ever wanted to upgrade a dog's happiness from \"good\" to \"great\" by petting it, this is your chance. The automatic name generator won me over immediately when it named one of my first dogs \"Trashboat.\"\n\nThe dogs each have their own personalities and quirks, but whereas a normal game might revolve around discarding characters with bad traits and hiring new ones with good traits to maximize team effectiveness, here they serve as just more fun flavor, as they aren't make-or-break in any given race.\n\ntl;dr: Dog Petting Simulator 2016, 11/10 would pet again", "timestamp_created": 1483810226, "timestamp_updated": 1483810226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29033785": {"recommendationid": "29033785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272324753", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1515879660}, "language": "french", "review": "C'est vraiment chouette !

It's a pretty straight forward game with some trial and error.

I'd like to be able to track the history of my team performance vs. other sledding teams. Another great addition would be if the dogs aged and you had to retire them. You could keep them around for breeding until they die of natural causes, sell them for profit, or give them away to a loving family...all of these choices could give your dogs in the kennel certain perks or affect morale in some way.\n\nI could even see multiplayer being pretty fun with this game.

If you like/dislike this review, please leave a comment so we can all gain something from this moment.\nThis review is spoiler free as it gets. And I was playing this game only on PC.\n\nDog Sled Saga is multiplatform singleplayer simulator involving racing and team management. Suitable for every age. Recommended only for those who can read English as some game mechanics and story are understandable only by reading.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nOnce you've set up your team the general idea is to win as many races as possible and improve your team along the way either by improving your dogs; using money on several improvements or signing better sponsor as time goes by. Everything leads to more complicated races in higher tier leagues. If we consider day count as a goal of the game, to be the best as soon as possible, then these choices very much matter, but if you just want to have some casual fun, your team will improve over time and the order of things is not an issue.\nController of choice is my beloved PC Mouse and on few occassions even Keyboard. Everything else I found to be a hindrance to the gameplay.\nUI can become a bit confusing at times due to design being done for smart phone devices. I have encountered one bug in main menu few times but nothing game breaking.\n\n[b]Graphics & Sound:[/b]\nGame is very easy to run on pretty much any computer, the choice was once again well crafted pixel graphics and very basic sounds. Even with very little resolution on character models, I found them adorable and very well crafted though they don't make for the best Steam page background.\nSounds can be helpful in this game as they give you clues on what happenings during the race once you learn to recognize them. Some sounds were pretty hilarious especially when something fails, it bounces back with humor.\nI preffered playing with loud sounds and music off.\n\n[b]Learning Curve:[/b]\nI have to say that first few races proved to be the toughest, the game does explaining it's mechanics very well but over time the game gets much easier than it was in the beginning and increasing in difficulty once again when you start reaching the end of the game.\n\n[b]Uniqueness:[/b]\nThere has to be only few games of it's kind. This game did an honest job with art style making it stand out among other games using pixel graphics. There's also an option to field a few unusual dog races for dog sledding.\nStory is very subtle addition to the game and doesn't affect the way you play the game.\n\n[b]Final verdict:[/b]\nVery enjoyable casual game that you can turn on anytime do a few rounds and then return to it later. Altough the general loop may seem a bit repetitive, I felt this game to be rewarding and cheerful. Ultimately I was not able to put in as high amount of hours as I think I could and I'd blame the repetitivness and rich game library but on other scores the game is very solid with future improvement being teased.\n\n+ Graphics\n+ Simple mechanics\n+ Cute and cheerful\n+ Low HW requirements\n+ Price\n\n- Repetitive\n- UI\n\nIn it's price category I'd say this game can dominate many comers and if you feel like Dog Sledding may be your thing, give this one a try or gift it to a friend. Make your musher dream come true.\n\nI, based on my experience, recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1480075992, "timestamp_updated": 1480082177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27330990": {"recommendationid": "27330990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066023708", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479082215}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of the most addicting games I have played this far.

You develop a rival who you come to race time and time again througout the game, and the races do get close at the end. There is a tale told to you about how the dog sled racing scene came to be, but I'm convinced that it's not 100% accurate.\n\n[i] There's not much to the story other than the fact that you are trying to enter higher leagues and become famous while beating your rival. [/i]\n\n[u] Races: [/u]\nYou pick your lineup, which dogs go where (Wheel, Middle, Lead). Your dogs will have different capabilities on what breed they are and how you train them. Throughout the course, your dogs get exhausted, keep feeding them by lobbing food into the air at the perfect angle for them to snatch and gobble up. Don't worry if you run out, there are reload bags all along the tracks. There are some obstacles like trees that will block your throws and rocks that will require you and your dogs to leap over. Each race has different statistics such as: different team sizes, differing track lengths, amount of food reloads, amount of obstacles, and ground snow, wind, and weather quality. At the end of the races, the participating dogs may receive some popularity, experience, and stamina depending on how the race went, but for sure they will receive a certain amount of fatigue from the race.\n\n[i] Feed your dogs to keep their energy up while avoiding obstacles, don't throw food at them when they don't want it or you'll bop 'em on their heads. [/i]\n\n[u] Resting: [/u]\nWhen you and your dogs aren't racing, you can let them rest, you can train them, and you can pet them! This is where you can let your dogs recover from fatigue, or where you can train them and boost their levels. Later in the game you have options to hire employees; caretakers or trainers who provide additional slots and capability of training some dogs while allowing others to rest during the regimen process that moves you a day closer to the next race. \n\n[i] Hire new dogs, say goodbye to old ones, do some training, pay your dues, get sponsorships, it's all part of your day to day life as dog sled racer. [/i]\n\n[u] Visuals: [/u]\nThe pixel art convinced me to buy this game, the husky on the cover to be specific. The pixel dogs are adorable and the frame-by-frame animations are so smooth.\n\n[i] There's so much detail put into the art and it all comes together and is executed perfectly. [/i]\n\n[u] TL;DR: [/u]\nA fun game that is a great buy, it may fall short to some in racing engagement and story, but it's addictive and outstanding in visuals and experience (roughly 5 hours gameplay time to reach the final league).

Although the gameplay during the race is really nice and smooth, I think the storyline is somewhat thin. You get updates about some old sledrider when you're back in the cabin which isn't really connected to anything in the game (at least till league 5). And then there is the fast sled rider with the turbo-husky's, which the main character keeps complaining about. The thing is when you doing alright, the fast sled rider never wins and you still are annoyed about him which seems a bit strange. At last there is some balance missing in the upgrade system. For example the most expensive trainers seem not really necessary, because the dogs are easily maintained in top condition with just the main character (at least till league 5). \n\nDid I enjoy the 2 hours I played?

I first tried it at my friend's house and immediately had to buy it. I have been playing it like a maniac since then.\n\nSo far I have enjoyed the game immensely, though that does not mean that I haven't noticed certain pros and cons to it.\n\nThankfully the pros outweigh the cons. The game is a pixel game which in my case is awesome because I love pixel games. The dogs and everything is pretty detailed and with pretty darn good animations. The colors and nice and soft and don't hurt the eyes even though the majority of the game consists of various shades of white and gray (the environment).\nThe game's racing mechanic is simple enough yet it offers a challenge, especially later in the game when you reach higher leagues. For examples, I am currently part of league 6 which involves having up to 5 dogs on your team and I have to admit I am struggling a bit more often to reach the 1st place. It takes a bit of practice and choosing the right dogs for the race becomes a lot more important. Still, it is very fun and enjoyable. \nManaging your team is probably my favorite part of the game. Considering all the expanses you have it is really important to keep only those dogs who work for you. However, you usually have to spend some time working with any dog to see if it's really a good match for your team. There are quite a few things to considering when creating a team for a particular race. I also love that you can now specifically train or rest your dogs and manage who will train, and who will be idle for a while. Having staff to help you with that is of great help, especially if you have a lot of dogs to work with. \nUnfortunately there are a few things that do bother me, though I am pretty sure they will be improved later.\nFirst of all, yes, I understand that higher leagues are meant to offer a much greater challenge when racing, but sometimes the obstacles you have to face are a bit too much. Sometimes it is a bit too difficult to get to a race that your dogs are ready for and that will give you enough money to pay your bills. \nAlthough the game has quite a few of them, I would love to see more dog breeds, but the ones who are actually suitable for dog sledding. Though I am sure that will come with time. \nAlso, I wish there were more things to do in the game. At the moment you pretty much just race and spam the rest/train + proceed buttons. I wish we could interact with our dogs more by feeding, playing or petting, maybe make it optional to boost their happiness, or skills or something. Maybe add some real errands where you have to transport things, or help people in need, like a simple quest system that can help you financially or in some other way like free special training or something. Crafting would be a nice addition, maybe make your own food or equipment or something like that. They do plan to add breeding later to the game which will be awesome. \n\nAll in all, this is a great little game to play at almost any time and I cannot recommend it enough! :D Regardless of whether you are a dog lover or not, it is a good game to play. The only real issue is that once you start playing it is definitely difficult to stop. On more than one occasion I would start playing and after a couple of minutes realize that in fact almost 2h had passed. It's an awesome game with an awesome concept that has potential to become even greater.

Personally, I find Dog Sled Saga to be one of those games that I might play when I'm feeling down or overwhelmed. The atmosphere, though its graphics are simple, is fun and upbeat. The game may not reap so much satisfaction for everyone, but I feel so triumphant and proud of those adorable, digital dogs when we win a particularly difficult race.\n\nI'm typically wary of Early Access games, but I've gotten more than my money's worth out of this game, and I'm not even close to getting bored.

Now I can give my final review and thoughts, both the good and the bad. Overall, I find that this game is extremely charming with adorable pixel graphics, but it also shares a few problems like everything else.\n\nI LOVE this game to death, it was really fun to play from start to finish. There's so many dogs to choose from, with lots of sled and leash colors to choose from. The new breeding mechanic also doubles the fun, making me some adorable puppers! Racing is fun, and I enjoy figuring out the ups and downs of my dogs. It's nice to know that each dog is unique in personality and has different skills for your team. Many dog lovers will find this fun and adorable.\n\nSometimes I do have to put Dog Sled Saga on the shelf, I often get bored when playing for too long as the gameplay can feel pretty repetitive. I also feel the full release has a serious lack of dog breeds to choose from, which is fine since 'most' of them are made for this kind of job, but a lot of them aren't. With so many breeds in the world I understand that they had to stop somewhere, and there is already a nice roster, but there's quite a few popular breeds that weren't included. I do hope eventually there might be some DLC, or just updates continuing to add more.\n\nDog Sled Saga is a fun and short game to play, it's great for a quick sitdown as it isn't as demanding or as time consuming as other games. Its arcade-like style allows it to stand on its own feet as a fun and addictive game.\n\n(for those who TL;DR)\n\nPros:\n- Adorable Art Style\n- Fun and Simple Gameplay.\n- Can Play on Almost Any Computer.\n- Cute Music.\n- Dog Personality Traits and Features.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of Dog Breeds.\n- Gets Repetitive.\n- No Pugs. \n\nThe low price is definitely worth the game, I enjoy it a lot!\n", "timestamp_created": 1455525081, "timestamp_updated": 1490006607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20952410": {"recommendationid": "20952410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040225003", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464473200}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely a fun game, I enjoy the management and the dogs are cute.

The game is fun to play, and while I would like to have more breeds to select from, and a deeper management of their stats, it is still a great game to spend a few hours on.  Cheering on your favorites, cursing when their faults kick in at the wrong time, and laughing because your favorite dog's favorite thing is.... snow.  Fun, adorable, easy to play.  Just don't expect a deep story or complex career mode.... not yet anyway.... they are still working on it, and I look forward to see what they add.... but the bottom line is this:\n\nEven in the state the game is in NOW, it is a FUN and UNIQUE game experience.

There is no volume control on the music or sound effects - so you can either have them turned ON (and very loud), or OFF. There is no explanation as to what some of the more obscure options are (\"Catch Cursor\"? \"Sharp scale\"?). These should be explained simply so players know whether to turn them off or on.\n\nAlso, the other thing that really bothers me about this game are the dog breeds that you can choose from. Husky and Malamute are fine, but Labradors? St. Bernards? Schnauzers? Worst of all, Shih-Poos? Seriously? These breeds are NOT sled dogs by any stretch of the imagination, and they kind of break my immersion in enjoying the game when I see them on the \"Hire Dog\" list. \n\nThe game presents itself as otherwise somewhat \"realistic\" otherwise - I can't hire unicorns for my team, and I can't put rockets on my sled for speed boosts, plus there are weather and track conditions that affect my run - so having completely unrealistic dog breeds on my sled team really ruins it for me. I wish there was an option to only hire sled-appropriate breeds (and there are plenty actual dog breeds to choose from that are acceptable as sled dogs). \n\nSo this game needs a few serious tweaks - some improvements to the Options menu, some more dog breeds to choose from (and the removal of the ridiculous breeds or the option to filter them out in the Hire Dog menu), and possibly some other things to do besides run races. Some simple minigames to play with your dogs inbetween races would be fantastic.\n\nOtherwise, the game is enjoyable, and cute - a good way to spend some time, but it becomes repetitive quickly when all you can do is run races.", "timestamp_created": 1431585931, "timestamp_updated": 1431585931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456432", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15784171": {"recommendationid": "15784171", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985354787", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511567158}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very fun game with a unique style of gameplay and an original theme.  \n\nIt is different from other racing games.

Even though it seems simple at first, there are lots of different things that factor into races that make each one a challenge - especially when adding new dogs to your team or placing up in a higher league. There's more strategy involved than I first realized as well! As fun as this game is, though, I found it fairly easy, and after roughly 5 hours of gameplay I've managed to go as far as I possibly can with my current team. Despite that, this game is definitely worth the price, and I have high hopes that more things will be implimented before it leaves early access.\n\nPros:\n+ You have to interact/race with each individual dog to learn and unlock their quirks; the perfect dog just insn't handed to you (although more traits are visible when buying dogs in higher leagues)\n+ The dogs have personalities and can have rapport with teammates!\n+ Races truly seem randomized, don't think I've encountered the same course twice\n+ Weather and snow conditions affect the race!\n+ Refreshing breeds available. Never thought I'd see a Shih-poo or Schnauzer in a dog sled race!\n+ Lots of different fault, skills, and other quirks each dog can have\n+ Neat color choices for harnesses/names/accents for each dog\n\nCons:\n- Not very many breeds to choose from. Yes, there are 10 \"different\" dogs altogether, but three of those are just different colors of husky, not individual breeds. Greenland Dogs, American Eskimos, Alaskan Huskies, Pointers, Chows, Mutts even - there are plenty more breeds that are apt for racing that I'd love to see included!\n- You can't return/resell dogs once they're acquired. I feel like this would be a very good thing to add to the game, especially once you get to the higher leagues and find you have 12 dogs or so, five of which you don't race anymore because they have undesirable faults that keep you from winning a race. I hate seeing dogs \"rot\" away in the cabin with no use.\n- Only one save file. I know I personally would explore the game much more if I had three or so files to have different teams in!\n- No real plot/objectives. Race. Add dogs to your team to qualify for higher leagues.

It looked pretty fun in the videos, so I figured I'd give it shot. I'm glad I did. It's a really fun and simple game, where all you do buy some dogs and race, I guess with the goal of advancing through the ranks. Your dogs all have certain talents, likes, faults, ect., so you'll have to decide which position on the team the dog gets in order to maximize it's abillities.  Everything is done with the mouse, making the game easy to control, and because of the simple gameplay, It's real easy to jump in and out of. The graphics are really good and the sound and music great as well. Even though this game is in early access, it feels pretty complete already. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes retro style games, dogs, or to those who don't have a lot of time to game.

You click and hold the mouse button to initiate a variable trajectory with which you try and hurl dog biscuits into your awesome dog's mouth.  You'll know your dogs are hungry by their panting breath against the cold pixel-y wind.\n\nIt is actually quite easy to blunder this up.  First if you try and feed your dogs before they are hungry, it will comically bounce off their noggin and you'll have lost a doggy biscuit.  Second if you just clearly miss (some dogs seem to be better catchers than others) well then you're probably going to lose the race.  But sometimes you can miss because you aren't paying attention to the huge TREE INCOMING sign.\n\nSo what happens if your dogs are hungry?  Well, aside from going slow they trip up the works.  You'll have to, in real-time, adjust the length of rope dividing the dogs to make sure it has proper length to avoid getting tangled.  Outside of that, I'm not really sure.  I never went that far without feed my dogs.\n\nDog Sled Saga is surprisingly deep despite being pretty shallow.  All of the game can be controlled via the mouse and one mouse button.  You don't really need to tend to your dogs outside of the races, like a tamagotchi.  The only thing you need to concern yourself with is if they are tired and if they get along with other dogs on your team and what type of position they like to be in.\n\nDespite all of this, I did find myself becoming attached to my Dog Sled Saga team.  The pixel art is wonderful to watch and the music, my goodness the music.  It is great!  I mean, the music is 8-bit style, but it's SO WELL DONE.  Truly gets stuck in my head.\n\nI am a fan of Dog Sled Saga even though right now it seems kind of bare-bones.", "timestamp_created": 1418113676, "timestamp_updated": 1418114545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13290920": {"recommendationid": "13290920", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996491274", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418196685}, "language": "english", "review": "Dogs are cool.", "timestamp_created": 1418105577, "timestamp_updated": 1418105577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13290401": {"recommendationid": "13290401", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972414642", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508211550}, "language": "english", "review": "Great so far.

I will say that my first impression is [b]positive[/b]. I did not notice any obvious bugs or flaws. The gameplay struck me as repetitive, but not boring. It has the potential to be addictive. The game proved to be a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend a night. It does not seem overpriced, but remember to be wary of [i]any[/i] early-access title.\n\n------------------------------\n[h1]CORE GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n------------------------------\n\nThe core gameplay focuses on learning how to properly manage a team of dogs, and how to maximize race efficiency. Races use simple click and timing mechanics to manage factors such as sled position, hunger, jumping, and untangling. Proper racing is rewarded with speed and happy dogs. Awesome moments are rewarded with fame that can lead to sponsorship upgrades.\n\nLearning about each individual dog is important to team management. Each dog has a unique personality that will affect their natural sled position, likes, dislikes, happiness, and rapport with teammates. Dogs will have their own favorite things, skills, and faults. They will also have different levels of athleticism that will affect their fatigue and hunger.\n\nAll of the information about races and dogs will serve one purpose: managing the team. The overall goal is to earn money from victories and move on to more advanced leagues. The time outside of races is used to rest dogs to lower fatigue, fill the journal, change leagues, and hire new dogs. Raleigh will offer a piece of advice (chosen by you) at the end of each race. This information will be used to fill the journal and provide gameplay tips. The first couple of leagues seem easy once the core gameplay is understood, but that seems subject to change based on in-game progress and future updates.\n\n------------------------------\n[h1]FINAL DECISION[/h1]\n------------------------------\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty more to the game that I have not discovered yet, but these are my first impressions.

It is simple but a lot of fun and the dogs have unique enough personalities that you get pretty emotionally invested in them. Racing them is fun, pretty easy to learn and can get kind of repetitive but I enjoyed it. Parts of it get more challenging as you move up the leagues so that's nice.\n\nSome suggestions I would have for things to improve:\n\n- Up the difficulty of the racing a little bit maybe? Once you master the throwing it's pretty easy to get 1st every time even if something goes wrong. If two of my dogs got exhausted during the race I probably shouldnt be able to get 1st.\n\n- Right now the mechanic is that you're in last place for like half the race and then overcome the others to move up to 2nd or 1st usually. I think it would be a little more exciting if the race was more neck-and-neck the whole time with you continually passing and getting passed by people.\n\n- Make it a little clearer how leagues work? like I'm not sure when's the best time to try to earn the new league, between bills or on bill day, or does it even matter?\n\n- When breeding, obviously my female dog should be out of commission for a while, but can I get my boy back? Why do you need him for that long? :P\n\n- When conditioning new puppies, make it so that I can choose which of the parent's traits I want them to try to learn.

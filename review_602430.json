The game has a high puzzle element to it, while also offering town areas to explore and discover bits and pieces about the lore. Each of the groups within the game (humans, elephants, zombies, robots, etc.) are common tropes of games (well, besides elephants) but they've put their own twists onto the backstories and reasonings behind each that makes it unique and interesting to investigate.\n\nBut even if exploration isn't something you find exciting, the main story and puzzling elements are still very strong. A few of the rooms feel like there's an overwhelmingly large amount of options of things to interact with, but it has a good mix of small, medium, and large puzzle rooms. The combat is pretty basic, but it isn't particularly the focus and doesn't need to be intricate.\n\nThe few things I would say negatively would be that some of the sound effects are fairly low-quality, which probably is only more noticable because the music is so much better in contrast. You're restricted to a single save which can be bad if you have multiple people playing or want to do so for other reasons. Unless you wanted to go back and collect all the health token or explore buildings you might have ignored, I wouldn't say the game has a ton of replayability, but length-wise compared to the price, I would say it's a fair bargain.\n\nMost people won't have an interest in this, but speedrun-wise it's a lovely lovely game with a ton of cool strats and not too hefty of a learning curve at all. Definitely a good way to artificially extend the life of this game is you enjoy it and still want to play it more but have done basically everything.\n\nI think after watching a minute or two of gameplay, your gut reaction will be a fairly honest indicator of if this game will suit you properly. I'm awful with puzzles but still enjoyed the experience.", "timestamp_created": 1516471070, "timestamp_updated": 1516471070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39066464": {"recommendationid": "39066464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092526732", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515108099}, "language": "english", "review": "Is everyone high in this game because all the reviews are positive (including mine)\n\nI feel like I'm on LSD:\n\nRando elephant falls from space, with the purpose of helping people so impoverished that they do not know what an elephant is, and I could abuse a chicken with the headbutt ability.\n\n\n\ni still liked it and i will finish it", "timestamp_created": 1515108634, "timestamp_updated": 1515108634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38820417": {"recommendationid": "38820417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014719953", "num_games_owned": 486, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514044425}, "language": "english", "review": "An adorable and funny zelda-alike.

It took me about 4 hours to fully complete. It doesn't hurt that the art and sound design (so many trumpetings) are ridiculously cute, too. Just a really all-around nice game.\n\nMinor issues:\n- I had a couple bugs relating to item placement -- odd clipping and so on.

Yono is new to the world and he was sent from the heavens for a purpose he isn\u2019t quite sure of. To find answers, he sets out on a journey across the world to visit the races of the world and to help solve their problems.\n\nThere are 3 major races in Yono\u2019s world, the Humans, Zombies and Robots. During his travels he meets many unique and often charming characters. Two of which join him in his journey across the world. The world also has a couple enemies that you\u2019ll encounter as well including snakes, skeletons and goblins. There are also a few boss fights along the way as well.\n\nThe game\u2019s main focus is on it\u2019s many different puzzles that you solve across the world. The puzzles are largely logic based and often revolve around pushing blocks around and activating switches. They also incorporate Yono\u2019s special abilities such as spitting water, air, peanuts, or fire out of his trunk.\n\nThere is also a bit of combat along the way but I\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s a bit basic since Yono is an elephant that can\u2019t wield swords or weapons. So he simply slams into them with his face.\n\nThere are 2 stores which you can visit in major towns as well. The first allows you to turn in heart containers which grant you an extra heart on your health bar. You need to collect 4 of them before you can turn them in. The second is a tailor which allows you to change how Yono looks. There are a lot of choices and they change based on which town you\u2019re in as well. There\u2019s even a nod to The Legend of Zelda in one of the fashions as well.\n\nIn towns there are also some NPC\u2019s that will have side quests for you to complete for them. The quests all take place in their town of origin and if you don\u2019t complete them before leaving, you can always return later.\n\nOverall, Yono and the Celestial Elephants is quite the cute little game. Yono is an interesting, if naive elephant and his journey is an entertaining one. It\u2019s on the easy end of the difficulty threshold but this makes it a great game for older children to get into. It\u2019s pretty entertaining for adults as well but I wouldn\u2019t go in expecting something overly challenging. The game is also pretty short and can be beaten in 3-5 hours total.\n\nIf you'd like to see my final score for the game, you can find my full review here:

Both of them are for babies, but like, mentally advanced babies.\n\nGameplay consists of moving from screen to screen, each screen consisting of a self-contained puzzle of sorts.  Puzzles consist of box-pushing and \"use metaphorical key X in metaphorical lock Y so that you can access literal key A to open literal lock B\".  Puzzles kinda sorta get more complex as the game goes on, but solving them always follows this game general line of thought, and usually there's only one functional action you can take in any given puzzle at any given time, so even if you can't logic it out ahead of time, you can generally stumble your way through it with enough time investment.\n\nTo put it another way, puzzles require the same general type of deductive thinking as puzzles in something like The Talos Principle, except you wouldn't give the Talos Principle to a six-year-old, you would give them Yono so that they're ready to play Talos Principle when they're a little older.\n\nRegarding the game's atmosphere, you can probably tell from the video that everything in the game is adorable, and that generally follows along with the story where nothing particularly dire ever happens.  I mean, threats to world peace or whatever, but not anything more extreme than you would see on a Nickelodeon cartoon.\n\nBut what's weird about this game is that a lot of the characters you talk to will ponder on life philosophy.  Like, you have cartoon skeletons questioning the meaning of a life based on material goods, and you have cartoon robots wondering if life is more or less \"free\" whether you are born with a given purpose or without one.  It's nothing revolutionary or anything, but it goes pretty deep for a game that's clearly written for a younger audience.  So once again, I have to come back around to saying \"It's like The Talos Principle, but for babies.\"\n\nWill adults like it?  Well... Personally, I thought the gameplay was tedious after a while.  There was never any question to what direction the story was going, either, though I was generally wondering what weird thing the next random NPC was going to talk about.

I think it's for the same reason that lining up between a barrell and a movable block and then head-butting the block sends the elephant into the air. Similarly, you can't walk between a block and away-facing fence - the elephant just doesn't fit in there.\n* Related to above (physics!) it is possible to solve a number of puzzles in an unintended way (e.g. push a vase next to a block and carefully climb on top of it instead of doing what you're meant to), although I've find this mildly entertaining to be honest.", "timestamp_created": 1507998005, "timestamp_updated": 1507998005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570552", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35710054": {"recommendationid": "35710054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003292839", "num_games_owned": 491, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507962408}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Yono\" is very much on the easy side, which might be boring to some people.\nThat said, it's also very charming and stylish.\nMusic is well done, story and (some) sidequests offer more depth then is readily apparent by looking at the game and, well, Yono is ridiculously cute.\n\nTook me about 3,5 hours to fully complete (max health upgrades, all lore pages filled),\nand I enjoyed it the whole way.\n\nSpecs are kind of a moot point.

It suffers a bit from a seemingly random story, a lack of character development, and a complete lack of any sort of progression, but the core puzzling experience is largely enjoyable. If you\u2019re looking for a charming game to relax and play for a few hours, this one might be worth checking out. However, if you\u2019re looking for a deep, challenging experience that will last more than five or six hours, you may want to look elsewhere.\"\n\nYou can find the full review and some cool screenshots from our time playing here: http://twocredits.co/our-two-credits/two-credits-yono-celestial-elephants/", "timestamp_created": 1507824169, "timestamp_updated": 1507824169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.387214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 27, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 27}}

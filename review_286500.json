Kate being an author in the supernatural field couldn't lose the opportunity to see a real ghost with her own eyes. Things eventually turn to the [b]House of 1,000 Doors[/b]. A mysterious house that appears and disappears out of nowhere, leaving no trace or indication where the next stop will be.\nIt's up to Kate to uncover the real mystery behind this ghostly house, and discover her family spiritual past!\n\n[b]House of 1,000 Doors: Family Secrets[/b] offers a tremendous concept for a ghost story, where a House with 1,000 Doors appears always at an unknown location, containing the trapped spirits of those who died with unfinished business, or are in too much pain to move on. The Player controlling Kate (which gave me a huge Dana Scully vibe) must free those spirits and at the same time gather information about her linked past, and relatives who were always connected to spirituality.\nThe game executes this concept really well, and leaves the player with a pretty cool story-plot to unveil and enjoy the 3D cutscenes that are actually pretty good visually.\nUnfortunately the resolutions are locked to outdated ones, and the visuals are affected by it, stretching the image and losing overall quality. This being an Hidden Object Game surely could benefit from a resolution of 1280x720 as the bare minimum, this was released in 2014 after all! [i]Alawar[/i] probably developed this game using an old engine.\nIf weren't for such technical issues, this first chapter of [b]House of 1,000 Doors[/b] could easily be praised by its visuals, as they are very interesting, distinct and magical, varying from spooky hallways to snowy abandon houses. This adventure makes the player to travel through different times as well, and thus giving a much wider variety of interesting places to explore.\nAlthough this game is named after 1000 doors, you can't go through all of them obviously, but the game still lets you explore quite a bit, with impressive detailed rooms, atmospherically perfect to give you the appropriate mood in each scene.\nHidden Object Scenes are included, but not as much as you would expect, making this more of an adventure. If the traditional and simplistic HoS are not enough, you can also search for objects connected through different dimensions.\nThe puzzles are also present, but slightly complex or difficult, which is great for new players or anyone looking for a simple and fun adventure without feeling the need to skip puzzles. Some of these puzzles are original and are very suitable for the story, others are jut plain generic we've seen dozens of times!\nThe Collector's Edition offers a Strategy Guide that may come in hand, and an extra chapter in the story, that focus more on the family side of the main character, as well as events such as the story of Kate's grandmother's, who started a spiritual journey, and therefore giving the player more answers. New areas are also available with new objectives to complete.\n\nOverall [b]House of 1,000 Doors[/b] is a really good game that everyone who enjoys a ghostly adventure should try it, but keep in mind the poor resolutions.\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1505328047, "timestamp_updated": 1505337252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530166", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34809424": {"recommendationid": "34809424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169054355", "num_games_owned": 580, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504854962}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun very enjoyable game!

Goldilocks would have liked it.  ;)  The story line features the usual paranormal stuff which admittedly I am not keen on, but which all these games seem to be infected with (please, somebody recommend me HOPA games that aren't).  It's mildly spooky, but not scary or gory.\n\nIt has a map feature, you can always use hints or skip the puzzles so you won't get stuck (it does in fact include a full walk-through called a \"strategy guide\") and it's captivating enough that I played it through in two long sittings.  At summer sale values it was well worth the purchase, at full price it would just make it into my acceptable category, considering it doesn't have a lot of replay value.

The plot has some supernatural elements, but doesn't feature any imagery that might scare younger players away. And the puzzles, while not all that challenging (especially if you choose to use hints), were still engaging enough to hold my interest.  The default price is a tad high, even for a \"Collector's Edition\", and especially since this game AND two of its sequels can be found in the \"House of Snark 6-in-1 Bundle\" (though there may be some quality issues and glitches with that pack).

got my mom to start playing Hidden Objects Games (HOGs for short) \u2013 which means I\u2019ve been inadvertently playing them right along with her. Steam (and more importantly, bundle sites) are so flooded with the damned things that I\u2019ve got dozens in my account without ever making a conscious effort.\nSo I might as well do a month-long writeup of the HOGs that I\u2019ve got.\n\n[b]What are HOGs?[/b] (We just don\u2019t know)\n\nIs that a daft question? I mean, they\u2019re just this:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KZsZU5l.jpg\n\nRight? At least, that's what I kinda assumed. Finding a bunch of hidden objects is right there in the name of the genre. Well\u2026 not really. \n\nHOGs like \"House of a Thousand doors\" are basically all about a set of arbitrary obstacles, overcome by \u201cspecial keys\u201d, gathered through lite adventure game puzzles, arbitrary \u201creal\u201d puzzles of the sort you might find in a puzzle book for 4th graders, and relatively fairly few scattered hidden object hunts. Check out this screen:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fK2bOB9.jpg\n\nI'm going to need to find a pendulum for the clock, a record for the player, a way to put out the fire, a spring for the door, weights for the cales, some thing or another for the creepy hands-clock thing on the right, and an axe to murder the guy drinking the coffee (I don't need the coffee, but his tie has a button needed to complete a puzzle later on). \n\nSome of these objects can be found in hidden objects mini-games like the one above. Some just hang out in new screens you access. Some are acquired after completing a basic mosaic / numbers substitution / item rearranging / maze completion puzzles. Still others (and this is really fun) show up on totally unrelated screens after you've completed an arbitrary number of puzzles. Thankfully, you have a big old recharging [b]?[/b] in the corner of the screen, telling you what to do and where to go next. You can easily play through the game with only a very vague understanding of what's going on, why you're here, what you're doing and where you're supposed to go next, merely hammering the hint button in order to progress further.\n\n\nHouse of 1000 Doors: Family Secrets Collector's Edition (As an aside, every single HOG on steam is \"Something of something: Subtitle here\". I think there's a law and a regulatory commission) is literally the first HOG I ever played, and pretty much formed the standard for the rest - incoherent plot, semi-decent puzzles, interactive map (though you have to dig around a bit to use it) and a fairly fast \"hint\" button. All standard HOG features I came to expect in later games. \n\n\n\nObviously I'm reviewing this game first because the haunted thing fits the the whole October Halloween theme. I mean,  look at how horrified this very good actress is about [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQPVQGc0384]all this fuss[/url]. \n\nSeriously though, despite the fact that most HOGs fashion themselves in some trappings of Gothic horror - haunted mansions and spooky portals and creepy statues and other fuss - they're not exactly twitch stream jumpscare material. \"Horrors of the Deep\" isn't contending with SOMA, \"Weird Park\" is probably not as scary as...The Park, and Spooky Town Terrors aren't particularly spooky or terrifying. I suppose a generic horror-ish setting provides a good background for the detective / medium / writer (generally the protagonist is one of the three, if not all three at once) to investigate.\n\nBut I mostly introduced this game to my mom first because it had a semi-sane and heavily tutorialized introduction to the adventure-game-lite logic on which these games operate. Let me break it down for you, because I was genuinely dumbfounded by how it progressed.\n\nThe heroine receives a package, which you must cut open with a handy KNIFE. Inside is a a wind-up automatic typewriter (which were apparently a thing back in the 1920's?) with a message for you. USE the KEY on the typwriter to wind it up. No paper, and the typewriter ribbon is depleted of ink. OPEN the CUPBOARD, to recover a sheet of paper and some ink. Place the ribbon in the ink slot - you now need TWEEZERS to remove it without getting your hands dirty. [i]Of course[/i] you're going to use your Golden Quill award as a key to your jewelry case, which contains your tweezers inside. Because it's never too early to introduce batshit adventure game logic.\n\nThe typewriter types out an invitation to a seance. When you arrive there, you don't speak to anyone (in fact, you don't even see anyone's face, just a bunch of hands reaching towards a crystal ball) and immediately start trying to figure out how to cut the power line leading to the ball. Once you do, a ghost of your dear departed granny appears. Having manifested your medium abilities (?) you are instructed to enter the House of 1000 doors - a spooky teleporting mansion that's about to show up next to the statue of Liberty - and uncover its secrets in order to exonerate your granny from some unspecified crimes she was accused of. The entire freaking intro had absolutely nothing to do with anything - granny could just as well had manifested in your cozy suburban home, with nothing of substance lost.\n\nSo whenever you see a review praising a HOGs storyline, treat it with a bit of caution. In the House trilogy, at least, the plots are scattershot bits and pieces, as arbitrary and interchangeable as the obstacles in your way. Maybe the game makers are operating in the Square-Enix \"[s]cutscenes[/s] game screens first, plot later\"  style. \n\nThe one thing that could have been unique about this game is the setting, but even that is a bit of a wash: Despite being set in the \u201cHouse of 1000 doors\u201d that can teleport to between space and time, and is full of inter-dimensional portals that the heroine is curiously incurious about, 90% of the game takes place in the same locale. Creepy mansion, creepy basement, creepy shed, short interlude for a creepy ghost train, creepy attic. Same old. \n\nIn terms of ease of use / help for casual players / my mom (because as a hardcore gamer, I naturally never had to resort to such measures) the game has an in-built walkthrough, a semi-hidden map that tells you which screens have something for you to do, and the big pulsing [b]?[/b] recharges fairly fast and doesn't get used up if the hint is \"go to different screen\". (These are actually all fairly regular HOG features, just particularly well implemented. On the same note, whenever you need something to progress, the game is remarkably clear about what you need - another virtue that should be common enough, but still good to have)\n\nSo, not bad as an introduction, not really that brilliant either. Then again, I'm not a HOG connoisseur, so I'm sure the game is great / terrible by a set of measures I'm not familiar with. Pretty much every HOG you'll find on steam will have a \"Very Positive\" aggregate score, with the exception of a few stinkers which merit a \"mixed\" due to being literally impossible to play, so praise in reviews should be treated with a bit of caution.", "timestamp_created": 1487611106, "timestamp_updated": 1487611159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648485", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30004831": {"recommendationid": "30004831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142665671", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487074602}, "language": "french", "review": "House of 1000 Doors est un jeu d'ocjets cach\u00e9s tout ce qu'il y a de plus ordinaire.\n\nDans cet opus, vous incarnez une \u00e9crivain qui est invit\u00e9e dans un myst\u00e9rieux manoir.

I've stumbled upon a dine-room with a large table filled with all manner of food, surrounded by an ominous sculpture that keeps flashing its winking skeletal face at me... I think it\u2019s trying to invite me on a date. The table is filled with exquisite food and wine, along with a gun, a whip, puzzle box, garter-belt, a horseshoe and... what kind of a dinner was this! There is even a dynamite sitting on a chair, what's a dynamite doing in a ghost house? This clearly makes no sense!!!... And... and.. there is a GOLD BAR under the table... I...uh... having problems to understand... are they wealthy, suicidal ghosts or... ooooh, shiny!\"\n\nThis sum up my first impressions as I started playing House of 1000 Doors: confusion and frustration due to its internal inconsistencies. It wants to be a horror game, but most of the time plays like an easy-Sunday drama. It wants to be an adventure game with proper story and intriguing puzzles, and it also wants to be a by-the-numbers hidden object game. Most of the times these extremes clash against each other instead of working together, but somewhere along the way all of the game's elements balance out, and you get a hidden object puzzle game with intriguing collection of stories, pleasant look, decent traditional puzzles and rather well done cutscenes. The best parts are the short ghost stories that you encounter while you traverse the house and try to solve them, as they are creepy and unusual. They would make good Twilight Zone episodes easily!\n\nThere are some major downsides as well, biggest one coming from me not being convinced yet in the allure of hidden object games. I've played only one before House of 1000 Doors and didn't really like it. One of the biggest problems that game had, which also rears its ugly head in House of 1000 Doors is the repeating nature of side-trekking puzzles that force you to solve them more than once, and the story connected crucial inventory items that are popping up in the most illogical places and times, which is a death knell for the traditional adventure games.  While the visual look is rather nice, it is wildly inconsistent, producing next to zero horror atmosphere this game was clearly reaching for. Music is too chirpy and inappropriate in conveying a proper dark mood, In-game animations are bad, and the same goes for the voice acting. Some of the puzzles are unnecessarily complex and fiddly, but they are pale shadows to the puzzle masochism that Black Dahlia had.\n\nBut somehow, when you reach the end of this relatively short game, creepy and fairly original ghost stories that you meet along the way stay in your mind, leaving you with an overall positive experience. So yeah, House of 1000 Doors gets a pass for being an okay game, but the verdict for the value of the entire hidden object genre still hangs in the air. Maybe, if I encounter a few more of similarly good games in this genre, my cynical heart will mellow.", "timestamp_created": 1477575573, "timestamp_updated": 1477575573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26181545": {"recommendationid": "26181545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090172103", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477222365}, "language": "english", "review": "This was my first HOG game and I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe story, graphics, music, voice acting were all good, very atmospheric.

Though the voice acting can be a bit wonky/robotic at times, I think the main plot point of this game (there is a house that appears at certain places/times because there are souls who haven't found peace) is intriguing and super interesting. I love the visuals, the music is amazing, and while you're kind of alone with your thoughts most of the time, I think it really adds to how melancholic and sad this game truly is. It has a lot of the basics of a HOG but also pairs it with a fascinating and immersive storyline.\n\nI do have two complaints, though: \n1. Functional fixedness in this game drives me CRAZY. I know how ridiculous this sounds, but sometimes the game requires a very specific object for a task when you already have something in your inventory that could just as easily complete what needs to be done (for example, using a knife vs scissors to cut something). I know it's because the game is super expansive and if you could complete every task using a select few objects, it would be boring, but it still can be irritating at times.\n2. This seems to be a pattern with most of the games this company puts out, but the ending is extremely rushed. Not only that, but the last door/portal you enter is extremely out of place in comparison to the other storylines. I don't know what it is about this company and their need to insert magic/demons/weird sci-fi elements ONLY at the tail-end of a great story, but that's what happens here, and it's a little sad, because the rest of the storylines are so beautifully thought out. The fourth and final portal is so short in comparison it feels tacked on.\n\nThat being said, if you purchase the CE, there is a phenomenal additional chapter to play which totally (IMO) makes up for the quickness of the final door. You get to learn more about Kate's family/why and how she's tied to the House (and also how it works), and it's on par with the melancholy of the earlier plotlines.\n\nI really enjoyed this game and really recommend it, simply because the storylines are so fascinating (if you ignore when they randomly add magical elements), it has a longer gameplay than most HOG, and the environments are expansive and beautifully rendered.", "timestamp_created": 1467707256, "timestamp_updated": 1467707256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24082796": {"recommendationid": "24082796", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973241775", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492217664}, "language": "french", "review": "J'aime bien ce jeu, il est \u00e0 la fois attrayant et int\u00e9ressant.", "timestamp_created": 1467644159, "timestamp_updated": 1467644159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23725605": {"recommendationid": "23725605", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986030242", "num_games_owned": 491, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466686946}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Imprescindible para los amantes de este tipo de juegos.

Or maybe she doesn't\u2014the plot gets a little confused towards the end, although that will be addressed in a moment.\n\nFirst, the HOG criteria:\n\nCriterion 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?\n\nThis isn't one of the genre's shining moments, by any means. Every item collection screen is full of random nonsensical clutter, along with a fair amount of trick items that can only be found by assembling other pieces of clutter or finding a secret sub-screen within the main area. To the game's credit, finding these items is made far easier by the fact that complicated items are highlighted in the list. The game also has a better explanation for the clutter than most. After all, if this house really travels through time and space, who's to say what random garbage it might pick up?\n\nCriterion 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?\n\nNot especially. It's bog-standard design right down the line on this front. Players move through a series of screens, unlocking doors and solving simple puzzles (or skipping them with the aid of an extremely fair hint system) until they find that they're missing a certain item. Suddenly a previous area is bathed in a magical glow, and it's time to find that item! (Along with twenty other arbitrary knickknacks.) Not especially disappointing, but the developers certainly weren't going the extra mile this time around.\n\nCriterion 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?\n\nHouse of 1000 Doors is something of an odd case, since the story that the player finds themselves participating in has very little to do with the plot they're promised at the outset.\n\nAfter a chilling opening movie, the main character is contacted by a ghostly relative, and told that the only way to clear their family's name is to go to the house. So the player does, and finds herself tasked with traveling to the sites of a variety of murders\u2014all involving a tragic death in the past (some more gruesome than others)\u2014and solving puzzles to put the ghosts involved to a peaceful rest.\n\nThe bizarre part is that the main character's relative isn't mentioned. The nature of her scandal never comes up, and by the time the end of the game rolls around I'd almost forgotten what the point of the whole endeavor was supposed to be in the first place. It wasn't until the main character mentions in her final monologue that she'd gotten the evidence she needed to vindicate her ancestors that I was reminded of the game's purported storyline\u2014and mildly annoyed, since nothing like that had actually happened.\n\nAfter beating the game I discovered that the main story\u2014really the entire central plot of the game, is entirely dealt with and resolved in a bonus unlockable chapter that's included only in the \"collector's edition\" of the game. Luckily the publishers were kind enough to provide me with that version for review, but I worry that anyone playing the standard game would come away completely disappointed (and somewhat baffled) by the utter lack of a resolution.\n\nWith all the ghosts, murders, and tragic histories one would expect from a gothic melodrama, House of 1000 Doors does a great job of finding an eerie tone for the game and giving players a consistent level of challenge as they explore their way through it. It definitely loses marks for the bizarre mishandling of its plot, but beyond that, the mechanics are solid, and it's successful at everything else it attempts.", "timestamp_created": 1454836777, "timestamp_updated": 1454836777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20966518": {"recommendationid": "20966518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277633832", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464948311}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "so boring  \uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1454669231, "timestamp_updated": 1454669231, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20881616": {"recommendationid": "20881616", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977633085", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454268774}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a point and click hidden object game.

(Except for the bit where there weren't actually a thousand doors.  That would've been pretty awesome, though I guess more like a room escape game than a hidden object one.  Which is a genre-smush I didn't know I wanted until I just wrote that sentance, but wow.  Does it exist?  If it does, someone let me know!)\n\nPlots were terrible, but because there was a bunch of sub-plots tying into an overarching big plot, they didn't seem so bad - I mean, some things were are-you-SERIOUS?? level dumb, but that's pretty normal for the genre, so I can't dock it too much for that.  A few things that didn't come up AT ALL in the cutscenes but were actual vital parts of the plot, which you could only find out by reading the diary, though.  Made things kiiiinda confusing at times.  Devs, even if you're not going to invest in quality writing, just... don't do that.  It's a terrible mood.\n\nKeyword choices were also pretty good!  There were a few things I was ???? about that I think were just dialect differences, and a few reaaaally obscure terms (one I ended up googling, and the fourth or fifth result was a walkthrough for the game, soooo yeah, obscure), but there weren't any mistranslations or coding errors, which puts it a couple of steps above most games in the genre I've played.  There was one instance of having two things in a HO scene which were classified as $keyword, and only one counted, though.  That was pretty frustrating.\n\nMinigames were pretty good; nothing amazing, but nothing bad, just solid little puzzles.  Art was nice, VAing - well, terrible, but again, that's not unusual. A few places where I wasn't sure what to do next, but there was a map with action-avaliable highlighting and warping, so I could usually figure it out before too long.  There were a couple of places where you had to use a specific tool even though you had something else that would actually be better for it, or would work equally as well (pots of water being just as good to put out a fire as a bucket of water, for example), which was annoying but, again, pretty normal (and probably really hard to code differently unless you completely redesgined the entire game, to be fair).\n\nConclusion: solid game of its genre!", "timestamp_created": 1451654150, "timestamp_updated": 1451654150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20176011": {"recommendationid": "20176011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072549688", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451647495}, "language": "french", "review": "J'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 ce jeu.", "timestamp_created": 1451647547, "timestamp_updated": 1451647547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20105618": {"recommendationid": "20105618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040859498", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451459275}, "language": "english", "review": "5/5 Stars\n\n6 hours of enjoyable playtime.

However, I played the game on a mac first and it crashed often, it had a screen resolution bug which auto set my mac resolution to 4k at a non widescreen format with no option to change that. I played the entire game and endured the bugs and crashes only to find the cards did not drop. I then installed it on my PC and had to complete the entire game (3 hours on 2nd playthrough) a second time for the cards to finally drop. On PC there were no bugs for me. Overall the game took about 3-4 hours to complete and I was no longer enjoying it after about an hour or so. I do enjoy hidden object games, but this one didnt really do it for me. Stay away from this one if playing on a retina display mac is your only option. MAYBE pick it up in a bundle if you play on PC.\n\nPros:\nSome nice artwork. The backgrounds are nice.\nThe hidden object scenes are pretty well done often requiring several steps to repair or paint or uncover objects.\nSome of the puzzles are well done.\n\n\n\nCons:\nThe bugs on the mac version: resolution bug. game timer bug. crash to desktop bug. cards dont drop bug.\nsome pretty bad voice acting, or pretty bad script reading...can't really say acting.  Major con for me.\nrepitition of the same hidden object scenes \noveruse of hidden object scenes.

(All Big Fish collector's editions include strategy guides, bonus features, and extra chapters, so well worth the money spent.) One of things I like best about this particular HO game is trying to figure out where all the inventory items go.  Some items get picked and used later in a different unrelated \"adventure\" chapter, while others stay with the player for nearly the entire game and act as red herrings or McGuffins throughout.  Some of the puzzles at the start of the game are unsolvable and can only to be solved as the game progresses or near the end.  It tests the memory and creates \"ah-ha\" moments throughout the game as \"Oh that is where that item goes\" and \"Oh this is what I need to solve that puzzle\".  Of course the end is always satisfying (at least for me).  The \"boss\" (who or whatever it is) is easy to \"defeat\" and the overall storyline mystery is solved conclusively.

I don't know why, but the HOGs seem much more difficult than the ones in other games.  Plus, the \"go fetch\" puzzles needed to progress through the game seem much \"deeper\" than I've run into (some run from almost the beginning areas of the game to near the end).  Also, this is my first HOG without Achievements.  I expected not to like that.  But, it turns out to be more rewarding to just play the game instead of worrying if some stray mouse click or publisher design decision will lock me out of an Achievement until I make a second run through the game.\n\nAs far as mild negatives:\n\n- the \"story\" feels like it's picking up in the middle (perhaps this is a sequel?),\n- there are two or three instances where an object you've found is not the object you're looking for (i.e., you need a lantern, but the one you've found isn't the right one).\n- the HOGs all contain objects that are hidden, but they're not color-coded as being hidden (objects that have to be manipulated or are physically hidden are textually red, but those that are in a container that just needs to be looked into are textually black).\n\nOther than that, it's pretty much standard HOG fare:  decent graphics, acceptable voice acting, tolerable story.  I got about 7.3 hours of game play out of the main game, and an additional 2.3 hours out of the Bonus Chapter (totaling 9.6 hours).  So, I'd say the list price is pretty close to being worth it.  But, as usual, look for a deal (right now, there's a Sinister Stories Bundle (that includes this game) that costs less than just the list price of this one game).

You're a young woman, lost in a mysterious manor that appeared suddenly. In your way to find the mysteries of it, you'll meet the inhabitants... and understand why it's called the House of 1000 doors... as they're appearing and disappearing...\n\nI'm redoing the review as I've replayed the game, which is part of the House of Stark 6-in-1 Bundle, with the Snark Busters Trilogy and three (out of four) games in the House of 1000 Doors series.\n\nThe story in itself has no real goal but to wander around and help the residents to finish their tasks or to relieve them (Sammy, Chloe and Amanda are all being disturbed by something). However, the mystery in itself is in reality a test and a choice that Kate, the protagonist, has to make. The bonus chapter is the return of the manor and a request from Margaret Fox, Kate's grandmother.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty standard: find items around, use them, solve puzzles (they're really easy apart for one), clear hidden objects scenes (I must say that you don't have many of them and that the developpers recycled some scenes up until 5 times at least). As I've already said, everything is easy, even the hunt for beyond objects as they're easily spot thanks to a change of shape of the cursor. It didn't prevent me to miss some of them as they were in close-up scenes (meaning that some locations had two instead of one).\n\nWhile the graphics in the cutscenes are average, I liked however the rest of the game as the scenes are really well done. The soundtrack is also very enjoyable.\n\nTrue, the game isn't any Artifex Mundi developed but it could be easily included in their publishing catalogue.

This is where some games get extremely tiresome, with endless back-and-forth travel, but with the jump feature (which has no cooldown and can be used over and over) the game avoids that mindless \"travel for eighteen screens to get an item and then backtrack another twenty screens to use it\" problem that can ruin the experience.\n\nI clocked in at around five hours of gameplay including the bonus chapter.

It plays like a mixture between classical point and click adventure and HOG, the HOG Part though has not the impact that often goes with such games.\n\nThe game plays very casual, which is in fact quite refreshing if you played a game with a lot of heavy thinking for days over. The HOGs are very good rendered and localisation was done by people who are in knowledgeable (ever had the trouble finding a piece because you didn't know what the description really meant? I had it on some of those games.), voice acting in the in game cutting scenes was also quite good - only on the bonus part there was some glitch in one of the voice-actors part. \n\nThe riddles are easy, sometimes way too easy - but that isn't really bothersome, because the side-stories in the game make up for this. \n\nThe graphics are good, well rendered. The HOGs work perfectly into the game, and the searchables are very easy to distinguish and find - though not too easy, you still have to search the whole scene for some items to find them. \n\nI can recomend this game on my own game experience, it is good for some relaxing hours. Though the price of 9,99 \u20ac seems a bit high for this kind of genre.

Item-based puzzles (find objects, then use them to solve various tasks).  Most of the solutions are fairly straightforward, although it is easy to miss items if you are not being thorough.  My only issue was the game's level of redundancy (i.e. needing two different buckets of water, a million keys, etc.)\n2. Traditional hidden object screens of the \"pile of junk that doesn't really belong together\" variety.  These were challenging, but never frustrating; the artwork was clear, the labels were accurate, and items were overlapping but not obfuscated.  I would actually say these were some of the best HOG puzzles I have seen in recent memory.\n3. Bonus hidden \"beyond\" objects that appear in the background art.  There are 35 total to find in the main game (approximately one per screen).\n4. A handful of incredibly easy mini-games (rotating discs, dragging lines, rearranging components, etc.) that provide a break from the main gameplay.  Some of these felt like remedial versions of classic genre mini-games, although others were new and creative.  Unlike other HOGs I've played recently, the mini-games complimented, rather than overshadowed, the hidden object sections.\n\nThere is quite a bit of backtracking, but since there aren't that many screens it doesn't feel like a slog.  There isn't even a map because you really don't need one.\n\nOne thing I found surprising is the fact there is only one level of difficulty (medium).  The game is very casual, with good puzzle feedback, a hint system that points you in the right direction if you need a nudge, and a built-in walkthrough (including all \"beyond\" locations) if you need a push.\n\nA note to the faint of heart: the game does contain blood smears and references to death; however there isn't any on-screen violence, nor are there any jump scares.\n\nWhat I wished this game had done better:\n- Most of the voice acting is atrocious.  \n- The plot gets a bit lazy and convoluted at times, with the maguffin being almost forgot about during the main game (they do explore it in the bonus mission).  It just seems like they wrote off any inconsistencies with \"because ghost house.\"\n- There is no incentive to find all the \"beyond\" objects other than personal pride.  Other games I've played will let you unlock either gallery images or additional backstory notes.\n\nOverall, I would give this game an 8/10.  The story might not be the best, but the puzzles are strong and plentiful, and the atmosphere is satisfactorily creepy.

Remember those Highlights magazines or I Spy books as a kid? Its kind of like those, but throw in some puzzles too. Its nothing too hard though. So if you are looking for adventure or a challenge I'd say look elsewhere for this is for those who enjoy the journey and story and its not how fast you can get through to the end. What it is, is simple problem solving and a whole lot of finding things that are hidden beyond others.\n\nTo put it simple it's a Point & Click. You go about the house pointing and clicking, sometimes \"dragging\" (rarely). Most doors and objects of intrest are locked. Sometimes you can go and find the key, other times you play a mini Hidden Object game (which you can hop in & out of fairly easily without losing what you found so far, which is a plus). Upon completing the mini HO game you are always awarded a object that you will need (its worth noting: usually the object awarded in question is one of the objects found in the mini game). Aside from the hidden objects sprawled about the house, there is a great deal of puzzles that must be solved to obtain other items of intrest. Also there is a tie-in with ghosts and such; you help ghosts sovle mysteries based upon themselves. In doing so, you resolve their need to be at peace.\n\nSuch is how this game is played. I find it soothing. Relaxing. A quaint little title (or not so little, but still) It's not an adventure, its an experience.

If this sounds interesting to you then it\u2019s time for you to play [i]House of a 1,000 Doors: Family Secrets[/i]! Step into the shoes of Kate Reed as she visits the house to clear the good name of one of her ancestors, only to be introduced to life-altering supernatural experiences. It\u2019s up to Kate to help the residents of the house and make her way out before she becomes one herself.\n\nThe story starts you off by saying Kate has to go to the house to clear the name of her ancestor, Margaret Fox; however, most of the game is spent instead helping ghosts and residents of the house. Many of the ghosts you help have met tragic ends and can\u2019t pass on without your aid. Despite having nothing to do with the main reason you went to the house, I found each story very interesting as well as the characters you meet. In fact, the game is full of a large cast of colorful folk except for Kate; despite being the protagonist, [b]Kate is very dry and unrelatable[/b]. Another issue I had with the story is that it isn\u2019t really given a proper wrap up until the bonus chapter. The entire main game is spent helping others with little to no mention of Margaret Fox until the epilogue and you don\u2019t get to know more about her until the bonus chapter which is odd for a game about \u201cfamily secrets.\u201d If you\u2019re playing a version of the game without the bonus chapter the story might even seem incomplete to you. The story of the main game seems more about Kate proving to Gabriel, the mysterious caretaker of the house, that she has what it takes to join the residents and live there permanently.\n\nMinor complaints aside, the story is well done and fun. The game is also a very solid hidden object title, offering many scenes as well as some mini games. Most scenes will be played twice, however some get hit three times and a certain one even four or five thanks to the bonus chapter. I personally [b]dislike when a hidden object scene is used more than twice[/b], you get too used to it and where the objects are. Another thing I disliked was the lack of a map; this game was very backtrack heavy and it was time consuming and slightly irritating without a map. Aside from those two points, I highly enjoyed the game. Voice acting wasn\u2019t bad and the music was nice as well though the game could have used a bit more variety in that department.\n\nA game so good I played it twice, a good addition to your collection of hidden object games. The length is solid, about four hours with the bonus chapter and it isn\u2019t too difficult. The [b]puzzles ranged from easy to moderate[/b] usually but there are no achievements so if you\u2019re ever stuck you can always skip. There also semi-hidden items called \u201cbeyond objects\u201d to find around the game, you can try to collect them all for fun. The game does have trading cards, however, so if you\u2019re a collector of badges you\u2019re in luck. [i]House of 1,000 Doors: Family Secrets[/i] isn\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s an overall good experience that I recommend giving a try.\n\n[url=http://lunarproductions.tumblr.com/]Lunar Productions[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1415093101, "timestamp_updated": 1457069635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12769315": {"recommendationid": "12769315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013718483", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415263371}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want to play eye spy 800 times in a row then buy this", "timestamp_created": 1415055665, "timestamp_updated": 1415055665, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433140", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12763828": {"recommendationid": "12763828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033999999", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414982623}, "language": "english", "review": "While the acting is nothing special, and the in-game cutscenes look a little old school (for want of a better word), it has a genuinely interesting concept and I really wanted to see where it went.

Partially this was a matter of game mechanics.  (For example, hiding objects inside of objects, or having to repair or transform them for them to 'count' for your search.  Half the time this was figuring out the hotspots within the puzzle screen, and less about actually seeing a hidden pattern inside of a larger picture.)  \n\n[Update:  I recommend other users play this on 'Casual' difficulty setting, as this will minimize the interface level issues.]\n\nHowever, I really did get into the whole idea of the House of 1000 Doors itself.  That part tying the whole game together across space/time/afterlife was very interesting.\n\nThere were aspects of the quest/story that just went ... nowhere.  (i.e. What are the Beyond Objects for, and why can't I see my progres, or lack thereof, anywhere within the game interface?)  The original game ramps you up to make an interesting choice, and then suddenly ENDS ... without actually giving you an oppurtunity to choose your final outcome at all!\n\nHowever, I did really enjoy the Collectors Edition content.  (Extra Chapter/Myster to solve, Strategy Guide included with game, and Wallpapers, etc.)\n\nI recommend the original game at 3/5 Stars, but I'll give it an extra star with the Strategy Guide, etc. contect included.  It was enjoyable, and I did play it all the way through, but it was not compelling!  I was slightly disappointed, even for a casual/hidden objects genre game.\n\nFinal Rating:  4/5 Stars  (With Collectors Edition content bonus)\n\nValue for price?  I think this is worth the $10, but this is definitely a game I'd recommend if you can catch it during a Steam Sale.\n\nUpdate:  I did NOT consider the value of the Steam Collectible Card drops when I originally reviewed this.  If you merely trade them away for cash in your Steam Wallet, these are worth $1-$3, each [at the time I sold mine].  Expect up to 3 to drop while you play this game.

When I say several, I mean like.. eleven weeks. This has given me a lot of time to process.\n\nYes, I received this game from PR -- but that's never really mattered to me when it came to being critical. Visual Novels nowadays seem rather pedantic and they almost seem built to be cheap little one-man-shows where the writer monologues you until you're passing out from the pretentiousness.\n\nThis game is not that. In fact, this game is written with such a love for comedy and yet realistic drama which is wrapped around a fantasy story in which a girl kisses animals and sprouts enchanted young men. The artwork is close to the chest and done with an innocent love for these characters. It's bright, it's darling and not even remotely your typical fare. If you can get past some of the repetetive explanations of their plight to each new character they encounter, Animal Lover will take you on an emotional journey on getting to know people outside of your typical comfort zones.\n\nThe lead character grows before your eyes, which is thanks to the writer and those characters that look so light-hearted and cute, start to develop slowly but surely as you fight your way through this complicated situation thrust upon an everyday person.\n\nSo, if you have several hours to devote to dialogue that Kevin Smith would salivate over and you want artwork that is endearingly sweet and perfected for their story -- get this game. Get this game, mull over its many choices and its romances and then share it with your friends. \n\nTL;DR -- I played Dream Daddy for four hours and never went back.

The art was good, the music was well placed, and it was well written. I wish it could have touched on the romance aspect a bit more, because what I did get I liked. It dealt with complicated issues in a manner that I felt was pretty respectful. There were some times when I was a little dubious, but there were no major issues. Honestly, the way it handled the main antagonist was much better than I was expecting. I kind of held my breath the entire way there in the first play through, and there were some routes I was more satisfied with how it was handled than others, but that's just part of playing a multi-ending visual novel. \n\nI enjoyed the voice the character was given and the chance to make so many choices. Normally it annoys me if there are many choices that don't really impact the outcome of the game, but it felt like it gave life to the protagonist and I liked that I didn't always have to agree with the boys to have them like me. A lot of this game builds up a friendly rapport and allows you to get comfortable with everyone before making a final choice. You also get to see a lot of interaction between characters outside the protagonist and their chosen love interest, which I enjoyed. I have some issues with the way Charlie was handled, but I think part of it is me wishing I enjoyed him more as a character. [spoiler]Personal opinion is that his was definitely the most lackluster route and the least satisfying. I was actually pretty annoyed with the way he handled his personal conflicts. [/spoiler]\n\nTLDR: Overall, this is a great game, and I'd really recommend it. Good art, music, writing. Nice plot that delves into deeper  issues pretty well. A lot of interaction with the characters, but not a lot of romance.\n\n\nEdit Edit: [spoiler] JK, apparently they all can confess and I was just consistently saying all the wrong things. So that pretty much clears that issue up.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]I get that the antagonist is handling things really poorly, but it just sort of bothers me that... there's no real way to help her move past it or feel better? Like, I understand why the narrative is the way it is. It's just, I wish that, because of all she's gone through, there was some real comfort for her at the end. And it really bothers me that the only ending where she gets that comfort is through like, continued male violence, and like... against her will.

Plus, it does a good job in keeping you invested in learning the truth of it all.\nYet, I found after I played through one route completely, I mainly just skipped through everything to get the other route's endings. Which made it not as good as going through it the first time. It just didn't seem like there was much of any extra content between the routes. Just a few different conversations.

First things first, this game is hilarious. The dialogue and banter between the characters is so wonderfully hammy and ridiculous that it never failed to put a big smile on my face. The characters are all written in a very realistic manner. Each character is from a different time period, and the writers took great cares to make sure that they all felt like they truly were from those times. It touches upon some of the events during those time periods that effects the characters and their perceptions today, such as stigmas against sexuality, or sexual harrassment. The game balances a perfect blend of funny and serious, and excels at both without dropping the quality of one or the other. I sincerely love this game, though it is not without its faults. For one thing, the characters swear a LOT. If you don't care for a ton of swearing in games, this might not be for you. Furthermore, the game more or less follows one plotline throughout the routes, so once you play one route, you'll be repeating a few steps each route. It's not as bad the first couple of times, but can get kind of annoying the 4th or 5th time through. The art style can take some getting used to, though I personally don't find it disagreeable, I know some others dislike the cartoony look. Finally, the game sports a tiny amount of CGs, I believe it is like 2 or 3 route exclusive ones per route, which is rather small. It isn't terrible, but it's something to watch out for if you're bothered by that kind of thing. All in all, I believe that the game is still a wonderful, enjoyable time that manages to be thought provoking and touches upon many issues that aren't explored in many games. I believe that the biggest thing that makes me truly believe in it is that it touches upon forgiveness. Many of the characters have done wrong in the past, and these actions eventually come to light in the route, and each of the characters are forced to face this ugly wrongdoing head on. It's up to the player whether they want to forgive the person or not, and I think that that is a very poignant story device that is fitting in today's world, with so many people who scrutinize others to such extreme degrees that they refuse forgiveness in any shape or form. It is truly thought provoking and is a fantastic examination of today's social landscape.

They hang out and bond (or fight) when you're not there either, so they don't feel like characters who're solely dependant on the main girl for character development. What a breath of fresh air!\n\nPROS\n-Excellent writing and hearty storyline\n-Engaging characters and dialogue\n-Characters displaced from different decades!\n-Dope references!\n-Believable and multi-faceted characters and MC - everyone goes through doubts, stresses, and funtimes so nobody feels one-dimensional <3\n-Appealing character designs!\n-THICC BOYS yaaaaassss\n\nCONS\n-Jesus christ, that title... Animal Lover sounds cringy as hell.\n-Not a fan of the logo! \n-Sometimes the art is meh (but more often than not, it's great)\n-Personally, I didn't like the MC's design as much as everyone else?\n-Despite the excellent plot, most of the guys' endings follow the same storyline, so for the most part you get a very similar experience going with one dude (it only really branches off into husbando territories near the end)\n\nAnyways, I had a lot of fun with this one!

It is the consequence of humanity. We are all formed of frailty and error; let us pardon reciprocally each other's folly - that is the first law of nature. - Voltaire[/b]\n\nBacked by a small populace, developed by a trio of people who makes up the whole team of Trainwreck Studios and coming into heavily Asian dominated market of otome games during February this year, [i]Animal Lover[/i] is one of the best in the genre in means of realistic interaction, narrative and character build that I've ever encountered. It is refreshing enough to encounter an indie otome game developed by an American Team, but the product itself ended up well beyond my expectations.\n\nOur protagonist is an ordinary Jane named Lucy - or whatever you decided to call her. She is interning at a local vet clinic before college during her soon to be the longest summer ever. As Lucy has been receiving messages for the doctor, a small girl and her mother appear with a hamster cage, which includes the sweet, tiny rodent. While picking up the animal Lucy absentmindedly kisses it, which results the little guy instantaneously turning into a charming, handsome young man! As the family flees away in terror, Lucy manages to hide this weird man from the doctor. So, this is how she meets Edmund - the first of quite a many endearing fellow a witch once cursed with animal forms. She and Edmund start looking around town to recruit other unfortunate transmuted souls to eventually find a permenant way to break their curse. In the meanwhile, Lucy and all these fine gentlemen become some sort of an involuntary family, having moments grand, absurd and heart wrecking all together. At the end of the summer, nothing will be the same for either Lucy or any of her beaus.\n\nIntriguing? Yeah, but the scenario isn't the best part of this whole lovely chaos. Both the atmosphere and characters themselves are exceedingly well-written, containing genuine character depth, with flaws, eccentricities, insecurities, endearments, hobbies, philosophies and quirks. These boys are not your stereotypical charming princes, or dangerous bad boys. They do not fit into stereotypes. You can feel that they are real people with backgrounds, worries and character traits in every sentence coming from them. None of them are exceedingly pretty or unrealistically head over heels in love with the protagonist either. Sure, the game is an otome but the flirting doesn't dominate the whole game like many other games in the market. As the storyline itself proceeds, you witness your relationship with the man of your choice improve naturally. It's as if you getting together with one of these guys is not the aim, but a pleasant side effect of all these absurd chain of events - which is ten thousand times more realistic compared to any Asian otome I've seen in the market. In the same way, our protagonist is not the surrealistically perfect Barbie doll with dubious choices and questionable taste in men which we commonly encounter in the otome genre. Lucy is down to earth, smart, and realistic. She has her nervous moments, her principals and her own quirks. She isn't portrayed as a super sexy or ephemeral beauty. She is ordinary looking, short for her age and even chubby. She is one of the most realistic female leads that I've ever seen in this genre.\n\nIf there is one thing that didn't satisfy me in this game, it was the limited number of artworks. Sure, character sprites were really various in expressions, but there were only 2 CGs per route - which is a tad bit limited for my taste. Still, artwork not becoming a medium of fan service in an otome was refreshing. All characters involved are cute enough, but not fairytale depictions of some tropes. It was all sweet and appropriate for the tone of the game.\n\nCan I say anything else at this point? Nah, not really. The game is worthy of the full price with the amount of fun you are getting and the playtime you will be putting into this one. The hamster, the cat, the ferret, the dog or... the bear! Pick whichever you like, I bet they'll surprise you in good, bad and dazzling ways.

I've managed to get \"good\" endings for all the guys, although I haven't yet looked into whether the \"canon ending\" is only possible with one particular guy or if there's a version of it for each of them. (Edit: After looking through the Discussion area, I'm thinking the canon ending is only for that one character, which I'm cool with since I loved him.)\n\nPros:\n- This isn't one of those stat raising visual novels - there are decision points where you have to choose between different actions and dialogue and that's it, thank goodness. \n- There were some nice funny moments.\n- The heroine wasn't a wet washcloth with no personality.\n- I actually kind of liked all the guys, although I did develop some strong favorites. My most unexpected favorite: Kyle.\n- I'm probably in the minority here, but I'm kind of glad the romance in this was just limited to talking, a date, and kiss here and there - no sex, even fade-to-black.\n\nCons:\n- It takes a long time for the heroine to find and transform all five guys. Way longer than I thought it would. Also, if you go into this expecting it to be a dating sim, be prepared for it to also take ages for anything like a date to happen. Maybe two thirds of the game?\n- I wasn't a fan of the art style, although it eventually grew on me.\n- No art gallery. If you have particular scenes you like, you'll need to take a screenshot.\n- The whole \"trying to figure out how to change the guys back to human for good\" story felt surprisingly calm and unrushed. I was a little surprised there weren't more emotionally charged moments, considering that these guys were never going to get back the lives they used to have. Sure, there were jokes about Frankie having trouble believing in the existence of the internet and whatnot, but most of the guys took things really, really well.

I've never really written a review before but this game has stuck with me through the past few days and I can't help myself any longer.\n\nAnimal Lover is an enchanting story with an interesting twist as well as moments I couldn't help myself grinning. I was excited for the game a long time before it was released, always a sucker for a concept involving attractive bachelors and animals. Who isn't? When I saw the game on Steam I hopped on the chance to get it, I already had my eyes on a few of these lovely beasts.\n\nThe story is great. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found myself smiling quite a lot during the story and admittedly it got me laughing. It's nothing too thick and hefty but it catches your interest enough to keep you along for the ride. I will admit I would've liked for the routes to change a bit in terms of writing ( I get a bit uninterest when I have to skip large amounts of text I've already read over and over and over just to do another route ) but for the small bits I did get with each boy I have to say I was able to over look it. Not to mention I'm sure there were reasons behind it, be it time restraints or what not.\n\nThe characters are absolutely charming. I don't know what it is but I got so attached to each and every one of them. I was charmed by Edmund INSTANTLY. The little bugger got me good, the rest naturally were the same. Each one has their quirk and admittedly I love the difference between each one.  Poor Frankie being teased for his lingo was a big guilty pleasure.\n\nI also actually really enjoyed the art for the characters! Being a stickler for anatomy I really was pleased with the animals and the boys themselves have a charming art style I can't help loving. I really really enjoyed the extra details to the designs of the characters like Kyle's hair color and markings, Miguel's hair instantly made me think of a husky, Frankie's \"whiskers\" etc etc. I especially loved that tidbit. The backgrounds weren't AS nice but not enough to bother me much.  10/10 censor method btw\n\nAll in all I would definitely recommend the game and I'm admittedly going for a second round haha.

It's been awhile since I've actually felt so connected and emotional over characters in a vn and it was so refreshing. Each guy and their story is heartwarming and I literally got butterflies in my stomach throughout the game from all the sweet tender moments the MC experiences with each guy.

Well fuck you, too!\".  The main plot stays the same regardless who you end up with and most of the same scenes happen in all plays but I don't think that's a bad thing.  I liked it, in fact, because it felt as if I wasn't judged for the route I was on at the time.\nIn terms of characters, I fucking love them all.  The romance characters are all really nice, with pros and cons to each of them.  The antagonist's actions, while not exactly justified [spoiler] (like dude, teleport them away or make them forget you, don't fucking curse them lmao) [/spoiler] didn't feel unneeded and the characters repented when they did something wrong which is something too commonly overlooked in romance games (like when the player is forced to go \"oh I love you therefore you can do no wrong!!\", no, in this, the characters actually acknowledge they did wrong and I love that).\nLegit my ownly issue with the game is that it's tagged with 'sexual content' and there isn't any, haha.

Having characters who talk, act and feel real is incredibly important, no matter the gender, and that's why I love Animal Lover so much.  Sure, the story is fantastically silly, but the characters Trainwreck Studios created are all people I've come to love, even the ones I was sure I'd hate on first glance.  \n\nAnimal Lover is one of the most well-written VNs I've read in a LONG time. Granted, the plot isn't complex or deep, and things start off slow in the beginning, but the characters are amazing. Each guy has his own unique and distinct personality, and watching them interact with each other and the MC is pure joy. In the short time I've spent in game, I feel like I know them personally; and having come to the end of my journey with the gang, I'm heartbroken with how much I'm going miss them all. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=865841921\nThat's to say nothing of the humor which is absolutely hilarious. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard reading a VN before (the Truth or Dare hot tub scene is comedy gold). That doesn't mean things don't get serious, and some pretty heavy themes are worked in towards the end, but it's all good stuff. The romance isn't overblown either. Some may think it's a little light on feels, but once the relationship between Lucy and her guy starts blossoming, it's really sweetly done. I'd go far as to say this is one of the few otome titles that may be just as enjoyable for guys as it for us girls as the characters are so well developed that there's plenty to relate to even if you're not of the female persuasion. \n\nAnd then there's Lucy, who's probably my favorite otome protagonist to date.  She's smart, funny, caring, and courageous (even though she may be scared as heck), but most of all, she's realistically feminine.  No, she's not going to let these guys walk all over her, but she's not too hardened to be the  emotional anchor they need, and I find that lovely.   She's also not a pixie with a 2 inch waist!  It's about damn time, y'all!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=869114993\nThe game isn't perfect, however. I'd have loved a few more CGs, as the 2 per route is on the skimpy side. It's not a deal breaker as the writing more than makes up for it, but a little more artwork would have been appreciated. It's also a bit short, taking only 17 hours to fully complete (and I'm a slow reader), but those 17 hours were so enjoyable that I'm really not complaining, I just want more time with these guys cause I love them so damn much. My biggest gripe is the Skip function, which is buggy and a pain to work with. You have to be careful with its use or you run the risk of skipping right on past unread dialogue even though everything is set correctly in the options. Most of the game is common route, so you're not likely to miss too much, but it's still a hassle making sure you don't end up skipping past certain key scenes where major dialogue changes occur (the date chapter, Edmund's intervention, and the final confrontation with Aadara). Still, I'll take that bit of frustration over not experiencing the game at all.\n\nSmall issues aside, I cannot express enough how much I love Animal Lover.  It may not be THE perfect VN, but the characters it's given me places it high on my list of favorite otome games.  The price may be a little daunting, especially for a visual novel, but I promise you the amount of entertainment you'll receive from this gem is more than worth the cost of admission.\n\nNOTE: I was a Kickstarter backer, so my review doesn't count towards the average game rating since I received a key for it.

I'll admit I was very skeptical with the title at first since the whole animal/human combo character (or whatever you want to call them) aren't really my schtick. But the price was right, I had the money in my wallet, why not. \n\nThe pacing of the game is something that is pretty slow, but not in a bad way. From what I can tell the game isn't necessarily  divided into traditional routes, where you make decisions and then spend 99% of the time with your chosen character for the rest of game. Honestly, the game itself reads more as a story of these six strangers who come together through the weirdest of circumstances and how they basically become a sort of support/family unit. The romance is still definitely there, that's just my opinion on the matter.\n\nOne thing I really want to gush about is the MC. Oh. My. Gosh. She is WONDERFUL. Like the way the devs wrote her she feels so real? And there were things about her that I could specifically identify with or one of the choices that she could make was exactly what I was thinking. She actually has a personality and emotions. She gets mad, sad, annoyed, embarrassed. She acts strong but also has moments of weakness, she's an actual character. And it's just....so fricking wonderful. \n\nThe other characters are all amazing as well, all the boys are distinctly different with their backgrounds and personalities. I'm really excited to read through the other routes and see what else is going on with them. Although, I'll be honest Miguel already holds the number one spot in my heart. It's gonna be darn near impossible to top that. \n\nThe other important aspect of any VN, the story. Like I said, the pacing is a little slow, but it works. These characters have to take things a day or two at a time. While the plot isn't realistic, the pacing is. I never really found myself bored, there was always a new interested side character or plot moment around the corner to keep me intrigued. \n\nIf you're a skeptic because of the title like me, trust the devs that that isn't what the game is.

Not because it has an ingenious plot or some sort of breakthrough on the technical side--both of those are pretty average and have their flaws, actually. What shines in this game are the characters. From their designs (can I just love how diverse their faces and body types are???) to their personalities and backgrounds and dialogue, everything makes them feel genuine and well-rounded. I swear, I came to this game for the fun and memes, and was completely swept off my feet by these stupid, funny, cute, INCREDIBLY LOVEABLE CHARACTERS. \n\nAnd because I loved these wankers so much, rather than listing \"cons\" to the game, I'll call them \"suggestions\". My suggestions for improvement are:\n- Some lines of dialogue are said twice in a row with very minor changes in wording. I assume that's because they were in the \"common\" part of the route, but [i]also[/i] inserted onto the specific scenario that followed whatever choice you just made. It didn't happen that much, but it felt really off. Maybe it would be better to just erase the \"common route\" line and tweak wording a wee bit for each character route.\n- Speaking of which, there are a few instances in which your guy of choice says something, and that something is THE EXACT SAME for every single guy. I think it would be better to change this a little to match each character's voice and personality more--for instance, it is very strange, to me, seeing Frankie and Miguel word something the exact same way in their respective routes. Because besides their mannerisms, their views are also quite different. Some guys are more sensible or insightful than others, so seeing them all make the exact same comment at one point feels strange.\n- A couple more CGs would be nice. For instance, maybe we could get one when Lucy goes out with her current guy during \"Alone Time\". The art in this game is lovely and I really wish we could get more of it.\n- More route-specific interaction would be great! Maybe just one or two more occasions to hang out, or a few more conversations Lucy could have with her guy of choice, etc. I feel like there isn't that much emphasis on the particular character you're going for, as most of the game is still \"common route\", and this makes the romance feel a little rushed.\n- IT'S TOO SHORT!! Okay, you guys may think my playtime [EDIT: which was 12 hours by the time I wrote this review, but I then re-played it] is enough for a visual novel, but trust me, IT'S DEFINITELY NOT. And I know this was released just this week, but I REALLY REALLY HOPE the devs eventually decide to release some sort of DLC, sequel, fandisk, WHATEVER. Just some more material with these guys (and Lucy, because she's an excellent MC), because I honestly haven't gotten enough of them and will gladly throw my money at whatever the devs come up with involving the same cast.\n\nBottom line: this is an excellent game because of its funny dialogue; endearing, well-written characters; and lovely relationships (not just between MC and the guys, but also the friendship that the boys develop).

(I will update this once I do finish). I am ON THE FENCE with this VN even though I said it was one of the better otomes I dislike how its repetitive for each guy...there is no difference between the routes except for who you end up with. (Buy this game when it is ON SALE)\n\nAlthough this is not on Mystic Messenger level of awesomeness, I do believe this VN is good. It is not short. It has some depth and characters respond in a more natural way that you would expect them too. The MC is NOT your average otome VN character. The MC has spunk and is not afraid to tell one of the guys to BLEEP off if they are being kind of jerky. This is rather refreshing as many times the MC is bland, submissive, and does not have an original thought other than: \"He kissed me...but am still unsure of his feelings.\" There is actual progression in relationships between the MC and the five guys. I like this as you do not just wake up one day head over heels in love with some guy for no reason other than the fact that he is hot (or rich...or both, really). \n\nPROS: \n-artwork (very different than your everyday VN)\n-music\n-storyline/plot\n-length (It is not short. Too often I shell out $20 and I can finish all story routes within an incredibly too short of time)\n\n\nCONS:\n-CHOICES...really dont matter except for who you end up with. For example in some VNs for whichever guy you choose you get a whole different story. Not so with this VN, its the same story for each one, which is kind of boring. The only difference for each \"route\" is who you end up with.

The story is exciting, the art is beautiful, and the programming is fantastic. It certainly fills the requirements for an otome game, and it adds on something extra. The romance in this game is slow burning; you take time to learn about each interest, and the building relationship is gradual. Nothing feels rushed, and this makes the game feel realistic (magical animal boys aside). And if steamy love really isn't your whole cuppa, that's fine. Animal Lover is much more than a dating simulator. It has story that goes beyond trying to smooch some guys.\n\nThe characters in this game are multidimensional, with many of their own flaws and quirks. Not one is that perfect dream guy, as much as some of them may seem to be. They make mistakes, they get angry, and they cry. These guys are REALISTIC. They're going to probably mess up, and it's up to you, the player, to help them.\n\nA good dating simulator wouldn't be good without an artist behind it all to make these guys total babes. The art for this game is clean and stylish, and there's so much diversity between each of the characters. Not to mention there are some pretty funny expressions, giving the boys another level of realism.\n\nOverall, this is a very good game.

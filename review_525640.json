Move your hands the wrong way or look a certain way and the screen just goes black until you move back to a stationary and central position directly facing your sensors.

The shooting mechanics are spot-on, and I love the feature that allows you to pick your weapon from the ground without the need to kneel down physically.\nIt's got a lot of game modes too, both for single player and multi, and some of them are really awesome. \nThe fact that it has a level editor and Workshop support just tops the cake, with some great additions made by the community.\nThe only downsides are low server population, and some poorly designed and textured levels, but it's understandable in an early access with so much content and only one developer. In fact, I'm amazed at the level of content and quality he's been able to pull off alone.\nI'm convinced that the sheer fun you have in this game will bring more people online.

The light controller vibration to let you know where to holster the gun without looking when running for your life. Getting the perfect spectator angle on the final kill of the game and laughing manically in heaven with all the other ghosts hovering around.\n\n-Not just Battle Royale!

A lot of maps (some include vehicles) and game modes to choose from. Lots of different weapons with attention to detail and excellent gunplay to go with them. The scene editor is fun to play with to create your own maps and scenarios. If PVP isn't for you there is also bot matches, target ranges, a survival-horror wave defense game mode, and holo-gun, which is a score attack against waves of blocks that shoot back at you after you shoot them. Support for the game is great as well, constant content updates and bug fixes. There is definitely enough variety to keep you entertained and at a good price. There are a few down sides that go with it. Some of the visuals can be a little basic (detail on weapons is great as well as a few maps), but not bad and do not take away from the game. Also a somewhat small player base (recently got a good boost from the introduction of the Battle Royale game mode), but in my experience, there is always at least one or two games going.

From the moment I saw Pavlov, I figured [Pavlov] was a much better fit for me, and judging from online footage, the visuals and audio certainly needed work in BAM's earlier versions.  In a surprise twist, Bullets and More is by far my favorite VR game, topping everything from Robo Recall to H3VR.  I really didn't expect to say that any time soon, but seven hours of BAM later, I regret not buying this sooner.  I bought Pavlov a few weeks ago, and while it was plenty of fun, the lack of variety got to me in the end.  I'll still check in from time to time, but it really needs some more content to be something I could play regularly.\n\nBAM, on the other hand... well, it blew away my expectations in every regard.  The developer is highly active and trying many new things with the base game, adding all sorts of modes.  Multiplayer lobbies end up feeling highly connected, with the 5-12 players you may encounter frequently communicating or talking about just about anything, as the match voting system seamlessly has everyone moving on in a minute.  The handling mechanics feel accurate yet accessible to new players, there's a wide variety of training areas and singleplayer content to get a new player ready for online, and there's several game modes to pick from with exponentially more maps.  I paid $15, and the amount of high-quality content here is absurd.\n\nNow, let's backtrack to accessibility.  You have a wide variety of options depending on your setup, regardless of which HMD you went with.  Oculus Touch and HTC Vive are both supported very well.  You have access to several different locomotion options as well; Oculus-friendly snap-turning, choppy teleportation, JOYSTICK MOVEMENT (thank you), and even some experimental \"gamepad\" support for peripherals can be enabled freely.  Pretty much every VR-related option you could ask for is present and accounted for, and all in working order with control layouts that make sense.\n\nI just want to make this clear: I'm going to bash the game in the next paragraph.  It really isn't a big deal, but I just want to get this out of the way.  Don't listen.  Buy it anyway.\n\nALL THE CRAP YOU SHOULDN'T READ:\n=====\nFirst of all, there's a pretty huge visual difference between the two titles.  Pavlov runs on Unreal Engine 4, and visually, it's quite nice.  Nothing incredible, but visuals are serviceable and optimization is generally fine.  BAM, on the other hand... well, it's a Unity game, and the visual quality can vary quite a bit.  Some maps end up being far more demanding than others, and in some of the more proof-of-concept type maps, the graphics are just awful, with small texture tiles and flat \"grass\" surfaces galore.  The gun sounds are generally good, but some of the more powerful weapons end up sounding very flat.  It's jarring coming from any AAA title, and [i]especially[/i] rough coming from H3VR, but hopefully they'll be addressed.\n\nOverall, it's not the worst thing in the world.  A lot of it is just me coming from other VR games, namely H3VR's highly refined/authentic audio presentation and Pavlov's clean UE4 visuals.\n=====\nSTART READING AGAIN\n\nOverall, BAM VR is a must have.  It'd be dishonest for me to say anything otherwise.  If you don't own an HMD yet, this is the kind of killer app that would make the Oculus Rift + Touch worth its price of admission alone.", "timestamp_created": 1509045046, "timestamp_updated": 1511381783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35955341": {"recommendationid": "35955341", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967083106", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1515390152}, "language": "english", "review": "this one does it all.

I must be gratified by the visuals of every bullet, whether it impacts the opponent or a wall; otherwise, what is the point of having a great arsenal?\n\n *** More Added To This Review Today (10/10/2017) ***\n\n- Sounds of opponent footsteps and other movement needs to be heard at slightly greater distance to be even more realistic.  I rely heavily on sound and have heard better in FPS, but this is merely a matter of some tweaking (in other words, dev, you're very close to what I would expect).\n\n- Whether online or offline, there is about a 1/2 second between moment bullet impacts opponent and when he falls.  I assume this is being resolved by optimization to come.  The latency is a bit annoying but nothing that prevents from from playing for hours on end.  \n\nSince this is early release, I would wager that the dev is working to improve these areas.

On CTF there is only a single spawn point per team which quickly devolves into a chicken shoot. The developer could make random spawn points to fix this. I will periodically try this game out and see if the problems get fixed. Also, there is no team balance system so you can easily be pitted one vs five. As it is now, it's the only VR game I've played that makes me want to rage quit. Too broken at this point to justify it over Pavlov VR or onward. I will say that the vehicles are cool initially, but as these types of games progress it will be less and less unique, and all that's left is a game that can't do even the most basic multiplayer right (random spawn points)\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n-Make random spawn points around bases in CTF\n-Give each player an ammo count and put ammo supply points in the map (no camp and kill indefinitely)\n-Team balancing (force balance if player count ratio is greater than 3:1)\n-Lower hit points on vehicles (It seems impossible to shoot a helicopter down) \n\nThe gameplay is pretty good if you find the right lobby, but it only takes one person exploiting the game mechanics to ruin it.......and there's always that guy!\n\nUpdate 9/13/17:\n\nAfter a few more hours of play, I've decided there is a lot more to this game than meets the eye. The amount of game modes are enough to set this apart from others in the VR FPS genre. The developer is one of the best in regard to support.

This game gets more updates than most other VR titles period. This developer is constantly adding new things to the game and they really know what they are doing. Most recently they added a battle royale mode which is basically PUBG for vr and it is amazing. I cant emphasize enough how much better this dev is than most other devs. I have had the vive since release and I own over 70 games. I have watched dev after dev abandon their games because all they wanted was a quick cash grad. Hoverjunkers is a prime example of an abandoned game. I use to LOVE Onward with a passion. I was in the league and my team did very well. Now I rarely play that game because the dev is a recluse who never updates his game. This game on the other hand, constantly has new experiences for me. I know it sounds like I'm stroking this dev right now but I just want to see more people buy this game instead of one of the neglected turd games out there because this game really deserves your money. Also, I am ABSOLUTELY NOT being compensated for this review and I paid FULL price for the game. \n\nIf you don't have this game already you are missing out. I didn't even realized this game existed until recently but now it is all I play. The parachuting and helicopters are such an amazing experience considering they are still experimental. The bots in this game are also better than the bots in onward IMO. The thing I appreciate the most about the game is how often the developer posts updates. Its frustrating how many VR games have slow or no development after launch but this dev is constantly putting out patches. I cant wait to see what the future holds for this game and if you are on the fence about it, I have over 200 hours in onward and ive barely touched it since I found this game. Buy it.

Great work to Koenigz; this is how VR shooters should be. I would even go as far as to say this is now the bar I place for other shooters. There are some other good VR shooters available (and yes, I own a lot of them), but this is my favorite so far. If you are reading this, do yourself a favor, stop reading, download the demo and try it out for free. If you like it, and I think you will, buy this game for the absolute steal it is (even full price is a bargain).\n\nAlso, if, like me, you don't care about the online multiplayer, the bots are more than adequite for hours upon hours of fun. There are a plethora of good maps available already and some are tributes to some classics from the past couple decades which feel so satisfying to play in VR.

This is a game you might move to once you are well versed in VR shooters,and want a more tactical game (maybe even so far as to have /made a gun stock for your controllers)\n\n-Pavlov: plays like Counterstrike\nQuick paced shooter, thats easy to grasp however when compared to the other two, the gameplay and controls are not fluid, the recoil/bullet spread feels off and the netcode needs some serious work. This is literally Counterstike VR, if thats the only thing you want/need, look no further. However it is extremely sparse on weapons, maps, and features, especially when compared to the other two. It doesnt do anything poorly, it just doesnt do anything great either. Its work picking up for the comparison, or to try something slightly different. \n\n-BAM: plays like COD (but one of the good ones)\n It has the most varied amount of modes both in multiplayer and the additional single player modes as well as the widest variety and largest number of guns, maps and attachments. It's single player options make this a compelling purchase alone, having a very good tutorial, gun range, time attack, holo gun (holo point, but with guns), a suprisingly scary and fun wave shooter, a breaching mode, and a full blown in VR level editor. Most of the single player modes have various types of leaderboards on each one as well, for something to aim towards. The multiplayer modes, (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Virus Infection, Gun Game and Classic Deathmatch), and large variety of maps and weapons keep the game feeling fresh. The player base is small at the moment for the game, usually only around 10 or so people in an open match (but join the discord https://discord.gg/DTQAw69 and its super easy to get in  dozens of active games every day), but bots make up for this.

Tausende Dinge gehen mir durch den Kopf. \n\nIch hatte noch nie die Gelegenheit mit einem Entwickler zu sprechen. Damit rechnet man ja nicht, wenn man einer deutschen VR Community beiwohnt. Doch auf einmal ist er da. Patrick - und sein Spiel, von dem heiss und innig geschwaermt wird. \n\nMeine Ueberraschung ueber diese Situation, blieb wohl nicht unbemerkt, denn er fuegt rasch hinzu: \"Ich bin gerne nah bei der Community und arbeite mit Euch. [...] Es ist wichtig Feedback zu erhalten was man besser machen kann.\" Ich bin immer noch total geplaettet. \n\nVorweg muss ich eins klarstellen: Ich bin absolut keine Shooterqueen. Die ganzen Shooterspiele sind total an mir vorbeigezogen. Nur BAM VR wollte mich nicht loslassen. \n\nIch hatte aufgrund der vielen Empfehlungen mal die Demo getestet und fand auf Anhieb die Vielfalt und Mechanik der Waffen sehr spannend. Das Tutorial ist ausfuehrlich, strukturiert und gut verstaendlich mit kleinen How-To Videos aufgebaut. Auch gibt es zahlreiche Optionen wie man sich in der Welt fortbewegen kann. Slide, Touchpad, Controller, Teleport. \n\nDas Teleporten ruft am wenigsten Motion Sickness hervor, allerdings ist die Teleportentfernung aus Balancing Gruenden limitiert und im Kampf eher hinderlich. Es empfiehlt sich also, es mit der Touchpadbewegung zu versuchen und ggf. die Laufgeschwindigkeit im Menue anzupassen (nachdem ich die HTC Vive Brille abgesetzt hatte, bin ich noch einige Zeit durch die Wohnung \"geglitten\", das war witzig).\n\nIm Tutorial darf man jede Waffe mal ausprobieren; wie man nachlaedt, die Waffe richtig haelt, Recoil etc. Das ist verblueffend gut in die VR Welt transportiert worden. Angetan haben es mir das Leichte Maschinengewehr (LMG) und der Bogen. Magazin auswerfen, neues Magazin aus dem imaginaeren Backpack ziehen, nachladen, Klappe auf, Klappe zu, die Kammer leeren... es war als haette ich eine echte Waffe in der Hand. \n\nSchwierigkeiten hatte ich mit der Granate - da musste man den Stift rausziehen und ich habe erst gar nicht gecheckt, dass die kleine blaue Kugel auf den Controllern den \"Grab\" Punkt darstellt. Ich musste laut lachen, als sich mir die Loesung endlich offenbarte und ich nun sehr praezise Stifte ziehen, sowie Waffen und Keypads bedienen konnte. \n\nNach dem umfangreichen Tutorial, kann man bereits in der Demo alle Karten im Multiplayer spielen; allerdings \"nur\" in den Spielmodi Team Deathmatch und Capture the Flag. In der Vollversion gibt es dann noch viele weitere Modi, Level Editoren, Single Player, Waves uvm. \n\nDer Abwechslungsreichtum ist erstaunlich und ich habe aktuell nicht mal annaehernd das gesamte Potential ausgeschoepft. Auch befindet sich das Spiel noch im Early Access - man darf also noch einiges an Features erwarten. \n\nIn meiner ersten Multiplayer Session steht auf einmal der Avatar des Solo-Entwicklers neben mir. \"Ich spiele mal mit\", sagt er froehlich. Ich hantiere derweil tollpatschig mit den Zielvisieren umher, ich bin nervoes. \n\nLos gehts, ich gleite durch das Portal und staune: ploetzlich laufe ich in Mausgroesse durch ein Kinderzimmer. Ueberall stehen Cornflakes-Schachteln und umgekippte Buecher - mir entrinnt ein fasziniertes \"Ahhh\". \n\nWie zu erwarten war, stelle ich mich jedoch selten daemlich an und laufe konsequent in die Schussbahnen der Anderen. Das Spiel erfordert viel Geschick und viel Uebung. Ich gewoehne mich leider nur sehr langsam an das was gefordert ist um zu gewinnen.\n\nNichtsdestotrotz macht es unverschaemt viel Spass und die Maenner haben meine klaeglichen Versuche Kills zu erzielen mit Humor genommen (gut, dass es kein Friendly Fire gibt).

I struggled to even distinguish people from background in onward most of the time. The frame rates are always high enough to keep from using asynch etc. Also the options for res scaling are there and immediate and my rig plays it on 1.5 no problem. \n\nThe game modes in onward tend to provide more suspense as one kill and youre out, making you tread more carefully, which i like. B&M is more about respawning and hitting as many people as possible before getting hit again. There is a capture the flag mode which is a lot of fun but I havent found any modes similar to onward yet, they  may be there, if not, they should be something to include later. \n\nThe single player portions of B&M are surprisingly addictive especially competing against others all time down to daily records for each weapon.The range is really well made, allowing you test every weapon and their configurations on the fly, unlike onwards slow exit, choose, maybe re-enter the range again if it doesnt crash method.\n\nThe only issue at the moment is there are so few people playing for some reason, especially in europe. Come on people this game is a lot of fun and probably the best multiplayer shooter out there at the moment, lets fill those servers!\n\nThe updates come thick and fast and the editor has had people produce some great level designs. There are massive maps that would suit a lot of players down to tiny maps that are good for 4.\n\nAll in all this game is worth far more than what theyre asking.\n", "timestamp_created": 1496074110, "timestamp_updated": 1496074110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32044508": {"recommendationid": "32044508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100190207", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "last_played": 1516321836}, "language": "english", "review": "This has got to be the most \"COD\" like shooter for the vive and I love it.

But then I got frustrated with mid-game loading screens and debateable hit detection and noticed that most people who had played both games prefer bullets and more.\n\nIn multiplayer, everyone's mic is on by default to talk to everyone, which has made this the most friendly shooter I've ever played. Multiplayer feels sort of empty if all you do is kill the other people in silence. It's a lot of why rec room is so much fun too.\n\nAt the end of each round you vote on the next mode and then the next map, which is great for keeping it fresh. Team deathmatch, gun game, deathmatch, and infection seem to be the most popular and are all a lot of fun. Deathmatch can be a little iffy if the map is the wrong size for the number of players. Classic deathmatch is fun, with weapons scattered around the level that you have to get after spawning. CTF is less played, and tends to be one-sided. There is no bomb plant/defuse mode.\n\nThe choice of weapons is pretty satisfying and the choice of attachments to put on them is too. I just learned that you can change the color and image in the holosights. The bow and arrow has it's draw backs (lol) but is a pretty legit midrange weapon and it's way more fun to shoot other players with arrows than it is to shoot npcs or cubes. I usually play with the mk18 because that's what everyone cool uses, but taking an LMG to fight off infected players is a good choice too.\n\nCons; limited player base, but i've only logged on and found it totally dead once. usually there's at least 2-3 others playing and it's not rare to get a full 12-player game. The one time it was dead, I just went in to the level editor to mess around there.\nloading screens: kind of long. if you go right when the round ends and skip voting, you could probably pee and get back just in time for the next round starting. Or you could vote and go to the fridge to get a new beverage. It's kind of a bummer having to wait when you first fire it up, but after you've been playing for an hour or two it's sort of nice to have a break.\n\nThe game gets significant updates pretty regularly and the teaser video is not representative of what it's like to play the game or of the current graphics. Mostly the weird locked knee character animations have been replaced with pretty good IK. Since I've started playing not so long ago I've seen it improve quite a bit. The already great core gameplay has had a lot of rough interfaces cleaned up and the new exploding head animation for headshots is very satisfying.", "timestamp_created": 1495956665, "timestamp_updated": 1495956665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31984354": {"recommendationid": "31984354", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972501993", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493483963}, "language": "english", "review": "A great VR game that is hamstrung by a low population.", "timestamp_created": 1495841623, "timestamp_updated": 1495841623, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460044", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31978774": {"recommendationid": "31978774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061606395", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499206507}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game if you are looking for a partner to Onward. $15 bucks is a steal.

I am eagerly waiting for the mechanics to feel as fluid as onward. I am in love with onward, I play at least a few hours everyday (1100 hours logged so far).\nAnyways, the other night I gave bullets and more another shot, again, just like last month I was blown away by the progress. The first time I played it, it was awful, I had so many glitches, and just in general I could not shoot straight or anything. Last month when I played, most of that was fixed. The gun seemed to shoot where it was pointing at least. The other night, I tried again. I was disappointing most of the issues I had were not fixed. There was an incredible amount of new content though. Zombie mode, gun game, that mode where your in a forest and shoot the monsters and avoid innocent creatures. These are all really cool features. I talked with some of the people in there, and they said I should send a message on the forums about some of my suggestions. Not sure where that form is, I thought there would be a subreddit for this game, and I would just submit it there, but there wasn't so here I am. The people I talked with said the dev, (I think his name is Patrick), kept a list of priorities that he wanted to put in the game. However, some of my suggestions I think are easy to implement, but must have never been thought of, or been made lower propriety than some of this new content you added. I think some of these suggestions are crucial to the success of this game, and are what most consider the reason they play onward over BAM.\nHere we go:\n\n**1- Your character should move slower when looking down the sight of your gun:** This give the game a much more realistic feel. In onward, as you raise your gun, your character slows down, giving myself a firing stance and a running stance, the same way I would behave in real life.\n\n**2- The red dot on the holosight and red dot sight should get smaller as you hold it away from your face:** A lot of the time when playing BAM, I would be shooting at people across the map, the red dot in my cross air would actually be larger than target I was trying to hit. This made it really difficult to aim. One thing I love about BAM, is the ability to build your gun, place attachments wherever you want. I think if I place the holo sight on the far end of my gun, the sight should be smaller, instead its still the same size as if I were to put it on the back of my gun, right against my face. This is not realistic. It would also give users the ability to choose if they want an easy to see and quick to focus on reticle, or if they want something smaller for long range maps they can have a small reticle.\n\n**3- Using a gun stock with two hands does not work:** When I was playing, I would try and aim at people across the map holding my hands very still in a gun stock, but the reticle would just float around. It was impossible to shoot anything. Its like taking a moving average of where my hands are over the last second or two and moving the gun to there. When I move the gun from left to right, it takes a few milliseconds for the reticle to catch up to where I am aiming. This was the most frustrating thing I found, and should be made a top priority. Eventually the people I was playing with realized my problem. I guess if you are using a gun stock you should just hold the gun with one hand. This made my problem go away, but when holding with one hand you get more recoil. So this really is not a solution, but a temporary fix. I was forced to play all my games with single fire on. The last time I played this a month ago, there was a gun stock mode in the settings that I think fixed this, my problem is that I am using an oculus, and I guess the dev and the tester do not own an oculus, because last month when I played with gun stock mode on, I had some issues that made the game unplayable but I was told were specific problems to the oculus users and I dont really remember what those were, it was a month ago. This time I did not see a gunstock mode in the settings, but I will check again later. Maybe I missed it. Bottom line, if I can't hold my gun with two hands and have the reticle be steady and responsive to movement, then this game is almost unplayable. MAKE THIS TOP PRIORITY.\n\n**4- When I walk physically walk into a virtual wall, my character is unable to move:** This one bothered me the least, but is still a frustrating issue when it happens. If I sidestep at all, and my character's elbow or something goes into an object, I cant move. I think out of what I am suggesting this will be the most difficult to fix.\n\nThat's it.\n\nLike I said, I love this game, but it has a few kinks to work out before it feels polished. That's it for me. I really cant believe the progress this game has made compared to onward.

Not really the games fault, but I can see it being a problem. I would also almost swear there are some people that cheat if it wasnt so rare for that to happen in VR games (Training on people through objects, etc) But they probably just play the crap out of it. Who knows.\n- Shooting people feels more like youre just trying to lower their Health % rather than shooting them. This may have been a design choice but Im not much of a fan of it. Any game I can empty a gun into someones back and they be on about 3% bothers me.\n- Again, it may be a design choice, but I feel like the recoil of weapons is also a bit much. I consider myself pretty good at other VR shooters, but on here, Ill be lucky to unload my weapon and hit my target more than a couple times, unless I pause for a second or two between shots (Which is a bit hard to imagine if youre being shot at and need to fire back), its like this for every weapon for me.", "timestamp_created": 1494545370, "timestamp_updated": 1494643512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31685337": {"recommendationid": "31685337", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960503893", "num_games_owned": 877, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509823411}, "language": "english", "review": "VR Multiplayershooter Done Right!\n\nBullets And More VR or BAM VR is a FPS for VR Systems like Vive and Oculus. With its main focus on multiplayer matches there is a viarity of modes from classic deathmatch/teamdeathmatch to the virus mode where one infected has to hunt down the other players which each kill they get infected too. The singleplayer part comes very short and just gives you your standart shooting range and a horde like mode where you defend yourself in the middle of a dark forest. There is also an level editor included which you control completely in vr and can waste auf many fun hours building your own map for single or multiplayer. Sadly atm you can't use your own created map in multiplayer from the get go and have to be submitted. But with this game still in early access and there are bigger things to finnish this will rarely happen.\n\nThe gunplay in this game is fantastic and so much fun that you can waste a ton of time by your own to test all weapons out. Hell you can even throw magazines and guns in the air to make some awesome moves reloading your weapon. This game supports locomotion with the touchpad and is highly recommended. If you own a gun-rig you can use this here too.\n\nThe graphics are okay at best. The weapons look great but everything else like the enviroment is just meh. Gladly this doesn't matter because the gameplay is insanly fun...if you find a mp-match. And here we go to my biggest negative point.\n\nIf you are from europe like me or an other timezone far off from the us-timezone you will have a hard time finding any games with many players. The majority seems to come from the us and therefore playing with a high peak of players would be very early in the morning or late at night and this is a huge problem. On top of that not many people own this game as there is nearly no advertisement for BAM VR as the developer said he wants to finish a huge chunk of the game first. Which is understandable and he has the communitys back. And what a great community this is.\n\nThey are friendly to newcomers and helping out. I didn't had one time where someone starts offend someone or gets over the top angry. They support the dev and even build maps to help him. The discord channel of this game is a very friendly place. No toxic whatsoever.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Hell yes even in this state.

I've tried several, and BAM has the perfect balance of realism and easy controls, with a bunch of fun game modes.\n\nIn some other VR shooters like Pavlov and Onward, the awkward controls (especially reloading) can make the simulation seem LESS real, because it reminds me how much easier it is to just use my real hands.  BAM doesn't have this problem.  Drop the old magazine with a click on the touchpad, then get the new mag close to where it's supposed to go and it will pop into place.  You still get to operate the bolts realistically, and they actually modeled the HK charging handle more correctly in BAM than Onward.  (I do wish BAM had the G3 rifle though!)  You can even reload and chamber weapons carried in the bubbles in front of you.\n\nMovement in BAM is great.  You can use the teleport feature to move, while other players see you run from point to point.  Most multiplayer VR shooters only let you use the touchpad to move, but teleporting feels more natural to me.  The only time you don't teleport is when climbing up and down.  Going up a ladder is pretty cool, because you actually grab and pull with your hands.  Hopping over the top of the ladder is a bit awkward, but you get used to it.  Sometimes I've had trouble getting down from a short ledge, but it's rare because the level design doesn't often make you do it.\n\nBAM also allows you to use other control schemes if you'd like, so don't fret if you enjoy touchpad sliding.  Actually, one of my favorite things about BAM is how customizable it is.  I have a Vive, but I use the grip-to-hold mode intended for the Occulus Touch.  It can get a bit tiring and I accidentally drop my gun every now and then, but I find it's the most immersive mode that lets me naturally interact with objects in the world.  (I think my ideal control scheme would be clicking grip to toggle weapon pickup but with the other hand HOLDING grip to operate bolts and slides, but I haven't seen any game do it quite that way.)\n\nSingle player has a nice low-stress shooting range with unlimited access to the weapons, and an intense timed shooting challenge where you compete for the best daily, weekly, and all-time score with any of the available weapons.  There's also a sandbox editor mode which I haven't explored much yet, but you can see from the Workshop that others have made some cool things.\n\nIn multiplayer you start out by voting on the mode and map, then pick your gear and spawn in when ready.  You return to the gear room whenever you die and can respawn from there.  Most modes let you pick weapons freely, but in classic deathmatch you'll only start with a pistol and find other weapons on the map.  My favorite mode is Infection, which starts one player as a zombie with melee attacks only and the ability to climb walls.  Anyone killed by the zombie comes back as a zombie.  BAM multiplayer has a friendly atmosphere with all-talk voice chat, and I've enjoyed the people I've played with.\n\nThe level design has a good mix of close and long range combat, without too many tight repeated turns the same direction to remind you about the cord at your legs (a big problem in Pavlov).  The scattered cover gives you plenty of places to hide without getting in the way of traversing the map.  With the customizable controls and excellent map design, it feels good to move around in BAM.\n\nThis game is early access in a good way, with regular updates and new features.

You can crouch, prone, and climb ladders and handholds to attack and defend from any tactical angle. \n\nZombies, you get to climb up and down any flat surface. Be the Spider-Zombieman. \n\nLike many VR FPS, your inventory is on your body and is denoted by bubbles where you can place any items such as guns, knives, bows, ammo magazines and shells, grenades, and even weapon attachments! You reload by reaching over to the pouches on your side and slamming the magazine into your weapon's empty magwell. There are many quality-of-life additions such as the ability to reload weapons in your inventory, or even change out magazines by simply ejecting the magazine and moving your weapon's magwell into a magazine on your inventory to load up a fresh one! You can even activate grenades on your person, or pull their pins one handed with your \"teeth\"! Unlike Pavlov, your weapons actually hit where you aim them on your sights or on your scope, and your skill in managing recoil will determine if your shots hit.  \n\n\nBullets and More's inventory system is unique in that you can switch your hands from \"open\", and able to manipulate bolt actions, pistol slides, revolver chambers, charging handle, attachment lights/lasers, bow arrows, knives, grenade pins, and shotgun pumps. You can also draw or store weapons and ammo magazines  from your inventory and pouches while your hands are open. Switch your hand to \"closed\" next to a gun, and you'll have that gun attached and aimed to that hand, ready at the trigger. Take your offhand and put that next to the front grips of that gun, and you'll stabilize your gun and get a recoil control bonus. The great thing is that the offhand does not affect the aim of your primary hand on the trigger, and as long as you keep your offhand near the grip, you'll get the recoil control bonus. It takes a bit of getting used to, but the increased fuctionality is a godsend and alone sets this game apart from shovelware FPS like Pavlov. \n\nDid I mention you get to use a bow?\n\nThere is a large variety of weapons, sidearms, and customizable attachments to choose from. Reload your long silver bullets into the well greased chamber of the powerful Revolver while in the middle of battlet, and hunt down your prey like an ocelot. Load up the magwells of an assault rifle such as the AKM, MK16, K5C and mow down your opponents. Harken back to the days of World War II with the M1 Garand and the Kar98k. Or even meet an old friend from Counter-Strike in the form of the L96 Arctic Warfare Police, also known as the AWP, and the Desert Eagle. There are 17 primary weapons and 6 secondary weapons to load out with along with three types of grenades and multiple attachments you can pick, choose, and even color/customize to your liking to really personalize your loadout. Every gun is balanced, and I can attest to the fact that I've seen every gun (Yes, even the Bow) top the scoreboards due to their user's skill.\n\nBy the way, did I mention that there is a Bow that works just like you think it does? Well, now you can have the one fun thing from those terrible, cheap, shovelware archery wave shooters and play it in an actual game with full locomotion. Pull an arrow from your ammo pouch or even from the back of your shoulder like a QuiVR\n\nThe multiplayer game modes consist of Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Classic Deathmatch, CTF, and Virus Infection (Zombies), and there are more than 20 maps available for players to choose and shoot it out (or eat brains) on. THe beauty is that many of these maps were made in the level editor itself by the community and turned into actual maps for the community to enjoy and play. There are even old classics from FPS history such as Halo: Combat Evolved's Battle Creek, Counter Strike's Dust2, Office, and Vertigo, and even CoD: Modern Warfare's Nuketown and Rust. There are loads of locales to choose from and play on. At peak time, there's always a good server on to play with others, and the player count goes up to 12! That's 4 more than Pavlov AND Onward! \n\nTHere is a bevy of single-player modes as well, such as Timed Target Shooting (I currently have the all-time for Bow, M249, MK16 and the AWP), Night Forest Survival (Night time wave shooter that takes place in a forest), Hologun (Holopoint with guns), Endless Breaching, Shooting Range, and the powerful Scene Editor where you can make your own multiplayer maps or single player scenarios by hand all in VR, and upload them to the workshop! You have access to all the tools that the sole developer uses to make maps, such as ladders, configurable AI with spawning behavior and difficulty, night-day, and even the ability to control whether ammo is infinite or limited!\n\nIf this review doesn't persuade you to buy Bullets and More, there -is- a free demo that allows you to play with other demo players and even players that paid for the full version on specific maps, and includes some of the single-player modes as well. \n\nSo there you have it: Superior, fast-paced and frantic gunplay and movement in equally expansive and growing multiplayer and single player modes, with up to 12 players on a server and a bevy of guns, gamemodes, maps, and ways to play with an option to try the free demo, or dive head first into the full $15 version.  Add the powerful scene editor for the community, with a very active developer and you've got a recipe for a game that keeps spitting lead faster than a machine gun.", "timestamp_created": 1492007717, "timestamp_updated": 1492007829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518494", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31088826": {"recommendationid": "31088826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057655638", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1516317820}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

Highly recommended! I've only scratched the surface, but this game seems to have never ending content. All of this coming from one dev is pretty nuts.

Attatch your scope, flip down the bipod and crouch at the bench, pull back the bolt, and load some ammo from your pouch. Doesnt get better than that. Everything is pretty much pin point and adds a hefty amount of immersion.\nAfter giving all the guns a whirl and shooting target, I customized my avatar and height, and  jumped into an online death match. First thing i noticed was you had an actual radio strapped to you, and needed to use it to cycle between chat modes. Instantly intuitive and felt cool as hell. I started chatting with some super supportive cool fellas and learned some more mechanics.\nThis was the first time I used the trackpad for motion rather than teleporting. While you can use teleportation locomotion, I was told to switch to track pad and agree it has the advantage.

Great game, great dev, great replayability, easy to pickup.\n\nWhy I like it:\nI bought it on Saturday (5 days ago)... It's very easy to pickup and the gameplay is smooth. \n\nThe zombie mode is a huge blast and is the reason I got it! Playing as zombie you can scale everything and leap through the air. As a player you have to find good spots and cover each angle. Very fast paced rounds but exciting every time.\n\nStrangely though, going to TDM and other modes, I found myself having just as much fun as the Zombie rounds. So far, I've not liked any VR multiplayer shooter, having tried a few but this one for whatever reason is a lot of fun. The time to kill is spot on. The guns feel great and you can aim with one hand. Being able to jump from Zombie mode to TDM and back adds variety to the game. This makes it possible to play a lot longer and have a lot of fun.\n\nThe community is awesome (there's a dedicated discord with around 30 people online at any given time, discussing the game). At the moment, you're more likely to find a game in the evenings (UK time) than in the day and on weekends, as most people are working and the Americans don't jump on till later. \n\nAnyway, I'm rambling. \n\nHere are some more bits of info:\n\nVR Features:\nMultiple movement modes (Teleport, Click and Slide, Point and Move)\nClimbing (players climb pipes, grapple handles and ladders, zombies climb walls)\nSingle or double hand on 1 gun (useful for those without a gun stock)\nDual wield & shoot\nVOIP\nSupersamples to 1.6 on a 980Ti\n\nGamemodes:\nTDM (Bog standard team deathmatch, equip your guns in the lobby, add the attachments, and get down to business)\nDM (Bog standard deathmatch)\nClassic DM (where you find weapons scattered around the map)\n\nExperimental gamemodes:\nHostage mode (haven't played this one yet)\nCTF mode (haven't played this one yet)\nZombie mode (1 or 2 players zombie, must infect all humans, infected humans become zombie too)\n\nNumber of maps at least 30+ at the moment with more on the way. \n\nNumber of guns: ~25-30\n\nNumber of attachments: ~10-15 \n\nThe game feels like CS with Zombies & I believe the guy will create something similar to Garry's mod by the end of it. A game with lots of games within the game. \n\nLook much forward to seeing him developing it.\n\nLast bit, I gave the dev a small piece of feedback, to add a speaker icon or colour a players name differently when they talk so you can see it clearly ingame.

In a word, BAM is the king of [u][b]variety[/b][/u], offering a buffet's-worth of content that keeps the game fresh and continually enjoyable hour after hour.  \n\nGameplay-wise, BAM leans heavily on the arcadey side, complete with fast movement, quick spawns, and a large arsenal of weapons and customizable attachments at your disposal.  Both touchpad/thumbstick locomotion and teleportation are available as options. The number of officially-supported maps is ridiculous thanks to the map builder and Steam workshop integration.  Every kind of map you could imagine exists in BAM, be it indoors, outdoors, long-range, close quarters, multi-storied, and nighttime variations, as well as remakes of classic maps from the likes of CS, UT, CoD, etc.  And yes, all these maps get actual playtime thanks to the robust voting system at the end of each game.  Beyond that, there are all manners of modes to play on, from your FPS staples (TDM, DM, CTF) to the non-traditional (L4D-esque Virus, Hostage, PvPvE w/ zombies, obstacle courses).\n\nSo what you might be thinking is, \"hey Palidore, if BAM is so good, how come games like Onward or Pavlov are more popular?\"  The answer is pretty easy, since it's what almost kept me from buying BAM, and is probably what has you, dear reader, a bit skeptical: first impressions.  \n\nStarting with the very first thing you see scrolling through Steam's catalog, \"Bullets and More VR - BAM VR\" is an admittedly uninspired-sounding name, in addition to being an absolute mouthful.  It sounds like one of the thousand VR tech demos and student projects already out there, which many VR users have soured on and gloss over by default.  For those who [i]do[/i] decide to click on the store page, they're greeted by much of the same, with a rather generic-looking game banner, and promotional screenshots that just look random and cluttered.  The trailer is actually fairly well done, but at the same time, showcases less-than-pretty textures, sounds, and animations \u2014 a lot of which is outdated and improved now.  \n\nTo me, this is BAM's cardinal sin: presenting itself like a cheap, hacked-together tech demo, instead of the quality, depth-filled game that it actually is.  Now, it might not be within the developer's scope to improve graphics dramatically, and I'm okay with that.  VR naturally brings out beauty and immersion even in low-fidelity games, and BAM is no exception.  Once you're in it and playing, you stop caring about how blurry certain textures are, and start appreciating just how robust and content-rich the game is. If nothing else, I just want to see more love put into the external presentation for the sake of marketability.  Shorten or change the name, make the store page nicer, and develop a prettier UI.\n\nSo, for those who look past its rough exterior, you're rewarded with a seriously fun game that's bursting at the seams with content.  More impresssive yet, is that BAM is essentially a one-man project, yet the developer, Patrick, churns out new updates at an amazing pace.  On a weekly basis, we're getting some substantial combination of new maps, modes, guns, features, sounds, animations, bug fixes \u2014 you name it.  Check the update page yourself; 40+ updates in 6 months of early access is no joke.  When BAM came out, Patrick provided an already playable and enjoyable base game, and has rapidly improved and iterated upon it ever since.  This is early access done right.\n\nFor those on the fence, [b] TRY THE DEMO! [/b]  It allows you to play unlimited amounts of multiplayer, with the caveat that you're only able to play on a select few maps with select weapons.  In order to maximize your chance at playing with other people, I highly recommend logging in during the weekends, or during the US daytime hours.  I know the lower player population can discourage some from buying BAM, but take some assurance in the fact that the game's population [i] has [/i] actually sustained itself over the months despite heavy competition, instead of dying off like others have.  \n\nTo sum up, BAM is quite the diamond in the rough.  What it lacks in presentation, it makes up for tenfold in gameplay and the amount of content it offers, blowing its competition out of the water with the latter.  Had its marketability not been hamstrung by what I can only presume to be the generic name and mediocre graphics, I can confidently say BAM would be one of the most popular VR games right now.  Yes it's rough in areas, but damned if it isn't fun and endlessly replayable.  Buy the game, or just try the demo.

Yes, just like pretty much every VR game on the market right now, there is a lack of a player base so it can sometimes be hard to find a multi-player match.

VR is a new market and it needs investment in order to grow. Stop crying \"muh player base\" when you don't actually contribute to growing said player base because you refund the game after checking one time.

I've played over 66 hours since buying it 3 months ago. It's incredible, with more truly top quality content than many AA games.\n\n\nI've played first person shooters for years and after trying a shooting game in VR I was hooked. Bullets and More VR took that addiction to the next level. With it's numerous maps, exceptional mechanics and guns playing against fellow gamers is a true joy. \n\nOne of the many things that make BAM so incredible is the gun mechanics, everything is fluid, smooth and intuitive. If you've ever fired a gun or have played enough FPS' using the weapons will be straight forward and easily become second nature as a result the fun flows naturally and you're never left feeling stupid having been unable to reload mid-firefight.\n\nThe guns are accurate and powerful, making the experience realistic without losing the sense of fun inherant in a great game. New community created maps are constantly being added, meaning that you'll not only be met with new highly detailed immersive levels, but also old favourites or tributes to classic maps from days gone by. For an \"old school\" PC gamer maps like Rats from CS or Faces from UT are incredible, nostalgia filled things to experience in VR.\n\nThe more you play this game the better it gets, the community is constantly expanding with committed players meaning that you regularly get to bump into familiar people making it a far more social game than it lets on. The developer is clearly committed to making a product that is fun above all else, and he's managed to do that without comprimising on quality in any area, an incredible acomplishment. \n\nWith a constant stream of feature rich updates I'm regularly astonished by what my small payment got me. Supressors and attachments gallore, realistic body movement and \"Climby\" style climbing have meant there are constantly fun, intense and often hilarious gun battles happening. \n\nI'm yet to play a game that compares to Bullets and More in terms of replayability and constant guranteed fun.\n\nIn short if you've loved Counter Strike, Unreal Tournament or Call of Duty and you want to bring that experience into VR there's only one game you need and It's BAM. \n\nIf you're considering buying this game, stop thinking about it and do it.

I have seen people mention low player count, I honestly haven't been playing for enough days to say if this is an issue, but I was able to play on a full server in the US early on a saturday morning, not at all a peak time and there wasn't an issue with a lack of players.\n\nAs for the things that could use work, this game needs a search and destroy/defuse the bomb mode. Right now it's just ctf or deathmatch, they are extremely fun but a single life mode would be well appreciated. Also the sounds need some work, there were times where the sound for my gun would cut out completely and I couldn't hear it. These are perfectly excusable for an early access game. Apparently the dev is really hard at work and I am really excited to see where this game goes.\n\nThis is an absolute must buy for anyone who even remotely enjoys shooters.", "timestamp_created": 1489253449, "timestamp_updated": 1489253449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30364548": {"recommendationid": "30364548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337312330", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507494690}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely love this game.

The major update I believe the game needs right now is weapon balance or atleast consistent time to kill. There have been too many occasions when I place 4 to 6 bullets on a player with the my AK and they literally turn around and kill me with 1 - 2 shot from M1 Garand, Shotgun and sometimes even the same AK! It can be pretty fustrating to shoot someone multiple times first and still die. However, the game is still in early access so some issues are expected and even with that being said, the game is still one of the most fun VR shooters I have played and is currenlty my favorite game on VR.

Casual is good, since sometimes you want instant action, something a bit more accessible.  Unlike other shooters, BAM offers a wide range of locomotion options.  I prefer the Onward Style touchpad movement, but there is also teleport, and Art of Fight Easy mode style point sliding, to accommodate different preferences which I think is great.  \n\nThere are still a lot of areas which require improvements.  Some of the Classes and weapon choices available seem a bit odd and thematically out of place.  While I really enjoy using the Garand and Kar98, they don't seem to fit with the modern military stylings of the game.  I would love to see more customizability in the loadouts and character customization.  If we are adding in weapons from all eras, I'd love to see helmets and uniforms from that time as well.  I would also like to see additional customizable loadouts that we can tweak instead of just predefined classes.  \n\nIn the end though, these complaints are pretty minor, and if I had to ask myself if BAM is fun, I would answer yes.

I've been playing the game and using the editor for a little while now, so it's time for a quick review.\n\nAt this stage, the game is still in Early Access.  I played the demo for a few hours, and then moved on to purchase the game because it was so much fun.  As of this review I have >60 hours in game/editor.\n\nI've never played Onward, but I frequently hear references to Onward from other players in-game.  While parallels are drawn between the two, the general consensus is that, while Onward has good graphics, BAM VR is more fun to play.  Re-spawn times are instantaneous (with time to re-spec, loadout, etc).\n\nFor reference, I'm running with:\n[list]\n    [*]Windows 8.1\n    [*]i7 4790k (overclocked)\n    [*]8 GB RAM\n    [*]GTX 1080\n    [*]HTC Vive\n[/list]\n\nNow on to a brief look at the pros and cons of BAM VR.  Please note that, bearing in mind that the game is still in Early Access, many of the cons are probably attributable to this.\n\n[b]The Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Game runs silky smooth;\n    [*]Re-spawn time is next to nothing - jump right back in, or change class/loadout;\n    [*]Gameplay moves at a good pace; it can be fast and furious at times.  Likewise, if you have a proclivity to camping - you'll get your chance, but be prepared to keep changing positions;\n    [*]Editor allows players to create their own levels (in VR);\n    [*]Matches (TDM) usually last around 10 - 15 minutes (in my estimation).  At this stage, the game ends when one team reaches 40 kills - so, if there are less players in the match, it will take a little longer;\n    [*]Single player/mini-games are included;\n    [*]Weapons are super-easy to use.  While I enjoy the complexity of [b]Hotdogs, Horseshoes and Handgrenades[/b], it's nice to be able to re-load a weapon simply, while on the run;\n    [*]For those prone to VR/motion sickness, there are several locomotion options available to choose from;\n    [*]The game developer is very active in the community, willing to make changes based upon player experiences;\n    [*]Game updates are very frequent;\n    [*]At the current price of USD$15, this is a bargain;\n    [*]The free demo is [i]almost[/i] comparable to the full game. \n[/list]\n\n[b]The Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Limited number of maps at this time;\n    [*]The editor can be a challenge to get used to;\n    [*]Not enough choice of assets in the editor;\n    [*]Some of the assets are a bit higgeldy-piggeldy - sometimes, things don't look like they fit properly;\n    [*]The editor is a VR only application - it would be nice to have a non-VR option;\n    [*]Currently there is only one server, based in the United States - I'm in Western Australia - my latency is >300ms most times;\n    [*]Gamer population is low at this time.\n[/list]\n\nIn summary: \n[list]\n[*]This is one of the best VR games I have in my collection - and I have a few;\n[*]The demo is free.  Download it today;\n[*]The full game is very economical and hours of enjoyment;\n[*]In Early Access, this game has a lot of promise.  If the dev keeps up the pace, this can only get better and better.  I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes.\n\nIf you want so see some gameplay, there's a little bit on YouTube.

Game is amazing!**\n\nThis game has developed into the best 5v5 VR shooter on steam. It might not hold that place for long as dozens of indie developers strive to become the \"goto VR shooter\", but right now its ahead of everyone else. Here's why I think so:\n\n1) Graphics, Models, physics, and Animation. Lets get this out of the way, this game has the same crappy graphics that every other indie VR title has. I don't consider any of this a part of the rating, because as most VR owners know, the VR experience outweights graphics by a factor of three. None of the best VR shooters have good graphics, and you can't expect them to.\n\n2) Better than Onward! The devs for this title understand you don't want down-time when you have a 10 pound face mask on. Onward is a fantastic game, and easily the #1 VR shooter title holder. However, if you die 10 seconds into the match you have to potentially stand there for 5 minutes while the rest of your team fights. Bam VR takes you right back to \"The Construct\" where you can change class, mod weapons, and then spawn right back into the game. This method of FPS spawning is probably my least favorite when it comes to PC based FPS's, but I believe this is absolutely neccessary for any VR FPS. Either that or other VR shooters needs to add mini-games inbetween deaths.\n\n3) Better than Art of Fight! The devs for this title also understand how important movement options are for players! They  did a great job of balancing the game so a person using teleport movement doesn't have an advantage over people with free movement. They have paintball style moving, they have onward style moving, and they also have their own unique style. You click a location far awar, and then it auto-walks you there.\n\n4) Better than Paintball! Paintball is probably one of the best VR shooters. However, this game scratches the itch you can only get from panic reloading a machine gun while trapped in a house or getting the flank on 3 guys and watching the blood spray as you empty your clips into them. Paintballs biggest draw back is the teleport movement allows you to flank enemies easily. You are constantly turning around and watching your back. You can't suddenly teleport behind somebody in Bam VR. Flanking requires more strategy.\n\n5) Map builder? I can't really comment on this, because I haven't played around with it. However, you can currently build your own maps from with-in the game.

But the difference is there BAM is very forgiving, while reloading and the ammunition snaps into the gun. Also Bam feels more like a traditional shooter then a gun simulator \n\nNumber 2: Movement: BAM got Teleport, Sliding and direct movement by touchpad similar to H3. All of the Options feel very fluid and good for a VR game if you can handle the specific style.\n\nNumber 3: Competitive Scenes: BAM got a \u201cavoid the bullet\u201d and a \u201ctarget aiming\u201d scene, both with Leaderboards. I am not much into competitive Gameplay, so\u2026\n\nNumber 4: Funny Scenes: We all know the fun of H3, with BAM we get a different flavor a survival setting in \u201cRiverhead Forest\u201d. A dark wood only your flashlight will provide a little bit of sight, for my taste a bit too scary. \n\nBut with the integrated leveleditor you can build your own settings. There are already some very nice Levels in the workshop. Users are able to create little settings against soldiers, zombies, horror deers or wooden targets.  \n\nNow to the downsides of BAM:\nIn the moment the editor is a bit complicated with the different menus and spawning mechanism.\nThe snapping of titles is an interesting approach but feels clunky in the moment.\nAlso a big nogo is to move the player while tilting the head! Never do this! Let the head clip into the wall but never move the player it feels terrible, as special on stairs!\n\nBut overall I am very interested to see the influences from BAM to H3 and the other way around. \nAnd for the users I hope to see many different workshop creations in the future.\n\n\nEdit:\nI love the game and the developer listens to the players.

Teleporting (with a dash effect), sliding (dynamic rails), controller aiming, and touchpad movement. \n\nThe game also has a fantastic Multiplayer mode (in beta) that currently has deathmatch and team deathmatch modes.

But it already makes fun!\n2) The Shooting Range is similar to the Warehouse-Level of \"Hot Dogs, Horseshoes and Handgranades\" (from that game they also borrowed the bubbles where you put magazines and guns into). There are several dynamically appearing targets, most of them are moving. Shooting and reloading while new targets appear all over the place feels good and provides a lot of fun!\n3) The Forest Level is a fresh take on the Brookhaven idea. It does not feel that scary (which is good for me), it is a bit brighter and there are innocent animals (with glowing eyes!) which don't bother you. It makes fun, if you like scary wave-shooters. This game feels already rather finished.\n4) The Level Editor is what might become (depending on the community) the best part of this game. It is a sandbox where you can put different assets like enemies, animals, walls, trees and buildings and build your own level. While it is rather easy to build something (there is a tutorial), you need a good idea what to build and some time. Currently the number of different assets is limited but I expect that the developers to add more. \n\nThe game is obviously in early access and needs a lot of work (e.g. the sound of the guns), but it is the little things that show that the developers are dedicated and want to deliver a good product.\n\n**Update of review after release of 1. update (14.Sept.2016)**\nThe developers are great!

I have no doubt he wants to keep adding more depending on the community.\nThere is a true tutorial which runs you through gun controls, movement and then the editor.\nThere are a couple other target modes and wave shooter modes, they were fun, but I only played them a short time so I could get back to making my own level.\nI recommend to anyone who likes to tinker and make their own scenes.", "timestamp_created": 1473379097, "timestamp_updated": 1473379097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25410288": {"recommendationid": "25410288", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970581839", "num_games_owned": 497, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508343045}, "language": "english", "review": "i love the target shooting range its like point blank\nthe forest takes way too long though\ni hope they make more target range stuff", "timestamp_created": 1473339901, "timestamp_updated": 1473339901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25409793": {"recommendationid": "25409793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042913113", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 208, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476577594}, "language": "english", "review": "<<UPDATE>>\n\nOk, so I played a bit longer and here's what I've found so far.\n\nThe game needs polishing. There are lots of good features, especially the editor, but everything feels like it needs a few more passes for quality. The graphics are decent, but they could be better. The sounds are decent, but they could be more crystal.\n\nThat being said, the editor is so easy that I just stumbled upon how to do it. I think that means that it's intuitive as I'm usually easily discouraged by interfaces that require more than a few steps to navigate. Within seconds I was shooting deer, a busted up car, and some soldiers that I had placed in the world. \n\nThat was enough to passively teach me how to create entire levels. \n\nAI animations could be tweaked a bit, and behavior could also use a once-over. \n\nThe true test with this game will be how disciplined the developer is. If he/she commits to this game, releases regular updates and tweaks, this title will be amazing. I'm hoping for the best. \n\nStill, at the price point offered, it's a good value for the money, especially with the possibility of future additions and tweaks. \n\n<<END>>\n\nI will update this as I've played more, but what I played so far was pretty neat. \n\nThere are a lot of options, the controls make sense, and there's a tutorial level/environment which clearly explains each of the mechanics so you don't go into the game asking \"How the hell do I do this!?!?!?\"\n\nFor H3 fans, this is probably ideal.\n\nFor now, I'm giving it a thumbs up, as it didn't rub me the wrong way in the short time I've played it.\n\nThis is usually a good sign as the most common VR bad game sign is when a game feels like it's been thrown together. \n\nThis one just feels right.",

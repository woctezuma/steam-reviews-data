Were my expectations out of order? Not at all. This is a great game, just like their previous offering. They show a lot of strength in gameplay, and paint out an art style that is simple, but pleasing. I think the devs did well to balance all the aspects of game production; in which it allowed them to produce one of the best polished VR games out there. I'd dare say, I even like it more than full on offerings like that of Fallout 4 VR. This developer knows how to best utilize VR, in this reviewers opinion. \n\nDo yourself a favor and pick this up.

You play an escapee fleeing a mysterious and oppressive government and its drones. Oh, and you get to pilot a train a lot during your escape too.\n\nGameplay in Conductor is split between train travel and pit stops where you explore your surroundings and solve puzzles in order to allow the train to progress further. At a certain point you get a sort of gravity gun to use both for puzzle solving and for dealing with aerial threats (e.g. slamming them into the ground). The train riding sections were actually very cozy and there\u2019s even a radio to play with while you wait for the train to arrive at the next stop. Of course to get there safely you will need to keep shoveling coal into the furnace, vent pressure when necessary, and be sure to come to a complete stop before any hazards on the tracks.\n\nDespite its 90 minute length, Conductor was one of the more enjoyable VR experiences I\u2019ve had, even with the awkward dialogue.

I think I finished the whole game in an hour and a half.\n\nWhich is really it's only problem. A longer experience with choices that influence where you go and how the story unfolds would have made Conductor an absolute gem.\n\nYou drive a train, which needs coal and some basic supervision to keep running. Putting coal in the burner and lighting it with the match, then keeping the pressure in the boiler down whilst driving.\n\nThis is when you start to meet your obstacles / puzzles. Some of them are quite simple, others had me scratch my head a little, but it wasn't long before I engaged my critical thinking and I was underway again. There are plenty of obvious clues if you're paying attention.\n\nI really wish this was a more fleshed out experience though. I kept imagining that you would be able to choose your direction. By switiching the tracks and heading off towards that town you could see in distance, or you wanted to go through a scenic pass. \nThough the game is set at night so there isn't much to see at all whilst driving the train. Shame, some nice views would have suited Conductor.\n\nI enjoyed shovelling coal, though I wished the hopper didn't have infinite coal. Perhaps a long the way you would need to fill it back up, or even refill the boiler with water. \nPerhaps you would find another train yard on your journey, and could pick yourself a whole new train! That would have been cool.\n\nMultiplayer would make this an interesting experience too. Trying to figure out puzzles with a buddy would be wonderful.\n\nI read a couple of reviews here talking about bugs. At one part I lost a key component that I was holding onto leaving me unable to progress. But I wasn't that far in, so I just restarted the game making sure to be more careful moving around next time. Checkpoint saves would have been nice at each stop to ease this issue.\n\nI get the impression the Dev team is a small one. I hope they do well, I'd like to see more games from them. Hopefully longer and more fleshed out experiences!\n\nI'll be using this game as one of my VR demonstrations when friends are round though.

It certainly gives you a goal; clear the path for your train. This is a good objective except for the fact that it's so easily interchangable between other things (unlock the door, turn on the light, play the game, Etc.). Actually driving the train isn't fun, it's a lot of swinging your head around to grab coal and then throwing your headset off your face. It's basically a minigame that involves managing your fuel and heat, all while fighting drones. The drones are not well designed enemies. They're loud, attack with slow projectiles that must be dodged, and can only be killed by slowly moving them into the environment with a gravity gun rip off. There are bugs that completely break the game, puzzle element fall out of existence and from what I can tell, only some of them are set to respawn when leaving the map.\n\nIt's too short for too much money.

A few seconds of sound and it a little flicker and then no sound. I had to play from earlier saves to fix it. That happened twice.

Without spoiling too much, the plot is roughly this:\n\"You're on the run from a group of people who refer to you by your \"subject\" number. Before you is a steam locomotive. Go!\"\n\nDriving the train is an absolute joy, from tossing coal into the furnace and lighting it, to the iconic whistle (Toot toot!).\n\nConductor is *fairly* light on story, but there are written passages kicking around for you to find which hint at what's going on.\n\nYour primary objective though is to keep on running down the track, stopping at each station to solve puzzles in order to clear the way ahead. \n\nThe minimalist art style works really well in that after a minute or two, you don't even notice. The models are really well made so the lack of surface texture feels intended rather than a lack of effort.\n\nThe puzzles themselves aren't *fiendishly* difficult, but I did have to stop and think a few times. When stuck, I found it was just that I hadn't quite explored enough. When you do solve the puzzles it's incredibly satisfying. I recall one which at first elicited a \"No way...\" followed by belly laughs as the solution unfolded. It's a great experience.\n\nMotion controllers are a must for this one, so if you're on a mobile, you'll need to dig out the PS-Eyes and Moves. I can't guarantee it'll work, but there's only trigger, grab and forward/back/left/right needed so nothing particularly exotic.\n\nSteam have a sale on at the moment (06/08/17) with a great price for both Conductor and Abode (which is also great fun, but with fewer trains unfortunately), so if you've got a Rift or a Vive, and you like the idea of driving a steam train in the dark, get it immediately.\n\nIf you're on mobile with PS-Move, it *might* be worth a shot, but I can't say for sure. You can get away with forward only tracking because there's snap turning, but 360 tracking would be ideal.\n\nIt's not the longest title in the world (I completed it in an hour and a half according to Steam), but it's a lot of fun!", "timestamp_created": 1501983615, "timestamp_updated": 1501983615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586466", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34050150": {"recommendationid": "34050150", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968334235", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501981889}, "language": "french", "review": "Jeu VR Hors du commun ! \n\nVoila une exp\u00e9rience VR qui m\u00e9rite d'etre soulign\u00e9 !

The game is played from a first-person point of view, and everything is life-sized. You move by teleporting - aim your controller, and a circle appears on the ground where you will teleport to. I did not feel dizzy or nauseous at any time. \n\nThe plot is minimal: you're on the run from people who want to kill or capture you. It's never explained why, as far as I could tell. You escape from what looks like a hospital room, and find a small train - just a locomotive with a coal bin. Your first task is to figure out how to start the train and get it moving. Every once in a while, you come upon some kind of obstruction on the tracks. You exit the train, and figure out how to remove the obstruction. Usually this involves a number of steps: find item, use item, which opens up another item, use new item, which opens up another item...and eventually you can remove whatever is obstructing the train tracks. Then you get back on the train, and move to the next obstruction. The puzzles range from obvious to hard in difficulty. \n\nAt your first stop, you pick up a gravity gun. You use this gun to pick up objects. You can either draw the objects to you, or fling them away from you. A cool idea, and implemented very well. It is essential to some of the puzzles. \n\nThe game takes place at night. It is pitch black outside of the pools of light given off by the train lights and lanterns, which limits what you can see. This adds to the \"creepy\" factor. \nAt one point, I tried to wander too far away from the train, and a message came up saying that if I went any further, I would die. An inelegant way to limit movement, but effective. \n\nSteam shows that I spent about 2 hours playing the game before finishing it. The end was a bit abrupt, and I was left saying, \"That's all?\" I guess the ultimate compliment for a game is that I wished that there was more of it. \n\nOverall, this was a fun, if short game. I recommend it if you're into puzzle type games.\n\nI also wanted to compliment the developer. At one point, I had an issue with the game, and asked about it on the Steam forums. The developer answered back the very next day, which solved my issue. In the very next patch, a few days later, a fix was made to the game which ensured that no one else would encounter my problem. Great service!\n\nBugs: There was a problem with sound. After loading a saved game, I would be able to play normally, except that all sound stopped after about 10 - 20 seconds. I would have to exit the game completely, and then reload before sound would start again. \n\n*** mild spoiler ***\nThere are no jump scares.

That didn't happen this time.\n\nMaybe it was the lack of textures, some visual glitches, having remote controls instead of hands or the fact that the objects were repeated too much on every level.\n\n* The story\nExtremely linear and simple.\nThe way you find the Half-Life tractor beam didn't make any sense to me.\nThe end was so abrupt it left a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\n* The price\nIn order for this game to have gotten a hands-up from me should have costed less than $5.\nIMHO It's not good enough for $10.\nI.E., I paid less for another puzzle game that took me 4.5 hours to complete, had better graphics and story.\n\nThe impression I got at the end of the game is the developers were lazy because they could have made a much better game if they had put a little more work.\n\nI didn't return it because I want to support the developers. At the same time, I want the buyers to know what they will be getting for their money.\n\nYou should only buy it if you are a fanatic of the genre, you don't care about graphics and you want to support the development of more of this kind of games. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends for this price though.", "timestamp_created": 1494539672, "timestamp_updated": 1495127743, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31672637": {"recommendationid": "31672637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150725768", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496767022}, "language": "english", "review": "[i][b]\"FOOOOUUUURRRR HOOOOUUUURRRRS?!!!!\"[/b][/i]\n-Angry Joe\n\nThis is what video game critic Angry Joe yells when he realized that he paid $40-$60 on a game that only lasted, you guessed it, 4 hours.

There are several obstacles along the way where you are forced to stop, and you have to solve puzzles to remove them. These puzzles are of the right difficulty for me, which is rather good as I don't find them too frustrating,yet challenging enough. Along the way while you ride the train, drones will appear to kill you, so you have to throw item to smash it down. They often appear while you are riding, so its most likely you have to toss the coal at them using the grav gun.

This time there are more story elements (while still very minor) and instead of being confined to two rooms, you traverse several locations alongside a train track and you have a handy tool at your disposal: a gravity gun.\n\n(TL;DR conclusion at the bottom; review intentionally omits specifics about puzzles to avoid spoiling the game)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Visuals[/b]\n\nConductor follows Abode art style as it presents itself in a texture-less environment, but nevertheless, in VR it is actually more immersive than those poorly put together games that use realistic textures but no coherent art direction. Here most areas feel very well put together and have more detail in terms of geometry than other similarly, small VR games. The darkness surrounding you makes the game feel atmospheric and leads to nice gameplay interactions between using spot lights to illuminate certain areas, though, I wish the dark atmosphere would have been used in more puzzles.\n\nOne negative point I have to mention here is that even on a GTX 1080 there have been some areas that suffer from some frame drops when shadows get activated. There has been a patch since I've played the game that says it brings some performance improvements, however, I've already finished the more cluttered areas that show those problems when writing this review.\n\n[b]Sound[/b]\n\nThere are 3 music tracks in the game that run in a radio which sound great, otherwise the game seems to lack ambient sounds. There are nice sound FX when throwing around items, generators buzz, but I do miss more ambient sounds to sell the environment.\n\nThere is some voice over which is of mediocre quality, but it isn't detracting. Generally from a sound perspective this game neither excels nor fails dramatically, it is just mediocre.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nLike in their previous game, Abode, here you are confronted with obstacles to overcome. Some are easier, some had me stumped, but generally they felt fair and unique. Often the environment itself was the key which forced you to explore the area to find a solution. The puzzles generally are of higher quality than other contemporary 'Escape the room' VR games out there. The developers have struck a good balance between challenging and not too frustrating, creating a good 'flow' of the game.\n\nMovement is done via teleportation and traveling by train and both work fine in this game.\n\nAs in other VR games you can grab stuff with your hands, here you can also grab and throw items via a gravity gun. The item interaction can be a bit buggy at times when there is seemingly a conflict in collision which should be looked into (same problem was present in 'Abode'; speculation time: maybe using the VRTK's interaction and grab mechanism don't work that well here and maybe NewtonVR may be more appropiate for their next game)\n\nThere are some light combat elements with the gravity gun as well, but they do not feel very meaningful. The puzzle element is the focus of this game.\n\n[b]Comparison to similar games [/b]\n\nThere are quite a lot of puzzle games or 'escape the room' games coming out for VR and in my opinion Conductor can easily be ranked among the best ones. While it does not have the same amount of polish as 'I Expect You To Die', it is also sold at a lower price point. Compared to 'Abode' the game has a bigger scope, more story elements and a more atmospheric world. However, some puzzles felt overly simplistic compared to some in Abode and could have be done differently.\n\nStill compared to many other VR puzzle games like 'The Cabin', 'The Ruins' etc., here the puzzles actually feel satisfying and aren't a simple hunt for a key.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Conclusion [/b]\n\nIf you liked 'Abode' or 'I Expect you To Die', then this is a no-brainer at its current price. This is a game studio that knows how to make puzzles and create a satisfying feeling of progression. While there are some bugs and some parts of the games could have benefited from more polish, overall this is still one of the most enjoyable VR games I've played.\n\nMy wishlist for their next game would include:\n- More intricate puzzles\n- More puzzles involving the environment\n- More work on ambient sounds\n- A more robust item interaction-physics/collision system", "timestamp_created": 1494240098, "timestamp_updated": 1494240202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617259", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31617847": {"recommendationid": "31617847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016826683", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495337745}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like an escape room but you're riding a train. \n\nI don't have much to say other than that it's not all that long but I found it pretty enjoyable.

The puzzles are short and fun to figure out, the world that you play in is mysterious, and the steam powered train is a really cool way to progress in a VR game. (Also, the music is really good and makes the atmosphere much better)\n\nThis game does have its flaws though. It is short. I beat the game in ninty minutes. I play alot of puzzle games so I can fly through some puzzles. So, realistically the game would be an hour and a half to two hours tops. I did run into some frame rate issues where it would drop during some puzzle sequences, but not bad enough to make me sick. (Graphics card is GTX 970)\n\nPros:\n+ Visuals (works very well in VR)\n+ Puzzles (short but fun)\n+ Music (increases the mystery in the world)\n+ World (interesting take on the apocalypse)\n+++ Progession system (train, would ride for 90 more minutes)\n\nCons:\n- Frame rate (dips a little GTX 970)\n- Little story (interesting but not really there)\n- A little clunky (gravity gun does not always turn on)\n\nPros and/or Cons:\n+/- Length (around 2 hours)\n+/- Light combat (helps keep the tensity up, but clunky)\n+/- Voice acting (nice that it is there, but not great performances)\n+/- mobility (only way to move is teleporting)\n\nOverall, I am happy I spent the ten dollars and would recommend this game for people who enjoy puzzle games.

Good puzzles so far too.   I get motion sick easily with involuntary movement.  A lot of games will narrow the field of view to compensate for this.  I found it interesting that while the train is moving the light on the train helps to give that narrow field of view.  This was either on purpose or to make it creepy or both.

The game begins with our heroes being rescued by a small eel fishing vessel that\u2019s been lost at sea. The majority of the game takes place in the city of Port Artue which is only mentioned in Chapter 1.\n\nPort Artue is a place full of corruption. Where the rich spend all their time at Club Temba and the poor (Misters) are left doing the work. Upon arrival in Port Artue they\u2019re confronted by the police chief, Barlow. Bwana and Kito are arrested and Lina and her book are taken elsewhere.\n\nIn this chapter, the game engine has seen an upgrade and it renders Port Artue in beautiful fashion. The city is beautifully detailed and it still utilizes it\u2019s hand drawn 2D/3D mixture to winning effect. The game also features a section with rain effects and the puddles of water shining on the ground are quite impressive. The lighting effects have also seen an upgrade and they really add to the atmosphere in many areas. The cinema\u2019s lights are the most impressive I felt.\n\nMuch like the first game, this game features a superb soundtrack. This time it uses a more jazz oriented theme and it sounds amazing. It fits the city of Port Artue perfectly and it really adds to the atmosphere. There were quite a few really catchy songs in this game, including the main menu theme once it got going.\n\nThis chapter is also an hour longer than chapter 1 as well. I clocked in at 4.3 hours to completion. I completed Chapter 1 in 3.3 hours by comparison. The chapter features a large variety of puzzles and they\u2019re always fun to solve.\n\nOverall, The Journey Down Chapter 2 was a superb continuation to Bwana\u2019s journey and I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough. The game features a great story, an excellent soundtrack, gorgeous artwork, and a great cast of interesting characters. It\u2019s a great game all around and it makes me excited to see how Bwana\u2019s story will end in the final chapter.\n\nIf you'd like to see my final score for the game, be sure to visit us here: http://www.endworldgaming.com/adventure/the-journey-down-chapter-2-review", "timestamp_created": 1508519481, "timestamp_updated": 1508519481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455442", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35783605": {"recommendationid": "35783605", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969262668", "num_games_owned": 959, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458399668}, "language": "english", "review": "The adventure continues!

Kingsport Bay, we continue a little bit after Chapter One ended. We left Brawna, Kito, and Lina just as they flew away from Kingsport Bay, but with forgetting gas they were left to drift around in the water. Till a boat happened to catch them in their net. Without a lighthouse to guide and a thick fog surrounding them, arriving at land may be difficult to do. At this time, you can also go to Kito for a story recap.\n\nEventually, you will get back on land after getting a few objects to help in navigating through dense fog. We can\u2019t have a part of the story based on being on a boat the whole time after all. After docking, we find out that the mysterious place plagued with thick fog is Port Artue. Port Artue is not like Kingsport Bay, corruption runs rampant throughout the higher ups. With St. Armando Power Company possibly being the main link to why corruption has taken Port Artue, leaving those doing the work to keep the town running wallowing in a bar. So when a police officer takes the Journal of the Journey Down by force, well, it may not be a surprise to the residents but a surprise to us. \n\nInstead of grabbing some parts of an airplane, here we deal with the corruption of Port Artue as well as helping the town get back on it\u2019s feet. All leading towards getting the Journal of the Journey Down back and hopefully get to the Underland safely. A lot of questions that were brought up in Chapter One gains some more development in this installment, having played out in this very town.\n\nThe puzzles take up the same mantle to solve them. A lot of them are really easy to figure out, with the hints portrayed by dialogue or by other objects needing items that will lead to the puzzle being solved. At times you will get to points where you have to get something, which can stem into a few other puzzles to solve to gain that particular item to advance. However, the last puzzle of the game does hike in difficulty as only half of it is hinted at. \n\nAs we left Kingsport Bay and arrived at Port Artue, we are able to see a whole new area meant to be a town rather than a few places meant to service those visiting. In terms of art style, you still get hand drawn backgrounds and modeled characters based on African tribal masks. With being in more of a town, you do get the sense of people living here and the possible scope of it. With a few interesting ways they show traveling as they focus on colors rather than detailed line art. The sense of Port Artue being a port is also shown by the differing face shapes and accents the new characters possess. \n\nThe sound quality has gone up but not quite there. I often found that some characters had a higher volume than Brawna or the other way around. There were instances where you did expect their voices to go lower, whispering to themselves a realization they had, but there were some instances where Brawna\u2019s voice was lower than the background music and became harder to hear him. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the soundtrack still holds the same quality as the last chapter. Unlike before, two different composers worked to give Port Artue a unique powerful jazz feel. Even if you never found out that there were different composers, it is hard to tell as both blend in together nicely that it may as well of been done by one person.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n+ Soundtrack\n+ Visuals\n+ Sense of Port Artue being a popular spot to dock/live \n+ Character design\n+ Logical puzzles\n\n- Dialogue volume differs between characters and can cause some lines to be lower than the music\n\nThe second chapter to The Journey Down is undoubtedly better than the first. While we only got questions and the adventure just underway in the previous installment, we come into this closer to the mystery of why the Underland is so important to keep on the down low. With the questions we were left with, we finally get some development on them as we explore the corrupt Port Artue. While you do get a recap on the story, I do suggest playing the first chapter.", "timestamp_created": 1507068963, "timestamp_updated": 1507068963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574490", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35442972": {"recommendationid": "35442972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072812047", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486072041}, "language": "swedish", "review": "A refreshingly funny and well-written comedy adventure trilogy, with top notch voice acting, surprisingly good and super-stylized cel-shaded graphics and an entertainingly charming(albeit sometimes a bit confusing in its mythology) neo noir-meets-african-folklore-story.

Ho gi\u00e0 [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TommyVercetti_ITA/recommended/220090/]recensito[/url] il primo capitolo; in questa rassegna mi soffermer\u00f2 pi\u00f9 che altro sulle differenze tra i due e sugli elementi inediti, evitando per quanto possibile le cose dette precedentemente.\n\nLa storia continua da dove era rimasta: Bwana, Kito e Lina, precipitati in mare, vengono recuperati da un peschereccio e portati in salvo nella citt\u00e0 insulare di Port Artue, ma non appena mettono piede sulla terraferma scoprono di essersi fatti un pericoloso nemico. E non \u00e8 il solo.\n\nRispetto al capitolo precedente, [b]The Journey Down: Chapter Two[/b] presenta una ben pi\u00f9 spiccata atmosfera noir, con tanto di gangster, autorit\u00e0 corrotte e fuorilegge intoccabili. Ho gi\u00e0 parlato delle somiglianze con [i]Grim Fandango[/i]; in questa seconda parte sembra effettivamente di essere capitati in una vera e propria [i]Rubacava[/i] parallela. Lo squallido bar e il club da benestanti, gli scaricatori di porto senza un soldo e il rispettato capo della polizia chiaramente invischiato in loschi affari, gli amici da salvare (o che vi salveranno!) e gli sgherri mafiosi senza piet\u00e0 riescono a creare, attraverso la loro contrapposizione, l'immagine di una citt\u00e0 essenzialmente popolata da personaggi di dubbia moralit\u00e0, che siano ricchi o poveri. Per fortuna non mancano alcune anime buone, e saranno queste le persone a cui si dovr\u00e0 affidare Bwana.\nAnche in questo capitolo \u00e8 presente una forte carica umoristica che bilancia bene l'atmosfera noir, a tratti troppo seriosa, senza mai sfociare nel ridicolo. Bwana e Kito rimangono un duo spassoso, con Lina spesso costretta a rimproverare le loro spiritosaggini.\n\nLa grafica \u00e8 davvero splendida: le ambientazioni, ancora una volta dipinte a mano, sembrano quasi reali. Gli sviluppatori sono persino riusciti a rendere l'effetto della pioggia in modo davvero convincente. Oltre agli sfondi, ho particolarmente apprezzato il design della nave pirata dei Sisulus, che sembra quasi uscita da un [i]Final Fantasy[/i] e che \u00e8 stata un'aggiunta inaspettata. Infine, se non consideriamo [spoiler]lo scontro \"finale\" tra Barlow e i gangster, in cui questi ultimi cadono come birilli attratti da una gravit\u00e0 10 volte maggiore[/spoiler], i filmati sono ben fatti e ben animati.\n\nIl comparto sonoro \u00e8 pari se non migliore rispetto a quello del gioco precedente. Le melodie reggae sono quasi completamente scartate a favore di musiche jazz e swing in stile [i]Grim Fandango[/i] che rendono l'atmosfera noir ancora pi\u00f9 immersiva, con la partecipazione della band [i]Straight No Chaser[/i]. Ogni tonalit\u00e0, che sia nelle scene di gioco o nei filmati, mi \u00e8 sembrata azzeccata e gradevole.\n\nIn questo capitolo sono presenti molti personaggi che vanno e vengono, e hanno tutti una qualche particolarit\u00e0 che li fa sembrare ben pi\u00f9 di semplici comparse. Detto questo, non c'\u00e8 nessuno che spicchi per memorabilit\u00e0, e alcuni mi sono sembrati poco sfruttati, come la \"regina\" dei pirati Sisulus, per esempio. Mi sarebbe anche piaciuto sapere cosa ne \u00e8 stato di alcuni personaggi dopo la partenza da Port Artue, ma lo svolgimento della trama lo rendeva proibitivo.\n\n[i](Ricordo ancora una volta che sia sottotitoli che doppiaggio non sono disponibili in italiano)[/i]\nAnche qui la [b]SkyGoblin[/b] ha giocato molto sugli accenti delle diverse persone che popolano il mondo di gioco: dal pescatore australiano della S.S. Biko ad Andiswa, con accento africano, ai due loschi scaricatori di porto che ricordano i gangster americani nel parlare, fino a personaggi come Morten, Raynolds e Joe che non riesco a identificare, ma che possiedono ciascuno una parlata particolare. Questi piccoli dettagli, se notati, rendono l'ambientazione davvero vibrante e distinta.\nAnche il doppiaggio stesso \u00e8 apprezzabile: \u00e8 addirittura migliore rispetto al capitolo precedente. L'unico che un po' stona, a parer mio - e mi dispiace dirlo -, \u00e8 proprio Bwana, che appare pi\u00f9 esagerato e fin troppo entusiasta, ma per fortuna nei limiti accettabili.\n\nLa difficolt\u00e0 \u00e8 ancora una volta bassa. Tutta l'avventura si pu\u00f2 risolvere col puro ragionamento logico senza neanche stare troppo a pensare. L'unico punto critico riguarda forse il terminale, ma se si fa attenzione ai dialoghi si capisce come avanzare. La durata \u00e8 di circa 6 ore, il doppio del capitolo 1, e anche in questo caso la fine lascia la narrazione alquanto in sospeso.\n\nNon ho incontrato bug particolari. L'unica cosa che mi ha fatto storcere il naso \u00e8 la presenza di errori di scrittura, e non parlo solo dei due puntini di sospensione al posto di tre (che, a tutto dire, c'erano anche nel primo capitolo). Ci\u00f2 a cui mi riferisco \u00e8 il libro di navigazione, che ha delle imprecisioni davvero fastidiose: cose tipo \"it's\" al posto di \"its\" come aggettivo possessivo e \"you're\" al posto di \"your\" abbassano la qualit\u00e0 del gioco, e non c'\u00e8 scusa che tenga dal momento che un qualsiasi correttore di bozze madrelingua avrebbe potuto controllare e correggere le linee di testo in meno di una giornata.\n\nUn'ultima critica va ad alcuni elementi del gioco poco sfruttati. Escludendo i pirati Sisulus gi\u00e0 menzionati, mi sarebbero piaciuti ulteriori enigmi basati sul libro di navigazione; inoltre l'ultimissima parte sarebbe potuta essere un po' pi\u00f9 lunga.\n\nPer concludere, [b]The Journey Down: Chapter Two[/b] \u00e8 un solido punta-e-clicca dotato di buone ambientazioni, grafica gradevole e personaggi interessanti. La semplicit\u00e0 degli enigmi e la durata non troppo elevata potrebbero lasciare un pizzico di amaro in bocca una volta finito il gioco, ma nel complesso l'avventura di Bwana, Kito e Lina non pu\u00f2 che far sorridere.

The overall amount of scenes and puzzles do not increase, and the game remains very linear, but all of this contributes to a laid back and relaxed atmosphere that is emphatized by the soundtrack used, which - once again - is one step above the one used in the first chapter (and truth to be said, that one was good already!). \n\nThe characters are very well thought of, and despite being maybe a bit too close to the classic \"good\" or \"bad\" guys, they're very, very, precisely designed in every aspect, from their appeareance, to their voice acting, to the dialogues (the way they behave). More importantly, the 3 characters which appeared in the first chapter retain the same voice actor, and they benefit so much of it! Bwana still feels so funky, and you can't help but feel for him :) , same as for Kito, his friend. Other than Lina, all of the other characters are new but the voice over is very well executed with quite some personality (i've seen several triple A titles using far lower quality voice over job than the one you'll have the chance to listen in this game).\n\nGameplay wise, it's still more or less the same from the previous chapter except for more depth: you happen to came across a tool not working or someone needing some object(s), and you'll have to end up finding or crafting it. It's very basic, it might require a bit more thinking at times, but not that much either. Everything is well laid out, well within your sight. and even the inventory doesn't ever get too full of items you don't need.\n\nNow, a big, important role is played by the music: i happened, more than once, to literally stop playing only to listen to the beatiful, relaxing, chilling music this game offers! It really is one of the few titles i can think of which has such a fitting and well done soundtrack which is contributing so much to the atmosphere. Well done! \n\nWhat else? The game only lasts a few hours, but i dare to say it lasts the right amount of time. Every aspect is well thought of, you might happen to need to backtrack sometimes but it won't be a issue, time-wise (Port Artue is a very small town, it seems).\n\nI don't usually complete a review with a vote, but if i had to i would rate this 8,7 out of 10 at the very least.", "timestamp_created": 1489353622, "timestamp_updated": 1489353622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560304", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30477702": {"recommendationid": "30477702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139007144", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489346176}, "language": "german", "review": "Gutes Spiel mit sch\u00f6nem Humor und stimmiger Musik.", "timestamp_created": 1489346223, "timestamp_updated": 1489346223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30472260": {"recommendationid": "30472260", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969031618", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489329956}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a step up from the first episode.

Also their play times are very short individually. Even though i like to explore every detail in such games, it took me about 7.5 hours in total to complete both chapters.\n\nTL;DR: Get it if you like pointing, clicking, humor, a bit noir style, a bit mystery, the good old jazz and Bob Marley. :)\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\n\nThe Journey Down is a very nice point & click style adventure game with humor that i would recommend to anybody who likes the genre. If you decide to buy, get the both chapters together. The game doesn't have tedious parts like some members of this genre does. You don't have to watch your character walk for ages, it skips to the place if you double click.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nThe story is not the most amazing one i've seen in a point & click style game but it's decent enough. It has some mystery elements and can make you curious at some points. In short, not amazing but good enough to keep you playing.\n\n[u]Puzzles[/u]\nMost of the time the puzzles are pretty easy. You usually know what you need to do when you first see an item ,if not, you can figure out quickly. The game is rather relaxing than pushing you hard to solve a puzzle.\n\n[u]Characters[/u]\nThe characters are cool and their accents are really fun. Their heads are inspired by african tribal masks. You play as a young guy named Bwana. There are two other main characters named Kito and Lina. I liked all of the characters in the game especially our guy Bwana.\n\n[u]Art and Atmosphere[/u]\nThe art design is very charming. The game has a nice carribean and also noir atmosphere. The hand drawn places look wonderful. \n\n[u]Soundtracks[/u]\nOne of the best things about the game ,besides its art design, is it's soundtracks. It includes some reggae and jazz tunes and the soundtracks become more jazzy in second chapter. The music fits well with the atmosphere of the game.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Charming atmosphere\n[*]Likeable characters\n[*]Beautiful art design\n[*]Awesome soundtracks\n[*]Good enough story\n[*]Fun accents\n[*]Character animations are not tedious\n[*]Gives you access to some nice behind the scene content when you finish a chapter\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Short play time\n[*]Places are somehow limited, not many different places\n[*]Puzzles are too easy sometimes, they don't require much thinking\n[*]Sometimes it feels like things are happening faster and easier than it should (or is it just me?)\n", "timestamp_created": 1468524312, "timestamp_updated": 1468524312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501360", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24313054": {"recommendationid": "24313054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034818783", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468496731}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recuerda mucho a Grim Fandango", "timestamp_created": 1468496473, "timestamp_updated": 1468496473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24245323": {"recommendationid": "24245323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121676772", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468205779}, "language": "english", "review": "Chapter Two of the Journey Down was very satisfying after completing Chapter One.

This is in part due to the nature of Port Artue, the game's main location, set in the confines of a dark mist. Consequently, pitch black darkness and haze envelops most scenes' skylines instead of the warm hues of dusk, city lights and waterfront of the first game.\n\nThe visuals look great as a general rule, though some of the art panels are manifestly sketchier. It is never too distracting but it feels lightly inconsistent with the other fully realized backgrounds. Many scenes feel monochromatic, whereas the first game was resolutely more lively. The music is also somewhat less festive but just as effective most of the time.\n\nRegardless of the change in tone, the game hasn't really lost much of its charm. Its characters and situations are truly enjoyable. The first half of the game features less of the cinematic moments and animated transitions. Whereas Chapter One felt more immediate, Chapter Two takes some time to build up into a genuinely fun experience. It picks up tremendous momentum about halfway through, and ultimately reaches the simple greatness of its shorter debut episode.\n\nBwana remains one of the most original and charismatic characters I've played in point-and-click adventure games. While a lot of his success resides on pure luck, he's delightedly never portrayed as an idiot or incompetent. Puzzles are generally fairly obvious and pleasant to solve, focusing more on the story than on challenging enigmas.\n\nThe story unmistakably sets the stage for the third and final chapter but is still satisfyingly conclusive on its own. Chapter Two is nearly twice as long as Chapter One.

Storyline:\nThe story-line is very linear. A P&C game has to be linear to some degree by necessity, and I have no problem with this, but this is taken to the extreme here. Commonly you have some degree of choice in which order you want to accomplish certain tasks, e.g. some tasks that require completions of several puzzles could be done in your order of choice. In this game the path is set and it is pretty clear what is required as the next step at every moment decreasing the illusion of having an influence on the storyline...\n\nAlso, it feels like there is a lot of the story that was lost on the way, like the release was somewhat rushed before the game was finished. E.g. there is a map that you find early in the game indicating many places that are not available in the game. The game design with the taxi makes me think there were bigger plans from start...\n\n2. Difficulty/challenge:\nI guess this is the most difficult aspect to get right with a P&C game. If puzzles are too hard you get stuck all the time, feel stupid, and the gameplay is not very enjoyable. If too easy, the game feels less meaningful and you do not get the nice feeling of accomplishment. This game was on the \"too easy\" part of the scale. Puzzles were very easy and combined with the linerar storyline, there was no point in the game where I had to stop and think. On the plus-side, although not very challenging, puzzles were generally logical and did not rely on pixel hunting...\n\n3. Length:\nPerhaps as a product of the two points above, the game felt very short. Being decently affordable and presented as an episode of a game rather tha a full game, perhaps this is to be expected. I guess that the unfinished feeling of lost intrigue/parts of the game, emphasize this feeling even more though...\n\nVerdict:\nDespite its shortcomings, the game has a certain charm to it and it was generally enjoyable. I will likely pick up part 3 when available.

I don't mind at all. Chapter Two of The Journey Down series is an experience pretty much any point and click fan should play through. It pulls of a pleasant balance of noir and infectious positivity, optimism, backed with undeniable visual stylishness and a superb soundtrack that couldn't be more fitting than it is. Now, I might not like all the aspects of the graphics - something about the main character just doesn't sit with me for example - and he's not the only one, but, face it, pulling off a genuinely atmospheric blend of jazzy noir with African tribal art and a mild dash of rasta culture, perhaps, is worthy of respect. The chapter functions well on its own - my memories of the first chapter are beyond fuzzy, but the game does well to explain the background and add and expand the, again, quite original and interesting lore. It does get silly, beyond silly at times, but that grates far less than it does in some other games. The cast of characters is more or less interesting, tropes or not too, some of them memorable, with some obvious hat-tipping going on around. The game is, as can be seen from my playing time, short, and I'll add easy. I AM a seasoned p&c player, but I've played through most of it @ 4AM with half my brain working likely, and the rest, including the final puzzle(s) did not pose much of a problem. You won't or at least shouldn't be wandering around aimlessly, you can't make a mistake really, everything is more or less dead obvious if you listen/read and remember what's there. Only one puzzle, with a car, had me wandering around pixelhunting (not needed in the game really) until I used an item that's really not THAT obvious or hinted at. But hey, as the old p&c adage goes... \"when stuck, use everything on everything\", right? Eh. Another plus is that, despite it being short, it doesn't feel as short as it is. All in all, a sequel superior to the original that left me wanting more. Will definitely get the third chapter once it's out.

It's even better than Chapter One, which, while solid, felt almost like a demo or introduction to the game world, without revealing too much of its history and lore. This chapter gets into the real meat of the story. As in the first chapter, the art design, music, characters, and puzzles are all excellent. The main character, Bwana, is hilarious, yet doesn't follow the long tradition of point-and-click (and parser-based) adventure games going back to goofballs like Roger Wilco and Larry Laffer of being an inept loser. Instead, he's more of a happy-go-lucky guy who seems to be enjoying himself no matter what he's doing.\n\nOne of the really cool things about this game is that your character, in the course of solving puzzles to progress the game, actually does a lot of good and helps quite a few people improve their lots. It makes the game even more satisfying. I did get slightly stuck here and there on puzzles, but never to the point where I needed to look online for hints. Everything was quite intuitive, and I almost always felt inspired with an idea for how to solve problems. There are lots of clever ideas in the puzzles, and a few relatively straightforward but well designed logic puzzles as well. And you do get a ton of backstory and exposition about what the heck is going on. The game ends on a big cliffhanger, and I absolutely cannot wait for the next chapter.

mehr als nur ein Pilot war. Er war auf der Suche nach den Sch\u00e4tzen des \"Underlands\", einer Welt, die man einerseits als M\u00e4rchen bezeichnete aber andererseits jegliche Nachforschungen bez\u00fcglich dieses Ortes strengstens verboten waren.\nWo ein Schatz ist, gibt es logischerweise auch Piraten oder Diebe, die diesen in die Finger bekommen wollen.\nAuf der Suche nach ihrem verschollenem Vater, treffen Bwana und Kito auf eine vielzahl kurioser Gestallten, die ihnen zu einem Gro\u00dfteil nicht gerade freundlich gesinnt sind.\n\nDie verzweigte Story, die einen immer wieder ins Gr\u00fcbeln bringt, rei\u00dft einen sofort mit. Jedoch sind einige Abschnitte zu klassisch aus einem Film mit Banden oder der Mafia entnommen. Dennoch gebe ich hier satte 8/10 Punkten.\n\n\n[h1][b]Das Gameplay:[/b][/h1]\n\nAn dieser Stelle kann ich eigentlich nur auf mein Review f\u00fcr das erste Kapitel (The Journey Down: Chapter One) verweisen; dennoch wiederhole ich es hier einfach nochmal, da es in diesem Spiel einige Extrapunkte hier und da gibt:\n\nEs ist ein simples Point&Click Spiel, bei dem es gilt, R\u00e4tsel durch Mausklick, mittels f\u00fcr normal Sterbliche unlogischen Aktionen, zu l\u00f6sen.\n\nDa es hierbei aber nicht nur das einfache Interagieren mit Gegenst\u00e4nden ist, sondern auch teilweise wirkliche Puzzel zu l\u00f6sen sind, und teilweise auch wirkliche Aktionen vom Spieler selbst gefordert sind wie etwa das Zerschlagen des Dschungeldickichts mit einer Machete oder das Zertr\u00fcmmern einer Wand mit einer Spitzhacke, vergebe ich hier 7/10 Punkten.

Still searching for the Underland, Bwana and Kito are arrested and thrown in jail while Lina is taken as hostage by the police. What will happen to our heroes?\n\nI enjoyed that point-&-click adventure because of the atmosphere. There is clearly influenced by Afro-Caribbean (as the characters are inspired from African masks but the way they're talking and the music is more from the Caribbean). Bwana still retains his cool personnality while being perhaps in another world. And that, dear gamers, that what I ask also from an adventure game: characters with a grey personnality as they're reflecting what we are: imperfect. Bwana isn't stupid. Some of his remarks show someone aware of his surrounding, feeling down because of his father's disappearance. Kito, his \"street\" brother, is a genius when it comes to engineering, despite his cool attitude. Lyna, well-mannered, stays polite and provides information on what may happen in the background. She's never pressuring the boys, apart when they foiled her plan. Besides, the fact that the ambiance is also leading to a comedy game is also doing that.\n\nHere, the graphics are more \"modern\" as Port Artue seems to be more a city. The ambiance is now more jazzy, which isn't bad in itself. It's changing from the first game.\n\nAnyway, the whole game seemed to be set in a film noir though here, the police is clearly corrupt.\n\nThe game is longer than the first chapter, which is a good point, though you need imagination to find sometimes a solution. Besides, the ending is quite different: after the foggy sad town, you're on a tropical island with sun everywhere.\n\nAnyway, I'm very impatient for Chapter Three and to discover what happened really, as some twists were present in this game (not about Lina, though, despite what Bwana may think).\n\nDon't hesitate anyway: The Journey Down is really a good series.\n", "timestamp_created": 1449234933, "timestamp_updated": 1449234933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563169", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19459901": {"recommendationid": "19459901", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993589814", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449158280}, "language": "english", "review": "The Journey Down: Chapter Two is a memorable point-and-click adventure worthy of being being compared with the Monkey Island series and Grim Fandango, which obviously served as its inspirations. Every fan of adventure games knows that their overall quality has gone down quite a bit in the recent years, and it is very hard for the modern iterations to live up to the standards set by the old guard. However, while I was playing this game, I felt as if I was transported back to the 1990s. The production quality is superb, the soundtrack kicks ass and the noir atmosphere is amazing and creates the atmosphere of a 1950s noir film.\n\nMost of the puzzles are sensible and not that difficult, although some of them can be solved out of order (ahead of time), which makes you wonder \"What am I supposed to do with this item?\", until you find a use for it later.

Absolutely gorgeous level design and character modelling. \n\n* The puzzles are slightly more challenging than in Chapter One, with a healthy mix of lateral thinking, minigames, and inventory management. \n\n* Even better storytelling than Chapter One. If this started out with heavy Indiana Jones vibes, then Chapter Two brings it firmly into D!ck Tracy territory, with dirty cops, intimidating mobsters, corrupt powers-that-be, and a bleaker urban noir vibe.\n\n* Builds on the setting established in Chapter One. Fascinating, in-depth world-building, from the mistfarer trade and piracy on the \"high soup\" to the looming threat of the influential San Armando Power Company.\n\n* Quality soundtrack -- a lively mix of laid-back Caribbean island grooves and freewheeling jazz.\n\nNeedless to say, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1447806126, "timestamp_updated": 1447806151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18999858": {"recommendationid": "18999858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104334578", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447193830}, "language": "english", "review": "In short: This game is absolutely awesome.

It's part two of three, with three upcoming probably next year. This one picks up right after the cliffhanger ending of the first part and ends with another one, but the story in between does a good job of filling in more backstory and plot without hitting you over the head with a ton of exposition and setting up a couple of twists that lead to the next part. \n\nThe only real con I noticed were consistently inaccurate or misspelled captions. I expect at least one typo for any text-heavy game, but there are more in this one than I've seen in a number of amateur games. Some of the voice recordings are of a noticeably lower quality than the rest, but I only noticed that a few times. \n\nOverall, very much worth playing if you like this style of adventure game, even with the episodic nature of it.\n\nIn this particular case, I would be absolutely okay with paying full price for the soundtrack as a separate purchase, because it is that good. Also, their original composer passed away last year and apparently there's an album of his music up for purchase., from which all the proceeds go to charity.

The characters are just as charismatic as in Chapter 1 and the dialogue / story-line have an even greater sense of humour.  \n\nAdditionally, this game's VOICE actors are talented - which makes the game much more immersive.  They did an incredible job for you to relate to the characters even though they are quite simplistic visually; in a sense that their faces are all based on \"African\" or \"Caribbean\" wooden face masks but which were carefully chosen by design to portray their basic personality traits.\nNeedless to say, graphically, it's well-done. A mix of simple and complex imagery. The cut-scenes are breathtaking.  The feel of the art-style is quite fitting with the entire story / mood.\nThe puzzles increase in difficulty as the game progresses... I got stuck maybe 2-3 times for a while but it was never frustrating -  I persevered until I figured it out.  Very much satisfying! :)\n\nIn summary:  Underrated humorous point & click adventure.  I recommend that you play Chapter 1 if interested, as there is a progression to the story (**even though I noticed that they made sure via the dialogues that you would not feel lost if you hadn't played Chapter 1, so maybe not necessary?**).  The length of the game was satisfying as well, considering it took me so long to figure out the last puzzle.

You will get to spend the vast majority of this chapter in Port Artue, a city below the previous city that you played the first chapter in. The biggest difference between this chapter and the previous, though, is the fact that the pace has picked up. There's definitely some urgency, and some large obstacles standing in your way. Remember you are still trying to get to the final destination, but there's going to be people who will do anything to stop you.\n\nGraphically you are still looking at the same type and feel as the first chapter. I did like the locations of the game a bit more than the first chapter. You are in a city where it is perpetually night, but there's definitely different levels of feel and look to this chapter. You are going to see the Club Temba, you are going to see a light house, back alleys, some places you don't even want to be in, but you are going to be in. I felt like this game just looked crisper than the first. I know that sounds weird seeing as this is the same engine that powered the first, but it looked like there was more flexing of the muscles in the engine this time around.\n\nOnce again the voice acting seemed to fit the tribal masks that were put to the faces of the characters that you are going to interact with. There's also going to be a bigger cast of characters to interact with, and impressively enough all of them will be voiced. What can I say there's just something about hearing voices put to faces and characters.\n\nThe controls once again are going to be point and click. Always be on the look out for an object that just stands out, chances are you are going to need to use it, or take it in order to get through this game.\n\nAlright, so here we are, chapter 2. I really wish I could write it without doing spoilers, but there's just some that are just going to have to be said. First off you are in Port Artue. A city in that lives in a permanent night time, but seems to sparkle all the more for it. You are going to find yourself immediately on a boat that is lost at sea. Now I know its not really hard to figure out that you make it into port, but there you have it. You will then have an immediate obstacle put in your path and you are going to find that your crew of characters from the first chapter are going to be torn apart, and it is through the majority of this chapter that you are going to be trying to get them back together. There's definitely another round of puzzles, and utilization of objects in order to reach your goal. I'm going to be honest, there's going to be some head scratching at a couple of points, but if you trust in your inventory, and you are paying attention to the objects you can pick up, you should always have some sort of solution at hand. \n\nThis was definitely a stronger chapter than the first, and it definitely shows itself as giving you a hell of a lot of story, and action packed into over 3 hours of game play. Now I know that this seems like a small number for some, but you have to realize that this is a chapter, and that, in my opinion, is a good amount to play with in a chapter.

Voice volumes with from one sentence to another sometimes varied which kind of ruins the atmosphere. The music however was good, pretty much what I expected considering Chapter 1.\n\nPuzzles were most of the time pretty easy, the only puzzle that gave me a headache was where you had to guess the right code for a certain door.

Daf\u00fcr wirkte Kapitel 2 auf mich deutlich umfangreicher, auch wenn Steam behauptet, dass ich nicht f\u00fcr Teil 2 nicht viel l\u00e4nger gebraucht habe als f\u00fcr Teil 1. Je nach Spielstil ist man mit 4-5 Stunden dabei.\n\nAlles in allem ist \"The Journey Down: Chapter Two\" ein sehr gutes Spiel, dass keine gro\u00dfen Schw\u00e4che, aber viele St\u00e4rken (Grafik, Stimmung, Musik, ...) hat.\n\nVon mir gibt es daher eine klare Kaufempfehlung.

The characters are inspired by those creepy traditional African masks (Sort of like how Grim Fandango was inspired by Mexican D\u00eda de Muertos masks) and combines it with a noir setting and Rasta accents.\n\nThis game heavily relies on the environment, which, in my opinion, is a make it or break it for an adventure game. What the game lacks in story (pretty generic corrupt government tries to cover up a secret-story), the environment and atmosphere makes up for it. The hand drawn backgrounds are gorgeous, the music perfectly complements the drawn art and really adds another dimension to the noir tone of the game. \nThe dialogue is for the most part fun and clever, while sometimes it can get a little too goofy. The voice actors are doing a perfect job with the material they are given. The puzzles are one of the biggest improvements over the first game. I found the puzzles more creative and challenging in this chapter (dial a number, type in on a computer-type of puzzles).\n I was stuck a couple of times, but it never got to the point where I got so frustrated that I wanted to quit the game. The puzzles are always logical, unlike some of the older adventure games where you had to combine completely random items and go pixel hunting). If you are an experienced adventure game player they are still on the easier side, but it's certainly a huge improvement over the first chapter. \n\nThe chapter is pretty short, but for a 9 euro game it\u2019s not too bad. You should be able to complete it in one sitting. 3-5 hours.\nThe ending is pretty anticlimactic. You finally arrive to the destination you have been working towards, and the game ends. Pretty annoying, but it makes me look forward to Chapter 3.\nWhile it\u2019s not as good as the games it draws inspiration from (Notably Grim Fandango), it\u2019s still a great game with a lot of memorable moments.

Na plus jest r\u00f3\u017cnie\u017c danie graczowi mo\u017cliwo\u015bci walki oraz wykorzystanie eliksir\u00f3w (gra nigdy nie ka\u017ce ich u\u017cywa\u0107, ale jak w prawdziwym \u017cyciu - trzeba korzysta\u0107 z tego co si\u0119 znajduje i kombinowa\u0107 ;P). Mimo, \u017ce nie gra\u0142am na najwy\u017cszym poziomie to kilka by\u0142o wymagaj\u0105cych co uznaje za plus. \n\nPo trzecie fabu\u0142a: omg, to by\u0142o co\u015b fantastycznego. Zupe\u0142nie jakbym gra\u0142a w gr\u0119 z serii Assasin Creed, Dishonored czy Bioshock.

Granted, a very action-packed one for its genre.\nStill, a HOG has to include the usual elements, so after the climactic attack, the story mostly takes a backseat to add most of the hidden object scenes and some traditional puzzles expected by its audience.

It\u2019s a fun game filled with action, fun puzzles and hidden object scenes, it also has great music and visuals. While it\u2019s certainly not a perfect game having an outlandish plot, some irritating puzzles and audio issues, for the price tag I enjoyed playing it and was able to look past its flaws. Though it may not be the best hidden object game on the market it\u2019s still a good gaming experience.\n \nKate is a young fashion designer haunted by the memories of her mother\u2019s death though she soon finds out the beings responsible for this murder are now after her. Her mother was part of a secret organization that fights demons, one that dates back hundreds of years and has notable members like Jeanne d\u2019Arc and, I kid you not, Marilyn Monroe. Things get even more complicated as the dark forces have built a time machine and use it to erase the organization from existence, prompting Kate and a few survivors to commandeer it and go back in time themselves.\n \nThe plot is just all over the place and while I\u2019ve played hidden object games with weaker storylines, this one could have been better. It\u2019s completely unrealistic that Kate went from a fashion designer worrying about clothing one moment and then becomes the saviour of an entire guild of demon hunters. She has little to no training but that doesn\u2019t stop her from wielding her weapon like a pro, granted it\u2019s mainly due to the player controlling her. While I know she is the main character and thus has to be the hero, it sort of hurts the validity of the game that such a novice outshines women who have much more experience.\n \nThis is a point-and-click hidden object game so all you need is a mouse to play. You can interact with people and objects, collecting useful ones along the way. Items are stored in your inventory and some can be combined to make a new item though the game does this automatically for you. One note about the inventory is that you can lock it in place so it always minimizes when not in use, this is a pet peeve of mine. You only have a fast travel map when you\u2019re time traveling though you don\u2019t really need one in the present day since there isn\u2019t much backtracking involved. I enjoyed the variety of hidden object puzzles, while there are your basic list of items to find there are also ones where you\u2019re given a shadow of an item and have to find in a scene as well as other types. While there is also a nice variety of puzzles, some are rather frustrating and some are often just pointless. Putting a puzzle on the side of a truck is pretty silly.\n \nThis game is riddled with annoying item fetch-quests for problems that could be solved in a much easier way. One example would be when Kate has to find a shard of glass despite having a very sharp weapon always on hand. Another odd feature is that of dialogue choice, while I do think this can be fun it really has no effect whatsoever on the gameplay or story at all, thus proving to be pointless. Kate can also use special potions to grant her super strength, special sight and slow down time. An interesting feature but a needless add -on. Also, the only way to get these potions is to find figurines and add them to what seems to be a checker board that Kate somehow always carries around. Adding a new figure grants Kate a potion which is always conveniently the exact one she\u2019ll need for her next problem.\n \nOn the plus side, this game has very nice graphics with attractive character models and good animation. The colors are vibrant and nothing is too dark or hard to see. This game also has its own theme song which sounds beautiful. The lyrics are touching and the melody is very soothing but very catchy. I\u2019ve never played a hidden object game that had its own song, I actually sat through the credits a few times just to hear the full song. Sadly, the rest of the game\u2019s audio is hit or miss. While the background music and sound effects are fine, the voice acting is the issue. It\u2019s fully voice-acted but some actors aren\u2019t very good and Kate herself sometimes overacts her lines. Also, there are some problems with audio quality, as some characters sound louder than others.\n \nWhile it might seem like I\u2019m picking apart [i]Dark Angels: Masquerade of Shadows[/i], in the end I really enjoyed playing it. It was fun and had great hidden object scenes, plus I did like Kate for the most part as a main character though they could have fleshed her out more. The good part about this game is that it\u2019s cheap so even if it\u2019s not the best hidden object game, for its price point it\u2019s a really good one. The game also has Steam trading cards and achievements which are not too hard to collect. I recommend this game to fans of the genre, it\u2019s a good game for a good price.\n\n[h1]My Rating[/h1]\n \n[list]\n[*]Must buy.\n[*][b]A good game to buy.[/b]\n[*]Only buy if on sale.\n[*]Mediocre.\n[*]Avoid at all costs.\n[/list]\n \n[url=http://lunarproduction.com/]Lunar Productions[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1498365214, "timestamp_updated": 1498365391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591724", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32324479": {"recommendationid": "32324479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074744887", "num_games_owned": 1144, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497120323}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "A m\u0171faji k\u00f6t\u00f6tts\u00e9gek adottak, a szok\u00e1sos klis\u00e9kt\u0151l sem mentes, de m\u00e9gis valahogy egy kicsit m\u00e1s, mint az \u00e1tlagos t\u00f6bbs\u00e9g \u00e9s ez jelent n\u00e9mi fel\u00fcd\u00fcl\u00e9st.

The graphics are top-notch for the genre, and the music exceeds anything I would expect to hear in a HOG. The plot, though an absurd mash-up of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/15100/Assassins_Creed_Directors_Cut_Edition/]Assassin's Creed[/url] and [url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/]They Live[/url] with ridiculous gaping plot holes, is still rather fun.  The cutscenes are unusually long and well done.  The whole thing seems carefully polished.\n\nHowever, for all the prettiness of it, I don't think I have ever sworn in frustration at a HOG so many times as I did at [i]Masquerade of Shadows[/i].  The more I played, the more I hated it.\n\nThe issue that kept infuriating me, over and over, relates to the nature of the progress barriers.  That's how the overworld in a HOG functions, of course -- an array of progress barriers, functionally doors in disguise, requiring a variety of objects that act as keys, which you must obtain by finding them, solving puzzles or playing minigames.  Here, however, the progress barriers were all so [b]stupid[/b] and [b]arbitrary![/b]  At one point, for instance, my character needs to open a container, but it is tied shut with a piece of string.  She is carrying no less than [b]three[/b] sharp objects, but she can't cut the string until she finds a piece of broken glass, because apparently none of the much better cutting implements [i]that she's already carrying[/i] will do!\n\nAt another point, there's an object I want lying in the dirt.  It's right there.  I can see it.  But my character won't pick it up until I find a glove for her, because she doesn't want to get her hand dirty.\n\nMy constant refrain to this game was \"Just ^&#*ing [b]do it[/b], already!  What's stopping you???\"  \n\nI click on a cart, and the character helpfully tells me that she could push the cart.  \"I [b]know[/b] you can push the cart,\" I scream. \"I want you to do it!  Stop telling me that you can do it, and just do it!  What is your problem???  Is it that wheel chock?  It's a single little block of wood!  Just kick it out of the way like a normal person!  Do you really need a corkscrew and an electric toothbrush just to remove a #%^$ing wheel chock???\"\n\nOver and over, the biggest challenge in the game is figuring out precisely what dumb object your character wants in order to overcome some silly problem that should be trivial to handle in any number of ways.  Even though progress barriers like these are an inherent element of the game, the ridiculously contrived nature of those barriers, along with the sole means of passing them, just overwhelmed my ability to suspend disbelief.\n\nIt doesn't help that the means of giving you the \"keys\" is often just as baldly contrived as the problems that require them.  At least a half-dozen times in the game, something that you achieve will result in a character saying some form of \"It's dangerous to go alone. Take this,\" and then handing you some bizarre object that no sane person would possibly expect you to need, but that is, of course, exactly what you need to pass another barrier.  As if that wasn't enough, you also drag around a magic checkerboard whose role is to dole out key items at exactly the time you need them and not before.\n\nI don't expect realism from a HOG, but please, at least work with me a little!  Make the impediments to progress plausible!  Ensure that the expected means of solving those problems is the most logical one!  Present key objects in a way that isn't blatantly handing them to me!\n\nAdd a few localization errors and a touchy UI just to add spice to an already infuriating stew.

We already know these games target a female audience, but having you play as a stunning fashion designer is laying it on a bit thick... hope you enjoy arranging fashion collections and refusing to get dirty. And obviously all the women-warrior-heroes look like supermodels. There are also some nice ideas for mechanics involving combat and magic, which unfortunately are barely used.\n\nThere are two problems: one is that it's too short and easy. The other is that there's a major production blunder for the English voice acting. It's usually fine, but once in a while the protagonist's voice is replaced with this bizarre shrill [i]other[/i] voice that I imagine was a placeholder during development.

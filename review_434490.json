Otem's Defiance is an action platformer game about a kid trying to escape his fate as a sacrifice. You play as Otem. A kid who is chosen by his tribe's Shaman to be the sacrifice for the gods. You have to defeat the Ringods and survive the ritual lead by the tribe\u2019s Shaman who seems to have a personal interest in your death. Talk about jealous lol.\n\nThe game is quite simple but so addictive and great.\n\nThe graphics are sure stunning. The animations are great. The colors are super good. The textures are so detailed. The art works are sure great.\n\nThe soundtrack is good. You won't get bored of it at all. The sound FX are also good.\n\nThe gameplay is super good. Pretty easy to get used to.\nLeft and Right arrow keys for movements , Space for jump and Z to shoot.\nThere are sixteen different Ringods with different attack pasterns. There are three difficulties for each level. There are thirty-six different rings in five unique locations which they all are great. the surroundings are so great. You can just look at it and be like damn this is a really great drawing.\nThe levels go from easy to hard slightly as you advance in the game.\nAll you gotta do is dodge and counter attack but it's not that easy. The game is actually challenging. You have three chances each level. The Ringods gonna just get better and stronger so you won't get bored easily.\n\nThere is also an animated comic full of details and is so great to read.\n\nThe settings are not bad. You can change the audio options, Video options and the language. Yet you can't change the key bindings. The default ain't bad but yet it sure comes in handy if you can change it.\n\nThere are thirty six achievements. You get four card drops out of a seven cards badge.\n\n[Spoiler]If you are interested in reading and discussing reviews.

You play as Otem, a child who has been chosen as a sacrifice to the gods of his tribe. You disobey your tribe's orders to be a sacrifice and fight around the ring-shaped arena.  In this arena totem-like objects attack you from the centre, with an array of attacks, ranging from fire, to magic, to ice, and a whole load of other crap. You fight back against the totems by getting bolts which lay around in sections of the circle. You attack the circular parts behind the face of the totem to destroy it.\n\nGameplay Design\nThe game is designed similarly to that of a 3d platformer, with good graphics if a little basic,   and cool designs, with definitely a comic book-esque feel to it, which I think going by the story of the game, the designers were looking to do. The controls are tight, and you learn more moves the longer you play, which make certain things easier, like for example the user of the double jump. All of these controls feel natural, and while certain powerups at times make the game harder to play, they add something different to the game.\n\nArtistic Design\nI must say I really appreciate the hard work which has gone into the design of the game, the comic books and the in between levels looks fantastic, and the art style is incredibly impressive, which at times made me wish the gameplay jusst had a little bit more. The actual art in game lacks a little, with it being a bit bland at times, but the character and totem's all look well polished even if other areas of the game don't. \n\nGeneral Gameplay:\nThe game starts off quite easily, but adds more and more totems making it more and more difficult, with different levels and areas adding new tiers of difficulty, with each area having it's own boss which you have to defeat before you move onto the next section.\n\nOverview\nWhat I don't like about the game is though, it does feel like it just lacks something for a PC game, its quite repetitive and can feel like a bit of a chore, but its also challenging enough to make you not seem as if you're just going through the motions. \n\nI could definitely recommend this on a mobile device as its controls would work great on it, and on a PC as a platformer it would also be a decent purchase. I think the developers have definitely created something here which is aesthetically pleasing and different, yet still somewhat familiar.", "timestamp_created": 1480082629, "timestamp_updated": 1480082629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26462429": {"recommendationid": "26462429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012221863", "num_games_owned": 838, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474548881}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, gonna keep this short.

I didn't even finish the whole video before I stopped it to add the game to my wishlist. I love narrative-based games, so I was waiting for a chance to pick this up and experience it for myself. I finally got to during the Autumn Sale. \n\nNow that I've played through the whole thing, I have to say that the game was well worth the price I paid! I loved the writing in Thomas Was Alone, despite not having finished it, and the dialogue in Subsurface Circular is just as witty and sharp as it was in TWA. The clean UI and minimal art style sell the idea of a future world, and I really liked the intuitive way of communicating with other characters to solve puzzles (and I don't even like puzzles usually).\n\nI think the story is quite thought provoking as well, and speaks to current anxieties about automation and the future of AI. For such a short game, I'd definitely recommend playing it all in one sitting to get the full experience. It's a linear narrative, for sure, but I think it's a good one. (I also love how the developer commentary is integrated so deeply into the game; I really want to go through the whole thing one more time just to see what Mike Bithell thinks about different aspects of development.)\n\nI only wish there was more voice acting or at least more music playing to break up the quiet humming of the train.

The only thing [i]I assure you[/i] that I'm right about is that the core gameplay mechanic is beat. The mechanic of 'dialogue tree choice exhaustion' is not fun. It hinges on needing a super interesting story which is dangerous because not everyone will be moved equally.\n\nPlease note I've played ~50% of this game. I tried to perservere to the end but had to throw the towel in. I found my mind wandering and then [i]reading[/i] dialogue quickly slid into [i]skimming[/i] which quickly lead to me mashing straight through the conversations. \n\n[i]Essentially, this is a visual novel, and at least the first hour (out of a two hour game) had exactly zero choices to be made.[/i]  You simply engage in dialogue with other robots and choose pre-defined dialogue options. Okay, let's strip away the stylish exterior (which is meaningless, really) and just look at the gameplay first. The core gameplay loop is all too familiar for fans of point-n-clicks:\n\n1. Talk to a person \n2. Exhause all possible dialogue options (generic responses consist of the first choice being 'positive' and the second 'negative' - yeah, you've been here before many times)\n3. Find new information\n4. Go to next person\n5. Rinse and repeat\n\nThe cycle was fine decades ago, but we've come a long way baby.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+I guess the stylish graphics/cinematography is nice enough - it does feel paper thin, though.\n+Even though I wasn't moved by the universe/setting/story, I have to give credit that at least it was unique.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Even after changing the option, the dialogue was horribly slow.\n-Why did it look like they were typing? I'm not sure what it's like to 'link' to a robot, but I would assume we could just 'talk' with no typing delay.\n-I hate it when I am roleplaying a character and I actually have to create backstory on-the-fly instead of just 'being born' into the story in this moment, and seeing things from this point forward. Hope that makes sense. Another way to put this is that I don't like to have to choose dialogue options about details of past cases (for example), that I (IRL) have no information about. I did not experience that, so I feel awkward 'making it up'.\n-The core mechanic of simply exhausting choices with every NPC is... Well... Exhausting. It's tedious and ho-hum. It's been done so many times before. And it's always a mechanic that's part of a much bigger game. Here, the whole game is this little mechanic.\n-The story did not interest me enough. Again, I give credit for something original, but I could care less how it all pans out.\n-It's completely linear - no matter what you say (in the first hour, at least) will funnel you to the exact same conclusion you are meant to arrive at.\n-Finally, because of the short game length, the devs clearly are concerned with people either just watching a LetsPlay or playing and then refunding, and I get that BUT why not just make it a bigger experience? \n\n[b]Sorry folks, I cannot recommend this one to my Steam friends.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1512232060, "timestamp_updated": 1512249425, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641841", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38005623": {"recommendationid": "38005623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054226888", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511471670}, "language": "english", "review": "fantastic experience.  its a short dive with simple logic puzzles and dialouge trees but the setting is highly realized and the characters are excellent.", "timestamp_created": 1512225962, "timestamp_updated": 1512225962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38002685": {"recommendationid": "38002685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417433962", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512218750}, "language": "english", "review": "this was the best game I ever played and heres why \nlets start with the bad \n1 can be a bit anoeying sometimes \n2 short about 2.6 hours long \nnow the good \n1 funny \n2 charming \n3 a great mystery story that isn't immpossble to understand \n4 a geart ending \nsorry about my spelling I have adhd and thank you for reading my 1st review", "timestamp_created": 1512219234, "timestamp_updated": 1512219234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37991528": {"recommendationid": "37991528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058401643", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513216481}, "language": "english", "review": "Subsurface Circular is a narrative dialogue game where you play as a Robot Detective.

Maybe. Sub-par? Not at all.\n\n\nJust as I was settling in for a night of Japanese takeout and Overwatch, Thomas Was Alone designer Mike Bithell dropped a surprise release on Steam. So I abandoned my post faster than a Royal Mail employee on a Friday night and grabbed a copy of this robot detective game. Apart from a few sly tweets and whispers in the industry, no one had any idea this game was coming.  \n\nSubsurface Circular is a spins a casual, yet brittle tale of class, religion and power, with undertones of revolution and an ever-present nod towards the old \u2018Robots will prevail\u2019 tech dystopia. It tells a story and builds mystery in a single setting by consistently changing its direction, tone and characters, providing a different interaction in every scene. \n\nYour journey begins, and you, a robot detective, are your help is requested from a worried \nTek with a missing friend. \u2018Tek\u2019, is the term for robots in this game, and there\u2019s lots of different ones, which you\u2019ll meet throughout your train ride. Robots get on and off the train, and it\u2019s your job to talk to each of them, and solve the mystery of the missing Tek. \n\nThe plot juggles themes like AI, conspiracy and human rights, but keeps it light and mostly on surface level as your investigation progresses. Each Tek you talk to requires something from you, be it a phrase, piece of information or the answer to a riddle. Some Teks even work as a pair, and your interaction with one will affect another\u2019s responses. That was clever, Bithell. You smart little thing. \n\nThe fact that your character does not move throughout the entire game, is a testament to the astuteness of the narrative; an entire plot revolves around you, and you don\u2019t even need to leave your seat. The interactions are so well calculated, that I didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on until the carefully placed reveals. Every robot has it\u2019s own thing going on, its dialogue laced with a special wit generally found in the works of team Bithell, and I thoroughly adored the 4th wall-shattering fedora tip towards Thomas Was Alone. \n\nSubsurface Circular was a glorious little spin of a classic sci-fi concept, that didn\u2019t require a lot of time or commitment to enjoy. It\u2019s design and scripting were spot on, and I was particularly impressed by it\u2019s smooth, sleek UI. That, and I\u2019m still buzzing over the part where I had to emotionally manipulate a pair of robots to retrieve the information I needed. Subsurface Circular is a canny, resourceful little release, and I hope team Bithell have similar ideas in the bank, because this one was lovely.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511967983, "timestamp_updated": 1511967983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37916652": {"recommendationid": "37916652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152274242", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1513628190}, "language": "english", "review": "Subsurface Circular is a very interesting detective game.

Other reviews are used to help stress my point across but are changed in such a way to make the review in my own wording [/h1]\n\nSubsurface Circular is a text adventure game developed and published by Mike Bithell or his company known as Bithell Games, the same company behind the amazing Thomas Was Alone and Volume. While some people may be turned off by a text adventure game where you don't really do anything but select a few choice here and there and see the outcome, I think that with Subsurface Circular, it allowed Mike Bithell to write engaging stories, beautiful and heartfelt stories\n\nEverything from the writing, to the concept behind robotics and the human race in the possible near future, the UI and the sound design are all spot-on. If you like the concept of a future where robots and humans work hand in hand to provide a sustainable future and what happens when power is left in the wrong hands, then this is the game for you!\n\nSubsurface Circular is a short sci-fi story about the role of robots in a near future society where robots coexist with humans, how they take the jobs of humans, how humans cope with robots around them. It's about people, and robots-who-are-people, and where society's going with the idea\n\nIt is presented in a very pleasant style. The choices are interesting, the focus system is interesting, and you can manipulate your fellow robots as you try to get to the bottom of a simple missing person case\n\nAlthough short and only took me roughly an hour and a half, within that hour and a half I was more drawn into the story and what was trying to be conveyed then playing a 15 hour campaign where the story is not even as well written and explained as Subsurface Circular\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]\n[i] THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

You take the part of a 'detective' on the underground, where you are presented with a mystery to solve.   You can chat to other commuters on the subway to ask them about the investigation.  Some you can also do little favours for. \n\nThe wonderful thing about the game is that it explores (tangentially) the ultimate goal of robotics and AI:  Once we can make bots which are as good as us, what role will /they/ want in the partnership?   Will we end up being surpassed?  \n\nThe dialog tree is a set of constrained choices, not free-form.  Other than the tannoy announcements, everything is purely text-based.   This meshes nicely with the idea that the 'bots are communicating over a private chat channel, like IM.   It also means that you can imprint your own voices and feelings onto the 'bots themselves.  \n\nThe game is minimalistic, insofar as there's one location (a train carriage), and one type of person to talk to (bots).  The bots have some morphological variation, but are all built along the same lines.  They all sit, move, and talk differently. They all have different 'buttons' you can push to elicit different responses.   For the most part what you choose doesn't affect things too much, but in some (restricted) cases, you can earn an achievement or two by being persistent or following a humorous avenue of dialog.   \n\nIt lasts about 2 to 3 hours.  The pace can be changed, but it's a relaxing \"sit back and enjoy the story\" kind of game, so the default speed feels about right.   The graphics are lovely, with great use of motion, lighting, texturing and depth blurring.    The 'bots all move in a convincing 'bottish' way, and they all feel solid'.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Subsurface Circular.  It was highly relaxing, thought-provoking, and gave just enough humour to give a wry smile from time to time.   There are a few times when the setup seems a tad obvious (e.g. in one part a bot needs another type of bot, and lo and behold that exact bot type happens to also sit down at the same time).  Doing this gave a little mini-game, but broke the flow a little by the coincidence.   Of course, perhaps it was a forced coincidence? I dunno. That's too many levels of indirect thinking for me at this time of night.\n\nI paid about \u00a34 for it, and that feels about right for something of this length.

So starts your circular adventure as you try and unravel the mysteries that lurk below the surface in this city rife with robots. Will you solve the mystery?\n\nPROS:\n+ Hot robots! - Oh boy do I like some attractive robots and this game has more attracive robots than you could shake a stick of RAM at. The designs of the robots are delightful and varied.\n+ Would you look at that writing! - There's lots of reading afoot and the words are good! Subsurface Circular has great writing and dances with ideas that will, hopefully, leave you thinking and constantly wondering about the robots to come.\n+ Are the robots real? - The characters you come across are great and I really enjoyed talking to them, well, not talking.... forming a wireless connection with them. Robot stuff.\n\nCONS:\n- Is it a puzzle? - There's not much actual puzzling afoot as you sit down and ride the train. For the most part you do just read through the conversations and give them varying prompts of information that you have learned about previously. To be fair I wouldn't really call this a negative because there's still a sense of achievement to be gained from prompting robots with questions to get what little bit of information they may have and then running off (in a metaphorical sense, you're very much sat down) and talk to the next attractive robot. So, this really doesn't count as a negative, but I guess some people may be expecting a bit more than a visual novel with a greater level of interaction than your average VN.\n- Help I can't stop thinking about it! - It's been months and I'm still sometimes finding myself thinking about this game. Did I make the right choice? What does it mean for our society in real life? Do I have an odd attraction to actual robots? I can't sleep at night as these haunt me, which probably is a bit of a con because it's ruined my life, but in a good way.\n\nOverall Subsurface Circular is a delightfully small game that you can knock out in an afternoon and it's definitely worth it. An enrapturing tale that'll hopefully leaving you chomping at the ...

A self-proclaimed 'Bithell Short', SC's formal restrictions (dialogue tree-driven, mouse click short form narrative) and writerly restraint (it takes place entirely on the eponymous underground train system transporting robots to various locations on the surface that we only hear about in conversation) free it of the wide burden and bloat that can afflict even the best open world games of larger scale. It hits a goldilocks zone for me of not too committal, not too complexly-interfaced, and not overwhelming (exploration is possible, but within the comforting corridors of conversation, not vast vistas or sprawling streets). You don't often see the short form in video games, and I appreciated being able to play this one through in one sitting if I wanted, or pick it up in bits and pieces when not afforded an abundance of play time. \nI also enjoy the story, and would love to keep seeing what has already been a trend this year of sci fi video games tackling genre tread territory with the fresh perspective of contemporary angles and issues. SC is set in a world in which labor has been automated, and that hasn't ushered in a post-scarcity utopia so much as created a new underclass of sentient machines targeted by neo-Luddite hate groups. You are one of these robots, a model relegated to the task of detective and investigating a series of robot disappearances.

It is not a long game (~2 hours plus a bit more cleaning up achievements), but it is a good one. I had massive expectations for the game as it is from the same team as the gem Thomas Was Alone, perhaps unrealistically high, so while I was a little let down by the fact that I wasn't sucked into the game, I did really enjoy it in the end. There are 2 (I don't think there's any other than 2) puzzles in the game which are suprising difficult for being seemingly a very small part of the game, but there is a built-in aid to solve them which does help, and they should be solvable by pretty much any player.\n\nGameplay takes place as text-based conversations with other robots on a train where your dialoge is choosen from a set of options you're given each time it is your turn to speak. You talk to a variety of robots from a variety of occupations, and the game does a great job painting a world and making each conversation seem unique. The game takes place as a 3D render of the robots as they sit on, enter, and exit the train which makes the game feel much more full than if it were simply the text. The rendering is nice and the intro scene is really neat. The music that plays is choosen well, but is mostly background. The story is interesting (as you would hope from a story-driven detective game), but not overwhelmingly so, and up until the end I would have had few qualms about getting up and taking a break if I had needed too, contrary to a game like OneShot that keeps you wanting to play more and more in the same sitting.\n\nIn terms of achievements, most are tied to progression and will be awarded in a single playthrough, and the others can be gotten in a few minutes by going back and replaying specific parts of specific scenes (you can choose to replay specific portions of the game once you've beaten it). A few may not be immidiately obvious as to how they are earned, but there are discussions on the game's Steam forum to help you figure it out.\n\nI guess the purpose of reviews is to help you answer the question: Should I buy this game? And I think the answer in this case is, yes, you should play through this game. However if you aren't super intrigued by the game's style, perhaps you should wait for a sale as it is on the short side, so the price may be a tad steep in some people's eyes.\n\n\n\nA Note (Mild Spoiler): After playing through this game I played back through Thomas Was Alone, and I really like how this game made subtle references to it. I think that did improve my opinion of this game, as they reference it in a very clever way that makes a lot of sense, and if you haven't played Thomas Was Alone, give it a go.

As it is, it is a simple visual novel that ends up being an interesting, but not exceptional, read with poor gameplay. The visuals are almost completely meaningless, with most entities the player interacts with not moving at all throughout their conversations. The story clearly pulls heavily from Asimov\u2019s works with an emphasis on seeing the rise of artificial intelligence from the A.I.\u2019s perspective. However, in terms of gaming narratives this one is fairly simple given that the majority of the player\u2019s actions have little to no effect on the outcome.

En effet, exit les plans marketing et autres publicit\u00e9s, accueillons une sortie impromptue et volontairement limit\u00e9e. On incarne donc un robot d\u00e9tective d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 Claire qui va devoir mener une enqu\u00eate bien \u00e9trange sur la disparition de l'ami d'un autre robot. Pour ce faire, on va traverser toute la ville dans le m\u00e9tro et y interroger des habitants robots gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un astucieux syst\u00e8me de dialogue et de d\u00e9couvertes \u00e0 creuser.\n\nSubsurface Circular s'apparente \u00e0 un jeu d'enqu\u00eate dans lequel on va devoir d\u00e9couvrir ce qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs robots disparus dans un univers futuriste o\u00f9 les humains et les robots cohabitent paisiblement ou presque. Le jeu est simple mais rudement efficace, on se d\u00e9place automatiquement de station de m\u00e9tro en station de m\u00e9tro et l'on fera connaissance de diff\u00e9rents robots qu'il faudra interroger afin de d\u00e9couvrir des indices et autres pistes. Chaque d\u00e9couverte du puzzle nous octroiera une nouvelle possibilit\u00e9 de dialogue et d'interrogation, il conviendra alors de poser de nouvelles questions aux robots qui n'avaient plus rien \u00e0 nous dire jusque l\u00e0. C'est donc un v\u00e9ritable travail d'enqu\u00eateur qui nous attend avec \u00e9galement quelques \u00e9nigmes plut\u00f4t cors\u00e9es afin de d\u00e9bloquer des situations ubuesques.\n\nUn poil court mais pas en terme d'id\u00e9es.\nSubsurface Circular est un jeu vraiment attachant que ce soit au niveau de son histoire dense et int\u00e9ressante qu'au niveau de ses protagonistes. Sans jamais rencontrer d'humains, on va vite se rendre compte que tout n'est pas rose entre les robots et les hommes. On s'attache aux diff\u00e9rentes personnalit\u00e9s et aux \u00e9tranges possibilit\u00e9s que nous apporte la vie de robot d'usine, lover, publicitaire ou policier \u00e0 l'humeur changeante. D'un ton r\u00e9solument mature, l'histoire est plut\u00f4t complexe et il faudra parfois se faire violence pour ne pas acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le texte tant il y a d'informations \u00e0 retenir. Les diff\u00e9rentes phases de jeu reprennent des \u00e9pisodes avec le m\u00eame d\u00e9cor mais de tous nouveaux robots \u00e0 rencontrer et \u00e0 faire cracher leurs ci-boulons afin qu'ils nous aident \u00e0 progresser dans l'aventure. Le jeu est assez simple malgr\u00e9 tout avec une dur\u00e9e de vie d'environ 3 heures pour peu que l'on tente de tout \u00e9lucider et d'explorer les diff\u00e9rentes fins qui s'offrent \u00e0 nous.\n\nLe jeu est int\u00e9gralement en anglais et dans un langage soutenu ce qui risque de poser probl\u00e8me \u00e0 la plupart des joueurs fran\u00e7ais. Sachez tout de m\u00eame que l'on comprend assez bien ce qu'il se passe m\u00eame si on zappe parfois des dialogues. Le gameplay est assez simple pour que l'on tente plusieurs combinaisons de dialogue afin de d\u00e9couvrir un indice et ainsi d'obtenir une aide nous indiquant o\u00f9 nous devons concentrer nos recherches. Certaines \u00e9nigmes n\u00e9cessiteront \u00e9galement du papier et un stylo pour trouver les bonnes r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 certaines questions mais aussi pour comprendre un robot d\u00e9glinguer. C'est dr\u00f4le et rarement frustrant, on s'amuse comme dans les grands jeux d'aventure de l'\u00e9poque \u00e0 tout noter \u00e0 l'instar des excellents Zork par exemple. La r\u00e9alisation est impeccable avec un excellent travail sur le design et quelques effets plut\u00f4t r\u00e9ussi dans le m\u00e9tro. Rien de bien folichon mais le r\u00e9sultat est unique et propre. M\u00eame une petite configuration pourra faire tourner le jeu sans le moindre probl\u00e8me. Mention sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 la bande son r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par dan le sac.\n\nReboot\nSubsurface Circular est donc une exp\u00e9rience courte mais \u00f4 combien int\u00e9ressante. Rajoutez \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'\u00e9quation un descriptif de la gen\u00e8se des anciens jeux de Mike Bithell par le biais d'une conversion avec un robot pr\u00eatre et vous obtenez un des jeux les plus originaux de cette ann\u00e9e 2017. Il est fort recommand\u00e9 de jouer au jeu en une seule fois car on a tr\u00e8s vite fait d'oublier certains d\u00e9tails apr\u00e8s quelques jours. Vendu \u00e0 tout petit prix, il doit surtout \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une aventure \u00e0 l'ancienne enrob\u00e9 de beaux effets et d'un syst\u00e8me de mots cl\u00e9s (indices) fort novateur. Le casting des robots est vraiment excellent avec un c\u00f4t\u00e9 geek tr\u00e8s appuy\u00e9 et une possibilit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s pratique de rebooter certains robots.\n\nDifficile donc de rester de marbre devant tant d'intelligence artificielle autonome et devant un avenir si proche et si r\u00e9el.

This is the phrase that I wish to start this review. It's very hard to present the plot without spoiling everything, mainly because it's simple, short and sweet like the game itself. Basically you are a Tek, a robot, more specifically humans finally realized that they are too busy or too lazy to do their own jobs and decided to create the Teks. Robots. Built to take over normal jobs like psychiatrics, athletes, librarians, nannies etc. leaving the scientists, presidents and other \"big fish in the sea\" to control the rest. What is indeed interesting about is that they have a consciousness, making them more emotional and thoughtful of what is happening around them. That's where you come in. You are a detective Tek, and after an encounter with another robot that approached you in the subway metro regarding the disappearance of his friend, you accept the case and start asking the passengers of the train about information. While you will progress in the game you realize that this whole case is much more deep and happening at a bigger scale.\n\n\n[u]~Gameplay~[/u]\n\nWhile I was playing the game I felt like I was watching a theatrical play and I was making all the choices, possibly because everything happened in this train and no where else. The story unravels itself based on the dialogue which makes it more unique then the other choice games I am used to. Basically in some stations Teks come and go and you have to ask them questions regarding their life, profession and lastly the case. Basted on your encounters you will meet different personalities and gather more information. The story takes a dark turn when you, as a robot, start to question yourself if the humans have a hidden hatred for Teks and they are the ones guilty for the disappearances or the robots.\n\nThe dialogue is very realistic. The robots make the whole conversations have taste by simply talking about their chores, problems and life. The subject involving life, to me, was indeed interesting and I think it will be for whoever decides to play this game. I say this mainly because the developers did a fantastic job describing life through the \"eyes\" of a robot.\n\nBUT not everything is perfect and I have to say that the plot becomes boring dragging down along with it the gameplay itself. It feels like the choices you make have no impact and the entire idea of  Teks \"come and go\" in a subway metro become quickly repetitive. This is the main flaw of the game, the fact that nothing interesting is happening and the end makes everything feel like it was for nothing, very unsatisfying and predictable. Hell, I half expected the game to turn up like that 1994 movie Speed with Sandra Bullock and the characters to realize there is a bomb in the train and there is no way of stopping but no, everything remained the same.\n\n\n[u]~Graphics and Soundtrack~[/u]\n\n\nNot much to say. Beautiful visuals, no frame drops and I am firmly positive that it will work smoothly on any decent graphic card. The music was calming and had a happy-go-lucky feeling along with it.\n\n\n[u]~Conclusion~[/u]\n\nThe hidden meaning of this game it's what should motivate you to buy it, not to say that it has a perfect price. With all the questions and details about the disappearances I started to look at the bigger picture and see what this game wants me to understand. After finishing the game I went with my friends to McDonald's and while I was waiting for my friend to come with our orders I started looking around me and spotted an employee that was mopping the floor,the father who was laughing with his daughter while eating, the taxi guy who came to have a launch break and the angry man in the suit who was talking on the phone. Nothing wrong with that after all it is a busy place and a bunch of people come and go, but I saw them for the first time at a bigger scale. The idea of this game was to bring attention to the way society works at a more emotional level. How the mediocre class works almost like robots everyday to live their life, sustain their families and how the high society treats them like robots and their whole existence revolves around work, not seeing that they are talking and working with humans. As a human being, we have feelings, needs, problems and family. Everyday we pass each other on the street not knowing what happens around us, too filled up with stress, jobs and technology to see that we are not equal by money or importance but by respect and honor. Two things that this game wanted express through simple conversations by Teks and how humans feel like their only existence on this planet is to serve them, and they are wrong. Just because they are invisible to them that doesn't mean that they do not think about the actions that they make, actions that led to this amazing story. The game is truly touching once you observe and understand the true meaning of it.\n\n\n[u]~Strong Points~[/u]\n\nBeautiful graphics. Interesting plot. Realistic dialogue. Good price.\n\n[u]~Weak Points~[/u]\n\nThe HUD was not so appealing and the choice interface I found it too basic for a SF game. The ending is disappointing. Nothing big happens to spice up the story leaving all to drown itself.\n\nRating: 7/10\nDeveloper: Bithell Games\nPublisher: Bithell Games\nGenre: SF narrative game\nRelease Date: 17 August 2017", "timestamp_created": 1503429957, "timestamp_updated": 1503430451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642857", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34422313": {"recommendationid": "34422313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065806898", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503461973}, "language": "english", "review": "Short game, but I don't think I would have it any other way.

A huge pleasure to play in 1440p, and although a lot is static, it is rare to see such accomplished, polished and to the point visuals and artwork. I am really looking forward to the inclusion of Trading Cards and the subsequent backgrounds of this game. Audio-wise it was a little minimalistic, but I'd rather have it this way than aurally choking on a floodwave of sounds.\nAs a text adventure, it was alright. To be honest, I wouldn't have read or cared about the story if not for the audiovisual experience. The story is interesting enough to keep one going, the choices are often enough intriguing, in the sense that you want to read the answes to all the choices, but may only pick one. \nBut, for future reference, I don't think I need any more of this. I'd honestly see what other games and visuals Mike Bithell (and his team) can come up with, as I feel that up to now, every game was unique, but distinguishably \"bithell\" nontheless. Volume remains my favorite of the three though, and I am very much looking forward to Bithell#4 in a few years.\nIn conclusion: Well worth the money if you feel you're in for two hours of reading on a nice afternoon or evening.\nThanks for the good times, until we play again!", "timestamp_created": 1503418545, "timestamp_updated": 1503418545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34418653": {"recommendationid": "34418653", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992300452", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503417026}, "language": "english", "review": "good stuff", "timestamp_created": 1503417045, "timestamp_updated": 1503417045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34415978": {"recommendationid": "34415978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046225980", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503408832}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice, short experience.

The storyline of this game is extremely captivating, from start to end. \n\nTowards the end, as all the plot points start to piece themselves together, it results in a story that keeps you hooked untill the last second as mysteries start to unravel themselves. The plot twists at the end are some of the best I've seen, and this game is most definitely a piece of art. The writing is absolutely fantastic, and the art style+graphics are to my liking--they have a nice futuristic, cyberpunk-like feel.\n\nFurthermore, the developers have obviously put in a lot of work into this game; from the art gallery to the developer commentary; it's obviously not a game that was pieced together in a couple hours. If you have the time, the music in this game is great as well.

Thomas Was Alone and Volume were completely alien titles to me.  I decided to grab this game when a friend pointed it out to me.  They hadn't played it either, but the concept: a mystery story set aboard a subway train with robots, was different enough to intrigue me.  And the execution: a text-based game using words to solve puzzles was instantly my jam.\n\nEnter Subsurface Circular.\n\nThe premise of the game is incredibly simple and too the point:  You play as a Tek (the word for robots in this setting) detective who rides the subway, the titular Subsurface Circular, as it follows it's roundabout route.  While on the subway, you meet a fellow Tek, who implores you to investigate a missing friend of his, who is part of a string of unusual and inexplicable disappearances.  Since you cannot leave the train, you must converse with the various passengers, interact with them, help them, to uncover the truth.\n\nThe game is made in the Unity engine, and while I'm no programmer/coder, I'm told this is a very good engine, and it shows.  The in-game graphics are crisp and clear, the UI is easy to navigate and use.  The text is easy to read, and my default, moves at a pace that makes it easy to read before it moves along (and even that can adjusted in-game).  The designs of the robots are all quite unique.  They share similar motiffs among types, but they look fantastic, often posed in a manner to convey body language that gives them their own personalities.\n\nThe gameplay itself, like the game, is simple.  You engage in conversations with the passengers (each set of passengers is called a 'Sequence' of the subway, gaining 'Focus Points', key words or phrases, which serve as the 'inventory' of the game.  These Points can be used to gain additional information.  With these focus points, you can solve the puzzles given to you by the various passengers.  Some might ask for directions to a stop, others will want to hear a joke.  But don't worry, if you're truly stumped, the game has a hint system!  A '?' icon in the upper right will give you a generalized nudge in the right direction, while the in-game 'Guided Deduction Module' will assist you on the game's much more brain-wracking puzzles.\n\nThe story is superb, for a game that's so short.  Pretty much the entirety of the setting is told through the dialog and Focus Points.  While not all information is relevant to the progression of the game, you can learn a massive amount regarding the world through the conversations, adding to your understanding of the setting.  Even then, Bithell kept some details vague and non-specific enough to allow the player's imagination to draw their own conclusions.  Whether you enjoy the 'twist', I feel the story supports itself well enough that the finale will not actually disappoint.\n\nOf course, no game is perfect, and even Subsurface Circular has it's share of smaller, but still prominent issues.  The first, is the runtime.  Even including the puzzles which require you to use your brain seriously to solve, don't expect the game to run longer than 2 or 3 hours.  It's practically anemic.  And while the narrative fits neatly into this, I wish the game had run a bit longer, added more to what was already a solid game.\n\nThe fact the game requires you to do pretty much NOTHING but read might be a turn off to some.  Normally I wouldn't include this as a 'Con' for a game, not everyone enjoys having to spend essentially the entire game just reading.\n\nIn addition, outside of unlocking an art gallery and a developer commentary in the form of a self-insert character for a second playthrough, there's not a whole lot to replay for, except simply for the sake of indulging in the game's aesthetics and music.\n\nI will point out that these 'downsides' are almost more nitpicks than real negatives.  For a game who's development cycle was a mere [b]four months[/b], there's so much here that I feel it's worth it to play this game, even if perhaps sci-fi isn't really your cup of tea.\n\nAll-in-all, Subsurface Circular shows that you don't need years to make a good game.", "timestamp_created": 1503355210, "timestamp_updated": 1503355210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34404030": {"recommendationid": "34404030", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982823666", "num_games_owned": 703, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503354121}, "language": "english", "review": "A really enjoyable experience.\n\nThe text-based conversations was a very interesting way to allow the player to relate to the protagonist and learn about the 'world' they're are set in.\n\nAdd to that a rewarding ending and a beautiful aesthetic (in my opinion), definately worth the small amount for this story-based game.", "timestamp_created": 1503354605, "timestamp_updated": 1503354605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34403257": {"recommendationid": "34403257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064668332", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503351676}, "language": "english", "review": "Definetly a must buy for anyone who loves games with interesting stories, political and philosophical themes, and has 2 hours to spare.

I casually clicked it, reminding myself that I have an incredible backlog and can't possibly buy more games and then found myself somehow with it in my library five minutes later. I have selective amnesia about the whole situation but since I now owned it, I clearly had to immediately play it. \n\n[h1]\"When the truth is buried, go underground.\"[/h1]\n\nSubsurface Circular is a short (approximately 90 minutes) visual novel from the maker of Thomas Was Alone and Volume. We play a detective Tek - a robot of the highest intelligence levels. In this universe, robots have been \"freed\" from ownership, yet still work for the human \"management\" and seem for all useful purposes, slaves, as they are assigned tasks which they must complete and reset when they're needed for a different purpose. In the beginning of the game we meet a Tek who talks about his missing friend, and we decide that despite not being given the case by management, we are going to work on the disappearance of Teks and solve this crime.\n\n[h1]Thought Provoking[/h1]\n\nIt's a neat sci-fi story that really makes you think about the rise of AI and robot sentience, about job replacement and how humanity would feel in this - potentially not that crazily distant - future. Whilst of course, we have no real reality of sentient AI, machinery causing human discontent by replacing certain jobs is certainly a relevant topic and only going to become more so. It was well written, thoughtful and logical with a few small puzzles to make it a little more than just reading. The atmosphere is perfect, from the music to the sound effects, from the graphics to the font and even the way the text pops up and you ask questions. The entire artistic aesthetic really felt authentic to me and allowed me to immerse myself and empathise completely with the robots I was talking - something that's really important to take any genuine emotional impact from the ending.\n\nThere are no details I can give without being spoilery - and I would strongly recommend you don't try to get more information as with such a short game, even a small spoiler will detract from the enjoyment and surprise. You'll just have to trust me that the story develops in a satisfying way!\n\n[h1]Don't go expecting Gameplay. This is pure story.[/h1]\n\nGameplay wise there's not much as this is a visual novel - it is purely clicking the dialogue you want. There is an option at the ending, but this is the only relevant option in the game. The rest will be experienced the same by everyone. If you want to feel like you make an impact or have choices, this is not the game for you. But if you want to be engaged in a story that makes you think, set in a medium that really feels atmospheric then I highly recommend it. I did like the fact that you can set your reading speed as reading faster than the dialogue pops up is very frustrating for a speedy reader.\n\n[h1]And it's a short story.[/h1]\n\nThe game is short, there is no beating around the bush but if like me, you read the store description, then you'll know that going in. The developer makes it clear you can complete the game in under 2 hours and as he mentions, this technically means you can complete it and get a refund. If you're planning on completing it and then refunding it, just take a moment to think about how much work goes into making a good game like this - and how honest and upfront the developer was about the playtime. I do think that even at 90 minutes, this game offers excellent entertainment for $5, but I'm also an avid reader, and have no problem paying $5 every week for a new book.\n\n[h1]Hankering for more[/h1]\n\nThe game was almost flawless; but I did feel a bit disappointed about the ending. Not the way the game ended itself, but I felt the last sequence or two felt rushed and as if a chunk was missing from the story. We took a big leap at a critical point and then the ending was there. I would have loved if this game had different options and endings, or if there had been a few more sequences as it didn't quite feel perfect. Considering this is such a small indie development; perhaps budgetary constraints were at work. Maybe I'm just greedy, but I'd have happily paid double to experience more of this world. \n\nThis game definitely won't be for everyone. I would recommend it especially to those who enjoy reading books or with a particular interest in the philosophy of future AI, especially if you've read any Asimov (who is quite heavily referenced in the game).\n\n[h1]Despite that, it is still an excellent game and one of the best visual novels I've played, so it gets a massive thumbs up from me.[/h1]\n\n\u2665\u2665\u2665 If you're a weirdo who wants to follow my reviews, please clicky some links: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url] and [url=http://www.twitter.com/playwithath]My Twitter[/url].

The style and setting are enough to lure you in, but that's all the game has.\n\n\nSubsurface Circular is basically a dialogue tree game. You are a robot and you have conversations with other robots who come on to your train, and you try to piece together enough clues to solve a crime. Apart from you don't actually put any clues together. Your character makes all the leaps without your intervention and there are no real narrative branches (that I can see). There is absolutely nothing to be found here from a \"Whodunnit\" standpoint.\n\nSo what is the gameplay? I THINK it's supposed to be puzzles. That's certainly what I've seen in other reviews. However the puzzles in this game are //awful//. The vast majority are not at all puzzles, instead they are simply instructions to go and talk to somebody else first and then come back. You can't really get stuck and you don't really have to think.\nThe only \"difficult\" puzzle in the whole game is a logic puzzle that has ZERO narrative explanation. You are talking to another Tek and they literally go to you \"I'll tell you what you want to know, but first solve this puzzle!\". It is incredibly arbitrary. Many of the \"puzzles\" also make no sense at all. A robot will tell you that they are looking for a certain other robot... That's sitting literally right next to them. To solve the puzzle you have to talk to two people sitting closer to each other than they are to you, and tell them both that the person they're looking for is right there. It's bizarre.\n\nSo maybe the hook is the story. It's certainly interesting to start with and, like I say, the world really pulls you in. But as the game wears on, it becomes less and less compelling. Ultimately the finale of the game leans on some incredibly odd and unmotivated narrative leaps and you are presented with a rushed and nonsensical final decision to close out the game.

If you've ever seen 12 Angry Men or The Man from Earth you should know what I mean.\n\nVideo: Lives up to the Unity engine. Quite a bit of art in the robots.\n\nMusic/Sound: Just right. Cannot help waving mouse everywhere for the UI sound!\n\nBranches/Riddles: Mainly linear to be honest. Sometimes it just forcefully drags you back to the main story, whatever choice you pick. Riddles are decent, with a few needing paper.\n\nMISC:\n\n- Runs on win7 smoothly for me\n\n- Can't stop thinking about oscilloscopes when I see the robot name \"Tek\"\n\n- Reached out for an overkill in the joke riddle.

YMMV on how you measure value vs. length, but that won't be covered below.\n\nThat being said, Subsurface Circular is an interesting title whose simple play undersells the work that went into it.  First and foremost, it is not going to be a game for everyone.  When you strip away all the glam of the game, it is little more than a conversation simulator.  You do not move, you do not shoot, you don't do anything except select questions and responses.  However, it's the content of what is being said and asked that makes Subsurface Circular a fascinating journey that doesn't demand a lot of your time.  Shorter than any Peter Jackson movie and more entertaining than at least three of them, those looking for a more cerebral experience might want to take a ride on this subway for robots.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, you are a robot detective riding a train underground and as you meet and speak with passengers that come and go, a mystery unfolds and, true to your designation, you try to start figuring it out.  That's it.  There's some gamey convenience here like the fact that despite the train car clearly having at least 18 seats, no more than 4 will ever ride it at the same time and they will always take a seat next to you.  This could very well be a clever nod to the fact that you, the player, never get out of your seat to solve this mystery, either, it's more likely the result of a singular focus - to have the player pull at a thread and unravel a ball of yarn.\n\nEven though this game could entirely be accomplished in text, some TLC went into the aesthetics of the game, from the train and its riders to the floaty dialogue boxes.  Everything seems purposefully laid out in the Subsurface Circular and I personally appreciate the artistic [i]intention[/i] that permeates the whole thing.  Even from the very get-go, you can wiggle your mouse during the intro slideshow and for some reason, I thought that was a pretty neat touch.\n\nAt the end of the day, however, I don't think the game will blow anyone's mind.  It's incredibly deliberate in its design goals and I think the fact that it nails what it's trying to do is what makes this something that will be endearing to several gamers.  On the other hand, a subset of the gaming populace will quite simply not care.  It's not so much that they wouldn't 'get' it, but rather it just won't speak to everyone, especially the crowd that revels in twitchier, competitive play.\n\nSubsurface Circular is like sitting down to play through a chess problem.  You have a goal, and you pay attention, observe, and act in accordance with reaching that goal.  It's a reflective process and I think by the time you reach the game's conclusion, you will understand that feeling of lone pursuit.  It's definitely something I think people should try out, even if it's not particularly your cuppa.

It feels forced and as though they were scared writing it that things might not be \"big\" enough and I enjoyed it a lot more prior to the twist at the end. What's wrong with a simple investigation? Nothing! Why is there this need that everything has to be a huge world changing decision? Just keeping it as a simple interesting story where you solve a crime would have been fine with me. With a little more time put into the investigation aspect instead of the jarring twist at the end it could have been really good. As it stands it is only okay. Additionally the developer commentary is text only and doesn't flow well with how it is laid out, audio to go along with the text would have been great.

This originates in your options existing of singular words. You never quite know in what way the dialogue steers as you don't actually see the formulation\n-Many dialogue options don't have any actual impact, subjects don't have any form of lasting \"mood\". This disallows characters to be considered \"round\" by conventional means\n-Faced the same bug twice where a station would freeze upon arrival\n-Game shoves \"hints\" in your face before you even realize there was a puzzle. This part frustrated as I never got the time to actually do the thinking myself. I say this without spoiling anything, but if you're like me you will inevitably feel annoyed when these come by\n\nOverall: it's like watching an interesting filmhouse movie that relies much more on intelligence than explosions to keep you in your seat.\n\nMy verdict: 7/10 - worth it on full price\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1503071593, "timestamp_updated": 1503071593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.420769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34330560": {"recommendationid": "34330560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015511122", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503722309}, "language": "english", "review": "Subsurface Circular is one of those experiences that knows just how long it needs to be to provide an entertaining experience, make the player think, and not overstay its welcome.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1503069032, "timestamp_updated": 1503069032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509011", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34330514": {"recommendationid": "34330514", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973148866", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503091444}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little game from a wonderful studio.

That's enough for me to tell you - it is garbage. Effort went into this, but far too little, in my eyes. Let me parallel here: eating a $5 banknote feels basically the same as playing this.\n\nPeople probably simply dislike this review without even reading. Oh well.\n\nIt's a story driven adventure (\"game\") - you're presented with text options which are so linear that my brain deflates - you, as a player have absolutely zero choice on how the story or at least the conversation goes. The questions our \"detective\" can ask sound like they were written by a 5 year old while he's made out to be with \"smart\" enhancements.\n\nTek: I seem to be lost\nDetective: Are you not from here?\n\nNote - instead of directly saying that \"I'm lost, since I'm new around here\" or something along those lines, it's pointlessly made so that you need to ask, when it's obvious. \n\nSeems the developer also regards players as complete degenerates, since in the corner of the screen it says \"Find out what X wants.\" - there's nothing else to do in this boring game, so I have enough brainpower to realise that myself. \n\nAnother reason for that is even worse. You can choose to end the conversation, but as I've said - talking is the only thing you can do and ending it will only force you to interact with the same dumb-ass you were talking before. It's so counter intuitive  that I'm simply baffled.\n\nI'm sure that example alone is enough for me to prove that this is not a game, but rather a linear, boring story conveyed through a chat. Although I can only comment 20 minutes I've played, I'm certain that the story drags on like this for those 2 hours aimlessly, seeing how much exposition is dumped at the intro and our \"detective\" taking on  completely unmotivated tasks. The intro dialogue could've had a conflict, a doubt and yet nope. Instead of cleverly using the fact that the \"detective\" is  obviously smart and self-driven to cause some sort of diversion while talking to the \"kid\". Oh, and please don't tell me looking at a map and answering a question when there's an option \"I don't know\" is gameplay, plus has no consequence.\n\nEither way, it seems like the developer spent more time making these moving images (some call it graphics, but not in this case) look pretty than developing an engaging story - or an intro, at the very least, about which they so proudly boast. \nWhat I also just realised from Store screenshots - it appears as if you spend the whole time on this train and solve a case at the same time? Isn't that a bit coincidental for the right people to be at the right train stop? Coincidences in storytelling are the purest showcase of inability to tell, well,  [spoiler]a story.[/spoiler]\n\nHonestly,  I'm better off eating my $5. Here's a suggestion. What if instead of making it look shiny, you'd spend those resources on making it more interactive and interesting to actually \"PLAY\". Speaking of their limited resources, I really despise their choice to make it more visually appealing instead of actually interactivity or at least produce a quality intro story wise. For me, that's questionable resource management. Best example how it's done right  - Undertale. A one man project, simple visuals, but a vast amount of quality content, gameplay and narrative wise, so no, budget sounds like a cheap excuse to me (no pun intended).\n\n[spoiler]Comment: Oh, you c*unt, it's not a game - it's an experience!\nAnswer: \"Bithell [u] GAMES[/u]\".[/spoiler]\n\n I did not finish it for reasons mentioned above. I don't care if it has an astounding build-up and ending. I lost interest, because I predict the same poor level of quality through out the whole 2 hour \"game\", since the intro HAS to reflect the game and its intentions..  \n\nAny dislikes simply feed my sinister outlook.\n\nNow sincerely,\nsuck a d1ck, b1tch.", "timestamp_created": 1503061661, "timestamp_updated": 1510410855, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.245480", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34328082": {"recommendationid": "34328082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016956669", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503060180}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent narrative-driven game.

This game however, is amazing. The visuals are very clean and polished and the detail that has been created is superb on the train itself, especially since it will be the only thing you are seeing in this game. \n\nGameplay mechanics are very interesting. There is one point where you have to change a \"setting\" on a character to get different responses, a logic puzzle (which has the option of using auto complete to do for you, which I would have done but I didn't have anything with me to suitably write out the notes for. I won't spoil the other puzzles but those are some really great moments in the game. The dialogue is also fantastically written. Each robot has a different personality and they all feel genuine. \n\nThere was also a reference to Thomas was alone which made me laugh and it was told in a really interesting manner. \n\nThe ultimate plot was great. Most of the other kinds of games like these that I've played have had plots that become predictable and I can accurately guess what is probably going to happen, but this game has a story that is so well crafted that I am amazed. \n\nIt is super short but it is one of those games that can have multiple different endings depending on actions that you perform even from the very start of the game.

I do think though that this game is so well executed that it will have appeal to people who are not normally interested in the genre.\n\nSubsurface Circular takes place entierly on a subway car for robots. You are a robot detective that is attempting to solve a mystery by questioning other robots in the car. Through questioning other robots, you unravel bits of the mystery as well as discover more about the personal lives of the robots and even attempt to solve some of their problems (aka: problem solving you can do with dialogue trees while sitting down).\n\nIt's worth noting that the problem solving aspect of the game is the most, well, \"game like\" thing you do in Subsurface Circular. Solving problems will involve you quickly looking through maps for travel answers, looking through dialogue for hidden clues, as well as other puzzles that may require you to pull out the pencil and notepad. The problem solving is never too hard, but I enjoyed the process of doing it whenever possible anyways. It's a neat way to add a \"game like\" element to sitting down and talking to some robots on the subway.\n\nBut this game excels in the parts where you are just talking to the robots, chipping away at the overarching mystery and learning more about their world. The robots range from amusing conversationalists to downright hilarious and then all the way to wise. The robots you meet on the subway lead to conversations that at a minimum are enjoyable and at their best made me reconsider some thoughts and belifs that I hold. I'm not saying that this game is life altering or anything, but it makes some decent points about some issues that I haven't thought about in a lot of detail.\n\nFinally, I want to mention that this games art direction is killer and the soundtrack is well written and presented in a way that suprised me.\n\nI recommend this game to those that want to experience a cool story in weird future. While the game will probably take you only around 2 hours, I think it is time that is very well spent, and very much worth the price tag. Even if story games aren't usually your thing, I think you should give it a shot. It is so well done that I think any person who likes games as a hobby will at least appreciate it for telling a good story and showing how conversations in games can be done very well. \n\nAlso, I recommend playing this in one sitting, so get a drink and a snack and please, play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1503024472, "timestamp_updated": 1503024472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750920", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34318906": {"recommendationid": "34318906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273263334", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503257917}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing text based game with an insanely cool looking design and feel to it!

Different characters enter and leave your car. Decision points unfold as dialog with them. The story (which is well written) unfolds as choices in this dialog. Playtime is 3 hours tops (more if you want to explore different choices or go back for the dev commentary).

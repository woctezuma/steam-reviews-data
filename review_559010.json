Hard to believe that something this simple could also be so beautiful. The perfect VR experience to simply relax to. No points, no score, no guns, no enemies. This game is best experienced either standing or sitting, but ideally with some relaxing music playing. This is basically a mesmerizing iTunes visualizer (you remember the good ones? From the early 2000's.) that you get to control. So, to make this a proper review, the good:\n\n1. This is pretty unique\n2. It is exceedingly simple in design, but still elegant.\n3. It is easy to get lost in this game just playing with the physics.\n4. It runs surprisingly well given the CPU intensive nature of the physics.\n\nSo the bad (not really bad, just niggles.):\n\n1. There are no options as far as setting. It's a blank dark expanse you stand in. Dev please add some choices for backgrounds. A beach at night, the surface of the moon, etc.\n\n2. No music either. There's plenty of open source chillstep music that would go perfect for this game.\n\n3. Minor performance dips, i'm running an FX-8350 @ 4.2 ghz and a R9-290X and sometimes would see gameplay slow, especially when the particles star clumping tightly.

The point of the game is iteration, doing the levels over and over until you understand what to do and until you get better at doing it. The camera is close to the actual \"ball\" that you're playing, which makes it difficult sometimes to see where you're supposed to go, and the game's visuals plays into this with its aesthetic and actual, invisible platforms in many levels. Don't expect to be able to do all levels in the first try; again, the game is about iteration and learning-through-doing. If you like games that will frustrate you a lot at times, then Grapple is a pretty damn good experience. If you don't, you will hate it and probably not finish it, because there is nothing else but the gameplay to get you through the game (meaning, there is no story).\n\nAs for my recommendation, I personally liked it, but I can see it being kind of a nieche experience. I would suggest getting this game if you like the core principle of grappling/swinging, because it does work very well in this game. I would suggest getting it if you like difficult games and overcoming them. I would suggest getting it if you like 3D platforming, and can oversee your perspective being limited while playing.

Just don't ask me about the time trials, those are for a different breed of platformer enthusiast altogether.\n\nAnd if all that sounds a bit too pretentious, the TL;DR is that it's a great platformer that's not overly difficult (unless you want it to be) and is unlike anything else presently on the market.", "timestamp_created": 1499294142, "timestamp_updated": 1499294142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33117230": {"recommendationid": "33117230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101128615", "num_games_owned": 1227, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499370956}, "language": "english", "review": "Although the tag says that Grapple is a puzzle platformer, I would call it more of a momentum based platformer.

Okay, so I'm not making the game sound that fascinating, but the gameplay is what's being focused on right now and after churning 16 hours into Pathologic, I needed a much-deserved \"break\" before I get back into the swing of things (no pun intended... I think). \n\nThe controls and obstacles are what make this game really unique. Grapple slowly introduces concepts to you about momentum, different colored blocks, purple launchers, and smashing your keyboard to smithereens (although that part is optional)- and multiplies the difficulty of those concepts until you learn to simply get good at swinging around the obstacles. I get it. That's what a game is supposed to do. But after I beat Sonic Adventure 2, I sort of forgot how video games are supposed to work, so thank you for reminding me Grapple!\n\nThe game controls exceptionally well. It's a lot like the swinging mechanics of Spider-Man 2, with a much tighter experience than just swinging across an open world. It's tough- it'll kick your a**- but it's pretty fair throughout the experience. There were only a few times when I felt that something was either way too easy out of nowhere or something purely luck-based. There are even some levels where you can skip whole portions if you're clever enough (which I hardly ever am) and will certainly aid any speed-runners looking for something to get their rocks off to.\n\nSo... yeah.\n\nGrapple is good.\n\n7/10\n\nBye.", "timestamp_created": 1519664980, "timestamp_updated": 1519664980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39811402": {"recommendationid": "39811402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012766987", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 107, "last_played": 1520720432}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried this a little in 2016.\n\nWent and played Energy Hook.

Your position in a 3d field. The distance between you and the next thing to hook onto. And your momentum/fight with gravity.\n\nThis game is frustratingly unforgiving. I say it's unforgiving because the hook has a very short distance and there is nothing but gravity that is going to give you your momentum. This means while you are in the air, you have a very tiny window to hook into the next ceiling. So much precision is needed here and it is frustrating to come up short.\n\nThis game is a lot like Super Meat Boy. Super precise timing is needed and the tool to instantly quit and retry is there, but there is no leaderboard. There are achievements.\n\nYou cannot skip missions and you unlock one mission at a time.

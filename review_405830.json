Only problems I really have with the game are well first of all the hit detection is awful, half of the time the enemies don't get hit even if you're aiming right on them, its like their hitboxes are right in the middle of them so you can't hit their arms and legs. It's just annoying and makes you want to run past the enemies half the time. Also I don't like this one as much as the first game, its not as straight forward, you need to run around this huge level completing objectives one by one, and ontop of that you need to collect the level keys and some other stuff if you want to face the true final boss.

Now, some might question why a 6 year old kid should get this as a game to play, but the simple answer to that is that my father also wanted to turn some dinos into chunky kibble. I remember running around the first level in a mix of fear and excitement, terror and curiosity. I hadn't the slightest clue what I was doing or what I even needed to do, but that didn't stop me. To the beat of that awesome original N64 soundtrack, I sliced, shot, and rampaged my way through anything foolish enough to step in front of me. Prior to this, I had only ever played games like The Legend of Zelda and Sonic, so this was a [u][b]HUGE[/b][/u] step in a hole new direction for me. \nLife was never the same.\nNow fast forward 18 years, and hear I am running around the same levels with the same stupid, awestruck smirk across my face. Once the nostalgia wore off, I noticed a few slight differences from the original N64 version I grew up on. The occasional thing moved here, a new enemy there, but it still felt like Turok 2. The controls were simple, the game looked beautiful, it ran better than you can ever ask for, and before I knew it 3 hours had passed by. There was the occasional slight lighting issue, and audio would cut out on a cutscene every now and than, but there were no other reportable problems with this game.\n[u][b]Now, the thing to remeber is that this game is dated.[/b][/u]\nIt's old, and was made in a time when graphics weren't as they are now. However, if you can look past that (and don't mind a few hundred gallons of blood sprayed everywhere), I can guaranty that you'll find hours worth of fun in this game.\nNow, as I play more, I'll update my review based on my experiences across the whole game, and what I found while experiencing the multiplayer aspect.

The music suits for everything like when you are fighting a lot of enemies or you are almost death or just plain exploring. My only complain about this game which is the reason why I cant give it a 10 is its ending.

Levels can be confusing and are easy to get lost in. The voice acting is often hard to hear over the other sounds of the game as well. An option to have subtitles would have been nice.

It has more weapons, enemies, environments, and unlike in the first Turok game this one is much bloodier and very gorey (which is always a good thing of course :) ). I remember playing this as a kid back in the day just like with the first Turok except Turok 2 is much more serious and even has a forbidding tone such as the enemies you fight and the levels you venture into. \n\nThe story is much more developed and brings a bit more immersion (for the time it was released anyways) than Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. You play as Joshua Fireseed who becomes the next Turok after Tal'Set from Turok 1 (which was never really explained unless you read the comics) who must stop the Primagen from escaping his imprisonment of his own doing. The Primagen is an alien life-form with powerful telepathic powers, whose actions in his universe led to the creation of the Lost Land and our universe many eons ago. Realizing the danger he possessed, the elders of the Lost Land erected five Energy Totems in places thought to be vulnerable to the Primagen's power.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is an excerpt from the Turok wikipedia about the Primagen:\n\n\"Long ago, in a universe that no longer exists, there was an alien race of extremely intelligent sentient beings. They had answered many of life's mysteries, with the exception of one: where did all come from?\n\nOne of them wanted to answer this very question. His peers tried in vain to stop him. He devised a \"time\" machine, one which could theoretically allow him to travel back in time and discover the beginning of creation itself.\n\nThere was a problem, though: time travel to the past is impossible, as it goes against the very foundation of the universe. His device was a time machine, but not the one he intended to create.\n\nAs the Primagen traveled through the Netherscape, bits and pieces of different worlds were dragged along with his Lightship, like a magnet, until he reached what he thought was the beginning of time. When the Lightship came to a stop, matter all around him began collapsing and compressing, and he realized this was his chance to witness what no mortal eyes had ever seen: the birth of the universe, the beginning of time.\n\nAs the universe reached its final moments, the hole left by the Lightship in the Netherscape had yet to be closed, and matter dragged by many of the Lightship's power cores began bombarding it. The bombardment de-stabilized the Lightship, sending it towards the One Point, triggering what is known as the Big Bang.\n\nShortly thereafter, all that was left from this universal display of fireworks was the cosmic, primordial soup that eventually lead to the creation of our universe.\n\nThe Big Bang sent the Lightship and its owner back into the Netherscape, sealing him away in a temporal prison of his own making, one way in, no way out.\n\nConstant freak events occur all across our universe, such as objects disappearing to either never be seen again or re-appearing in another world, billions of light years away from their origin. There is a reason for this: the hole left behind in the Netherscape by the Primagen's Lightship allowed for energy from the Big Bang to affect its natural structure, and thus, these bits of pure energy punched holes all across the vastness of the universe.\n\nThese holes are in constant flux, always unpredictable. Being sucked into a Netherscape hole is like playing a game of Russian roulette; you will never know if the other side of the portal is either deep inside a planet's core or right in the middle of an intergalactic war.\"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow as to were this information came from I'm not sure maybe from the game manual or something.\n\nAll in all I highly recommend this game to anybody willing to give it a try and to the hardcore fans of the original Turok series.", "timestamp_created": 1512638576, "timestamp_updated": 1512639466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38042761": {"recommendationid": "38042761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098426505", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512869341}, "language": "english", "review": "For a 19 year old game, (one that I loved in 1998, so my opinion may be a bit colored to begin with) Night Dive have done an amazing job making it feel relevent.

I still own my copy of Turok 2 SOE, on the N64 and I remember the days, I'd stay up late, trying to find my way through the Lair of the Blind Ones. The game left a lasting impression on me and I recall having dreams (err nightmares) of it.  Unlike anything I've played before, during that period of my life.\n\nToday, we now have a remaster of that game and while I was excited to play it, I was also a bit afraid of any changes made to it.   But my fears were put to rest, almost immediately after starting up the game. You'll get that classic Iguana intro and music at the start screen, which put a smile on my face. :)\n\nAfter punching in 14 hours into it (I'm not done yet!), I can honestly say that I'm very happy with the work done by the developers. A lot of love was put into making this remaster a great experience, with finer image quality (though not a transformation of the original) paired with good sound quality and fast paced action.\n\nThe controls are quite sharp, though hit detection can be a pain with smaller enemies, like the spiders and compy dinos, but it's nothing that ruins the game. Use the war blade on the comps and deal with the fact that you're going to get bit at least once and you can safely strafe around the spiders, if you're not into slashing through them. Eventually, you'll have the flame thrower to help you with the nuisance.  \n\nThere are also markers around map objectives, to help you, which wasn't present in the original console game.  I'm not sure if one can turn this option off.\n\nSpeaking of options, there's many to play with, besides the games graphics and difficutlty. You have your bloom options, brightness settings as well as music style (PC or N64).  \n\nThe game play is also much faster than I remember. Very fluid and it almost feels like your flying around.  I appreciate this, after growing accustomed to Doom 2016's speed.  Keeps the action from going stale, imho. Love playing this with the keyboard and mouse!\n\nThe game's objectives and maps are recaptured with only a few minor changes done to the Lair of The Blind Ones, which seemed to have made it easier to run through, without constantly making that wrong turn, which puts you back to a spot you've already covered. Some people may or may not appreciate this. It didn't ruin it for me.\n \nHonestly, this game is great. Whether you've played the original or not, I'd totally recommend it. It's very fun and captivating, for a game it's age.  Best Turok game ever, imho.\n\n\n\"I AM TUROK!!\"", "timestamp_created": 1511892263, "timestamp_updated": 1511892380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37873805": {"recommendationid": "37873805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031258640", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511937771}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice and Challenging", "timestamp_created": 1511870250, "timestamp_updated": 1511870250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37860791": {"recommendationid": "37860791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074774106", "num_games_owned": 1946, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511855790}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game when I was a child and Im happy to say that replaying this version feels extremly tight and the hardcore mode adds another layer to it that I'm currently enjoying a lot.\n\nCompletely recommended", "timestamp_created": 1511856377, "timestamp_updated": 1511856377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37844649": {"recommendationid": "37844649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195954521", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511623911}, "language": "english", "review": "Prepare to love this gem for cerebral bore, be amazed at the other weapons and hate lair of the freakin blind ones.", "timestamp_created": 1511836587, "timestamp_updated": 1511836645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37839572": {"recommendationid": "37839572", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996750046", "num_games_owned": 2155, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513716504}, "language": "italian", "review": "bello peccato che il multiplayer \u00e8 quasi deserto. conviene acquistarlo solo molto scontato", "timestamp_created": 1511830825, "timestamp_updated": 1511830825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37833583": {"recommendationid": "37833583", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994893654", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494639234}, "language": "english", "review": "Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is a wonderful recreation of the N64 original, and a computer version I actually didn't even know about until recently. The game itself runs with all the bells and whistles you would expect. Touched up graphics, no bog down, and in general how you wished it played back in the day (especially on N64). I was a huge fan of the game on console, and though I had the expansion pack, it still ran as clunky as a ten year old washing machine on legs. \n\nThe game is a crude open design, from a day when open exploration games weren't all that common. This game actually does a better job of direction than the first, but it's still easy to get turned around, lost, or just not find one of the many keys needed to open the next level gate. Still, there's a simplicity in the design that feels great if you don't mind wandering around for a bit, dispatching the endless spawning enemies. It holds up well enough today, but certainly shows it's age. It's fun, but not the ideal open world shooter thats since evolved. \n\nThe music is great. It was great when the game released, and it's better now. They've retouched the music, and taken the liberty of putting both the CD quality of the PC version in alongside the N64 set. They're both distinct for their own reasons, and I enjoy switching between the two. It was a nice touch they added in, but didn't have to. Either of the music tracks were great, but having the foresight to add both showed the developers care for their craft. \n\nWeapon selection is one of those things you don't see too often these days. This game had some of the most distinct weapons of any game, present or past. The Cereberal Bore is legendary in video games, and here is it's birth. Beyond that, the Nuke Staff is so very impressive. The Tek Arrows stood out for their vicious and distinct sound when they charged up and exploded inside an opponent. In general, the detail for these weapons were just a delight. Even that arm sabre thats obtainable is a viciously designed and executed weapon. I would love to see more game designers take variety in weapons design like this game.\n\nOverall, it's a classic. It stands the test of time, even if it stumbles slightly in the pacing. It can be tough at times, you can run out of ammo if you get stuck on a mission too long wandering for a key, and platforming is always hit or miss with 3D titles. All said, it's still great if you like classic games. For anyone who wants to remember what shooters were like, this is a good place to be. For those comfortable with the present, you may find this formula a bit different to your current tastes. For the price, especially on sale, I encourage a buy here. \n\n-M-", "timestamp_created": 1511824602, "timestamp_updated": 1511824602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547038", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37827227": {"recommendationid": "37827227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118781278", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513363155}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Awesome game, awesome remaster!", "timestamp_created": 1511819051, "timestamp_updated": 1511819051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37824718": {"recommendationid": "37824718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083115621", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511878271}, "language": "english", "review": "your childhood made relavent once again.\nbless you", "timestamp_created": 1511817078, "timestamp_updated": 1511817078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37820606": {"recommendationid": "37820606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000864959", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496576224}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\u00bfRecuerdas cuando los shotters eran exigentes y con un dise\u00f1o de niveles que podia llegar a frustrarte? \u00bfRecuerdas la sensaci\u00f3n de super al fin ese nivel? \u00bfrecuerdas la era pre ni\u00f1o-rata?", "timestamp_created": 1511814208, "timestamp_updated": 1511814208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37804107": {"recommendationid": "37804107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071074620", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511803530}, "language": "german", "review": "Ganz wie in alten Zeiten!\nWer dieses Spiel noch von fr\u00fcher kennt wird sich sofort heimisch f\u00fchlen.\nEin klassischer FPS Shooter mit einer guten Auswahl an Waffen.\nWer gerne viel ballert ist hier gut aufgehoben.", "timestamp_created": 1511803749, "timestamp_updated": 1511803749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37753403": {"recommendationid": "37753403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058386896", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493592404}, "language": "english", "review": "Nostalgia, what can I say?", "timestamp_created": 1511764084, "timestamp_updated": 1511764084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523490", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37730698": {"recommendationid": "37730698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064705507", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512101708}, "language": "english", "review": "Truely a throwback to simpler, and gorier, times.

While the first game was pretty barebones in its visuals, I don't recall it having quite so many blatant world edges. Where the first one would cover such things up with a layer of fog or something, this game is lousy with pits that clearly just stop, to the point that in some places you can see big boxy chunks where the developers just stopped building the wall. It creates the effect that the entire game is a crudely-built paper mache obstacle course.\n\nGeneral level design is worse too, largely abandoning the first game's distinctive verticality for an increased emphasis on corridor shooting, though this is admittedly rectified somewhat in the later levels. The attempt at nonlinearity simply serves as proof that nonlinear level design isn't better by default, as the game's reliance on teleporters to break up the level largely destroys any sense of continuity and the levels generally make no effort to visually guide the player, making exploration (which given that each level has specific objectives besides \"kill the things and find the exit,\" is non-optional) a trial-and-error chore. I had one instance where I spent a good half hour scouring a level for the last objective only to find it hidden down a random side passage that I had never noticed because I simply hadn't glanced left at that spot without any indication that I was supposed to.\n\nThe game is quick to boast its weapon selection, but much like Half-Life: Opposing Force this selling point is more of a hassle than a boon in practice. With 22 weapons to keep track of (at least, I could honestly be forgetting one or two), trying to find the best tool for the job in the heat of battle is a distracting mess and I often wound up spamming through whatever was convenient or just relying on one or two weapons until they ran out of ammo. Many weapons were outright useless, either rendered redundant by an identical-but-better weapon or simply being unable to keep up with the difficulty curve of the enemies. Even the big assembly weapon of the game - the Nuke - is largely useless because it's not worth using its ammo on lesser creatures and in boss fights it's an impractical time waster because they're invincible 60% of the time and only vulnerabe in certain spots the rest.\n\nTurok 1 had almost no story to it, and the sequel proves that this was for the better as the plot is roughly on par with something you'd find on a cereal box. Not only do dinosaurs barely feature this time around, but the game constantly feels the need to establish how this level's cannon fodder are a) irredeemably evil so it's okay to blast them to chunky bits on sight, but b) also being manipulated by the Big Bad to prove that he's even eviler. The attempt at stringing a story together also seemed to do a number on supplying variety, as the levels are in order: a vaguely acultural ancientish city, a nearly identical vaguely acultural ancientish city, a swamp, a cave beneath a swamp, a techno-organic complex, and a non-organic techno-complex. Each one introduces roughly 2-3 new mobs, none of which besides the basic lizardmen enemies will appear in any of the other levels.\n\nBoring, ugly and clunky, Turok 2 is worse than its predecessor in pretty much every way.

You'll see switches and items that you won't actually be able to reach until quite later on in the game and because maps are linked with portals it can be quite hard to keep track of where you are. Luckily this new version has a 'hint' mode, which hovers exclaimation marks over important switches and items, even through walls. You can switch this off, but unless you want a real challenge you'll probably want to leave it on because without it it's extremely easy to run straight past a vital item that you'll end up having to backtrack trying to find later on. Even with hints on I still found myself scouring around trying to work out what to do next. I recall when I played the original I was stuck on one particular part of the map for no less than a week because I couldn't find an extremely well hidden switch.\n\nThe hint mode alleviates some of this kind of frustration, but not all which is probably as it should be.

It became one of my childhood classics when I started playing FPS at 8 years old.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]Return of Dinosaur Hunter[/h1]\n\nTurok 2 was first featured in Nintendo 64. You play as Joshua Fireseed, a member of Native American hero, was assigned the task by female alien named Adon to stop the invasion of Primagen.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty straightforward in classic FPS formula. You progress through each world by completing main objective and collecting Primagen keys to unlock the last level. At the end of level you will have to destroy Totem that link to Primagen\u2019s power.\n\nEach world filled with well-crafted design from Hellenistic decoration of Adia city to hi-tech mothership. It\u2019s simple and linear, but multi-layered complexity rewarded you with collectathon life up gameplay (except on hardcore difficulty) and bonus items.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]Big Game Hunter[/h1]\n\nTurok 2 captured the feeling of hurting and it\u2019s the strongest point of Turok series; gunplay and enemies. You carry unlimited number of weapons such as traditional bow, shotgun, and harpoon. The more you progress, the more you earn advanced arsenals; laser shotgun, flamethrower, boomerang razor, and cerebral bore (a.k.a brain drilling). There\u2019s variation of enemy types; the dinosaur, the undead, the blind ones, and more. Each of them has their own behavior and attack pattern which make engaging combat and strategy on higher difficult (it\u2019s challenged, but fair). Moreover, the various feedback animations of each enemy are scripted, but very satisfied and brutal to watch. Solid sound design and memorable soundtracks.\n\nAlthough, the remastered version reduces complexity of some sections, it still remains its labyrinth and some objectives require fully exploration which can be aggravating for some player who enjoy full-action mission. You might experience head-bob issue while moving in default setting. Only few enemies have hit-scan and respawn mechanics every time you switch level can be bit annoy for some players.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]Supreme Remastered[/h1]\n\nNight Dive does amazing work on remastered version; polished port and much optimized for modern system. I have solid framerate without single technical issue on my full playthought. The game also offers various graphical customization, improve gameplay, UIs, new multiplayer mode, split-screen, and mod support while preserving its main core. It brings back Turok back to life again with improvement in every aspect.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nTurok 2 remastered is the long deep single-player and enjoyable multi-player with varied enemies and weapons.

I loved the world, the violence and the weaponry. So the day Turok 2 came out was a good day indeed. However, it ran like mud on the N64 even with the extra memory, like 20'ish fps at most - and was difficult beyond belief. I got so stuck in the Lair of the Blind Ones that I'm pretty sure I went insane at some point before finally finding those two switches.\n\nAnyway, Turok 2 on the PC fixes every problem I had with it on the Nintendo 64. It runs smoothly at 60fps, controls like a modern shooter and looks as good as it should without killing the original look. It's all great. It's a great port.\n\n[b] The good:[/b] \n\nThe game is bigger and more complex. The worlds are different and the enemies are varied enough. The weaponry is as imaginative as ever, with the Cerebral Bore being the big star back in the day because of the over the top violence. My favorite weapons from the game is probably the Tek Bow, because of the challenging headshots, and the Shotgun with explosive shells for those precise insta-kills.\n\n[b] The Bad:[/b] \n\nThe game is bigger and more complex. The complex part makes it confusing at times, and the level design is not all that memorable - making stumbling around levels looking for things you might have missed (and you will miss them) a little annoying at times. And when you have found all the levels and gone through them all, you still need to find the sacred feathers and primagen keys - so there will be a lot of backtracking. It's a lot of fun opening up places you couldn't reach before, sure, but the level design again kills a little of that fun.\n\n[b] Conclusion:[/b] \n\nTurok 2: Seeds of Evil is a true sequel, in that its more of everything. More of what made the original so great, more great weapons and more violence. But also bigger and more complex than it needs to be, and it loses some of the light fun the original had in the process.

wenn man Backtracking aufgrund von Schl\u00fcsseln betreiben muss, kann man das jetzt locker flockig machen, ohne den ganzen Level von A-Z durchzurotzen\n- Die Story (recht d\u00fcnn, aber auf die kommt es auch weniger an)\nAnsonsten f\u00e4llt mir nichts weiter an negativen Aspekten ein.\n9,5/10 kriegt Turok 2 von mir, und eine ganz klare Empfehlung!\n", "timestamp_created": 1502139128, "timestamp_updated": 1502139128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505205", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34073971": {"recommendationid": "34073971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080825013", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507074669}, "language": "spanish", "review": "soy un jugador quien crecio con la n64 y al ver que remasterizarian los turok , le di atomos para luego luego comprarlo cuando saliera , y que les puedo decir , mejoraron enormemente la experiencia de juego , los graficos , la estetica , y la percepcion de renderizacion del juego , tanto que ahora ni siquiera parece el original , parece un nuevo titulo. conserva la dificultad original de la nintendo 64 , aunque ahora puedes utilizar las ayudas que te da el juego para no batallar en pasarte el juego , que recalco , necesitaras el 100% para acabarte todo el juego , y preparate por que los enemigos seran demasiados bestiales con una ia casi perfecta y las distintas variedades de armas que puedes conseguir en el juego , ademas de las localizaciones y los jefes emblematicos en especial los 4 ultimos jefes. este titulo es 100% recomendable para las personas fanaticas a los FPs y mas los que crecieron con turok en la n64. no lo dudes compralo , te volvera mas adicto que la cocaina", "timestamp_created": 1502077479, "timestamp_updated": 1502077479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598540", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34011821": {"recommendationid": "34011821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032115890", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505030815}, "language": "english", "review": "Arguably the best Turok in the franchise, Dinosaur Hunter and Evolution being close 2nd and 3rd.", "timestamp_created": 1501838264, "timestamp_updated": 1503301853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33989426": {"recommendationid": "33989426", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971415675", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501744209}, "language": "english", "review": "Sequel with much more variety and even bigger levels than its predecessor\n\nPRO:\n+ Original gameplay with rather subtle visual improvements and convenience features (e.g. turn off intros, skip death sequences or eliminate head bobbing)\n+ Six massively huge levels which often require backtracking to collect everything\n+ Every level has a different look and enemies (other than in the first Turok)\n+ Motivating hunt for Nuke Weapon, Talisman feathers, Primagen keys and secrets in general\n+ More story with objectives to complete in each level\n+ Option to switch between N64 and PC soundtrack via menu\n+ Free saving (plus quicksave option)\n\nCON:\n- Levels are almost too huge at times - it's easy to get lost (especially the Lair of the Blind Ones)\n- Some objectives and secrets are quite difficult to find (e.g. unlocking the Primagen key in level 6)\n- There could be a few more checkpoints in some levels to cover more ground quickly via warp feature\n\nVerdict:\nTurok 2 is a huge improvement over the original game with quicksave option, acceptable jumping sequences, great variety of locations, awesome soundtrack, and objective-driven level design. Its massive levels can take you 1-2 hours each, and even after that you will have to return later after collecting Talismans which allow you to reach areas in some levels which you could not access before. Other than the first Turok, I can recommend this game without any restrictions. It is enjoyable, entertaining, does not get boring over time and has a huge load of weapons for you to collect and use on a wide range of enemies.

Turok 1's main objective was to find level keys just so you could continue. Turok 2 on the other hand keeps the level keys, but also gives you numerous objectives per level to complete. As an example, the first map in this game, The Port of Adia, tasks you with saving 4 children and activating 3 distress beacons. The overall MAIN objective of each level however, is finding and protecting an energy totem from Oblivion's forces. These totem challenges will test your mettle by the end of the game, with absolute swarms attacking it as soon as you warp into the totem challenge.\n\nGuns GALORE. Seriously man if you don't know what the Cerebral Bore is you are a fuckin' mongo. Ammo types! Explosive Arrows! A Nuke Launcher! Flamethrowers and Plasma Guns! Plenty of options for your carnage needs friend.\n\nThe only issue everyone seems to point out with this game is map length. There aren't that many levels in the game, but Acclaim made up for that fact by nearly doubling the length of every map in the game. Turok 1 had some decent sized maps but Turok 2 turned that way up. Thankfully, unlike the first game, this remaster has the classic save and load anywhere function, so you do not have to rely on checkpoints to save your progress. \n\nTurok 2 has and will forever be my favorite game made by Acclaim. I'm hoping that the sales of both Turok 1 and 2 drive nightdive to finish the series with Turok 3 and Turok: Evolution.

I think that I was about 7 or 8 years old when I first got my hands on this game for the N64, and with my cousin we spent lots of days and nights playing with it (the good old days, our parents didn\u2019t even know what we were playing at). By then all we could do was entering the super cheat and have fun with it exploring the levels and getting lost, or just kill each other in the multiplayer mode, because the campaign was, obviously, too complicated for us.\n\nNow let\u2019s go to the present (almost). It wasn\u2019t until a few years ago, maybe at age 16 or 18, that I took my old N64 and decided to take this game seriously. I WAS AMAZED. I had read on some forums on the internet that modern games were too easy and simple, and that Turok 2 was the perfect example of how back then good games were elaborate, and well, I just couldn\u2019t agree more with that fact. I completed the whole campaign once and then played each level again 2 or 3 times (with the exception of Port of Adia, the only level I could pass as a kid), and after that I realized that\u2026 it wasn\u2019t that hard at all! After the first try I could easily remember where were all the key objects, even in the infamous Lair of the Blind Ones. All you had to do was to use the map to not get lost because, of course, no one would be so stupid to try and memorize it. I ended falling in love with the game and the design of the levels knowing that no modern game could give me that weird sensation of frustration mixed with self-accomplishment.\n\nSo as you can imagine I couldn\u2019t be more hyped when I read about Night Dive Studios remastering Turok 2. I waited until I was on summer holidays to buy it and well\u2026 starting from Port of Adia I notice some GOOD modifications on the design of the level: the portal to the main hub at the beginning, more enemies (well done, the ammo is almost infinite in this game), and the new zone in the ports where the beacons were located (I always thought it was stupid to separate both zones with a teleport when they were connected actually). On the other hand the \u201cgrappling ledges\u201d thing was totally unnecessary because it forced the developers to make some stupid changes, the location of the first Ultra Health being an example, but well, I could get along with that. Then I go with the River of Souls\u2026 short summary: the objectives were relocated so you couldn\u2019t accidentally skip them, destroying the essence of the game. The original version had that added bonus of exploration that it made the game what it was, and now the level was almost lineal, GREAT (SARCASM). As you can see I still remember perfectly the distribution of PoA an RoS and while the changes where overall positive in the first one. I stop playing, go to the forums and\u2026 surprise! The same thing happened to the Lair of the Blind Ones!!! And hilariously there\u2019s and achievement for that level, what a joke\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve seen somebody in another review complaining about the same things, and the answer from another steam user was that all those things were foretold (because the developers thought that some zones had unnecessary maze-like structures), so I\u2019ve got to recognize it: MY BAD, I didn\u2019t mind to get enough information on the product I was buying. But then it is not a remastered version of Turok 2, it is a modification with improved graphics and performance. You can\u2019t imagine how sorry I am to have to make this negative review (the only one I ever made in Steam), I suppose I was too hyped and my intention is not to hate, but I'll have to ask for a refund.\n\nPS: I still recommend this game as it\u2019s the best port you\u2019ll find, particularly if you like 20 year old videogames and FPS, and never played it before, or even if you played it but don\u2019t remember it as well as me (most of the players haven\u2019t minded the changes or simply haven\u2019t noticed them).\n\nPSS: Again sorry for my english if I haven\u2019t explained something well enough.", "timestamp_created": 1501271722, "timestamp_updated": 1501271722, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501390", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33850378": {"recommendationid": "33850378", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990324404", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501226528}, "language": "english", "review": "A great FPS experience!\n\nPROS\n- Great for nostalgic gamers.

When I played this version for the first time, great memories of the N64 came flooding back. However I'd like to point out. First of all, even though this is remastered the graphic changes are barely noticeable. The only type of graphics that I know that changed is the lighting but there's so little darkness in the first level that it seems I don't even need a flashlight (In later levels, the flashlight becomes more useful).\nThe second thing is the cheats. This is very personal and I find it quite funny in some ways but I just want to ask, why did they put this in the game. It's when you turn on any cheat, even if it makes the game funny or even harder (Like the mode that makes the world very hard to see) Adon will say things like \"Oh, does that make you feel good?\" or \"You should be ashamed of yourself\". The fact that this game doesn't like it when you use cheats just kicks me in the balls. Cheats in single player is harmless and it seems the developers for this remastered version didn't take the hint. Only cheaters in multiplayer should be punished as it ruins everyone else's fun. In single player, it's just for personal preference. (Please don't complain about me using cheats, I played the game without them too.)\nThe last thing I want to point out is the sounds. This might just be me but some sounds in this game makes me miss the old sounds. Unlike the music, you can't change the settings to play the N64 sounds.\n\nSpeaking of the music, here's some good points. I wish I can do this with the sound effects but I like the idea of being able to change the music from the N64 version to the PC remastered version. This way you can listen to the old music for that nostalgia effect or you can switch to the remastered music to see how much has changed.\nThe difficulty is just as hard as the old version too. Of course there's the 4th level which is easy to get lost in which no one likes. But the developer made fun of it by making an achievement for getting all objectives and keys in that damn place just because of how hard it is. Part of me hates that idea but the other part loves it as we all remember how annoying it was. The only change in difficulty that I found was the enemy AI. Enemies can now see you from really far away. Which makes them more unpredictable.\nI have noticed while testing the weapons that the lag caused by the flamethrower, scorpion launcher and the grenade launcher has been fixed. The N64 made those weapons cause the game to slow down while the remastered version allowed them to let the game run so smoothly. I also noticed that the damage they do is a lot more realistic. The PFM layer tears pretty much any enemies' legs off like it should. All explosives tear enemies apart like a real explosive weapon while the old version for some reason made them completely immune to it at random times.\nThere's a particular cheat that allows the player to memorise the level maps a lot easier, even the Lair of the Blind Ones. That's the Fly ability. It could have been better if you can move through walls like the first game but I can tolerate it. If the 4th level is too hard, just play the game again with the cheats and just memorise the map as much as you can.\n\nI have noticed a glitch in the game. In the second level you need to open a gate to get to the trap portal making you pull a few switches and fight through some spiders. But there's a gap where you get a full health which is possible to jump across. If you run diagonally you move faster and jump further allowing you to jump across the gap with ease. At this point you'll notice that all the enemies in the portal room are gone.\nThe reason why I didn't put this in with the cons is because it can be a great tactic for speed running the game. I'd really want to see this game get beaten in just a few hours.\n\nNow would I recommend it. I'll say yes. Even to those who haven't played the N64 version before. Yeah, it's bloody but that's what makes Turok so great. And yes, the graphics are not the most aesthetically pleasing but that doesn't make this a bad game. I love this game so much and it's worth every cent. Plus, it's really hard to get the N64 version these days so this is a good way to get the game.", "timestamp_created": 1500454026, "timestamp_updated": 1500454026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33644272": {"recommendationid": "33644272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085477871", "num_games_owned": 690, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500515608}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh yes, yes, a million times YES! Turok 2 may be easily enjoyed by anyone with a passing interest in classic-style FPSes, where outlandish blocky graphics were the norm, the only time you looked through a sight was for the resident sniper and the finest aim you had was the quickness of your wrist or the litheness of your thumb. Having surfacely played the first Turok on an old PC way back when, then playing it via emulator on Wii N64, I arrived at a Steam sale and thought to get the first Turok, but the reviews were clear: don't bother - its map design isn't the best and a constant guide is required. Thus I turned my attention to this. It's by far the superior game in every way- a greater selection of weapons, variety in environments and tighter map design. Eagle-eyed aim is rewarded as I found out by going full headhunter mode with quick enemy deaths that spill out brilliant gloopy alien blood in such a classic way.\n\nMaybe get the first Turok cheap if you have to, but the story of the first game barely ties into this. Then again, it's a mid-late 90's FPS. Story in games still followed Romero's Law.\n\nSome people may be put off by the 3D hints displayed in game, that float in front of important switches or passageways. I say, f**k those elitist pri*ks. I'm sure they can be turned off but the main meat of the game is the enemies you face.

This game has always held a special place for me and is one of the big ones that kickstarted a lifetime of gaming. \n\nIn its heyday this game was a cut above the rest. The weapons were so detailed with many moving parts, and the imagination in their design makes each one so memorable. The way the enemies explode into entrails when you hit them with a Scorpion Missile, or how their arms and heads blow off when your Tek Arrows find their mark, and not least of all the unforgettable Cerebral Bore kills; the attention to detail in the models and their animations was just so far ahead of the other N64 games of the era. \n\nThe level design is still so intricate and varied with many secret paths that can be easily overlooked. Even having played the game over and over in my youth I still found this game so difficult to beat (I dont remember the levels being so damn long)! \n\nAs with Turok 1, Night Dive have done a great job remastering this game. It would have been nice if they had added a few more animations and a bit of pizzazz, but they have stayed true to the source material which is always a safe move. One thing I did notice was that on hardcore the era-appropriate difficulty spikes are really very frustrating, even more so than Turok 1 (which was quite easy on the hardest difficulty). But maybe modern gaming has softened me up.\n\nStill, this remaster has brought back many fond memories and it has stayed true to the original game. \n\nI had a great time!\n\nbewareoblivionisathand", "timestamp_created": 1499513667, "timestamp_updated": 1499513792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561753", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33329302": {"recommendationid": "33329302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310318317", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1514226739}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Simplemente debes comprarlo si disfrutaste originalmente del juego en 64 o en PC.\nTiene muchas mejoras que lo hacen aun mejor que antes, AI mejorada, mayores niveles de dificultad, se puede extender el limite del horizonte a diferencia del original.\nPrincipalmente lo grafico, puedes jugarlo con mucho detalle, o para los que disfrutan de la nostalgia; se puede desactivar todo eso y disfrutarlo como originalmente y con soporte a resoluciones mayores.\nNo pierdas el tiempo y compralo!", "timestamp_created": 1499389900, "timestamp_updated": 1499389900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33326519": {"recommendationid": "33326519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137284043", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 187, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "last_played": 1513599753}, "language": "english", "review": "It's in HD and uncut so I had to buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1499380812, "timestamp_updated": 1499380812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494350", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33298016": {"recommendationid": "33298016", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965629528", "num_games_owned": 953, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499477626}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing and disliking the first one I was really hesitant to go after this one.

In addition to the added PC controls, this port also has a few changes in dynamic lighting, slight map changes, some moved item and enemy locations, and a new ability to fast-travel between pink portals (originally used as saves in the N64 version).\n\nAll in all, this game is a masterpiece with incredible level and music design, and this all transfers beautifully to this Steam incarnation.

The lighting is better, the textures are better, weapons look better, not only that but it's easier to find things with the little markers now. I'm finding stuff I didn't even notice previously. \n\nAlso some of the maps are altered and improved with new things. There's also a new animation to grip onto a platform when jumping which is useful. On top of that the health now goes past 200 and you can save any time you want. I've only played the early part of the first level but i'm not dissapointed what so ever. I'm utterly impressed and happy I got the game. \n\nI bought it on sale and the nosataglia trip is amazing. Even the character models look better, more rounded and less blocky. They're not perfect but that's the good part of the game. It's nostalgic, it's a trip down memory lane and I love it. I highly reccomend this game and getting it on sale if you can. If you loved the original you'll fall in love with this one. I can only hope they port the 3rd one, Rage wars, and Evoloution next. I truely hope they do. \n\nAlso I'd like to point out the new lighting system is NICE.\n\nEdit: I'd also like to point out the control system is completely revamped as well.

Si alguna vez jugaste el t\u00edtulo original para N64, y sabes lo que involucraba invertir para poder jugarlo, ahora jugarlo en PC y tener una experiencia de juego renovada es muy satisfactorio.  Texturas renovadas, mayor resoluci\u00f3n, controles m\u00e1s intuitivos y una banda sonora renovada, hacen de este juego un homenaje digno del t\u00edtulo para la consola... y lo mejor, ya no se necesita un Expansion Pack ni un Memory pack para poder sacarle provecho y avanzar sin complicaciones (el que pas\u00f3 por esta \u00e9poca, sabe de qu\u00e9 hablo). Adicionalmente integra los mapas de multijugador de la consola, mapas exclusivos de la versi\u00f3n original para PC, mapas nuevos y modos de juego multijugador nuevos, incluyendo la posibilidad de jugar una partida local en pantalla dividida, como en aquella \u00e9poca, o una partida en l\u00ednea de hasta 16 jugadores.\n\nPara los jugadores \"millenium\", las nuevas generaciones que dan cr\u00edticas negativas por no saber lo que era realmente un buen t\u00edtulo, este fue uno de los mejores shooters del momento cuando se lanz\u00f3 originalmente, y lo recomiendo mucho personalmente. Se les advierte que este no es otro shooter lineal y simple, es un juego de tipo FPS que tiene una dificultad muy alta, niveles bastante extensos y laber\u00ednticos, requiere mucho tiempo de exploraci\u00f3n (ser detallista), saber administrar recursos y tener estrategias para eliminar enemigos de la forma m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida y \"econ\u00f3mica\", tiene un gran variedad de armas\n\nEn mi experiencia personal, me siento muy satisfecho con el juego, pues super\u00f3 mis expectativas con respecto al t\u00edtulo original, y est\u00e1 muy bien dotado con los elementos adicionales y mejorados de la versi\u00f3n remasterizada. Lo recomiendo mucho, y es un cl\u00e1sico que se debe tener.\n\n========================================\n|| Desde aqu\u00ed es algo de historia y experiencias de juego ||\n========================================\n\nCuando adquir\u00ed Turok 2 la primera vez, rentado, para la consola N64, me esperaba encontrarme con \"otro FPS m\u00e1s\" como muchos otros t\u00edtulos, y escuchando comentarios de otros diciendo que apenas eran 6 niveles en total me resultaba f\u00e1cil pensar en algo similar a Doom, pero \u00e9ste no fue el caso.  Para m\u00ed fue el juego que m\u00e1s me ret\u00f3, que m\u00e1s me frustr\u00f3 y el que m\u00e1s disfrut\u00e9, y que puedo decir que lo seguir\u00e9 disfrutando por mucho m\u00e1s tiempo.\n\nEn esa \u00e9poca (~1998) el N64 era una consola que ten\u00eda muchos t\u00edtulos cuyos datos de partidas pod\u00edan ser almacenados directamente en el cartucho, pero en el caso de los t\u00edtulos m\u00e1s complejos, como es el caso de Turok 2, depend\u00eda de 2 accesorios adicionales, un Expansion Pack y un Memory Pack, el primero era necesario para poder disfrutar de una mayor resoluci\u00f3n de im\u00e1gen y fluidez, no era obligatorio, pero mejoraba mucho la experiencia de juego; y el segundo era obligatorio para salvar la partida, y si no lo ten\u00edas hab\u00eda s\u00f3lo dos opciones: 1. dejabas la consola encendida hasta terminar el juego, cosa que era inconcebible, \u00f3 2. Apagar e iniciar una partida nueva la pr\u00f3xima vez.\n\nEn mi caso deb\u00eda optar por la segunda, e iniciaba el juego muchas veces con gusto, d\u00eda a d\u00eda, y realmente s\u00f3lo con el objetivo de probar suerte y habilidad para poder completar el nivel 1.  S\u00ed, aqu\u00ed esto no parece la gran cosa para los que no han tenido su experiencia, pero el punto es que, para poder finalizar ese primer nivel, tuve que valerme de una gu\u00eda que casualmente encontr\u00e9 en una revista mucho tiempo despu\u00e9s (hablamos del tiempo antes del Internet), y demor\u00e9, con gu\u00eda en mano, unas 10 horas cont\u00ednuas de juego para poder completar, finalmente, el nivel 1.  Y luego de saber completar a la perfecci\u00f3n el nivel 1, a\u00fan as\u00ed es una tarea que lleva alrededor de 1 a 2 horas, seg\u00fan la dificultad.\n\nAhora, luego de muchos a\u00f1os de tener el t\u00edtulo original y de jugarlo muchas veces, sin avanzar en lo absoluto realmente, me encontr\u00e9 con el lanzamiento del proyecto de Turok 2 remasterizado para PC.  Lo primero que pas\u00f3 por mi cabeza fue: \"voy a poder guardar la partida para avanzar\".  Para resumir mi experiencia con esta nueva edici\u00f3n, en el modo historia, inici\u00e9 el juego directamente en el modo dif\u00edcil, para adaptarme, y en este momento llevo m\u00e1s de 12 horas de juego y estoy iniciando el nivel 4, y no s\u00e9 cu\u00e1nto m\u00e1s me demorar\u00e9, teniendo en cuenta que hay que regresar regularmente a los niveles anteriores a adquirir elementos que s\u00f3lo es posible obtener con habilidades de niveles posteriores. Hasta el momento puedo decir que no he encontrado fallos y he tenido una experiencia de juego bastante \"limpia y muy agradable\"\n\nY para quienes son curiosos y quieren un vistazo r\u00e1pido a la apertura y complejidad que tiene el t\u00edtulo, la clave maestra que desbloquea todo el contenido del juego, es el nombre de uno de los logros... o en su defecto busquen las claves que hab\u00eda para el juego en el N64.", "timestamp_created": 1498711781, "timestamp_updated": 1498711827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32958849": {"recommendationid": "32958849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081595654", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497143154}, "language": "english", "review": "The Cerebral Bore is one of the finest virtual instruments of killing ever conceived.

The remaster improved here a lot with new visual clues for important items etc, but it still can be pretty annoying.\n\nAnother issu for me was the small amount of ammo you get for the weapons, i guess the original developers did this so you would also use the more obscure weapons, in that regard it worked, but for my taste i ran out of ammo for my favourite weapons too fast.\n\nall said and done, i would devinitly recommend trying Turok 2, it is a great shooter with a lot to see and find.

The only con of this game is that sometimes the level design is a bit too complicated, but of course we need to consider that this game is from an age were path finding and puzzles were sometimes the main features of a shooter or an adventure game.

Turok 2 is the sequel to the N64 hit Turok, remastered and looking better than it ever did on the N64.\n\nIn Turok 2 you play as Turok, a Native American warrior chosen to defend Earth from interdimensional threats. This time the Primagen has come, unsealed after thousands of years its up to our favorite Dino blasting hero to blast some Dinos and save the day.\n\nTurok 2 is an FPS and has loads of interesting weapons at your disposal. Of course you begin with the mundane, pistol and a bow. But quickly you gather up exploding bolts, and energy shotgun that literally shreds the enemy, and of course the Ceberal Bore, which drills into the bad guys head and.....explodes. Great fun to be had for all. With the PC controls or using a gamepad/controller, the controls are tight. Aiming is less precise, considering this is an N64 game, and it does get annoying to not be able to zero in on your target. This is slightly forgiven when more powerful weapons are obtained.\n\nThe level design however is sorely lacking. Each level tasks you with finding several things, and the levels are sprawling. Multiple paths, hidden paths, teleporters to other realms, it can be a little over whelming. Luckily a handy overlay of the area can be summoned, giving you an exact location as to where you are in the current area. This is great, but still doesn't take away the fact that there are a ton of things to collect. Aside from the main objectives, there are runes to collect to unlock more levels, weapon parts, keys, its quite a lot. If you do plan to play, plan a several hour session. However, there are teleporters around, allowing quick jumps to different sections.\n\nWith the remasting of the graphics, so does the sound get remastered. You can play the game with the original score, but the remastered just sounds so much better. All the weapons sound great, and powerful. The pistol sounds wimpy, while the whine of that Cerebral Bore is certain to make you whince at least once. The enemies also sound amazing, with dinosaurs sounding scary, as well as many of the more unique enemy types.\n\nIf your looking for a nostalgia trip, or your a young punk who has no idea what an N64 is (Nintendo 64), Turok delivers.", "timestamp_created": 1495601986, "timestamp_updated": 1495601986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31925076": {"recommendationid": "31925076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044001469", "num_games_owned": 405, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500341432}, "language": "english", "review": "Undoubtedly one of my favorite childhood titles, including it's predecessor.

Turok 2 resolves a lot of those issues, adds some fun new stuff in, and ends up with a really excellent product.\n\nThere are actual voice-acted cutscenes and plot now, which is interesting. The plot itself is fairly standard (bad guy wants to take over a place, you have to stop him), but there's backstory for a lot of locations, motivation for a lot of enemies, and an actually well-crafted sequel hook. It's nice to see that effort was put in, and the game's story is generally alright.\n\nThe game looks good (for its time) and animates great. Areas are bright and colorful, enemies are astonishingly expressive, and physics seem weighty and realistic.\n\nA lot of mechanics and gameplay elements are carried over from Turok 1, including the lives system, the idea of a handful of giant levels instead of many smaller ones, a few weapons, some enemies, and the solid platforming with no fall damage. However, there're a fair amount of new ideas added to the gameplay too, such as reclaimable arrows, a rideable armed dinosaur, checkpoints that give you health and ammo and allow fast-travel, and upgrades to help you find certain collectibles which are now scattered throughout levels.\n\nThose collectibles are the main difference between Turok 1 and 2. In addition to the level keys from the last game, Turok 2 adds additional (yet necessary to continue) objectives to every level. These mostly involve running up to something and pressing a button or using an item that you picked up in the same area, but the problem is that they're often really well-hidden. Combined with the expansive, complex nature of the level design, this leads to a shit-ton of backtracking and looking stuff up to try and find the last necessary location. Complementing these objectives are pickups for upgrades and new weapons that are similarly well-hidden or spread out. You can spend an hour or two longer than necessary picking a level clean for everything that you need to progress, slowing the otherwise-fun gameplay to an absolute standstill. The level design also lacks the intuitiveness of the first game, so it's far easier to get lost and completely stuck. This is Turok 2's main fault, which is a shame, because everything else works so well.\n\nOn the more positive side of things, Turok 2 does a lot to correct the first game's faults. You can switch ammo types now, and enemy respawn rates are down. The armor's gone, which I don't mind because it wasn't really that necessary in the original.\n\nThe weapon variety is insanely good. All the traditional weapons are still present (pistol, shotgun, etc.), but there are some really crazy ones added in. The War Blade is one of the most overpowered melee weapons I've seen in a while, there's a minethrower and an auto-pistol and a thing that fires shotgun shells in a sort of bouncing sniper-shot, and then there's the Cerebral Bore, which is one of the most amazing video game weapons I've ever encountered.\n\nComplementing the weapons is the gore system. Turok 1 was more bloody than gory, but this game kicks both of those things to 11. Blood splatters, gushes, and pools, enemies twitch and jerk on death, and you can remove heads and limbs if you aim at them. At one point I blew an enemy's entire top half off. The sound design adds a lot, too, adding screams, spurting noises, and the sound of enemies choking on their own blood. This is one of the most amazingly violent games I've ever seen, and it's a goddamn N64 title.\n\nApparently the main character is a different guy also named Turok.\n\nThis Steam port is also really good. The game seems to be far more crisp and colorful than the original, a quicksave feature seems to have been implemented (making the lives system obsolete), the auto-aim is gone so you actually have to try and hit things, and overall it just seems like a lot of love went into it.

My downright refusal to give it away often stems from the fact that I could never beat it fairly. It has always been a game that seem to require cheats in order to finish it. But despite my promises to beating it fairly-  The 12 year-old pissant that was myself back in the day, would input the oblivion code nonchalant just to get past the tougher portion of the levels with unlimited ammo and God mode. Looking back at it now- neither both the game and I didn't age properly to a certain extent.\n\nI'm going back a year later or more to Thanksgiving of 2016. I'm visiting my brother who still has the old girl that is the Nintendo 64 along with her controllers and their abysmal analogs. I know, I know- Input childhood nostalgia and 90's kids shenanigans here. But sometimes, I believe that there's some memories that need the rose tint taken away. Now don't get me wrong but the N64, God bless its hardware, has never aged well as one would think. It's equivalent to that of decades-old jerky. Sure, you can still eat it but it was hard to chew, tough to swallow, and the taste is faint but not enough to motivate you to keep eating. \n\nThe system while incredibly addicting with racers and platformers, it felt like it was never intended for the FPS genre. I'll admit a few good ones like Doom 64 comes to mind immediately- it was the other games like Turok and GoldenEye that showed how awkward that three-handled monstrosity that was the controller truly was. Utilizing the C buttons to move may have helped, but try aiming with that limp thumbstick and your frustation will escalate to Wieliczka levels of salt. \n\nJump away from the off topic family reunions and back to self-loathing and loneliness that I call military life. I get a coupon for 'Turok 2: Remastered'. And after playing 'Dinosaur Hunter' months before, I purchased the game immediately and promised to myself to play it straight. No cheats and maybe some walkthroughs, but no cheats for the duration of the playthrough.\n\n\nReview:\nAfter beating it, I can say that 'Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Remastered' is one the best remasterings I've ever seen for a game. There's a lot of polish in both enemies and environments, making everything looks so grand and without the fog of war minisculing the depth like it did a decade ago. You can now see everything and are no longer annoyed by baddies shooting you through the fog. Enemies now bleed more and corpses stay put rather than disappear in order keep the frame rate steady. Understandbly, what I'm typing before may be considered heresy to some players. But thankfully, Night Dive placed customization and allows the player to tool the game to their liking. Do you still love that fog regardless of its massive shortcomings? you can activate it. Hints are either distracting or bothersome? You can disable them. Want that weapon sway? Sway it away. Do you think that the ledge grabbing ability shouldn't belong in game despite it being incredibly helpful in situations? Disable that mess and keep it vanilla for Turok 2 is essentially your virtual oyster.\n\nInitially, I played this game with a Xbox controller. Considering Turok 2 was originally for consoles. It felt somewhat integral to play it vanilla like so.  Again, heresy to say- but utilizing a modern controller to a 10 year old title felt like I was playing it for the first time. As stated before, the N64 controller is a nightmare. So the use of two thumbsticks made game more responsive. My only gripe was when it came to swapping weapons. The one thing I was hoping they would keep was the way on how you switched your arsenal in the N64 variant. If I remember correctly, you would hold either A or B on the N64 controller and then highlight your choice of firearm with the thumbstick. Here, they repeat Turok: Dinosaur Hunter's mechanic of gun swapping. It's not a bad mechanic but when you're in an intense firefight, I would rather be fighting Mantids and not the menu. But more realizing too is that the 90's method means your couldn't move while you were choosing your gun so I can understand why they would change it to what it is now. \n\nBut we all know keyboard and mouse is by far the best choice. Considering that Turok 2 is basically Pre Serious Sam, Post Doom sort of mix. It made me curious to see if WASD  was more preferrable what with the no reloading, run/gun features; so I decide to give it a shot and playing this game upon a second run with the WASD+Mouse setup surprisingly feels natural. Much like GoldenEye- Seeds of Evil with PC controls is fantastic. But I do feel they missed an opportunity by copying Doom's way of handling the weapon switch. Every weapon is labeled on the numerical keys, yes. But remember how Doom categorizes their guns to specific numbers? For instance, the shotgun and super shotgun were on key 3? That made it convenient. That convenience is not here. Every single firearm has their own key which doesn't sound bad, but when your guns are listing from 1 thorugh + on the keyboard then that categorization would be exponential and much needed.\n\nShort answer is that graphically speaking, Turok 2 looks amazing. But on the control side of the game can be somewhat frustrating and there's  a limit on how you can customize in terms for button layouts. But the experience of it varies on your input and choice of play style. And there's without a doubt that Nightdive has put a lot of life into Turok 2, making it one of the few remastered releases that doesn't feel completely souless.\n\n\n\nConfession:\nI did noclip, though. It was in the Hive of the Mantids and I had no clue on how to get past the force field the blocking entrance to the whispers talisman chamber. Not to mention the fight with the final boss was both bullshit and ridiculous. So I did break my promise on not cheating and enabled unlimited ammo near the end. Suffice to say, though while I am somewhat pleased how far I've gotten- I still cheated and gotta play it again clean.

I still own my copies and they still work.\n\nTurok was, in my mind, one of the BEST FPS games on the N64. Some would argue that 007 Goldeneye and Perfect Dark were better, but Turok was basically the QUAKE/DOOM of the N64. The quickness and speed to it and the feel of the weapons made it more fun to me than the others.\n\nThis game, I can't really understand why I loved this game so much. Yes there are more weapons and way more fun/interesting (looking at you cerebral bore!) and the enemies and the ai they had were MUCH better and harder to fight... But yet I remember Turok 1 way more and enjoy it way more than this one and actually prefer to play Turok 1 over this game. I think my main issue is the push for a \"story\" and \"cutscenes\" and just how I didn't find any levels \"memorable\" Just about everything from the first game I can remember to almost to a Tee and know where everything is, and can play it over and over and over and never get tired. This game I just can't seem to pull myself through it, even after all these years... Maybe it's just me though.\n\nMy first MAJOR issue with this game though, is the performance. Turok 1 I can run it 60FPS or 120FPS through the entire game since day 1 (and while recording, even with mods.) This game I can't even keep it over 20FPS most of the time, even with the settings down low. Even when I tried to record this, I slowly started to lose 1 frame every 10 seconds, till the game ran at 0FPS. Even after 2 updates, this game still runs like ass. I currently can't even complete the game for how bad it runs. I've even deleted the game and re-downloaded it in hopes it would be better, it didn't help. I've looked around on the forums and tried various things to try help it, and did managed to get the game up to 30FPS sometimes.\n\nThe other problem (though minor) was with the updates, they ruined my save files, so I've had to restart the game 3 times. Hence why I've gotten pretty much no achievements. I've played with cheats so I can just jump ahead and have fun with all the great weapons.\n\nFOV settings for this game is just insane. It starts at 45 (original N64 FOV) to a stupid 179.00!! As in, impossible to play at. Why is that even an option?!\n\nThey brought back the MP, but I never played it, as my internet is utter sh*t and I have terrible ping. I never played the MP anyways back on the N64 because I didn't have friends.\n\n\nSo sadly, I hope they can figure out what is causing these performance problems, so that I can come back and attempt to play this game again. Until this game is fixed, I recommend getting the first game, as it works flawlessly... Or wait till they add in Workshop support like they did with the first game, so the fans can fix the game.\n\n\nPros:\n- Same great game that I grew up on\n- Fast paced Gunplay\n- Great enemies and AI\n- Both N64 & PC Soundtracks\n- Old cheat codes still work (disable achievements) [spoiler] BewareObliviationIsAtHand [/spoiler]\n- Working Multiplayer\n- Improved Options/Controls fit for PC gamers\n- Achievements\n\nCons:\n- Poor performance.\n- Some may not like the old look\n- I never liked the \"story\"\n- No Steam Cards\n- A little expensive\n- No Editor/Workshop support (yet)", "timestamp_created": 1491968881, "timestamp_updated": 1491970789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31090238": {"recommendationid": "31090238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019008644", "num_games_owned": 538, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499724666}, "language": "spanish", "review": "exelente remaster muy completo", "timestamp_created": 1491967221, "timestamp_updated": 1491967221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31089226": {"recommendationid": "31089226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109175148", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492287693}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing port of a very good N64 first-person shooter that was historically hampered by the console hardware it was designed for. There's an older PC port of the game that attempted to bring it to a wider audience, but it was pretty much garbage, and the game lay mostly forgotten as a result. This port from publisher Nightdive Studios not only resurrects this fine shooter, but also improves on it in every way, from graphics to audio to controls and even new (albeit minor) quality-of-life features.\n\nThe game itself holds up very well. It is a first-person shooter originally released in 1998, and was an early adopter of \"realistic\" gore modeling, where you could blow off heads, limbs, and even drill out brains with a nasty little weapon that harkens back to the 80's cult horror film Phantasm. Speaking of weapons, Turok 2 is full of them, from the aforementioned Cerebral Bore, to a bow that shoots explosive arrows, lock-on missile launchers, a Predator-style razor disc that returns when thrown, and even your own little personal room-clearing nuke. You'll be needing them too, as the game can be brutally hard, and enemies tend to be fast and aggressive, although sometimes you'll see enemy NPCs with more defensive scripts such as hiding behind cover.  There are also massive bosses to contend with, and you'll need to throw everything AND the kitchen sink at their hideous faces if you're going to win.\n\nOne aspect of the game that can be seen as either positive, negative, or both is the map design. There are only six levels in Turok 2, and they are MASSIVE. They are also twisting mazes featuring multiple objectives with minimal handholding. Nightdive Studios have added optional UI trackers that help keep tabs on your mission objectives, and you've got an auto-map that fills out as you explore, but you're still going to get lost in this game. It's just inevitable. Finding all the mission objectives and secret areas can be freakishly tough as a result, and use of a walkthrough will almost assuredly be needed to 100% clear this daunting game.\n\nMusic is decent, but gets repetitive. Sound effects are ok. As I mentioned earlier, this game was originally developed for the N64, and they had to squeeze everything on to a cartdrige. Audio took a hit as a result, and voices and sound effects were not on par with CD-based games of the time. That being said, Nightdive has still improved on the mixing, and everything sounds much cleaner and crisper than it did in the original. Still, this would be the weakest aspect of the game (and possibly the dated visuals, but those personally don't bother me, and the game looks better than it ever has with the all the enhancements Nightdive have made).\n\nMy final verdict is: this is an absolute must-buy. Turok 2 rocks, it's one of the great classic FPS games of all time, this port is amazing and can run well on most any rig, and to seal the deal you have the return of one of the greatest bloody multiplayer modes in FPS history. So sit back, relax, and prepare to get wrecked in an uncompromisingly brutal nostalgia trip which will have you hunting all the dinosaurs, aliens, arachnids, and other assorted dimensional trash who dare to pit  themselves against one of the mightiest warriors to ever prowl a circuit board. By the end of this game, you too will be exalting over the bodies of your slain enemies, war-bow in hand as you proudly cry, \"I AM TUROK!\"\n\nTL;DR: 10/10, would Turok again.", "timestamp_created": 1491961250, "timestamp_updated": 1491978540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31079686": {"recommendationid": "31079686", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976086602", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499011985}, "language": "english", "review": "Very poor performance.

Turok was a massive hit and development for its sequel began even before the release of the first game. In 1997, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil was released, and all the gaming magazines and Turok fans praised its all new graphics that were revolutionary for the time, the guns, mechanics, story and pretty much everything. A PC port was also released a few months later but it was widely ignored due to quite a few changes that upset the Turok community such as the infamous soundtrack change. Either way it was a hit. Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion would also be released in later years but anyway back to T2... The talented people at Nightdive Studios decided to remaster Turok 1, and everyone was just begging for the remaster of Turok 2. Nightdive did this and here we are now, with the release of it. \n\nThis remaster introduced new mechanics such as objective markers (which is very useful), choice on which soundtrack you want N64 or PC's, updated textures, all new areas, better lighting, shaders, FOV, and a lot of other much needed additions.\n\nPlaying through singleplayer again in an all new updated style is simply wonderful, and makes way for newcomers to get into it without the need for putting up with the problems the original had. The new areas are a cool addition to the already impressive level design.\n\nAs for multiplayer, this is what really made me start to realize that I may have been too easy on the game. The multiplayer in the original was good, and it required skill and an accurate basis of timing and aiming which was really fascinating. But this multiplayer in the remaster is simply bad. The chatbox is incredibly small and it is nearly impossible to follow a conversation without having to go through the console just to see what someone said. Players in multiplayer move extremely slow which is just unfair and makes for easy targets without almost any skill needed. Some guns are extremely OP and require to have the skills of someone like Neo from the Matrix to dodge, I'm looking at you Nuke weapon. Overall this multiplayer was an extreme disapointment to me and my buddies who wanted something that required skill but was still fun.\n\nThe new addition of Hardcore mode is interesting, I do however wish they could've added something more than just more and tougher enemies. The options menu is extremely full to the brim and can really be tailored to how you want to play. The extras menu just has one thing; the Gallery which is a collection of models, kill counts and what not from your journey in singleplayer, I would've liked to see more from this extras menu which only houses one thing only.\n\nThis is by no means a bad remaster, but its not an incredibly great one either. If you're new to the Turok series or looking to have a better experience from the original PC port, then I would highly reccomend this to you. If you're getting this for the multiplayer, then you will be slightly disappointed. \n\n(Do note at the time of this review multiplayer wasn't as polished as it is now)\n\nI would love to see Nightdive remaster Turok 3, and while I did bash the multiplayer and some things about this remaster hard, I do still love it with all my heart. Keep doing some good Nightdive, and do well on the remaster for System Shock 2! :)\n\nGame is also pretty gore-filled, may haunt your dreams.

The blur added to the character animations really brings the animation quality up a notch, even though it's just a simple touch. The improved lighting and sound also really enhance the experience.

Firstly the level design is fucking AWFUL and nearly impossible to navigate through without getting lost atleast 10 times, and it only gets worse as you progress to the later maps -- This being coupled with the fact that movement is so unbearably slow (especially in contrast to the first game) makes it a very boring, and even frustrating game to play through.\n\nCombat is also extremely unfulfilling as there's so many enemies on the screen half the time, usually in very enclosed spaces, that you sometimes aren't even able to judge whether you've killed them because it's just a clusterfuck of insignificant things with lots of health being thrown at you. This can only really be enjoyable in a more open area where you'd have more room to maneuver or utilize movement in a way that would actually be significant during a fight.\n\nPlatforming is also extremely bad even with the added benefit of being able to grab onto ledges because not only is it such a small part of the game (unlike in the first game, where it was basically everywhere) but when it is involved the experience is either very un-enjoyably simple, or can be summed up entirely by you lagging off a rock into a pit of lava.\n\nThe audio quality is pretty mediocre and forgettable, I found myself not even noticing the fact that there was background music in some areas so aside from menu music and a few sound effects being enjoyable there isn't really much to say about it.\n\nThere's also a few glitches I've noticed.\nHit detection is really bad especially on your initial shot onto almost any object for some reason, about 60% of the time it doesn't register at all and you end up wasting so much ammo because of this in the long run. I also had the earthquake screen effect on my character at one point where it lasted far longer than I can only assume it was supposed to, knocking me off a ledge and forcing me to redo the impossible task of navigating back from my checkpoint.\n\nI also experienced allot of problems with the frame rate as it kept randomly dropping bellow 30 FPS which really shouldn't be happening to a game that has such outdated graphics.\n\nIn its current state, it's a complete waste of money and I'm past the time limit for refunding.", "timestamp_created": 1491081989, "timestamp_updated": 1491087787, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.354862", "comment_count": "23", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30886639": {"recommendationid": "30886639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024677176", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492876771}, "language": "english", "review": "Hell yes, great controls for modern gaming.

As someone who was massively excited for this and kept saying \"Man I wish this was Turok 2\" when playing the Turok 1 remaster, I strongly suggest people avoid buying this for little more than the nostalgia unless they can put up with infuriating level design.\n\nThe level design is some of the worst I've EVER seen. Level 4 notably has moments that are pure bullshit where paths diverge in opposite directions to waste your time. For example, there is a 10 minute maze you navigate upwards only to hit a locked door at the end. To the right of the locked door there is a floating platform you can jump down to, and to open the door you need to hit the switch on said platform. So you do that, and there's no way to get back to where you just were besides navigating the maze again. \n\nThe map is useless, you'd be better off using wet toilet paper to navigate some of these areas. Not to mention it's nearly impossible without the hints turned on because items like keys and switches are hidden in dark corners behind objects. \n\nThe ONE redeeming factor for the game is that the weapons are generally all fantastic. Lots of variety and some are badass. The enemy variety is pretty ok as well.\n\nAlso the music is sometimes completely fucking awful. As Vinny (Vinesauce) put it, level 3 sounds like several trumpets farting into your ears. Sometimes it's great though the levels can be so drawn out even the great music can get tedious to hear on loop.\n\nOn top of the level design being bullshit, the game can be insanely cheap at some points, I'm not sure if it's because AI was adjusted to make up for the fog removal, but countless times I'd round a corner or even start a level and instantly take damage by several enemies shooting me across the room the moment I'm within eyesight. There's also a bridge on level 4 (I'm not sure if this was on the n64 version) that you will fall through if you stand on the left half. Some of these bugs really should have been fixed.\n\nI do NOT suggest buying this unless you're willing to use a guide or just have serious nostalgia, I'd actually say in retrospect having played both remasters that Turok 1 was a superior game.", "timestamp_created": 1490996900, "timestamp_updated": 1490997059, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474867", "comment_count": "62", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30850074": {"recommendationid": "30850074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017783898", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490956133}, "language": "english", "review": "A bit pricy for a remaster but there is nothing to criticize, it's executed perfectly.  \nTotally recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1490954303, "timestamp_updated": 1490954303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592755", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30837861": {"recommendationid": "30837861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046242117", "num_games_owned": 621, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501186720}, "language": "english", "review": "Now bring Turok 3 Shadow Of Oblivion, Turok Rage Wars, Turok Evolution and Turok 2008.", "timestamp_created": 1490896279, "timestamp_updated": 1490896279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708579", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30825900": {"recommendationid": "30825900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048583636", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499059275}, "language": "english", "review": "Favorite game from my childhood and it holds up really well.

I had quite a bit of nostalgia about playing Turok 2 multiplayer with my friends as a kid. I never got far in the single-player campaign until now but I cared more about playing with buddies. \n\nAfter 15 hours spent with this atrocity, I can safely say it washed away wwhatever nostalgia I had for it. Since nowadays playing with strangers online is all the rage (wars), I saw no reason to go multiplayer wiht this remaster, since I don't like online MP. I played up until Hive of the Mantids and ... it's atrocious. Despite the addition of markers on objectives and important items, it's still a confusing mess of hard-to-navigate levels filled with confuzing maze-like corridors and hidden passages. You'd think the ol' \"Follow monsters, find objectives\" technique would be enough but some of the main objectives feel like they should be optional hidden items instead.  It's almost impossible to finish a level in the first run, you're bound to get to the exit missing that one (or two) objective that was so well hidden, there's no way you could find it without a walkthrough.\n\nThe levels are ridiculously confusing and the corridors look the same, there are few details to distinguish maps sections from one another, to a point even a walkthrough barely helps if you're not following it all the way from point A to point B. If at least those old textures looked at least a bit appealing ... but no, there's barely any diversity. Every area in a level will have the same textures, so not only are these mazes confusing but they're also boring to navigate, unless there are monsters to fight.\n\nThe gunplay's pretty much the only thing positive I can find about this game, it might be why I played multiplayer so often. The weapons are all impressive and seriously, who could forget the Cerebral Bore? Killing monsters is a delight, whether with the Mag 60's three-round bursts, a few shotgun blasts or a hail of plasma from the Firestorm Cannon. \n\nSoooo ....

To this point I thought Nightdive was about preserving classic titles by making them more compatible with newer systems, getting them to run better, etc. Nope, they are about being the video gaming equivalent of a small-town cover band. Actually that isn't fair, most of those at least try their best to recreate the original work instead of what happened here.\n\nI guess the problem is, it was largely one guy's idea to start taking creative license where there should be none, and that guy happens to be the author of the engine the studio uses to recreate old 3d games like this.

Nostalgia plays a large role in my recommendation of this game, but there are many reasons to buy it even if you never played the eighteen year old original game.\n\nTurok 2: Seeds of Evil was one of the first narrative driven FPS games ever released. Although more basic in terms of story compared with modern games, it still has a certain charm, worthy of your 8-10 hours to finish the game. The levels are very large, and teeming with secret areas, and alternate paths. Enemy variety is also decent, with each level introducing new ones, and a new environment to which they belong. Weapon diversity is also worth noting, as there are over 20 of them. They sound great, shoot great, and provide many different options for how you can play. New graphical options have been added, and gameplay feels more solid than the original. Make no mistake, this is the best version of Turok 2 currently available. \n\nDespite everything I like about this remaster, it still has issues. The first being the hit registration. Whether this is a flaw with the remaster, or an existing issue with the original game, I\u2019m not sure. But I certainly don\u2019t remember having such a hard time being able to shoot enemies. The hitboxes are very small, and what I assumed would kill them (or at least injure them) actually does very little, if not no damage. For example, I can headshot an enemy with one bullet, or waste 20 bullets before finally bringing them down. I was playing on Hardcore, but none the less this gap is too big. I regularly found myself saving after killing every enemy, as I didn\u2019t know whether I would end up wasting my ammo on the next.\n\nThe next issues are the boss battles. Aside from being some of the best examples of poor hit registration, sometimes the health of the boss would refill if you save during the fight and reload it. Personally I encountered a major glitch during the final boss in which he gets stuck in the ceiling and wouldn\u2019t get hurt. Forcing me to reload a much earlier save before the battle. \n\nTurok 2 is a great game, and Night Dive have definitely made a successful effort with this remaster. If you can play on an easier difficulty, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t have the issues I had, but none the less, be prepared to face them if you choose hardcore mode.   \n", "timestamp_created": 1490510119, "timestamp_updated": 1490510119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575200", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30743508": {"recommendationid": "30743508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075280397", "num_games_owned": 465, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501948395}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing this game as a kid and remembered how much the Oblivion freaked me out.

WHY? Who does that? Its not Turok 2 remastered, its Turok 2 simplified. Its the Turok 2 simplified vision of the devs and that kills the game for me. The game overall feels easier aswell, like the tek bow does a lot more damage then it did in the original or should i say the tek bow always kills with one hit in this game unlike in Turok 2 (original, real turok 2 game) You actually had to shoot at enemy weak spot. Then there is the speed of the character? Its a small thing, but again, why? Whats going on with this remake, remaster or whatever it is or wants to be??? And one more thing that bugged me was when i have N64 music selected and the intro cutscene of \"flesh portal\" plays, it isn t using the n64 music instead it uses the pc versions music.

Music continues to be catchy and driving, and the number of unique weapons give plenty to play with.\n\nSadly, the game's original design still holds it back in a few ways from being truly great. Despite adding waypoints to aid in navigating the maze-like level design in levels that are far too huge to navigate without taking notes, it's easy to get lost in the game. Backtracking is mandatory to start the final level and end the game, and even with the automap, it's hard to navigate because the game uses teleporters frequently that swap the map itself. \nThere are quick-warp points, but they aren't always located in the zone they're placed.\n\nThe game really wants you to get headshots, kind of a bummer when part of the game's appeal is its extremely violent dismemberment and gibbing. Enemies are very bullet spongey, and combined with very limited ammo reserves, you'll find yourself being pushed into using stunning weapons to make scoring headshots so easy that it's very trivial and feels broken.\nWhen you're able to *just shoot'em'up* with power ammo, the game is incredible. There's nothing more satisfying than filling your screen with explosions or watching monsters flee the horrific homing brain drill.\n\nOverall, my recommendation is fuelled by nostalgia for the original. When you don't get lost in the massive levels, this game is an absolute delight.

A long while ago I've watched some footage of the original Turok 2 N64 version and it left me unimpressed. Sure, the weaponry looked interesting but the pitiful draw distance, the small FoV and that it had to be played with the less than optimal N64 controller... it didn't appeal to me (I wasn't aware of the PC port). Thanks to Nightdive Studios, Turok 2 is back and better than ever. But is it enough of an improvement to warrant a buy?\n\nA first look into the options menu will make any PC enthusiast smile. Nightdive Studios provided a boatload of options to tinker with, including many graphical settings found in current-gen games like Ambient Occlusion and several Anti-Aliasing options. Controls can be easily mapped (even to additional mouse buttons), both N64 and PC soundtracks can be chosen to play during the game and several gameplay options like the new hint system and disabling weapon bob are available.\nUnfortunately Turok 2, like the remaster of the first Turok game, is capped at 60FPS due to game speed and physics. Too bad for an otherwise examplary PC port.\n\nTurok 2's presentation still holds up. Graphical fidelity and audio quality have been touched up for this remaster and it shows when comparing it to the obsolete N64 version. The game with all bells and whistles enabled runs smoothly and never dipped from 60FPS. (i7 4770k, GTX 980)\n\nThe game's plot is fairly straight forward: Joshua Fireseed must destroy the Primagen who is hellbent on destroying the multiverse. If you want deep storytelling and exposition heavy dialouge, this ain't your game. Not necessarily an issue as it's one thing less that could get in the way of the gameplay. Joshua is aided by Adon, an AI who tasks him with a variety of mission objectives that differ for each location. How to get to these locations is up to the player to figure out. First and foremost, the game won't hold your hand and in the case of Turok 2 this is both a good and bad thing. The game consists of 6 gargantuan levels, each one harder than the preceeding one. For most of the time, figuring out how to get to certain locations isn't an issue if you're used to oldschool FPS games. Turok 2 however doesn't pull any punches and some of the levels (Hive and Lair) can be really confusing at first. This complex level design, coupled with the huge size of those levels can really drain you and leave you frustrated. Be prepared to do quite a bit of backtracking in this one. I stopped playing for two days once I completed the Hive level, to give you an idea how bad it can be. But for the majority of my playthrough it was smooth sailing and I had a blast traversing through each level even if they overstayed their welcome somewhat.\n\nTurok 2's gunplay is amazing. Your humongous weapon roster ranges from simple bow and arrow to a goddamn nuke and no, that's not an exaggeration. Each weapon stands out on its own and is satisfying to use. Unfortunate enemies who get in your way respond to your arsenal with amazing animations and meaty gore. Most games nowadays, e.g. DOOM 2016 and Shadow Warrior 2 have nice looking gore systems for sure but none of them feel as raw and grisly as Turok 2 does.\nWhile your weapon selection is huge, your ammo pool for each weapon is quite small in contrast. Headshots are key to surviving the onslaught of enemies without running dry. Ammo and health pickups will respawn after some time as a failsafe, but improving your aim is key. Due to this system, even weaker weapons like your normal pistol or bow and arrow will still be viable in the later parts of the game.\n\nMultiplayer is standard arena shooter flare. It's functional aside from some weird graphic bugs (like the sniper rifle's particles looking like a checkerboard) and I didn't experience any issues regarding connection.

Quick Warps, Alt. Weapon Bobbing choices, Icon hints to guide us, controlling the fog, and changing music from N64 to PC anytime. I especially felt that the quick-save and quick-load options is the best part. Simplifies everything.\n\nEverything I see within this Remastered version is all good.\nBut there is one downside I like to note.....PC Music.\nThere are parts of most music tracks we hear only in the N64 version, the PC version lacked. And it was like that in the USA release of Turok 2 for PC back in 1998, but not the Japanese version. Which happens to be called \"Violence Killer: Turok New Generation\".\n\nI found the music album of \"Violence Killer: Turok New Generation\", which plays the FULL tracks of the PC version, including the part of each music you hear only in the N64 version. The Death Marshes would be my biggest example. Listen to the first 1 minute of the 3rd level's music from N64, and you won't hear that on USA's PC; but the japanese version will play that part.\nPerhaps the music can be helped with another update for this Turok 2 Remastered. It's worth helping Night Dive Studios.\n\nMy special thanks to Night Dive Studios for the re-release of Turok 2 as well as Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.

The arsenal of weapons in this game will keep you entertained as well. How good are the guns? Better than borderlands. \n\nI will admit a bias.

[/i]\n\nTurok 2: Seeds of Evil... the original black version of the game is still in my N64 console. Playing this remaster reminds me of my beautiful childhood memories.. When I could barely even finish the first level because I spent hours of playtime running around and finding the objectives; I can exactly remember being in the 2nd level for ages and not getting any further; ..Having my friends coming over and play TDM together with 4 people on 1 console.. I will never forget these goldy times ; )\nBut let's move on! Playing this on the N64 and on PC are two whole different dimensions. While playing something with great graphics like this on the N64 felt already great even though you were having like 15-20fps, playing this with completely refreshed textures on a stable framerate now feels freakin' badass! \nAnd that's what I desired! I played the remaster on Hard, killed all bosses and found all required Items.\n\nThe following Pros & Cons are based on the remaster AND the game itself. This is just my own opinion about the game!\n\n\nPros:\n\n++ Great looking graphics for a 1998 game\n++ Much better port than the original PC port, which was clumsy af and had a really bad hit detection.\n+ Looks beautiful with maxed out settings\n+ Steam Achievements\n+ Adjustable FOV (finally no more tunnel vision..)\n+ You can now save your Progress at any time of the game!\n+ a HUGE weapon arsenal with unique weapons such as the Cerebral Bore ;)\n+ 6 different Levels, each with its own prehistory\n+ Suitable for each player --> Difficulties from Easy up to Hardcore, where the game gets a real surviving challenge!\n+ Intelligent AI for its time: Moving around corners, hiding behind obstracles & objectives, running panicly away when locked on by weapons such as the C.B. :'D . ( and hey! You can even make these dinosaurs fight against each other if done right ;)\n+ You can now see markers on keys and activatables if you're near them, which results in missing less objectives when playing through the game (This can be deactivated in the options though)\n+ Explorers get rewarded! You will often find secret passages or destroyable walls with spicy loot.\n+ Multiplayer feels like the one on the N64, just with the original weapons and more levels\n+ Brings back childhood memories \n++ Hard working developers, who put their heart into this game \u2665\n\n\nCons:\n\n- The game can be pretty confusing if it's your first playthrough. Sometimes you have to run all the way back because you missed a key or a switch to activate.([i]Markers made this much easier now though[/i]) \n(^Some levels can be like a labyrinth, with parts where you have no clue where to go next anymore, resulting in running through the whole level again and looking for missed things.)\n- Sometimes, enemies can die in 1 shot, but can also take way more shots even if u hit the exact same spot\n- Some enemies will respawn after you used a warp portal.\n- You can run out of ammo really fast at the first levels(except you play on easy, where you have doubled magazines<<)\n- The Multiplayer can get really laggy if you're playing with more than 3 people from different regions.\n\n~ (The game is missing the old Multiplayer mod, which was way more competetive and skill reliant than the current one.)\n\n\n\nDespite the cons, I think it's a great and worth game at all.\nPretty much a must-have for any fan of the series. Huge Levels with actual objectives and additional weapons is what the game makes a good addition to the first Turok.\n20 bucks is quite a lot for such an old game, but I think this time the price is justified. (and hey, if this bugs you, you can still wait for upcoming sales :^)\n\nI enjoyed my playthrough and I will do a second one on Hardcore soon. \n\nOi, and If you made it to this point, I really appreciate it that you've read my brief review :) Thank you! \n\n#Bewareoblivionisathand ;)", "timestamp_created": 1490209377, "timestamp_updated": 1493591387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.802270", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30672938": {"recommendationid": "30672938", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995233398", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505751295}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR This is a fantastic port and a loving remaster of one of the best games on the N64.

The graphics have been updated, though they are still lacking by today's standards, of course (I suggest turning off motion blur, as well, this is another game that suffers from it).  Due to having a better engine to run off of, the game itself runs a lot faster.  This means that your slow, crawling \"run\" on the N64 is actually a run here on PC.  Enemies and projectiles move faster.  To those who played Turok 2 before on good ol' N64: welcome back.  To those who are new and curious as to what all the hubbub is about: prepare to have a good bit of fun.  Don't worry if you have to look up a walkthrough to get where you need to go, Turok 2 has a habit of having multiple paths, with the right one not quite being so easy to understand or find.", "timestamp_created": 1490168032, "timestamp_updated": 1490168032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30664607": {"recommendationid": "30664607", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996527115", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492765011}, "language": "english", "review": "Nostalgic First Impression:\nI am crying I'm laughing so hard.

It wasn't what I was used to. It felt like Turok 2, but didn't quite look like Turok 2. I was turned off a bit by the sheer number of visual changes and upgrades.\n\nHowever, it grew on me, pretty quickly. And luckily with most of the enhancements being entirely optional, you can keep on what you want, and the upgrades sometimes do bring out the best that Turok 2's visuals had to offer. \n\nBut what makes this easily worth it is just how easy it is to play now. It was certainly possible to play the original PC port, but it was a hassle to set up, and while most things would work, one or two things would be off. \n\nI applaud them for trying to keep to the original material as much as possible while also adding fresh updates. \n\nI apologize this \"review\" isn't much of a review, but I'm just so happy to see my favorite childhood game revitalized that I had to share it. \n\nThe multiplayer is incredibly fun, however at the moment there are a few issues with the netcoding. I once had a reported ping of over 26000. My internet is okay as far as US internet goes (it's still shit, but it's literally my only option) and I tried any number of firewall toggles and exceptions, port forwarding, anti-virus toggled off, nothing seems to fix it.\n\nBut man, when the multiplayer works, the sheer speed and fun weapon selection makes it the most fun I've had on a multiplayer shooter since my friends and I still played Titanfall. \n\nThe game has certainly aged. There's no disputing that, but it's still a fantastic FPS. You might find its forced exploration off putting, and I can understand that, but the changes with quick saving and the simple fact that this port runs magnitudes better than that N64 port did make it much more bearable, especially for brand new players.\n\nI hope Turok lives on and we get more of the games remastered.

He had a bunch of games that I still remember to this day, like Star Wars Episode One Racer, Goldeneye and many others.\n\nBut none of those games mattered to me as much as Turok 2. The game was insatiable to me. The graphics were crisp, portraying these worlds the game conveyed with such stunning detail. The way parts of enemies would blow off upon firing with the shotgun was tantalizing. The game wowed me so much that I would keep coming back, day after day, just to see it some more.\n\nSomething like 14 years later I have since beaten Turok 2 a few times, and every single time I'm still stunned by the work that went into this game. Especially in comparison to the original. Turok 2's worlds are massive, portraying locations like a large medieval city, industrial locations, a large underground cavern system amidst lava spires, and even abstract locations like floating platforms suspended in space. Your weapons start out fairly mundane: a bow and arrow, a pistol, a shotgun. But eventually become fantastical, like the razor wind; a rotating serrated disk that fires like a boomerang. Or the Cerebral bore, a gun that fires a probe that drills into an enemy's head and detonates.\n\nMore than that Turok 2 is just what I think of when I think of a first person shooter. Its storyline is just... there, something to get you into the action of killing monsters. But it feels like the developers chose to focus on making a really fun and unique balls to the wall action game on the N64. It's an overly ambitious game, and nowadays it feels rare to play a game where you just feel like you're having fun like a kid again.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xKyhMCXcWtA", "timestamp_created": 1490082180, "timestamp_updated": 1490083352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764322", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30647913": {"recommendationid": "30647913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049205324", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513459922}, "language": "english", "review": "Now no longer requires a rumble pack to save your games!", "timestamp_created": 1490081931, "timestamp_updated": 1490081931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509952", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30646414": {"recommendationid": "30646414", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977570111", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491963133}, "language": "english", "review": "I...

I thought they did a great job with Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, and if anything, they've done even better with this port. The menus and overall layout has been brought into a more modern gaming style gracefully, and everything is very easy to navigate.\n\nThe game itself is a classic old FPS; large, sprawling levels with many collectibles and an escalating armory of more and more powerful and unique guns, including the Cerebral Bore, one of the most satisfyingly gory weapons in video game history in my opinion. The difficulty of the game has been severly diminished with the mouse/keyboard control scheme, but the developers added 'Hardcore' mode, which, because of the way they changed the save mechanism, isn't too hardcore. Save often enough and it's really just a harder game mode with more enemies and less ammo and health pickups. It was a nice addition, but doesn't fit the typical 'one-life only' definition of many games.\n\nTurok 2: Seeds of Evil is a great game, and the remastered version is a great way to bring an old FPS into modern gaming without taking away its classic charm.

This is what helped define Turok 2 in my opinion.\n\nIt also has a complete working multiplayer mode if you want to fight against other players to see who's the best Turok out there.  only problem is if some dickhead desides to play as a goddamned raptor, it's all over for you. They seriously need to do something about this because all it takes is a few swipes and you're done.  really fucking easy character to play with.\n\nalso, I just wished the camera view turned sideways when you got killed like in the original game.\n\nI don't know if it's just me but I feel the first game had more of a variety of places to explore and find all the trinkets and keys you need to advance forward to, unlike the first 2 levels in T2 seem the same in almost every hallway you find in, which does make the game seem boring.  but whats not a problem is there are mission objectives to complete before you can exit the level and defend the energy totem pole from waves of enemies coming to destroy it.\n\nthe only other problem I run into are the ammunition and sometimes the enemies move their heads around alot when they run around or whatever so that brings another challenge if you happen to be a headshot honcho.\n\nOther than that, Turok 2: Seeds of evil has 2 things in store for you:  Nostalgia, and lots of death for you to deal.\n\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n*Badass weaponry\n\n*blood and gore\n\n*enemies and later levels will prove a challenge for you\n\n*Multiplayer is included.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n*Ammunition is pretty scarce, so make sure you hit what you're trying to kill or else you just wasted ammo.\n\n*sometimes you can easily get lost in the levels, so try your best to remember the routes and whatnot, even though \nthere's pointers now unlike the original game, so be fucking thankful for that.\n\n*playing as a rapter in mutliplayer is competely broken.....seriously?\n\n[h1]???[/h1]\n*..........so now when is Turok:Rage Wars coming out??   it's basically Quake/unreal tournament set in the Turok universe.\n\n\nEven though the nostalgia is probably the only purpose for this re-release, but at the same time the game now caters to veteran and newcomers to the classic turok series....unlike the cancerous 2008 reboot.  If you want, go check out Turok: Dinosaur hunter to see where it all started, and that's another good game brought from the n64 days.\n\n[h1]I'll give this thing an 8/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1489989714, "timestamp_updated": 1490417870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30629580": {"recommendationid": "30629580", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962750090", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489983962}, "language": "english", "review": "A true fucking odyssey.\n\nPorted from the N64.", "timestamp_created": 1489984642, "timestamp_updated": 1489984642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496095", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30627901": {"recommendationid": "30627901", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970580654", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490087921}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well done remaster!

On that note, it ALL works beautifully. If you enjoyed the original, you'll love this. Works great with a Xbone controller on day one. Audio, visuals, everything translates and works great. No issues on Windows 8.1 thus far. \n\nOn to the game. If you are new to Turok, since the first one just hit steam awhile ago, this is more of the same, just much better. Seeds of Evil totally kicks it up a couple notches, and to me, is THE Turok title of the 3 that graced the N64. It's a great 90's shooter with some puzzle elements, way more blood than needed with enemies who dramatically die and bleed everywhere, a rainbow of weapons to deal death with and some aboslutely awful 90's voice acting (B movie goodness awful to be clear ;). To me this is a great 'classic'. It even has the old Goldeneye style multiplayer.

I am a casual gamer and as such with tunnels and mazes I get turned around easily, but this game has all kinds of helpful hints to help me find my way. Yes sure you can turn those off, but then I would most likely get confused, frusterated and never play the game again. This game caters to both kinds of gamers, hardcore and casual players alike. The keyboard/mouse controls work flawlessly for me, but so does the controller too, but I'm not good with FPS and a controller to be honest, feels wrong to me. But the fact both work so well is a huge pluss to me. And although the graphics and textures feel very dated to me, the lighting, wow they did a fine job of just being able so see everything clearly, so its sort of a classic take graphically but still looks good. Sorry, its a hard one to explain. The game itself is very well put together, good levels with a nice variety, very quick and smooth game play. Although there are tons of graphics settings in game, I feel they could pretty much max it out and it still would run fine on a potatoe. Also default settings are quite low, so first thing you'll need to do is go into the settings and turn everything way up. Sadly though its capped at 60fps, its definitely an improvement from yesteryear, but it would have been nice to sync with my display, the game itself sees my higher refresh but just doesnt give me anything more.

I care way too much about this and the review turned out a bit longer than what I considered reasonable, so here's the TL;DR:\n\n[h1]The gist of it[/h1]\nIt's a very good game, but very much of its time. It was designed for a console and some of the elements don't quite translate so well to PC, but it's not a deal breaker. The remaster itself is competent, but there are a couple of issues that hardcore fans as well as the general public should consider before purchasing. More on that below.\n\n[h1]First of all[/h1]\nIt's Turok 2. By far the most popular game in the series, and with good reason, seeing as it has:\n[list]\n[*]Impressive weapon variety, complemented by the combat and encounter designs;\n[*]Well designed enemies that are fun to fight, especially on later levels;\n[*]Satisfying sound design, enhancing the general experience further.\n[/list]\nThe combat design is something I want to take a minute to break down. Ammunition, while not exactly scarce, isn't often readily available due to the strict carrying limitations, but some of the more basic weapons are exempt from these constraints: the Pistol gets 50 shots (a couple of which can take down most enemies if you know where to shoot) and the Bow shoots reusable projectiles. This encourages you to use these specific weapons on throwaway enemies and basic encounters while saving up the good stuff for hairier emergency situations, like when you're severely outnumbered or low on health.\n\nThere's a weird diffuculty curve to the game because of this. At around Level 4, getting headshots with your peashooter or waiting for the bow to draw back so you can shoot stops being the practical choice, but by then you've amassed a respectable amount of high powered weaponry that you can afford to rotate between them while shooting everything that moves, without worrying too much about ammunition. It's a nice shift in dynamics that changes the game without breaking it.\n\n[h1]The Remaster[/h1]\nIt's Turok 2, but not JUST Turok 2. Night Dive's name is in here for a reason.\n\nPurists will like to know that you can disable pretty much all of the bells and whistles introduced in the remaster. I turned off a few of those myself, and between all of the options I'm sure everyone will be able to find a middle ground between old and new that caters to whatever they personally might want out of an HD remaster.\n\nWhat is less ignorable, however, are the changes in level design, which if the credits are to be believed are the work of Mr. Kaiser, Samuel Villarreal himself.\n\nI have mixed feelings about these. On one hand they do improve the flow of the levels quite a bit, and some of the changes were inevitable, at least if the team wanted to keep other features like improved player speed and maneuverability. And personally, I found it interesting to go through all of the levels, taking note of what was different and what wasn't.\n\nOn the other hand, however, this could be seen as fixing what wasn't broken and tainting the integrity of the original designs. As you can imagine, beating this game is a pretty big milestone for me, but the feeling of accomplishment is diminished somewhat by the knowledge that this isn't *exactly* what I struggled against when playing through the originals.\n\n[h1]Nothing is perfect[/h1]\nFinally, let's end this with some of the less-than-stellar aspects of both the game and remaster:\n[list]\n[*]Expect performance issues. As of the time of writing, the game suffers from framerate dips and (reportedly) crashes, though only the former has occurred to me personally during my time with it;\n[*]The levels are confusing and obtuse to the point of absurdity. If you have never played this game, expect getting lost and backtracking to find missing collectibles or objectives. Night Dive's changes really help in this respect;\n[*]Audio was a bit wonky. The mixing is all over the place and the SFX slider controls a few of the sounds you'd expect to be under the jurisdiction of the Voice slider;\n[*]The game was designed for the N64, and it shows. Mouse and Keyboard controls kill a lot of the challenge early on, so I'd recommend turning up the difficulty to Hard, even on a first playthrough.\n[/list]\nAnd that's about it. This game has been a personal favourite of mine for as long as I can remember, and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to play it again, warts and all.

The first two were among my most played titles on the console (though not much of 2 stayed in my memory) but after all these years Turok 2 is definitely the lesser of the two titles, easily.\n\nFirstly, I'll get to the good stuff: Nightdive has done a wonderful job with this port, you can tweak tons of settings and you get some added bells and whistles to make the game really shine from it's original release. Multiplayer is intact if you want to live out some old school, deathmatch fun. Darren Mitchell's soundtrack still sounds wonderful and suits the game perfectly. I also haven't experienced any issues with bugs and the game ran perfectly day-one for me, anyway.\n\nNow is for the nitty gritty, and I'm gonna be harsh about this but: the game has aged like milk. Firstly Turok 1 locked down an aesthetic that went unmatched at the time and it was unique, and still really is. In the mid 90s no game pulled off outdoor environments well but Turok went the extra mile and set most of its' levels in nature with curved edges, wavy walls and slopes that were rounded. Sure, the levels didn't make any shapes that would ever appear in nature but it worked well. Turok 2's environments are mostly jagged and rough, the first two levels take place in vaguely Roman cities which are devoid of life and filled with strange invisible walls and small ledges that Turok has trouble walking over. There's a lack of detail or anything of interest in the levels and they just look boring; everything is super blocky and just looks bad.\n\nThe level design also brings down the gameplay and this, I think is it's biggest fault of the whole game, level's are large. Really, really large. They're so large that the first level is easily going to take you over an hour unless you've played the game before, the same goes for the second level as well. Turok 2 opted to go for less levels, (6 instead of Turok 1s 8) but make them bigger and more sprawling. There's also a lot of backtracking, within levels and in between levels (thanks to upgrades that Turok can attain to explore levels further) so this means that you'll have to revisit each level at least once to collect everything in it if you care to. After playing a single level for X amount of time and it being empty because you've killed everything, exploring and retreading everything becomes boring fast. The levels are completely arduous and the worst offenders of this are the first two levels. The levels are also littered with unlabelled switches that open doors but there's no telling what switch interacts with what door/wall/fence, it's just bad design. Portals are also abundant which break the levels into chunks and you'll soon forget what portal takes you where. This also really kills the pacing of the game having to slog back and forth just trying to figure out where to go.\n\nWeapons are always the highlight of Turok and 2 shines here and it's most famous weapon (Cerebral Bore) was created for 2 and it still kicks ass. The Razorwind is also fantastic. Not everything is that great though, and you won't find the more interesting ones until the latter half of the game.\n\nEnemies are somewhat hit or miss, Dinosaurs aren't the name of the game anymore (the raptors look terrible and they prance around, it looks goofy) and you'll be fighting humanoid reptiles/dinos, mantid aliens and space demons that look like they were ripped right out of early Unreal titles, really uninspired and they share the same body shapes as Popeye.\n\nOverall Turok 2 is a bloated, uninteresting mess compared to it's more precise, streamlined older brother Turok 1.

I'm looking mostly at 30-ish FPS with no settings having a massive impact.  After turning off Ambient Occlusion and VSync, multiplayer was at a solid 62 FPS, but singleplayer can't hold 60 without dropping the resolution scale to pitiful levels, and even then, it drops occasionally.  Thankfully, I'm the odd one out here and many others are talking about how well it generally runs, so I'll shut up about this for now.  Hopefully a few early patches get things sorted out.\n\nOne Disclaimer before moving on, I didn't pay full price for this.  It was $5 off for launch week and another 25% off for owning Turok 1 HD, so in the end, it put me back $11.24.  Thanks, Night Dive!\n~~\nTurok 2 is generally held in high regard, despite the fact that many people will recognize the name without having ever played it themselves.  \"Oh yeah, it was that awesome N64 game with the dinosaurs... WAIT, IT WAS A KEY COLLECTING GAME?  WHY DOES IT RUN SO BADLY?\"  Turok just kind of sits in this odd place after nostalgia ran its course, like System Shock and Thief it influenced so much yet is recognized by so few.  Thankfully, Night Dive set out to fix that, and did so with... almost... flying colors, considering a few issues I've run into.\n\nThe game as a whole mixes keyfinding from the first game with a Goldeneye style objective system that progressively adds more on with harder difficulties.  It's also a game where you have to watch your surroundings, as even the first room can stump you if you don't watch for a lever, a tunnel, a secret, an explosive barrel, SOMETHING that'll open up new opportunities.  Generous hitboxes, revamped climbing, and complex level design make platforming just as important as shooting, and you're expected to fully explore each level to the best of your ability to win in the end.\n\nUnlike Turok 1, this game actually has a bit of a story going for it, complete with in-engine cutscenes and objectives that match the current plot.  Combined with the vastly improved visuals (compared to 1), the overall animation quality, the new aesthetic of each stage, and the general feeling of the maps, every aspect of Turok 2 feels like a huge step up from the previous game and retains all the things that made it special while also tweaking the formula in a few new ways.  This may be only a first impression, but overall from the general sound of it, what I've played so far is the WEAKER part of the game and only getting better from here on out.\n\nSo, really, all I can say is \"go for it.\"  $15 is a pretty good price for a classic shooter entirely revamped, now in proper 1080p60 with a crapload of visual effects thrown on top.  There are some minor aesthetic changes I'm not a fan of, but overall it's still the same Turok that pushed N64 Expansion Paks by the crapload and made your friend with the Playstation 1 insanely jealous.\n\nI wish I had the same glowing remarks for multiplayer, but so far it hasn't been a great time.  The game modes itself are intact and it feels great, you can even bring local players online, but the few servers that were up had extremely high pings with a terrible amount of delay and rubberbanding to everything.  Keep it sub-100 ping or you're in for a true garbage fire... or just play Local/LAN, which is 100% intact and leaves me with very little to complain about.\n\nSo... yeah.  It's still Turok 2.  You'll have a blast with this game if you're even slightly familiar with either late 90s FPS's or Crash Bandicoot-esque platformers, but keep in mind that you'll need to get a 6 GB Expansion Pak for your Keyboard if you want to play in 4K.", "timestamp_created": 1489797025, "timestamp_updated": 1489797025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542218", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30580163": {"recommendationid": "30580163", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994372073", "num_games_owned": 594, "num_reviews": 336, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489790172}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A polished relic[/h1]\n\nNightdive delivers another flawless remaster of a classic game, offering the world one last glimpse at fps design from over a decade ago. Those who fondly remember Turok 2 will be pleasantly surprised to re-experience this old school titan. Turok has been set free from the drawdistance masking fog, and experiences no hiccups no matter how hectic the onslaught of alien mayhem becomes. Compared to the N64 controller, mouse/keyboard handles like a dream. If you know what you're getting into, absolutely pick this up. \n\nOn the other hand, if you have never played Turok 2 then heed this warning. It is almost NOTHING like the original. \n\nTurok 2 is a convoluted labyrinth that wraps in on itself, confounding anyone not intimiately familiar with the game. The original developers at Iguana employed every cheap trick in obscuring your destination and hiding the items you need to finish the game. Unless you've beaten this game before, you will not be able to clear this game without at least a litle guidance.\n\nLocked doors will stifle your progress, forcing you to find the key or switch sometimes hidden in complete pitch darkness. Brilliantly, Nightdive implemented quest markers, outlining many interactable objects. The abundance of hint nodes may seem annoying at first--but it becomes absolutely compulsory in the latter half of the game. Just look at one example, how nearly invisible this switch is.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885553783\n\nThe nodes won't save you every time though. Just look at this perfectly ordinary wall\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885004076\n\nYou can't even see the climbable pegs unless you stand immediately next to it\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885004216\n\nHow about this ordinary looking destructable wall? \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885556949\n\nThose images aren't optional little Easter egg secrets. They obscure fundamental items you NEED to clear the game. Those three instances are just the tip of the iceberg, you'll run into issues like that constantly. \n\nThe difficulty is one last problem I have with the game. Normal mode is far too easy and you can't switch to harder difficulties midgame. Other than instant kill pits, you won't die even once. Even when you do kick the bucket, the game showers you with extra lives. If they didn't cap at nine I would no doubt have had over 20. \n\nFinally I'd like to also mention that the musical score here is underwhelming, especially compared to the legendary soundtrack in the original. I recommend turning the music here to zero and loading up the OST of the original game on YouTube, running it in the background while you slay and explore. \n\nTurok 2 lasted me about 14 hours, double the time I spent in the prequel--not because there's more content here but because most of my time was spent in frustrated backtracking. This game certainly isn't for newcomers.\n\nDespite how heavily I harped on this game's flaws and it's penchant for obfuscation, I'm still giving this game a recommendation. I can fire a flying homing drill that latches onto a dinosaurs head, blood spewing from his skull like a fountain. He shrieks, collapses on the ground, wretches blood, vomits, and dies. The violence in this game is brutal and oh so satisfying. It loses out on its original theme of dinosaurs but adds to it a plethora of targets for you to shred to pieces in wholesome, oldschool carnage. \n\nIf you ever get frustrated at how much a contemporary video game holds your hand, just load up Turok 2.", "timestamp_created": 1489796950, "timestamp_updated": 1490485218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740147", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30579779": {"recommendationid": "30579779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007024712", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489795377}, "language": "english", "review": "Not Applicable", "timestamp_created": 1489795419, "timestamp_updated": 1511366715, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.377701", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30579723": {"recommendationid": "30579723", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981159744", "num_games_owned": 529, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489689527}, "language": "english", "review": "LMAO\nBought the game on release day.

The controls are much better than the 1998 N64 and 1999 PC port, and the blood has been ramped up. The levels were redone to adjust for the flow and controls, and the vault manuver makes platforming more forgiving. The added quest markers are helpful to keep players on track (and can be turned off in the menu if you don't want them), as well as the tabs that update you when you complete a part of an objective.\nThere are flaws of course, but for the sake of this review i'll say that these flaws are subject to change as time goes on.\nFor starters: Some weapons are a bit hit or miss, with enemies taking varying damage in certain spots, or in some cases, hitting the same spot. Ammo can be in short supply if you don't know where the respawn points are, and it can be a bit easy to get lost in the levels.\nIf your a fan of the original game, or a fan of the Turok series, i'd recommend this.\nIf your new to the series, this and Turok 1 Remastered are the best games to start with.", "timestamp_created": 1489783664, "timestamp_updated": 1489783664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30576100": {"recommendationid": "30576100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036904388", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506721166}, "language": "polish", "review": "Zremasterowany Turok 2 , fajnie powr\u00f3ci\u0107 do starych czas\u00f3w , gra si\u0119 fajnie i przyjemnie , nawet multi jest xD .", "timestamp_created": 1489781685, "timestamp_updated": 1489781685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30575487": {"recommendationid": "30575487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115859278", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490324540}, "language": "english", "review": "Having only played the N64 version back in the day, this feels like a completely new game.

The levels are still as huge as ever, surpassing the test of time in which you will still find yourself lost from time to time (which may seem like a bad thing at first, until you realize there's a quick-travel[warp] system in the game, as well as a conventional map), which is a huge break from the tightly scripted corridor shooters of the modern era.  Even Doom 2016, a game I vastly enjoyed, fails to truly recall the depth of exploration and roaming of 90's era FPS's, while in Turok 2 it remains still perfectly encapsulated.  You'll find out just how much you missed discovering where to go on your own.\n\nThe gameplay is polished to a fine sheen as the hit boxes and aiming is precise as ever, with some nice little effects sprinkled ontop.  The feedback from hitting and killing enemies is as good as it gets, where they shriek from being winged in the shoulder, grabbing their arm briefly, to snarling and crumpling to the ground after a well-placed headshot.  The spectacularly gorey deaths aren't just icing either, but rather lends itself to the over-the-top sci-fi prehistoric fantasy setting of the game, where you have a Native American cross-dimensional guardian weilding triple-rocket launchers fighting genetically modified dinosaur soldiers with wrist blasters that can turn invisible.  Yea, it's as crazy as it sounds, and even more enjoyable.\n\nThe story is much more developed than Turok 1, where you're given actual cutscenes and introductions before each level giving you a basic rundown on the enemies you'll be facing and some lore, along with your objectives.  With your objectives, you'll need to find keys to unlock the final boss, parts of the nuke weapon, and feathers to upgrade your character, giving you a reason to revisit previous levels so you can access areas you couldn't before.\n\nTurok 2 is still the benchmark for what a sequel should be in every sense of the word in the FPS genre.  It doubled the weapon count, has levels 2 to 3 times as big as the previous games, has unique enemies for each world, easily tripling the enemy count from Turok 1, boasts a very impressively orchestrated soundtrack, has an expanded story, and ontop of it all has a multiplayer mode.  One wonders how they even managed to fit it all on an N64 cartridge to begin with.\n\nI can't even begin to go into all the features they added, such as bloom, screenspace ambient occlusion, deferred lighting, extended draw distance, alternate weapon bobbing, FOV slider, both PC and N64 soundtracks, and the list goes on.

It now runs perfectly.\n\nI'm not familiar enough with the N64 version, or the original PC version, to be able to give a blow-by-blow comparison of this and the original, but I do recall that this was the best of the N64 Turok games, and one that I waited for eagerly when I saw it was being re-released. \n\nIt's fun, but it really shows its age. The enormous, labyrinthine levels that were once its greatest strength are among its biggest problems now; there are only 7 or 8 levels in the entire game, but they are long as shit. \"Why is that a problem?\" you may be wondering. Well, it's primarily a problem because fewer than a dozen objectives are scattered across these gigantic stages that take 2 or 3 hours to complete. So if you happen to miss a prisoner or child or distress beacon, good freaking luck backtracking through these enormous stages to find one small alcove that you accidentally missed initially. \n\nThere are, of course, changes to the UI meant to make this less likely to happen: objectives show up on the UI with a clear symbol, but so do switches and a lot of destructible objects. In more complex areas where four switches have to be pulled to open the passage to a new area, it's particularly not helpful. This highlights another problem: the stages are enormous, but, just as with Hyrule Field in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess, they're big for the sake of being big, with arbitrary and tedious switches hidden behind walls that have to be opened one by one until the way forward is finally opened. Flip a switch, it opens a wall with another switch behind it. Flip that switch, it opens a different wall with another switch behind it. Flip that switch, it opens another wall with another switch behind it. Flip that switch, and the way forward is finally open.\n\nThis happens repeatedly throughout each of the tediously long stages. The first stage, for example, has a mere 7 objectives, but my entire playtime so far has been spent in that level, with about fifteen minutes coming from level 3. I've beaten level 1 a number of times on the N64 version, but still missed two children this time around, so I had some idea of what I was doing, and the stage still took about 2 hours. \n\nTake Goldeneye's opening Dam level, for example. Counting each individual alarm, there are 8 objectives that must be completed. The stage is 5 minutes long for a reasonably decent new player. That's very high density, and it means the player is nearly always making small steps toward progress. Contrasted to the 2 hour opening stage of Turok 2, where one objective is accomplished for every 15~ minutes of gameplay. This means most of your time is spent running around and shooting enemies. That's good, because it's fun to shoot things, and Turok 2's biggest strength is the variety of weapons and their destructive capabilities, but it doesn't fix what is fundamentally a sparse and uninteresting game. \n\nTurok: Dinosaur Hunter--incidentally, the first N64 game I ever owned--was sparse, too, but it didn't have objectives. Levels had clear, simple goals: get from A to B, and kill shit along the way. Exploring side paths was about finding goodies, not achieving mission objectives. Turok 2 attempts to merge some of the objective-based mission play of Goldeneye with the linear \"Kill shit and find the exit\" that Turok had borrowed from PC shooters, but it misses the mark because it results in so goddamned much backtracking through extremely long stages. You're not looking for a hidden alcove to get a new weapon that is optional, and moving forward if you get bored trying to find it. You're looking for a required mission objective that could be literally *anywhere* throughout the entire stage. The only clue you'll have is that objectives are rarely clustered together, so you can be reasonably sure that, if you just rescued a prisoner, you've got a few minutes' trek radius in each direction where there won't be another one. \n\nI've not tried the multiplayer. I can't imagine that the multiplayer in this game is as much fun as it used to be. Last Xmas, my family revisited Goldeneye, which my father, my uncle, my cousin, and I spent hundreds of hours playing against each other when we were all younger. It was definitely one of those things best left to memory, instead of digging it up and seeing its flaws in a brand new light. Again, without having tried it, I'm sure it suffers the same problems.\n\nI like Turok 2, and I'd certainly recommend it for people who played it when they were younger and want to revisit it. It's worth it, at least at the discounted $15 price. I'm not sure I'd be willing to put $20 on it. More needed to be done to modernize the gameplay, though. Shortly after entering the Death Marshes, I realized that I should have found some sort of armor to permanently increase my max health, or gained a few levels to increase my weapon damage, or anything along those lines, because that's what we expect from modern games. There's none of that here, and that's where its age really shows: the gameplay is incredibly archaic, and it happens across levels that are at least ten times longer than they should be.\n\nI've also gotten inexplicably stuck on walls in a few places, so there are some glitches and bugs that need to be worked out. No, I'm not going to report them, because I'm a paying customer, not a beta tester. Having to redo fifteen or twenty minutes of gameplay because you got stuck on a wall is annoying, and is literally the reason I'm writing this review instead of playing the freaking game. \n\nI like it. If you liked it back then, then chances are that you'll like it now. \n\nThe music is better than I remember it being, too.", "timestamp_created": 1489766518, "timestamp_updated": 1490217651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30571140": {"recommendationid": "30571140", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969672503", "num_games_owned": 444, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493481451}, "language": "german", "review": "Masterpiece nuff said !", "timestamp_created": 1489765959, "timestamp_updated": 1489765959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30570818": {"recommendationid": "30570818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078208116", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508110115}, "language": "english", "review": "What began as pure nostalgia  gave way to a Very Strange but Familiar feeling I have not expierienced in years.

Passiert ist das vor allem in den ersten zwei Leveln (1/3), danach nicht mehr wirklich. Zur Sicherheit sollte man also oft Speichern.\n\n- Die Performance war f\u00fcr mich eher bescheiden. GTX 780 TI, i7-4790k @4GHZ, 16 GB RAM, Aufl\u00f6sung 2560x1600. Mit allen Einstellungen auf Maximum l\u00e4uft das Spiel in Outdoor-Szenen nicht \u00fcber 40 FPS, was sich leider sehr stark bemerkbar macht. Mit SSAO auf \"half resolution\" Einstellung l\u00e4uft das Spiel beinahe durchgehend fl\u00fcssig, mit seltenen Framerate-Einbr\u00fcchen, aber nie \u00fcber ~63 FPS (ohne VSYNC). Da besteht definitiv noch Optimierungsbedarf, gerade weil die High-End SSAO-Variante doch richtig gut aussieht.\n\n- Die Gegner-KI ist mMn deutlich zu aggressiv und intelligent. Man wird beim betreten eines gro\u00dfen Raums oft schon von Gegnern weit auf der anderen Seite angegriffen, auch wenn man sie selber noch nichtmal sehen kann. Damit wurde vmtl versucht die gr\u00f6\u00dfere Sichtweite zu kontern, funktioniert aber meiner Ansicht nach nicht so wirklich, da damit die meiste Taktik wegf\u00e4llt, und Waffen wie Tek-Bow und Assalt-Rifle an Wert verlieren (man kann nicht mehr wirklich Snipern, da Gegner sp\u00e4testens nach einem Hit direkt auf Turok zu feuern beginnen). Tats\u00e4chlich ist die KI nun \"intelligenter\", aber das geht f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack schon in den Bereich cheaten - vor allem da ich des \u00f6fteren durch W\u00e4nde etc... beschossen wurde, das bringt mich zum n\u00e4chsten Punkt:\n\n- Das Spiel hat noch diverse Fehler, die im Original nicht enthalten waren. Gegner k\u00f6nnen z.B. durch bestimmte W\u00e4nde zielen, und teilweise auch treffen. An einer Stelle bin ich durch die Wasseroberfl\u00e4che gebuggt. In den Luftsch\u00e4chten des letzten Levels kommt man aus dem Luftstrom, wenn man die W\u00e4nde ber\u00fchrt etc... \nDie meisten sind nicht sehr tragisch, jedoch hatte ich beim Endkampf einen Fehler, bei dem der Boss an einer Kante stecken blieb - daraufhin musste ich mich t\u00f6ten und den Kampf von neuem beginnen. \n\n- Da es ja jetzt einen Counter f\u00fcr Secrets und ein entsprechendes Achievement gibt, w\u00e4re es gut diese nach Abschluss der Kampange beenden zu k\u00f6nnen. Leider wird man nach Abgabe des letzten Schl\u00fcssels direkt in den Endkampf geworfen, und nach dem Sieg wieder auf den Titelbildschirm - ergo k\u00f6nnte man sich im schlimmsten Fall alle Saves im Endkampf vertun, und m\u00fcsste nochmal neu beginnen; in jedem Fall kann es leicht sein dass man progress verliert, wenn man nicht vor der Schl\u00fcsselabgabe speichert. Da w\u00e4re denke ich eine L\u00f6sung angebracht.\n\n- (wirklich kleiner Kritikpunkt): Die Galerie ist nett, aber ungut zu bedienen, da du nur nach link/rechts scrollen kannst. Da w\u00e4re irgendeine Liste oder so ganz gut, gerade weil links eh bis auf den Punkt \"Galerie\" alles frei ist.\n\nAbgesehen davon aber echt top - die Men\u00fc-\u00dcberarbeitung, das Teleport-System, die Hinweis-Marker, die \u00fcberarbeitete Grafik - hat echt Spa\u00df gemacht eines meiner Lieblingsspiele nochmal aufgeh\u00fcscht durchzuzocken.

What is this sorcery! It's awesome!\n+ DRAW DISTANCE! DRAW DISTANCE!\n\n+ Related to the above (draw distance increase), some parts of maps where enemies used to NOT see you (and you not seeing them) because of the Fog in the original will now shoot at you if you happen to be within range. It actually changes the dynamic of the game a little bit and it's great. There's a couple of places where more enemies than \"normal\" will shoot at you (especially guard Dinosoids from fixed posts at a distance) because they can now see you, but of course you can see them too. So it's a shooting craze in those map sections.\n\n+ You can actually choose between the N64 or the PC versions of the Soundtrack, I think I had a tear in my eye when I saw that.\n\n+ I THINK that there's some (very few) places where one or two enemies have been ADDED compared to the original. I'm playing my first game on Hard right now... it may be why. I might also be wrong... but I'm 100% confident that I've seen at least two locations in the first map (which I've completed by the time I write this review) where there was at least one extra enemy that just didn't exist there in the original. The best example I can give is right at the VERY beginning of the first map (Port of Adia). There's a dinosoid spawning at the port right after the initial explosion occurs as you walk to the right. I remember clearly that in the original game there were NO enemies there at all (unless there WAS one but I just don't remember if I actually beat the game back then on Hard, or not... it might be because of the difficulty setting, but that would surprise me). Anyway, the gist is that if they indeed ADDED some enemies here and there based on difficulty setting then that's AMAZING. More enemies means more things to shoot at, that's always a plus in my book!\n\n+ What can I say more?

The original had some flaws that made the game pretty unplayable, all of that has been fixed in the remaster.

Which is fantastic to see on a game that was made 2 decades ago.\n\nIf you played the original game and want to know if this game is worth the nostalgia, it is 100%. The remaster fixed all the bad things about the old game like horrible controls, hard to find objectives (which now have icons, this was an awesome idea), fog, and lack of saves. You can quicksave and even fast travel around the map using those checkpoints. It is well worth the 20 bucks. I would of paid 60 if I could play a demo and see how great it is beforehand.\n\nIf you never played this game before, I still recommend it. It was a very underappreciated game at the time it was released and deserves the respect it has given with this remaster. The game has a bunch of badass weapons, all unique in some way, from a Shredder that shoots lead like a shotgun that bounces off walls, to a Cerebral Bore that drills a hole into the victims head and explodes, the weapons are probably the coolest part of the game IMHO. The levels are all unique and have a different set of cool enemies to fight.

Take note, other developers out there: THIS is how you do justice to a classic game that so desperately needed a modern revival!\n\nPlaying this beast of a game on a steady 60 FPS (even during that Styracosaurus part which used to give me headaches as a kid because of the tremendously low FPS) alone is enough to warrant me buying this game the minute it went Gold, but man...the options menu in this game is truly remarkable. Night Dive Studios spared no expense bringing this game back from the proverbial dead, that's for sure!\n\nIf you played this game back in the olden days (either version) and you're a bit on the fence about buying this remaster because you have any doubts of how well it performs...lemme tell you right now...you look that fence square in its beady little eyes, give it the finger, and tell it to go fornicate itself, and then promptly buy this game. If you own the original Turok: Dinosaur Hunter on Steam, you will get a 25% coupon for this game (the game is on sale right now anyway, at $14.99...when I went to buy the game, the total went from $19.99 to $11.24, and well worth EVERY hard-earned penny of me money!).\n\nGone are the headache-inducing overly foggy skies and terribad draw distances, and here are the days of crystal clear, late-90's textures and, oh, did I mention the 60 FPS? I did? Great...but, for real brahs and brahettes...freakin' 60 FPS.\n\nBottom line...buy this remaster, especially if you are in any way familiar with this title. Well worth the asking price! Considering the original Turok was $20 (and still is, I believe), I was fully expecting this game to be more than that, but nope! Night Dive comes through again!\n\nNow, there are a couple minor niggling drawbacks that I can think of, in terms of glitches/bugs, but these will more than likely be patched very soon, given NDS' track record with remasters such as this: For example, In the Death Marshes (Level 3), if you reenter an Armory after blowing it up (regardless of how long you wait, it seems), you will instantly be killed by the exploding boxes around the warp...guess the things are self-aware and don't blow up unless Joshua himself sees them explode!\n\nAnd honestly, at least up until now, I haven't run across any other glitches!

Thank you Night Dive. There was a point in my life when my N64 died and Disney (really?!) bought the rights to Turok and I thought i'd never play my two favorite games again. That i'd be scouring Ebay as an old curmudgeon looking for halfworking black cartridges of Turok 2. And then Night dive remasters Turok 1..... and what a remaster. Now we have have Turok 2: Seeds of Evil. An abosulte fantastic follow up to T1 that builds on everything that T1 did right. Big weapons, great graphics, and dripping with atmosphere. My memories of this game are always hampered by the fact that the N64 ran this game at like 15 fps. But now that Night Dive has done a Premium remaster on my all time favorite game my GTX 980 powered pc finally play this game the way it was meant to be. \n\nWill Night Dive remaster Turok 3? Rage wars? Evolution (ewww). In my opinion the franchise ended after T2. I believe after this game Acclaim bought out Iguana entertainment and most of the staff left after that. Turok 3 never felt like Turok to me. They did away with the portal and key system that allowed you to unlock the world zelda style and gone were the over the top guns and fantastic Lost Land setting. Would I buy a T3 remaster? Oh yeah...lol.. but i'm also a huge Turok fan. Evolution killed the series and  the 08 reboot wasn't terrible but it wasn't Turok. Turok 1 and 2 for the N64 were the true Turok's...all others that came after lost their way (and mostly likey the talent that worked on T1 and 2).

I have to say that from the day Turok 1 was remastered, I was eagerly awaiting (and hoping) for Turok 2 to come out! I wanted to get a good idea of what to say in a review, so I made sure to complete the first level all the way through before posting. I forgot how long these levels are!\n\nI've heard some people complain about the convoluded, directionless levels presented in Turok, but I've always found that to be a staple in the series. There are way too many games that make levels by drawing a line, bending it a little, and telling you to walk down it. This game is about exploration and finding what you need to continue onward. Of course, if you don't like exploring levels, Nightdive Studios added a hints feature that's on by default which shows you objects of interest even through walls. I had to turn that off since I prefer the vanilla experience. They also added an edge climbing mechanic to make jumps easier if you just barely miss. I don't think you can turn that off.\n\nThis is the same old Turok 2 with updated graphics. It's not going to look anything near what today's graphics usually look like, but it's much prettier than revving up the old N64. I'm still impressed with all of the monster's reactions to being shot, all of which are still in the game. They have a hardcore mode as well, which removes most - if not all - pickups and makes the enemies ridiculously hard to kill. I think I'll just stick with hard mode.\n\nThe only downside I've found is that they have a separate music option for PC(CD) which sounds a whole lot better than the also included N64 tracks. It's a downside because the PC tracks are from the Turok 2 soundtrack which doesn't loop the songs properly. I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I found the soundtrack and it cut out large chunks of the music because they figured it was too repetitive. The loop parts had such cool transitions that I would literally just stand in the levels to hear all the way through! Fortunately, the N64 audio option (on by default) plays the whole track like it should.\n\nI had a ton of fun playing through the first level again and I look forward to playing the rest as well.

This fixes what is in mine and I'd bet most people's opinion to be Turok 2's greatest flaw, which was that Turok 2 did not give you enough information on how or where to find the objectives. \n\nThe combat is as great as ever, even more so with a mouse and keyboard. The feeling of strafe shooting dinosaurs, blowing their fucking limbs or entire upper body off with a double barrel shotgun, seeing their last few seconds of life as they fall to the floor in pain writhing like worns is a satisfying now as it was back when you first played it on N64.\n\nIf I had one complaint to give it would be that the lack of platforming has been retroactively made into a detractor. While I loathed Dinosaur Hunter's platforming on the N64, I did thoroughly enjoy it with the superior controls of mouse and keyboard. Turok 2 does have platforming mind you, but it's usually for secret areas or to collect resources such as health and ammo, most of it is none mandatory.\n\nAND MULTIPLAYER! GOD! Having played some it makes me sad that I didn't get to play it on this scale when I was a child. 16 player deathmatch is a joy! Tho people looking for balance need not apply, they shouldn't want to.

Klar, einiges davon trifft auch auf\nGoldenEye 64 zu, aber das Spiel hat seine eigene Klasse und individuelle Thematik.\n\nTurok ist ein Badass-Indianer mit dicken Waffen, der sich durch Horden von Dinos, Aliens, Zombies, Spinnen und anderen Fabelwesen ballert,\ndabei Schl\u00fcssel f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chsten Level sucht und unterschiedliche Aufgaben erf\u00fcllt:\nGefangene befreien, irgendwas zerst\u00f6ren oder einschalten usw.

Eine fast verlorengegangene Kunst.\n\nWer Schiss vor Backtracking hat, kann ganz bequem auf die Quickwarpfunktion oder Cheats zur\u00fcckgreifen.\nW\u00fcrde ich aber anfangs lassen, weil das zu sehr zur Gewohnheit werden kann und die Herausforderung ruiniert.\nWenn die Progression gestoppt wird, dann h\u00f6chstens durch Faulheit oder Unaufmerksamkeit.\nAber f\u00fcr die simpel gehaltene Grafik ist es eigentlich leicht alles zu finden.\nWem das nicht zur Orientierung reicht, kann neben der Karte noch eine Option verwenden,\ndie wie in \"modernen\" Shootern die missionsrelevanten Objekte markiert, allerdings nur wenn man in der N\u00e4he steht. Eine sinnvolle Erweiterung ist auch die Funktion sich an Kanten hochzuziehen, was nervige Tode bei Abgr\u00fcnden deutlich reduziert. L\u00e4uft so geschmeidig wie bei Crysis 3.\n\nAuf jeden Fall ist es schwierig aus dem Flow geworfen zu werden. So wie es sein soll!\nDie erweiterten Grafikoptionen sind umfangreich und geben dem Spiel einen sch\u00e4rferen Look.\nErwartet blo\u00df kein grafisches Meisterwerk! Das Spiel ist alt, aber mehr als nur eine aufpolierte Version.\nDie optimalen Einstellungen muss jeder f\u00fcr sich selbst finden.\nAch ja, das Spiel hat einen FOV Slider bis zu 179! Irre gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig.\n\nDas Spiel hat einen \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigenden Umfang, mit dem Ihr locker eine Spielzeit im zweistelligen Bereich erreicht.\nUnd f\u00fcr die Freaks unter uns gibt es noch einen Hardcore Modus.

Like the remaster of Turok 1, this game has been flawlessly ported over to the new engine and the new controls/movement physics make it vastly superior to play over the N64 version and the original PC port.\n\nIts crazy that this game has a huge amount of settings to tinker around with (and in the console commands) that most modern AAA PC games don't even come close to having. Although most of the textures/models don't appear to have been modified, the new object based motion blur and other new visual enhancements really give them added pop. I'm sure a HD re-texture project will appear at somepoint. They even provided both PC and N64 soundtracks which is a nice added bonus.\n\nI remain hopeful that Nightdive Studios can port over Turok 3 Shadow of Oblivion and Rage Wars as long as the sources for those games still exist and are in good shape. With the high quality of both this and their Turok 1 port, it really shows the huge importance of preserving older games to make them work with the latest computers whilst enhancing the playability of them.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone even if they haven't played the original game on N64 or the earlier PC port.", "timestamp_created": 1489698528, "timestamp_updated": 1489698528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30548222": {"recommendationid": "30548222", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991012973", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490444436}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr gut gemacht !...f\u00fcr Retro Gamer !", "timestamp_created": 1489698454, "timestamp_updated": 1489698454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30548216": {"recommendationid": "30548216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057507658", "num_games_owned": 511, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510847953}, "language": "english", "review": "This has always been one of my favorite FPS games of all time. The remaster delivers a questionably faithful, but absolutely enjoyable experience of Turok 2.\n\nI may not be a fan of the changes introduced to this version, but even a purist as big as I has to admit that the gameplay in this game is more of a blast than ever. I do believe that the faster style suits this game less than the original slow and deliberate movements did, but I can't deny it's really fun to dodge and weave in between all the enemy shots. The hit detection is accurate and headshots are very useful, and the enemies move around a lot, so the action is really good.\n\nIt's somewhat lacking in graphical options (I would've liked to disable some lighting stuff and lower the overall contrast...), but most of the rather ugly new \"features\" (ambient occlusion, bloom, scene saturation and all that trash) can be disabled to make the game look good. At the very least, it doesn't look worse than the original, which is OK, because for its time the original was very pretty.\n\nThe soundtrack includes both the n64 version - the full length, but lower quality tracks - and the PC version, which in my opinion sounds much better, but, sadly, has the tracks somewhat bizarrely cut. And what can I say about the music in this game? I think it's one of the best video game soundtracks I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. The tracks, even in the PC version of the OST, are long, dynamic, atmospheric and overall amazing.\n\nEnough gushing about the game, though! It's a masterpiece and the remaster does it justice.

The lighting is better, shadowing is better, textures are amazing, audio is great. Not to mention that you can save whenever you want, new features have been added like hardcore mode where you have one life at the hardest difficulty and last turok standing, which is a brand new gamemode for multi-player. You can grapple and climb up objects when jumping up close to them. They even made it easier to find switches and important items by including quest markers in-game. I feel like that was an awesome move by the developers considering that when I played the game when it first came out I always had to backtrack since I kept misssing certain items. The blood and reactions from the AI after being hit has been refined greatly, so things are much more reactive than before. Long story short, buy this game.

Ahora puedo decir que se cumplio mi deseo de poder jugar una vez mas este maravilloso juego.

Die un\u00fcbersichtliche Karte. Alle erstrecken sich \u00fcber mehrere Bereiche welche durch Teleporter verbunden sind und sich \u00fcber verschiedene h\u00f6hen Ebenen erstrecken. Es gibt weder ein Hinweis welcher Teleporter wo hin f\u00fchrt, man sie einmal entdeckt hat, noch werden die verschiedenen Ebenen einzeln angezeigt. Alle Ebenen werden \u00fcber einander gezeigt und nur durch leicht anders gef\u00e4rbte Linien gekennzeichnet. So wird das lesen der Karte unn\u00f6tig kompliziert und anstrengend. Dennoch ist es sch\u00f6n eine zu haben denn die einzelnen Level sind sehr weitl\u00e4ufig und komplex.\n\n4. Die Wassereffekte. In einigen Leveln f\u00fchrt der Weg nur unter Wasser weiter oder es verbergen sich Items im k\u00fchlen nass. Das man in manchen Gew\u00e4ssern sogut wie nichts sieht, weil das Wasser einen zum Beispiel gelblichen Stich hat, ist da alles andere als gut. \n\n5. Die Hitboxen. Besonders bei kleineren Feinden scheint die Hitbox nicht da zu sein wo sie sollte. Da diese flink um den Spieler rumhuschen und bei h\u00f6heren FOV aus einer Reichweite schaden anrichten k\u00f6nnen obwohl es so aussieht das sie noch nicht in Attackrange sind macht der Kampf gegen sie nicht immer Spa\u00df.\n\nDennoch ist Turok 2 ein sehr guter Ego Shooter. Der Kampf f\u00fchlt sich gut an, das Leveldesign im zusammenspiel mit der guten Musik erzeugt eine gro\u00dfartige Atmosph\u00e4re. Kleine Schockmomente funktionieren super und wenn ihr von mehreren Gegnern in die Ecke gedr\u00e4ngt werdet steig die Panik. \nNightdive hat den Klassiker technisch aufgebohrt. Erh\u00f6hte Aufl\u00f6sung plus viele Grafik- und Soundoptionen wurden implementiert. Die Steuerung mit der Maus wurde bedeutend verbessert im Gegensatz zum Original. \nDie Funktion sich Schalter und andere wichtige Objekte hervorheben zu lassen ist l\u00f6blich da man diese ansonsten leicht \u00fcbersehen w\u00fcrde dank der veralteten Texturen. Die Itemplazierung wurde zum Original ver\u00e4ndert so findet man im 2. Level nicht mehr die Stormfire Cannon sondern erst im Level 5 und einige Missions kritische Objekte wurden \u00f6rtlich versetzt. \nMit dem PMF Layer hat es eine neue Waffe ins Spiel geschafft. Daf\u00fcr musst der Klingenwind dran glauben. Die Bossk\u00e4mpfe funktionieren genauso wie fr\u00fcher und nicht nicht besonders Schwer wenn man wei\u00df was man tun muss.\nLeider hat es nur die Englische Synchronisation ins Spiel geschafft. Es gibt dennoch eine deutsche Text \u00dcbersetzung welche allerdings nicht gut ist. Man schaue auf den Men\u00fcpunkt Abziehbilder in den Grafikeinstellungen. \n\nTurok 2 ist ein guten, schneller und spa\u00dfiger Ego Shooter der hier eine verdiente und gut Neuauflage erh\u00e4lt, der dennoch einige kleine Fehler hat, die schon im Original Turok 2 f\u00fcr N64 und PC vorhanden wahren und es unverst\u00e4ndlich ist wieso diese ein zweites mal passieren sollten.

Ich habe seit dem Trailer an nichts mehr denken k\u00f6nnen, als Turok 2. Ich habe es damals auf dem N64 geliebt und die Remastered-Edition, steht der in nichts nach. Das Spiel bietet eine bessere Beleuchtung, die gut gelungen ist. Was ich ganz sch\u00f6n fand, war der FOV Slider. Ich hab es auf die normalen 90\u00b0 gesetzt und trotzdem spielt sich alles butter weich. Was ich dem Spiel auch sehr hoch anrechnen muss, ist, dass man in den Soundoptionen, zwischen dem PC und dem N64 w\u00e4hlen kann (hab nat\u00fcrlich auf N64 gestellt). Nach bisherigem spielen muss ich sagen, eine richtig gute Umsetztung. Es l\u00e4uft endlich auf den g\u00e4ngigen Windows Versionen, ohne nervige 3DFX Fehler anzuzeigen. Ich habe den Kauf in keinsterweise bereut. Die, die schon das Original auf dem N64 mochten, werden mit Turok 2 Remastred ihre Freude haben.

Diese soll Energie-Totems zerst\u00f6ren, die in verschiedenen Welten verstreut sind, um den Primagen zu schw\u00e4chen. Joshua Fireseed, der neue Turok, stellt sich nun mit Hilfe seiner  Gehilfin Adon, dem Kampf gegen die Armee des Primagen.\n\n[b]-Hintergrund[/b]\nTurok war urspr\u00fcnglich eine Comicreihe aus den 50er Jahren. Nachdem die Markenrechte \u00fcber Jahrzehnte hin und her gingen, kaufte Acclaim Comics 1994 die Rechte der Marke und lies daraufhin \"Turok: Dinosaur Hunter\" von Iguana Entertainment entwickeln, welches 1996 f\u00fcr das N64 und etwas sp\u00e4ter f\u00fcr den PC erschien. Der Erfolg war recht gro\u00df, weshalb schnell klar war, dass ein Nachfolger kommen soll. \n\nWieder von Iguana Entertainment entwickelt, erschien \"Turok 2: Seeds of Evil\" dann 1998 auf dem N64 und Anfang 1999 auf dem PC. Turok 2 war moderner, gr\u00f6\u00dfer und sch\u00f6ner als sein Vorg\u00e4nger. Letzteres brachte das N64 oftmals an seine Grenzen. Dazu war Turok 2 eines der ersten Spiele, die das Expansion Pak genutzt haben. Dieses hat die Aufl\u00f6sung des Spieles von 320\u00d7240 Pixeln auf 640\u00d7480 erh\u00f6ht - Oft auf Kosten der Framerate.\n\nBis heute hat Turok 2 eine gro\u00dfe Fanbase. Der Onlinemodus der PC Version wird bis heute noch aktiv gespielt, selbst nach der offiziellen Abschaltung der Online Dienste.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\n[b]-Level[/b]\nDie 6 Einzelspieler Level sind jeweils ziemlich gro\u00df und bieten eine gro\u00dfe optische Abwechslung. Von den S\u00fcmpfen des Todes, zu dem Hafen von Adia bis hin zum Raumschiff des Primagen ist alles dabei. Da man sich in der originalen Version oftmals verlaufen hat, wurden die Level im Remaster etwas \u00fcbersichtlicher gemacht. Hinzukommt eine neue Schnellreise Funktion innerhalb aller Adon-Portale eines Level. An solchen Portalen kann gespeichert werden, die Lebenspunkte sowie die Munition aufgestockt werden und die bereits angesprochene Schnellreise benutzt werden.\n\n[b]-Missionsziele[/b]\nVor dem Start jedes Levels gibt euch Adon die Missionziele, wie z.b. das Aktivieren von Warnleuchtt\u00fcrmen, das Befreien von Kindern und Gefangenen oder das Zerst\u00f6ren von Muntionslagern - nur um einige zu nennen. Am Ende eines jeden Levels m\u00fcsst ihr ein Energie-Totem vor anst\u00fcrmenden Gegnern verteidigen. Hinzukommen versteckten Gegenst\u00e4nde, wie Schl\u00fcssel zu den sp\u00e4teren Leveln oder spezielle Gegenst\u00e4nde, die euch F\u00e4higkeiten geben. Einige Gegenst\u00e4nde und Bereiche kann man erst sp\u00e4ter erreichen, weshalb man fr\u00fcher oder sp\u00e4ter zu jedem Level zur\u00fcckkehren muss.\n\n[b]-Waffen[/b]\nEs gibt 26 auffindbare Waffen, wie z.b. eine Klinge, eine Minigun, ein Tek-Bogen, ein Bet\u00e4ubungsgewehr, ein Raketenwerfer, ein Granatwerfer, eine Energiekanone, eine Energiekugel und viele viele viele mehr. Dies stellt meiner Meinung nach gleichzeitig eine der gr\u00f6\u00dften St\u00e4rken des Spieles da.\n\n[b]-Gegner[/b]\nEs gibt um die 30 verschiedene Gegner. Darunter Reptiloiden, Dinosaurier, Aliens, Insektoiden und viele mehr. Dar\u00fcber hinaus gibt es 4 Bossk\u00e4mpfe und gelegentlich kleine Arenen K\u00e4mpfe. Auch die Bossgegner sind sehr verschieden gehalten: Eine gro\u00dfe Gottesanbeterin, ein riesiges Auge mit Tentakeln, ein gro\u00dfes \"ogerartiges\" Wesen und der Primagen selbst.\n\n[h1]Verbesserungen der Remaster Version[/h1]\n\n[b]-Grafik und Kompatibilit\u00e4t[/b]\nDas Spiel wurde auf die Kex Engine geportet und l\u00e4uft dadurch butterweich auf allen aktuellen Windows Betriebssystemen (Linux wird bisher nicht unterst\u00fctzt). Die Grafik wurde ebenfalls unter anderem durch den Support von Full HD und 4k, sowie hinzuschaltbarer Kantengl\u00e4ttung und kleinerer Grafikeffete wie Reflektionen und eines einstellbaren FOV verbessert. Das Hud wurde ebenfalls  komplett erneuert und \u00fcbersichtlicher gemacht. Leider unterst\u00fctzt das Spiel nur eine Framerate von maximal 63 Frames, was f\u00fcr Nutzer von 144Hz Monitoren \u00e4rgerlich ist. Man sollte allerdings beachten, dass es sich hier um ein Remaster handelt, nicht um ein Remake. Wer also eine neue Grafikpracht erwartet, wird entt\u00e4uscht.\n\n[b]-Steuerung[/b]\nNeben einer besseren Tastenbelegung wurde die Steuerung deutlich verbessert: Das \u00dcberwinden von Zielen geht nun leichter von der Hand und die Laufgeschwindigkeit wurde leicht erh\u00f6ht. Au\u00dferdem wurden Waffenverhalten und Feedback verbessert, ohne dabei das alte Spielgef\u00fchl zu ver\u00e4ndern. Dadurch kommt etwas mehr Tempo ins Spiel, wodurch sich das Gameplay viel frischer anf\u00fchlt.\n\n[b]-Gegner und Level[/b]\nZu den Verbesserungen in diesem Bereich geh\u00f6ren eine verbesserte KI, ein Schnellreise System, leicht verkleinerte und \u00fcbersichtlichter gemachte Level und hervorgehobene Missionsgegenst\u00e4nde und Ziele. Das Schnellreise System funktioniert innerhalb aller Adon-Portale eines Levels, die man bereits besucht hat. Dadurch ist das Erkunden der Level viel einfacher. Man verl\u00e4uft sich weniger und findet sich sp\u00e4ter beim Suchen einiger Gegenst\u00e4nde besser in den Leveln zurecht.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]\n\nEndlich l\u00e4sst sich Turok 2 wieder vern\u00fcnftig online spielen und es macht genauso viel Spa\u00df wie damals. Cross-Play zu GOG ist ebenfalls gegeben. Dar\u00fcber hinaus gibt es noch einen Splitscreen Modus - Keine Selbstverst\u00e4ndlichkeit und wirklich toll, dass dieser es ins Remaster geschafft hat. Au\u00dferdem sei erw\u00e4hnt, dass der Multiplayer Waffen und Maps aus der N64 Version enth\u00e4lt. Ein netter Zusatz, wie ich finde.\n\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\n\nDer Soundtrack ist wirklich ein Meisterst\u00fcck und z\u00e4hlt meiner Meinung nach zu den besten Soundtracks, die Videospiele je spendiert bekommen haben. Jedes Level hat eine passende musikalische Untermalung, wodurch die Soundkulisse noch stimmiger wird. \n \nKleine Info am Rande: Man hat die M\u00f6glichkeit, jederzeit zwischen PC und N64 Soundtrack zu wechseln!\n\n[h1]FAZIT[/h1]\n\nEndlich vern\u00fcnftig auf dem PC spielbar, Online und Splitscreen Multiplayer, verbesserte Grafik und dazu noch ungeschnitten..was will man mehr. F\u00fcr den recht hohen Preis bekommt man also einiges geboten.

The late 90\u2019s was an era where First Person Shooters began to break away from the PC space, and comfortably on to consoles. Heavy hitters like Goldeneye 64 and Halo: Combat Evolved, proved that shooters didn\u2019t have to be cumbersome or difficult to play on those platforms. But before all of that, One franchise lead the way for the birth of the console shooter.\n\nTurok Dinosaur Hunter was released on the Nintendo 64 in March of 1997, seven months after the console hit the market. It proved that you didn\u2019t need a keyboard and mouse to enjoy a shooter on a different platform. Turok was released to good critical reception, and was an instant classic. And More than a year later, a successor was released. Nearly two decades have passed, Three Console generations have come and gone, and it\u2019s time to take a Nostalgic trip. And not only has the original Turok: Dinosaur Hunter been remastered with help of modern bells and whistles, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil also got the same treatment. \n\nHas Night Dive Studios done this iconic and classic franchise the justice is so very needs after two decades? Or is it best left to Oblivion\u2026\n\nSTORY-\n\nSet some time after the events of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter- You fill the role of Joshua Fireseed. Summoned by the mysterious alien: Adon, and the Lazarus Concordance- You are asked to fight against the evil Primogen: A powerful alien entity trapped in it\u2019s own Lightship by the Lazarus, in an effort to prevent the destruction of the Universe. The Primogen\u2019s captivity relies on Energy Totems located across the \u201cLost Land\u201d, and they\u2019re under attack by several primitive species that the Primogen has recruited to destroy them- Freeing him from his Prison. Each Primitive Species has a backstory, or a reason why the Primogen uses them selfishly to fulfill his mission at being free from his captivity\n\nThe story does a decent job of laying itself out to you in the very beginning, and at the start of each mission, but doesn\u2019t get in your face when the gameplay sets in.There is a healthy balance of exposition and gameplay that simply works for the game, while keeping the focus primarily on moment-to-moment combat and exploration.\n\nGAMEPLAY-\n\nFor a franchise that helped pioneer First Person Shooters on consoles, it certainly does great on PC again. The original version was released on PC, but no where near this quality. \n\nWhat could certainly be gleefully jarring is the level design, with environments that are mostly non-linear, which fosters exploration, and maybe even a sense of being lost sometimes. It\u2019s refreshingly and reflective of great game design of the old days when shooter campaigns didn\u2019t travel in a straight line. \n\nControls are refined, precise, and enjoyable, with decent options to help tweak to your needs, which is always nice. There\u2019s a satisfying feeling you get from even the simple gun mechanics. The pistol feels punchy, The Mag 60 delivers punishing damage to simpler enemies, and dispatches quickly, and the brutal impact of the shotguns feel just right up close.\n\nAnd yes.. The wonderful Cerebral Bore is just as amazing as you remembered it.\n\nDESIGN-\n\nFans of the original will be happy to know that, for better or worse, the game\u2019s base models remain the same. But most exciting is the addition of various graphical enhancements that have been added. Notably is the inclusion per-object motion blur applied to all moving objects, and object shadows.\n\nFor those that love graphics options, there\u2019s quite a healthy amount of tuning options, but what\u2019s most pleasing is how well optimized the game is. My i5 3570K and 1070 GPU combination did well to run the game at 4K and at 60 frames per second. \n\nI would have loved to see some better texture options for the game, as things are still a bit blurry, but overall, this is still the classic experience you remember with a modern glow.\n\nCLOSING-\n\nThe Turok Franchise was a glorious staple in the early Nintendo 64 era. Though It\u2019s subsequent sequels didn't get as much praise, which is unfortunate. Night Dive has done a wonderful thing in bringing the originals up from the depths to show them the respect they deserve. It\u2019s character models and textures may have not aged very well, but Turok 2 is certainly worth your time and money, and people who have never had the opportunity certainly owe it to themselves to experience the beginning of the explosive growth of shooters on consoles, when it was the most fun.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1489684034, "timestamp_updated": 1489684034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508365", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30544409": {"recommendationid": "30544409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007918535", "num_games_owned": 375, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 20521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489816155}, "language": "english", "review": "*Received the game for free*\n\nwhen i think back to my childhood, My mind instantly goes back to what i consider to be my nostalgia days.\n\nGames like DOOM, Timesplitters Duke Nukem, basically raised me as a young lad.\n\nBut if theres a game that i have a raging hard on for other than doom, its Turok 2 Seeds Of Evil a game that for the longest time was nearly impossible for me to get my hands on.\n\nAfter legally obtaining it and totally not torrenting it, the original pc port was finally mine and it was time to kick some a$$.\n\nAt least thats what i thought, until the port handed my ass on a plater with low framerates, the game speeding up whenever my framerate increased and constant crashes.\n\nIt was like a hot chick rubbing your beef sausage and leaving the room, it left me with blue balls, my balls needed rubbing and it needed rubbing badly.\n\nAnd now they've finally been rubbed, more than 6 years down the road when Turok 2 Seeds Of Evil has finally been remastered by night dive studios.\n\nAnd after having the privilege of meeting the team and playing the remasters earliest stages of the development As a Turok fan, i cant think of any reason for fans not to get this.\n\nFirst off you have quite a few graphics settings for you to tinker with like Motion Blur, Super Sampling, Ambient Occlusion as well as a Field Of View slider and the removal of fog.\n\nYou can choose to listen to either the Nintendo 64 soundtrack or PC Soundtrack as well and to have the classic weapon bob or role with the much smoother PC version.\n\nJoshua can now grappel up surfaces allowing for much better traversial of maps and You have an option to have objectives appear on your screen as an exclamation mark to avoid confusion.\n\nIf you feel like a challenge there's a new difficulty called hardcore which gives you only one life to beat the game, good luck.\n\nThere's now an optional objective marker so if you get lost, you can find the objective much easier when approching it.\n\nThe Multiplayer is up and running with Online Play and 4 player Local Split Screen so those of you who played Turok 2 multiplayer all those years ago can fuck people up\n\nYou can now quicksave anywhere in the level thank Phuck, as well as Teleport between Warp Portals around the game for easier backtracking which makes collecting keys much easier.\n\nOne of the original scrapped Raptor enemies have been fished out and placed back into the game.\n\nThere is now a library of sorts that shows all the enemies and weapons you've encountered in the game as well how many shot's you've fired with each weapon all of this plus numerous bug fixes.\n\nBut overall for $20 you're getting one of the best remasters we've seen and Nightdive have once again done gods work and given us one of gamings finest. \n\nFingers crossed oblivion will be at hand in the next year or so.", "timestamp_created": 1489683657, "timestamp_updated": 1489800873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 174, "votes_funny": 41, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716428", "comment_count": "26", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39399370": {"recommendationid": "39399370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183235943", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 741, "last_played": 1515303709}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent remastering of one of the greatest games of my childhood.

It is better than I remember it and I plan on beating it. \n\nI remember getting this when it came out for Christmas when I was 11. I wanted to like it - but we didn't have a save pack and the game ran slow (had a terrible frame rate). So I'd play it with cheats and just shoot stuff - but Turok is pretty boring when you don't know (care) what you are doing. Then I got my own 2nd hand computer (a 486 with 16mb ram) and kind of stopped playing consoles after really sinking my teeth into classics like System Shock.\n\nBut I always had a memory of Turok and Turok 2 - especially the first level in the 2nd game, it just seemed so advanced in my memory.\n\nPlaying this now - I am surprised of how much of a good game there is still here. Honestly with a decent frame rate this game just feels great - the shooting is fast and arcadey, and with a proper controller or a mouse-keyboard setup it just feels right.\n\nGraphically the stock game is very nice - I am running with all the enhancements at the highest quality and reshade 3.0 for further graphical tweaking. The texture resolution does not seem to be improved - but the textures themselves are good for the time, even if they do have that blotchy nineties look to them from time to time. Using reshade sharpening and a slightly adjusted cartoon preset helps (in my opinion) by giving the textures a bit of definition and the game a more cel-shaded presentation. The gore is cartoonish - but just as shocking as I remember it. \n\nThe soundtrack is as brilliant as I remember - if a little repetitive. The actual sound of it and the orchestration choices are perfect to provide an epic theme to the action.\n\nI'd say it is worth the asking price if you are a fan of the game from back in the day and just have to play it right now. If you were old enough to have played it at released and still love old games - but did not play it at release, it is worth checking out especially due to the loving restoration work done by Nightdive but I might recommend waiting for a sale if your games budget is not astronomical.\n\nIf you were not old enough to have remembered this game coming out and don't have much experience with older first person shooters - this is a fun game, but it is also quite a bit different from modern games. Even with the objective markers and other enhancements in this remaster - this game is essentially a maze with fast paced arcade style shooting that can be punishingly hard on higher difficulties. \n\nIt is kind of like Doom(4) - but with even less emphasis on story, and more sprawling level design. It still looks good - but due to the texture work this still looks like a game from 1998 even with all the fancy features turned on, it is very smooth and the details are economical. Unlike indie games that emulate this style but with almost two decades worth of advancement in design - this is a game where the gameplay principles are dated to 1998. If you can reconcile that - and are interested, it is a very fun action fps game that I would recommend full price if you need a game right now, or on sale if you aren't sure.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1515899674, "timestamp_updated": 1515899674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39321072": {"recommendationid": "39321072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087337254", "num_games_owned": 994, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 353, "last_played": 1515855542}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tras completar no hace mucho el reciente remaster del primer Turok, me lanc\u00e9 a por la segunda entrega en esta vor\u00e1gine de nostalgia que a veces nos invade a los que ya llevamos unos cuandos a\u00f1os en esto de los videojuegos ^^. Turok 2: Seeds of Evil no es un t\u00edtulo que me coja de primeras en estos d\u00edas, ya que jugu\u00e9 en su d\u00eda a su versi\u00f3n de N64 y a\u00fan conservo una copia de aquel m\u00edtico cartucho, pero creo que la plataforma de Nintendo hace mucho que dej\u00f3 de ser la m\u00e1s ideal para experimentar un FPS y casi 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s del lanzamiento original, as\u00ed que este Remaster ven\u00eda que ni pintado para volver al que considero una de las grandes joyas del g\u00e9nero.\n\nTurok 2 nos sit\u00faa en otro tiempo despu\u00e9s de los acontecimientos de la primera entrega, en el pellejo de un nuevo Turok de nombre Joseph Fireseed. En esta ocasi\u00f3n se le encomendar\u00e1 la misi\u00f3n de detener al Primagen, un ser de aspecto extraterrestre que amenaza todo Lost Land, y que por medio de sus tropas o convenciendo a otras razas, atacar\u00e1 los poblados y las tierras habitadas por los humanos con el fin de destruir los Totems Energ\u00e9ticos que pueden destruirle y salir de su cautiverio. Para ello tendremos que recorrer 6 laber\u00ednticos niveles cumpliendo una serie de misiones y avanzando a trav\u00e9s de las fuerzas del Primagen para derrotarle.\n\nEste juego presenta una buena serie de diferencias respecto a su antecesor. La primera y una de las m\u00e1s notorias es la cantidad de objetivos que tendremos que cumplir y que, en algunos casos, incluso comprender\u00e1 una serie de implicaciones jugables que le destacan de la mayor\u00eda de juegos del g\u00e9nero. Cada nivel tiene una serie de misiones propias que tendremos que cumplir antes de abandonarlo, desde rescatar a ni\u00f1os o soldados cautivos, hasta destruir dep\u00f3sitos de armas u otros objetivos. Impl\u00edcitamente, aunque no lo recalquen al empezar los niveles, tambi\u00e9n tendremos que encontrar items imprescindibles para avanzar, como las llaves de niveles que ya estaban presentes en el primer Turok, las llaves Primagen para el jefe final, o las pumas que, llevadas a sus altares, otorgan poderes especiales. Estos poderes ser\u00e1n imprescindibles para alcanzar algunos objetos adem\u00e1s de descubrir rutas y secretos alternativos, y a\u00f1adir\u00e1 un elemento de backtracking al juego, algo no muy com\u00fan en el g\u00e9nero. \n\nPara conseguir todo esto, tendremos que movernos por cada uno de los niveles buscando en todos los recovecos, incluso volviendo sobre nuestros pasos, lo que hace de Turok 2 una experiencia que va mucho m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de disparar y avanzar. El dise\u00f1o de escenarios es simplemente una locura. Largos, complejos, retorcidos..., el sentido de la orientaci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 vital en muchas ocasiones, y estaremos obligados a usar el mapa m\u00e1s de una vez, sobre todo en escenarios que plantean t\u00faneles y pasillos de similar apariencia y que complicar\u00e1n todo. En esta ocasi\u00f3n, Seeds of Evil renuncia al estilo selv\u00e1tico del primer juego para ambientar la acci\u00f3n en escenarios m\u00e1s l\u00fagubres y decadentes. Niveles como Port of Adia o River of Souls se ambientan en zonas moderadamente urbanizadas, con Death Marshes y Lair of the Blind Ones siendo los m\u00e1s oscuros en un entramado de pantanos y t\u00faneles subterraneos, con Hive of the Mantids poniendo la nota m\u00e1s \"extraterrestre\", y Primagen Lightning el punto tecnol\u00f3gico en una enorme nave. Tecniicamente Turok 2 mantiene m\u00e1s alto el tipo en comparaci\u00f3n con la primera entrega, tanto en el plano visual como, y sobre todo, en el aspecto sonoro, con contundentes efectos y una banda sonora que tanto en composici\u00f3n como en calidad encumbra la obra.\n\nPero sin duda una de las notas m\u00e1s destacables desde siempre fue su arsenal. Si la primera entrega contaba con armas de todo tipo y era muy completo en ese sentido, Turok 2 eleva el list\u00f3n y lo sit\u00faa donde pocos llegan a nivel creativo. A algunar armas cl\u00e1sicas como la pistola, la escopeta, o el m\u00edtico arco Tek, se le suman nuevas adiciones como el rifle volt\u00e1ico, el Nuke (que tendremos que conseguir juntando sus partes), la Razor Wind o el m\u00edtico Cerebral Bore, un taladro teledirigido que se clava y trepana los craneos de los enemigos para finalizar con una explosi\u00f3n, instakill garantizado. No solo hay creatividad, sino tambi\u00e9n cantidad, m\u00e1s de una veintena y que podremos llevar y usar cuando queramos, Old School del bueno, que sumado a la intensa violencia del juego, con decapitaciones, desmembramientos y otros efectos, queda con un conjunto de lo m\u00e1s atractivo para los amantes de la acci\u00f3n sin restricciones.\n\nCon todo, este Remaster cuenta con algunos a\u00f1adidos y modificaciones. Por supuesto las opciones gr\u00e1ficas y muchas otras inclusiones t\u00e9cnicas han sido implementadas para actualizar este cl\u00e1sico, pero tambi\u00e9n se han establecido cambios notables que infieren en la jugabilidad, como la posibilidad de activar una ayuda que nos indique la ubicaciones de los objetivos, algo que agradecer\u00e1n los que no quieran matarse a buscar frustrados (y los que no quieran ayudas, siempre pueden desactivarlo), y tambi\u00e9n se han redise\u00f1ado algunas partes de los niveles, sobre todos aquellos encarados antiguamente a transiciones, y la ubicaci\u00f3n de algunos objetos se ha modificado. En general, el remaster pule algunas aristas y actualiza el juego a nivel t\u00e9cnico, pero no esper\u00e9is algo como un remake, porque el aspecto sigue conserv\u00e1ndose \u00edntegro. Tambi\u00e9n sigue estando el multiplayer, aunque no s\u00e9 a d\u00eda de hoy qu\u00e9 inter\u00e9s podr\u00e1 despertar.\n\n\nA veces se ha tildado a Turok 2 como el metroidvania de los FPS, o incluso el Dark Souls de los shooters. La segunda afirmaci\u00f3n no me parece muy pr\u00f3xima, salvando la dificultad que puede llegar a ser muy alta, pero la primera no tanto, si tenemos en cuenta que muchos miembros de Iguana Entertainment formaron despu\u00e9s Retro Studios, y ya sab\u00e9is qu\u00e9 crearon aquellos chicos. Puede que, al fin y al cabo, Turok 2 fuese el prototipo que gest\u00f3 una de las obras maestras de lo que ser\u00eda la next gen de Nintendo tras N64, pero para su \u00e9poca, Turok 2 fue tambi\u00e9n un impactante t\u00edtulo, no del agrado de todos por su dificultad, sus desquiciantes niveles y toda la complejidad que comportaba, pero al mismo tiempo fue un t\u00edtulo que se desmarc\u00f3 absolutamente de toda la saga y, en mi opini\u00f3n, fue el pico nunca superado de la franquicia, con un estilo que no se ha imitado apenas. Si quer\u00e9is un reto desafiante, y no os ech\u00e1is para atr\u00e1s con unos niveles enormes e intimidantes, esta sigue siendo una obra imprescindible. Si quieres algo m\u00e1s complejo en ese sentido, creo que ya tienes que ir mirando hacia System Shock.\n\nSi quieres unirte a mi grupo: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JoshCell\n\nSi quieres seguirme como mentor: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/29569915-Josh-Cell/", "timestamp_created": 1515879357, "timestamp_updated": 1515879770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534314", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39280175": {"recommendationid": "39280175", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972680842", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1041, "last_played": 1515305841}, "language": "english", "review": "I first played Turok 2 on the N64 back in 1998. I was a young teen gamer back then, full of hormone-fuelled anger, wearing all-black clothing and with no patience whatsoever! So of course I never completed the game (there was no name for 'rage-quit' back then!) although I do remember thinking how atmospheric it was and how cool the weapons were. Somehow those thoughts must have stayed with me when I saw this new remake on Steam.\n\nSo having completed this game (hey, it only took 20 years!) how do I sum it up for other potential players? I'm going to try and review it for both people who played the original and those completely new to it. I need to say to those new to it that you may not get much out of it - this is a 20 year old game made up of polygons and textures which can't come close to anything around today. Having said that, given how old this game is you may be surprised by how well the gameplay holds up, how the music and atmosphere sticks in your head and how challenging the game can be.\n\nThe start of the game sets the tone for [i]almost[/i] everything to follow: you play from the first-person perpective of Turok (a title meaning 'Son Of Stone' according to the Turok comics). You start the game having appeared through a portal into a kind of Xen/outer space dimenision and meet an alien who introduces herself as Adon, the Speaker of Forever Light. Adon explains that you need to stop a creature called the Primagen from destroying five energy totems which keep him a prisoner in his Lightship, otherwise his blast of temporal energy will destroy the universe - no pressure! Promptly she sends you to the game's first level, the Port Of Aida. She gives you a little background to the location, explains what you need to do and what you're up against -the Dinosoid army, a race of gentically engineered dinosaur hybrids. She'll repeat the format of these speeches for every level you find throughout the game, although each level has it's own specific objectives. After that, it's huntin' time!\n\nSo let's get going with the core of the game, an FPS adventure filled with a host of enemies, locations, objectives and more. The game's biggest strength is in the uniqueness and variety of what it throws at you: just as you get used to one weapon (a pistol) the game has another, completely different weapon around the corner (a bow) followed by melee weapons, a harpoon gun, a shotgun, a charge-dart rifle... and so on. You might be thinking that these weapons are common to other FPS games, and you're not wrong, but with these regular weapons the game also gives you different types of ammo: a shotgun can be used with explosive pellets, bows can be used with explosive arrows and can be upgraded to the Tek Bow which has a sniper sight, and so on. Even the basic pistol feels punchy and fun, and this is all before you get to the truly unique, most memorable weapons of the game. If you've never heard of the Cerebal Bore before... trust me, nobody forgets their first time.\n\nThis variety extends to the game's enemies too: just as you get used to a dinosoid that peppers you with plasma gunfire from behind a crate, the game will throw up another that swiftly charges you from a distance, followed by herds of tiny dinosaurs that move too quickly to shoot and swarm around you, tearing at your feet. Later there are insectoids, zombies, mammalians, spiders, cave-dwellers, worms, robotic hybrids and more, each with their own characteristics and methods. The levels of the game will also change to serve as platforms and environments for this army of monsters, changing music and mood very effectively as you progress.\n\nOne of the things that always divided opinion about the game is the level design. I've played my fair share of modern and old FPS shooters where the player is encouraged to explore and work out where to go, but the later levels of this game almost confused the hell out of me! It's very easy to miss an objective or even the path/portal that leads to it (like missing that one small key in the Water Temple of Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time). I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but it's certainly effective if you like a challenge. Using the map is essential, and it can be difficult to know if you've looked around every corner. There's no avoiding backtracking either because of the power-ups you'll need to collect before you can reach cetain areas, although in these areas there's usually a portal nearby - if you can remember which one! The game respawns a few enemies when you revisit but the majority will be gone if you've taken care of them. The game's levels certainly make great use of their 3D space, with many twisting and turning paths or buildings/areas you'll be unable to visit until later on. If you see a path far above you and haven't walked on it by the time the level ends, it can certainly feel disheartening when the game tells you you've missed an objective - there are a few times where finding that missing route takes work.\n\nThe music in the game is very good, even for a 20 year old game. You may find yourself humming the themes you'll hear and each level's music is well suited. In the remake you have a choice between the N64 and PC versions too. My only complaint is that the music can overwhelm the speech - even if you turn it down to 75% of the speech volume Adon's mission briefings can be difficult to understand without subtitles. This may also be down to the choice of using what sounds like the original voice recordings, they sound like they have a very low bitrate/quality. (This could be down to my headphones too, I've seen gameplay videos on YouTube which don't have this problem at all.)\n\nFinally, I need to heap a ton of praise on Nightdive Studios for the job they've done with this game. I ran the game maxed out on a 4K monitor and was impressed at how the core of the game is untouched and yet enchanced at the same time.

And upon playing already for about 5-6 hours total, I'm not dissapointed! This is the smoothest this game has EVER played, especially on PC. And surprisingly, after playing this game for YEARS on N64, I enjoy this port the most, and actually enjoy playing keyboard/ mouse so much more on this port. The keyboard/ mouse chemistry this game has is marvelous. \nNow, here are some pro's and con's just generally about the game:\nPROS:\n-A truly unique and different setting, the worlds and atmospheres in this game are incredible, even for today's standards. \n-The gameplay, while it is your run-of-the-mill, first person shooter, and could be compared to the likes of Goldeneye or Quake, is VERY fluent, and as I highlighted earlier, keyboard and mouse feel incredible in this game. It'd feel foreign playing any other way. And that's coming from an N64 fan who spent hours upon hours playing this on the N64. \n- The enemies are unique, and very original. Everything from the dinosaurs to the bug-like aliens you face towards the end of the game. \n- The weapons may be the most unique weapons offered in a game. Everything from the Shredder to the infamous Cerebal Bore. They're definitely an aresenal to expereince. \n- The soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks coming from an FPS, maybe a game in general. \n- You will get your money's worth, and spend hours upon hours in the Turok world. Even if you think you've uncovered everything on the levels, you most likely haven't. There's also an online section, which admittedly, I haven't spent much time on. I did conntect to a dedicated server, but no players were actually on. Turok online may be dead already, but to me, it's no big deal, considering I bought this for the story mode. \n- The missions, and alert signs make finding everything ten times easier, and cuts back on the frusturation the orinal port had to offer. \n- QUICKSAVE....do I have to say more? \n\nCONS:\n- The levels can get very frusutrating, and can have a labrynth-type-feel to them, especially 'River of Souls'. It's easy to get lost, and to find items or things you might need to complete a level, and it's very easy to even completely miss a section. \n- I've found that the smaller enemies in the game (i.e spiders, small dinosaurs, worms, etc) are the most annoying, often hard to kill with weapons. This is probably the reason they're implemented, but it can make things a little fursturating. Using the claws is your best bet for these types of enemies. \n- Non-skippable cutscenes, not the hugest of deals, but to some, this may be annoying. If you enter the cheat though, cutscenes are skippable. \n\nAll in all, Turok 2:Seed of Evil remastered is an EXCELLENT game WORTH the 20 USD price tag.

Weeeee But... you will forget she is doing that. She tells you a lot of things (I think she is still talking??), and she just keeps on talking and talking... over blarring music. I'm like, \"Lady, please speak up!\" There is no way to skip this part or turn down the music volume, believe me I tried. So you are basically watching a bland cutscene for a very long time. A VERY long time, like probably 5 minutes. It felt like 50. I like the crazy gun lizard though.\n\nLevel Design:\n\n    I am going nuts on whoever created the first level. So basically, you have your first enemy to kill and he's tough as he should be, not a problem. Then already, you are basically trapped in a medium area with a mechanic system telling you \"You must find a Power Cell\" I'm like \"Ok, not a problem!\" \n\n    1 hour later... *Spongebob timelapse memes*\n\n    \"WHERE IS THIS POWER CELL I AM SUPPOSED TO FIND!?\" Mind you - we are not even past the first segment.

So I damaged my health a little, a wall section blew up, ok we got a path. \n\n...the pathing in this level is a catastrophy and is the definition of confusion incarnate. There is way too many stairs and ladders to climb that you get lost. You have to find like 4 crying girls and 3 beacons or something. ... guess what? You have to find them in barried and unmarked super secret locations throughout the level! Btw, saving crying girls and putting up beacons aren't secret good guy awards you get, these things are MANDATORY. That's right, you cannot get past the first mission until you find the little girls and access the beacons. There is a blue portal that will send you to the next level, level 2. Nah. If you go through it, it sends you all the way back to the beginning! This happened to me a few times. And I was disheartened. All I want to do is continue...  \n\n... I spent over an hour trying to find TWO little girls. ...on level 1.\n\nThis is the first level... the first level and I cannot imagine things would only get harder and even more confusing! I'm terrified to go through anymore levels like this.\n\nCharacters:\n\n    The bad guys have granny voices. They are more under terrifying than anything I've ever seen for a supposedly terrifying looking bad guy. Voice acting is terrible counting these guys and the main girl in the first scene.\n\nGameplay: \n\n- Arrows being picked up is nice.\n- You are able to switch ammunition is nice.\n- The bow is weird and its arrows curve waaaaaay too much.\n- The bad guys seem to die at random, whether it is 1 hit kill, 2 hits, or sometimes 5 hits with either a pistol, shotgun, or bow. I just use a bow because it is like unlimited ammo.\n\n- ...Just get Turok 1.\n\nOverall: This is the first game in my entire life where I was unable to beat the 1st level. Usually when I don't have fun, I try to grind my way up to fun, and it is worth it most of the time, but in this case I'd rather do school work than play this load of crap. It's boring.\n\nTurok 1 was very, very nice. Turok 2 is a train wreck.

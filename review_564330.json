An example: You use the shotgun and would like to improve it, and you never use the gatling gun, so you disable the gatling gun in the hub world, by taking all of its batteries. Then you dump all the batteries in the shotgun, and this way you get a stronger shotgun at the cost of not being able to use the gatling gun. \n\nThis progression system rewards exploration of options and it can drastically change the gameplay. I've played this free game more than a few other titles/experiences that I've payed cold hard cash for. Give it a spin.\n\nOne last thing I enjoyed: one of the weapons is a classic disc-golf-disc but with a twist.

So far you get used to games in VR with flat menus for configuration, well this game surprised me with an original and interactive way to set up some game mechanichs. \n\nLater when starting the first level you will find a basic but fully playable Tower Defense style game with some VR twists.\n First of all you are in the path of the creeps...at the same level..and you have guns. \nSo besides the normal turns of every TD game when you use different structures that you strategically decide which to buy and how to place them to defeat the different enemy rounds, you also participate by shooting them to avoid they to reach your base.\n\nThe idea is twist that it is actually fun (if you liked TD games of course).\n\nBesides that the game is fully operative, at least for the 3 levels I played (long ones), I haven\u00b4t encountered stability errors or bugs so far. \nThe assets used are clearly basic ones and the developers told me that for example, the skeletons are placeholders for better enemies to be developed.\n\nSo, besides not having many levels yet, the assets could be improved a lot. But, the game itself is already fully playable and I enjoyed it playing it like many TD I played...only with the VR twist of being there.\nHere is a video showing gameplay before EA was released: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSD24orq5fY\n\nSo, so far the game is incomplete, but really promising and enjoyable so far, I have to recommend it to you. \n\nI will also follow the development of the product and I really hope to see it evolving already with more content.\nI will update this review over time to see how good it gets...or not.

And its free!\n\nSo what is this game? Well, its of course a tower defence game.\n\nSo what makes this different than all of the other out there for VR? Well..\n\nIts a tower defence game at it heart, but like many oither VR TD games, you are in first person the whole time, Not just when using abilities. But you don't have to constantly be in first person mode shooting everything else yourself. You are not the main weapon (unless you want to be) which is refreshing. Too many TD games i have tried in VR focus too much on you being the main tower. This games gives you the option, \n\nThe method of giving you the option is that you can level up your towers back at homebase, OR you can level up your weapons, Or you can balance it and go for both.\n\nThe only negative i can see in this games so far (i have completed 2 of 4 maps so far) is that its a bit too easy. I'm a big TD fan, and found the highest difficulty (insane?) to be what i would class as \"normal\" difficulty in most other games.\n\nBut this does open the game up to newbies to the TD genre, and Newbies to VR also. So it kinda hits the mark for everyone.\n\nIt looks like the dev has left room to add new maps (which i would be happy to pay a small price for), and there appears to be a tower that is due to be released in the future (unless i simply have not unlocked it yet).\n\nWhat i would like to see is even harder difficulty levels. And it would be cool if the buzz saw frisbees sliced through multiple targets, and maybe even returned like a boomerang.\n\nAll in all, its free! and its a damned fine game for what it is. I'm going to be keeping an eye on this dev, and can see myself coming back to this game over and over for my TD fix in VR. \n\nYou should too!", "timestamp_created": 1516450715, "timestamp_updated": 1516450715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39469399": {"recommendationid": "39469399", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972090300", "num_games_owned": 987, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 286, "last_played": 1516448190}, "language": "english", "review": "I really hope you guys are using this as a testbed for a kick*** version of the same type of game.

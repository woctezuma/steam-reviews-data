The sad truth is that it is a rare occasion when you will find other players to play a match with because most VR gamers are playing newer shooters like Pavlov.

If the player-base picks up (from people like you giving it a chance) then this game has a second chance at life. I often check to see if other people are playing and will gladly jump into a match if I see an open lobby. I will also randomly play a few bot matches to see if any players will jump in, which does happen on occasion.\n\nI recommend downloading it, especially if you see it on sale!

A tear-jerker is forthcoming![/b] I paid for this game at 15$ when I got my Vive last year. This was the first MP shooter many of us played, and we were awestruck the first time we played it VR. I joined the Battle Dome chorizzo party when you could still team kill, and those were the good ol days of this game. My vive still had that plastic smell, and I was freaking out from joy 3 minutes into my first play. It went downhill from there from random updates and features, and a continued lack of polish to the aesthetic finally did get to be too much. The developer needed help, and probably could have found some.\n\nEverything seemed great! The graphics were garbage, but nobody cared, because but the gameplay was fun! I remember playing this game at my old apartment and ducking behind the walls, and shooting the other people, and it was a great multiplayer team battle, even though we were all just blue and red blobs! [u]I loved the teleportation idea it employed at the beginning)[/u]. You had to shoot goo from these guns to make areas where your team could teleport too and advance along the battlefield, and it added a nice teamplay dynamic. That WAS an excellent idea before it was removed/relegated. [i]This idea needs to be refactored into a fps/rts team deathmatch hybrid game. Someone please copy the original Battle Dome essence and actually make this game correctly![/i]\n\nBefore long, the earnest, lone developer keep adding random features, modes and spread everything out over multiple levels, and had no real direction or vision, and it became a ghost town with nobody playing and a soup of different lobbies. You now locomote in different ways. [i]At one point, non-vr support was going to be added. What?[/i] You wouldn't believe how many different gun models there are. It certainly makes hanging out in the lobby a bit more interesting. It's actually quite impressive and seems to hint that maybe Mr. Gooseman is just filling up the project with content before some focused Deus Ex Machina of a consolidation that makes it so there will be people playing, but it's out of early access, so I guess not.\n\nI got my $14.99 worth I think. I played it early enough to be fond of it and have some good memories. It's a labor of love, clearly, and the developer is learning alot and getting good at game development, but maybe not game design. Battle Dome's scope became so large that it is some kind of test bed for the developer to make about a half dozen shooter experiences. The zeitgeist is now Pavlov VR, which has players and is five dollars cheaper. [spoiler]Seriously, somebody needs to make a huge, gorgeous map, with support for lots of players, and we shoot teleportation goo, and build structures and shoot guns at each other.

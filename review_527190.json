Ever since I watched the anime Spice and Wolf. To say this review could be a little biased would be an understatement, but at the same time I think if I hadn't read or watched Spice and wolf, this game would still at least be a 9/10\n\nThe entire series as a whole has been a rollercoaster, with it's most impressive bit being the character development. In this final episode the characters own arcs and convictions really shine, and the result of their development blossoms in ways that really moved me to tears.\n\nThe story itself, the narrative contents and the themes shine. Although it can be a little bit of a grind to work through all the economics, it certainly provded a lot of insight into investment as a whole. To note, the themes of investment are based upon the author's own experience and knowledge in the field so it certainly has credibility if you are looking for that kind of realism. The bredth of the writers knowledge in market crisis is quite educational. Although there is some critiscism that economics hasn't progressed all that far compared to the norm of the present day. But hey, I don't know much about economics so I couldn't really tell.\n\nThe art is a huge goodie. Though it's lacking on content, the CG's accompanied with scenes can be very powerfull and provide the mood very well. It certainly was much like watching a drama, except I was projecting my hallucinations onto a 2D still.\n\nThe music is some funky sheeeeeet! I can't describe it much more than that. It's wonderfully made, with one or two exceptions, the majority of tracks will make you forget they are even on repeat.\n\nI bought the entire set of games individually for \u00a330 pounds. I've gotten at least thirty hours out of them all accumilated, and I'm a very fast reader. I would say after it all, yes it was worth it for me. It may be for you, but always be on the look out for deals. I'd suggest buying the first one at full price if you aren't confident, rather than jumping into the full bundle discount. From there if you like it, buy the bundle which will give you a good discount on the sequels, and then enjoy.\n\n#LeGoffBestGirl", "timestamp_created": 1509740959, "timestamp_updated": 1509740959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35967621": {"recommendationid": "35967621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020271508", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508853944}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10, investment certainly paid off.", "timestamp_created": 1508854112, "timestamp_updated": 1508854112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35763456": {"recommendationid": "35763456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018265822", "num_games_owned": 1718, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508121799}, "language": "english", "review": "Now that the trilogy has been completed I can safely say this is a must read/play for any fan of Spice and Wolf.

I was a little confused when I first started the game; I was hoping it would continue right where vol 2 left off, since that game was really heating up when it stopped short of reaching a conclusion.  Alas, this game tells you what happened after that, but it's done in explanation format rather than letting you really experience it.  Instead of direct continuation of vol 2's plot line, this game sets up a new high-stakes plot which, after it is properly set up, had me on the edge of my seat, just like the first 2 installments.  The ending of the game didn't leave me feeling let down, or that there was more that needed to be explained, and while the main character still has much to accomplish in his life, I don't feel that there will be any more games in this series.  \n\nJust like the last 2 games, I learned about some economic concepts I wasn't aware of, and they were explained in enough detail for me to understand them in the context of the game, without going in-depth enough to feel like an expert in the subject.  The music and art were of great quality that's pretty comparable to volume 2.

In the end, I think it has a satisfying ending, leaving no loose ends (although I would have obviously preferred (spoilers) [spoiler]Hal to end with Eleanor, even if it was obvious that he'd end with Hagana[/spoiler]).\n\nThe novel improves more on the technical aspects compared to episode.02, with more and better music, graphics and FX.

After many delays and setbacks it was finally released and while I would consider this an unfinished product it was still well worth the wait. \n\nNow the owner and manager of a rather prominent fund on the moon we follow Hal as he endeavours to reach his dream of exploring an untrodden land. In the conclusion to the trilogy I feel like the author has finally managed to find the right mix of story-telling and economics. While the first episode and for the most part the second focused almost entirely on the exchange of stocks, the final episode covers many other areas such as real estate, the role and workings of banks, and the effects of inflation. Throughout the series music is used to great effect in many scenes and this episode was no exception. I find that music is the best addition that VNs offer and was happy that the soundtrack for this episode fit especially well when compared to the previous two.\n\nAs I mentioned at the start of the review this game still feels rather unfinished. To start with there are many translation errors and could seriously use a good editing. Fortunately these errors did not detract from the story but could still be distracting at times. The biggest issue I had however, and this applies equally to the second episode, is that the game engine used is complete and utter garbage. I experienced a number of different crashes when trying to take screenshots, open the overlay, or enter CG mode. And the worst part about this engine is that there is no way to scroll back the text. So on occasion when I clicked too soon my only options were to fill using my own thoughts or to reload a save.\n\nAll in all I still greatly enjoyed this trilogy and look forward to reading it again hopefully on the Vita if that release ever makes it out.", "timestamp_created": 1499064371, "timestamp_updated": 1499065465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33055875": {"recommendationid": "33055875", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975674670", "num_games_owned": 2464, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499116684}, "language": "english", "review": "can you even call this a game? 0% engagement needed!", "timestamp_created": 1498856872, "timestamp_updated": 1498856872, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.303020", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32972709": {"recommendationid": "32972709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071761252", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498710593}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than the anime, C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control.

review the series finale as well... Well... It's over, at least. \n\nHere is a breakdown of my review - [i]Spoiler Alert[/i]\n\n[b]Stock Market Information - 9/10[/b]\n\nI learned quite a few details that I did not know before, regarding Market Derivatives and Securities.\n\n[b]Music - 7/10[/b]\n\nMusic is similar to Vol1 and Vol2, well done, well timed, but not special.\n\n[b]Art Design - 8/10[/b]\n\nArt seems to have taken a step back from Vol2, but is still pretty good for this type of VN.\n\n[b]Story/Taste in waifus - 1/10[/b]\n\nStory makes no sense; there are plenty of resources on the moon. I mean, mankind has a goddamn space elevator in this story, we can easily mine lunar ice, lunar He3 can be exported to Earth for hilarious profits, and lunar regolith (mostly sillicon/iron oxides) is a fairly decent 3D printer material for non-perishable bulk goods. Hell, you can manufacture PV panels by the ton and export clean power to Earth. \n\nWhat do you mean there's no reason to stay on the Moon other than low taxes?\n\nHow would the Moon compete with low-tax nations that already exist on Earth? Look at Singapore... It's basically the same success story as WEE, except that it's based on an island on Earth instead of needing a bajillion credits for a space elevator (or even more horrendously expensive - rocketry) to colonize.\n\nEven more enraging is the MC's taste in waifus. Hagana basically nuked the Lunar (and global) economy because she thought Hal was in love with Eleanor. What. The. Fuck.\n\n[i]And she continues her shittiness even after he throws away $30 billion in cash [b](and his dream to explore Mars)[/b] just for the chance to talk to her.[/i]\n\nEleanor had some incredibly moving character growth in Vol2, and decided to help Hal find his love after he rejected her. Holy shit.\n\nChris took care of Hal when he was crippled, and is now driven and strong willed individual that's about to take over the biggest Lunar Bank. It helps too that she's grown into a cutie as well.\n\nFuck, even Risa has a good case for Best Girl as well, but he has to pick the autistic girl that he thought cucked him with Barton.\n\nSeriously, I was so pissed I had to get up, punch the wall a few times, and take a few breaths before I could sit down and finish the series.\n\nUnfortunately, the story is the most important part of this kind of VN. As such, I cannot recommend the game.", "timestamp_created": 1494525573, "timestamp_updated": 1494528281, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.404707", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31407509": {"recommendationid": "31407509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199848653", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493350098}, "language": "english", "review": "Just pure awesomeness.

Welcome to the world's sweetest, most romantic explanation of the 2007 financial crisis.\n\n[b]Graphics: 8/10[/b]\n\nYet another improvement over its previous entry, albeit not as much as it was in turn over the first; character designs, backgrounds and CGs are all improved. Makes it somewhat jarring when screens from the first entry are used in flashbacks, but nothing too bad. Font handling doesn't play too well with the new in-game dictionary, though, but it's a minor point most of the time.\n\n[b]Sound: 8/10[/b]\n\nMuch better than its predecessor: still no voice acting but the music fits scenes much better, they flow into one another more smoothly, and I even found myself humming a couple once or twice. Full props here.\n\n[b]Story: 10/10[/b]\n\nLet's start with the worst: though they had been foreshadowed repeatedly throughout the entire series, some of the conflict on this volume still comes across as childish. I mean, seriously.\n\nBut the rest, oh boy the rest. This volume is just brilliant, hitting your emotions even harder than the previous two volumes, and it's all mixed with a deep, well researched class on economics. The author pulled no stops on this volume, and it shows: it's evident from the start it's building up to an analogue of the 2007 financial crisis, but manages to weave it tightly with its character drama: concepts such as securities, bonds and credit swaps are crucial in understanding what's going on, though the narrative often pauses to explain them using graphs and even an in-game dictionary; all while showing the emotional impact of such a crisis on people of all walks in life, both directly involved and mere victims of its consequences.\n\nA problematic point though is that it's over too soon; there's barely any denouement after the climax and, though sweet, the CGs that float during the credits offer very little emotional closure. There's no plot threads left hanging, mind you, it's just... you know.\n\n[b]Longevity: 7/10[/b]\n\nAs usual, it's a kinetic novel with no choices whatsoever; but, it is longer than the previous two volumes, taking me over 7 hours of reading time, and I'm itching to get back and read it all again from the start.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nA brilliant finale for a brilliant series, fantastic from start to end. Like its own characters, the series is never flawless but it's impossibly smart and has a lot of heart; in the end, I'm really happy to have come to know it, and I think you will too.

Let's get straight to the point: I do believe the third episode of WEE is worth your time and money if you've read and liked the other two episodes, but might not be worth it if you didn't enjoy any of the previous two episodes or [spoiler]if episode two was the only one you enjoyed because of your waifu Eleanor.[/spoiler]\n\nFrom an entertainment standpoint I have to say that I enjoyed this one less than the two previous ones and I would like to talk about the reasons for that. I admit it's been a while since I have read episodes one and two, so take any comparison between them and this one with the whole salt shaker. I also can\u2019t shake the feeling that I might\u2019ve missed a few points on the story, so take that into consideration when reading.\n\nThe first difference between episode three and the first and second episodes is character interaction. Understandably, most of the important characters in the other episodes have minor roles here because most of the time Hal is doing his own work, which isn\u2019t really related to such characters, although it is still a little disappointing that some interesting characters were shoved to the side. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t character development at all. Marco, a minor character from the second episode is present throughout the third one and proves to be a great support to Hal. We also see how confident Chris\u2019 growth and how far she has reached. My nitpick with it is that there are much less interaction compared to the other episodes and many of it is for the sake of the plot.\n\nThe second difference would be that the third episode is way WAY heavier on economics. Like, really heavy. I am pretty much a layperson on the matter, but I didn\u2019t have any trouble keeping up with the plot in the other two episodes, but there were various moments in the third one that the information was too much for me to process. Many technical terms are used and the novel even gives you a small summary explaining some of them, but it is still easy to get lost if you\u2019re not used to it. It\u2019s not a bad thing per se, but I didn\u2019t find it particularly enjoyable.\n\nThe third difference would be the plot progression and this is tied to the second point. Most of the episode is spent on economics talk and it might get tiring if you, like me, isn\u2019t too fond of it, but what I disliked the most is that there are too many passages where a character says something only for it to be a gateway for more technical explanation and for Hal to make a move. Minor spoiler ahead: [spoiler] Come on, if you\u2019ve read it you know I\u2019m talking about Eleanor. She went to meet Hal because the plot demanded he stayed on the Moon, so that was the only way for her to appear on the story to have that heartfelt talk with Hal and then disappear like that.[/spoiler]\n\nAnother complaint I have about episode three is the main conflict presented in the last part of the episode. Although its culmination is presented 4/5 into the story as a result of many other things which were shown throughout the story it felt like it came and went too quickly. It is mentioned in the story at some point that the solution might have some negative consequences, but it is left abstract how negative it would and it\u2019s further downplayed by the fact it isn\u2019t show to the reader the results of carrying on with what they came up with. I might be wrong, of course, but this was the point where I felt the author either got tired of the story or didn\u2019t know what to do with it anymore and just wanted to end it. \n\nThat brings me to my final complaint that is the lack of a proper epilogue for a proper closure to the story and what became of some things like the Housing Project, presented at the start of the story, Hal\u2019s own dream and some more.\n\nAll in all, I think this has been a worthy ride, with some disappointments here and there. It certainly could\u2019ve been more than what it was, but it has been great nonetheless. If you decide to read it, I hope you enjoy it as much if not more than I did.

With the economics of lunar city going out of control what is going to happen next?\n\nThoughts: After speeding through this last chapter of Hal's story I'm feeling Satisfied but also a little upset with Hasekura's pacing in the last chapter. I feel that the pace of the first two or three hours is too long without much character development to the story we left in Chapter 2. Even though I felt it was slow at parts, the way he ties up the loose ends around the two girls that liked Hal was done well and in line with how they were written as plot points. \n\nEven Hagana's main drama of the end was very true to her character even if I felt it was a little weak overall. Not having a small scene after the credits was a little sad. But the scenes during the credits tell most of the ending story and closure of Hal's dream. \n\nOn a side note, Not sure if Eagle was needed in the story at all. Guess he is there to show Hal's change in risk taking from the past 4 hrs compared to the young upcomers in the market.

The story here is another four years on from the previous episode (why four again? They seem to like the number four). This time, we are playing financial lecture with romantic subplot. Hal makes a big bet, wins big, things turn to crap and he chases after the girl he loves and we get a nice, happy, romantic ending. But, they really went full on this time with explaining how things work and even give definitions for some of the terms used. Why they didn't do that from episode one, I will never know. On top of that, they even give diagrams to show how some things work. Diagrams that simplify or break down how some of these investments work. Diagrams. DIAGRAMS. To me, putting diagrams in was wholly unnecessary because reading this you need at least a basic understanding of how these things work and because this is number three in the series, and you have almost certainly read one and two, I feel like everyone reading this has that. \n\nNew characters. Satia, Dr Wallace and Gazzanica. Satia is not a very interesting character and her character barely develops over the course of the story but despite this, she is fairly important. She is the lawyer in this story and she is referred to on a number of occasions. Dr Wallace is a grumpy old man nicknamed \"The King of Pessimism\" because he specialises in short selling and is apparently very good at it. He is a good friend to Hal (yes they changed his name back to Hal here but Lisa is still Risa because screw consistency) and rival in investing. There must have been some big event where he was given that nickname but we never really get much of his background story either. Gazzanica was briefly introduced in episode two as the feisty politician. He is now the president of the Lunar surface and Hal is a member of his financial advisory committee as \"Hero of the Lunar Surface\" for bringing down Avalon.\n\nNothing to note about artwork or music. It has barely changed. It is undoubtedly better than episode one, we even get some images reused from episode one as memories and you can definitely see a difference in the quality, but it is nothing major.\n\nTo wrap up this review and the series, while this was definitely a decent ending and I did enjoy it, I felt that they went a bit overboard with trying to explain things and that number two was definitely the peak of the series.

The plot devices he comes up to propel the story forward are simple and grounded -- which is why they are so good. \n\nThis volume is heavy on economic plots and terms. There was no time for us to see Hal or Chris' homes or rooms, for instance. Rooms and places (or lack thereof) were important in the first two volumes, so this omission is a testament to how the plot this time around is involved with the economy and the \"world.\" There was, indeed, lack of room. It's understandable, and all the economic issues do bring out character development, but I couldn't help thinking there was something missing.\n\nOne issue still left in Isuna Hasekura's writing is how randomly aggressive and impulsive the male protagonist becomes. This worked out very well for Hal when he was young, sure, but here, 8 years later and carrying the scars of his mistakes, it feels out of place. [spoiler]Hal grabs Hagana by the collar a little while after making up with her, even though he isn't even mad at her, and she would have every reason to react badly to this, but didn't. Lawrence in S&W nearly raped Holo in some alley, but she punched him to prevent it.

Read them in chronological order.\n\nLong review:\n\nWorld End Economica is a kinetic novel, meaning that unlike many other visual novels, it doesn't include choices. The drawback to this approach is that, as other reviews have stated, you can't choose the ending you want to see. The great strength of this approach, however, is that it allows the author to tell exactly the one true story that they wanted to share from the start.\n\nWEE succeeds at this flawlessly, using fantastic characterization and world building to tell an absorbingly realistic tale of human greed, suffering, determination, and love. Not the narrow sort of love you find in many other visual novels, but love in all its forms: Love of another person, both requited and unrequited; love of one's friends and the desperate need for their support when everything goes wrong; love for one's home, birthplace and identity; love for dreams and the struggle to attain them. WEE even manages to paint a convincing tale of how easy it is to fall in love with money and the safety money brings, and that this isn't necessarily wrong to feel.\n\nThe art in episode 3 has improved from episode 1. It never quite reaches the top tier of VN quality, but art is not and never was the main draw for this series. The lack of vocals could be seen as a downside, since many visual novels bank on talented voice actors to sell the story to the reader, but it never really feels as if vocals are \"missing\" from WEE. Rather it feels like other VNs tend to use vocals to make up for other things that they lack, which isn't necessary here. It's truly more like a brilliant novel with pictures than something halfway to a movie, which works well for this sort of deep story and dense conversations.\n\nIf you have absolutely no interest in the world of finance and investing, it may be hard to follow some of the dialogue and concepts, but even then you can find value in the human side of the story. If you do enjoy finance, this is absolutely the game for you.

Be warned though, there's a lot of economics terminology that may fly over your head, but even if you don't understand a lot of the terms the underlying story is always easy enough to follow that it shouldn't be a real issue. In fact, it may even interest you. At the very least you're bound to learn something about stocks and the economy.\n\nUnlike the first two games this one, as it should being the finale, comes to an incredibly satisfying conclusion wrapping up all loose ends that have gathered over the course of the first two. Also, unlike the first two, the pacing is faster but steadier and the story beats build up and actually reach satisfying conclusions throughout the adventure, rather then a majority of the plot transpiring rapidly near the end, which were the biggest issues the first two had. \n\nThe main reason the story ended up so tight this time though is because it picks up all those dropped story beats from previous titles, and most of the character development and growth was accomplished in the previous games. This ended up allowing the characters to perform their best, no more punk kid or traumatized young adults, and for the story to focus solely on telling this final epic that was heavily inspired by the 2007 housing market crash.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]The best story of all three games\n[*]The characters shine brighter than ever (though a lot of the cast got much less screen time than in previous entries)\n[*]The soundtrack is very solid\n[*]The art is as good as its ever been\n[*]I actually understood all of the stock concepts this time\n[*]A GREAT ending to the trilogy\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Spelling errors are still present throughout\n[/list]\n\nThat's really the only con.

The writing, visuals, and sounds work harmoniously to bring a unique experience. The problem is that this episode feels a bit rushed. Events feel forced and some character's decisions are not explained. Because of that the conclusion feels a bit forced. This is, in my opinion, a fault of the writer Hasekura. He had some forced endings in some of his other titles, Billionaire Girl being the most obvious one.... which is a shame really because he is a very good writer.\n    The art assets are simple but beautiful. The character designs are average.\n\nFunctionality:\n\n    It has all the features expected from a kinetic novel (hide text, skip functionality, autoplay etc.).\n    There are no major glaring spelling mistakes, illogical phrasings or flaws in the narrative structure (some inconsistencies are continued from \"episode\" 2, for example, Lisa from \"episode\" 1 is still called Risa).\n    At the moment (24.12.2016) there is no Steam Overlay functionality.\n\nEnjoyment:\n\n    Overall I enjoyed this novel, in spite of the rushed ending and somewhat forced events. I really enjoyed Hal's reunion with a certain character (it is not a spoiler if they show it in the Cover Art, is it?!?). In spite of its flaws (and the hard road walked by the whole series) WWE episode 03 is still fun.\n\nConclusion:\n\n    World End Economica Episode.03 is an ok conclusion to a good story. It was a bit short (finished reading it in 4 hours) and rushed but for fans of the series, it is well worth it.\n\nOther notes:\n\n    None at the moment.", "timestamp_created": 1482598408, "timestamp_updated": 1496521980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28600751": {"recommendationid": "28600751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032451982", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482595808}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are anything like me, you were waiting for the final episode of this wonderful visual novel with bated breath.

I can understand why, since there really were a ton of intricacies regarding the complex story that they just couldn't let any extra time be wasted, but then again this is a visual novel and could've definitely run longer if needed.  \n\nMoving past all that negative stuff, I just want to say that I personally adored the overarching narrative.  Even beyond all of the economics (which were great), I loved watching the characters grow over the course of the eight years that the entire series takes place.  Episode 3 shows the growth of Hal and co., via the culmination of all of the gains and losses that he and his friends have been through.  Compared to the first, and even the second games, it's clear to see how much more experienced and mature he has become, yet you can't help but feel like he's still the same kid from the first game. The appearances from characters from the first and second game also help give this episode an almost nostalgic atmosphere at times, and the worldbuilding itself was quite believable and enticing.  \n\nDespite it not being perfect (but really what is?) , WEE ep3. is an excellent conclusion to the trilogy.  It might not satisfy everyone, whether it be the story not suiting your tastes or Hal not picking your favourite love interest, but aside from that, WEE ep3. is a mature and often times thought provoking visual novel and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something with a bit more serious tone, in love with numbers, investing, or enjoy following people chasing their dreams.\n\nJust be sure to start at the episode 1 for those who may stumble on this review first.\n\n----\nPersonal notes:  I totally almost cried at least once.

This isn\u2019t the case with World End Economica. It\u2019s a thinly veiled recreation of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, told with a level of attention to detail that requires more knowledge and research than you\u2019d expect from your average visual novel. This is also a love story. But it takes up so little of the actual word count, that you better be on board for the economic drama, or you\u2019ll have a miserable time. \n\nThis is the third episode, so by now you should know what to expect from this series. Everything from the characterization, production values, to the pacing are all of the same quality as the past two episodes. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll turn out to be everything you hoped, but it is in large part exactly what you think it is.\n\nI would\u2019ve played the entirety of episode 3 in a single sitting, had I not started playing it too late in the evening for that to be feasible. The story keeps a good forward momentum between scenes, making it hard to stop reading. Many key moments hinge on characters and reader understanding how economic instruments work. This creates a dangerous balance, where the story has to make the jargon easy enough to understand quickly, and not dumb it down to the point where the characters don\u2019t act as smart as they\u2019re purported to be. There\u2019s a built-in glossary this time, but at the time of writing, it isn\u2019t translated yet. This will apparently be fixed with a patch. This isn\u2019t a critical feature, as characters still go to some length to explain terminology in the script itself. So the glossary seems to have been added afterwards, and not something you have to wait for in order to understand what\u2019s going on.\n\nI\u2019m not an economist, but everything you see in the story feels correct, authentic in its portrayal. Some of the events in the story are a bit too on the nose, with how they borrow from the 2008 crisis. But in most parts, it\u2019s believable. Using the subprime mortgage crisis as a basis for the story was a good idea, because it\u2019s an economic scenario that has aged well. Ie, it\u2019s likely to happen again, with how China is going through its own housing bubble. When you get to \u201clive\u201d the crisis like this through a story, you get a better understanding for the emotional rationalizations that made it happen, and how it\u2019ll happen again. Putting human faces behind the companies, governments and the people on the ground, living through the build-up and collapse makes it more tangible than it is just sitting at home, watching news anchors panic.\n\nThere\u2019s three great criticisms I can level against World End Economica. First off, it\u2019s not particularly good sci-fi. All the economic drama portrayed in episode 3 is stuff directly based off recent real world events. It was the same in the first two episodes. This isn\u2019t how the economy will run when we have a moon colony, as we will have moved to a system beyond our current imagination. I feel it\u2019s reasonable to expect something more visionary from sci-fi. I wouldn\u2019t know how to begin to write such a story, so I\u2019m actually fine with what we\u2019ve got here. But it\u2019s an easy thing to point out as a problem. The second thing is how characterization is packed into info heavy scenes. At times it comes across as desperate, like someone \u201cpuffing out their surprisingly developed chest\u201d, before continuing a deep dive explanation of how credit default swaps work. Like witnessing a mashup of Frontline and harem anime. Dissonant is how I\u2019d describe it.\n\nThe third and final criticism is the most damning one. This is the one that affected me the most. The ending feels cut short. I wanted something more indulgent, I wanted an epilogue. There\u2019s 7 bits of CG that roll over the end credits, showing scenes I would\u2019ve liked to have seen play out as full scenes instead. This isn\u2019t nearly as bad as Final Fantasy XV, but it just chose to end at a spot where I felt like there was something missing, which we\u2019re forced to fill in with our imagination by looking at pictures. It took the wind out of the finale, because up until that point, it was doing everything I wanted.\n\nBut overall, this is still very good. Time flew effortlessly as I read, and it was nice to see the story pay off on what it had spent three titles building up to. Anyone who enjoyed the first two will have a good time with this for sure. And maybe you\u2019ll be more forgiving of the ending. I just feel like there was maybe 30-60 minutes missing there in the end. Just a bit more, and we would\u2019ve had complete closure. So close!

Been waiting for this for what? 2 or so years? This visual novel isn't just interesting but deep in thought as well. Econ was never one of my strong suits but with this game you get a taste of the risk and reward of the stock market. Not to bash on other vn's but very few provide a serious narrative that takes itself seriously. WEE doesn't dumb itself down for the reader although the 3rd game provides hints in the way of highlighted terms (as of this post of the release of the game aren't translated, newcomers be aware). With that in mind I'd recommend buying the trilogy to get a full exprience. \n\nOnly Complaints? There are no voice overs so it does feel a bit detracting from the normal vn formula. Don't get me wrong the writing is incredible and the characters are memorable, but this game deserves at least character grunts or something! \n\nBesides that the music is awesome and the art style is greatly improved this game! I recommend this game to anyone interested in economics, but also anybody who likes a good character building story (think wolf of wall street but in reverse and it's done in space and the characters are more enjoyable, basically, play it!)", "timestamp_created": 1482369490, "timestamp_updated": 1482369603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 122, "total_negative": 5, "total_reviews": 127}}

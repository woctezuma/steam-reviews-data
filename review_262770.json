You're a prisoner who has been let out of your cell and you can receive pardon if you can escape the tower without dying.\n\nThe game has great visual language in terms of letting you know exactly how you need to jump and fall without dying, and the challenge of course is controlling the character in that way. Which is easier than it sounds of course, because although the controls are really tight, the challenge is in timing and spacing to avoid spikes, fire, and other hazards.\n\nI also like all the graffiti written on the walls. This princess isn't your typical cutesy damsel in distress, she's actually sadistically entertained by you and other prisoners who try to get out of the tower alive. Her messages are scrawled all across the levels to mock you and poke fun at you, and there's just something about it that makes you wanna get out of the tower faster so you can kick her in the twat for being such a snooty bitch.\n\nIn an endearing kid of way of course...\n\nHighly recommend it.

The mechanics are tight, each level presents multiple challenges (time, score, survivability), and the game is robust; these are the basics. The secret sauce in Freedom Fall is personality: the game has unique character, and it comes through in the storytelling and humor, both subtle and overt. Additionally, the game has seen solid support since release, with new features, levels, and challenges added, and various issues fixed.

There are a few \"descend the tower\" games on Steam but this one in particular stood out for me as more well polished graphics wise. Freedom Fall is probably one of the easier ones once you get the hang of it but I enjoyed playing a few times. Despite the entire game being played out in a castle tower there was a lot of environment diversity. Each set of stages felt like a different location from the gardens to the aqueducts. Since you play through the stages quickly no stage ever gets stale. \n\nThe story is told by the princesses' writings on the walls. As you descend she'd leave you notes either berating you or talking about her family. It was all very lighthearted and funny to read as you descended the tower. For a character we race a few times and meet at the end of the game her personality really shone through her writing. And while the 3 endings aren't terribly different from each other the replay value that this game has is based on the layer challenges of time trial, no death count and most cogs collected. \n\nUsually the game provides you with a 'hard' and 'easy' path to follow integrated into your journey so you only need to choose which path to travel. For an even easier play there are 3 accessories you can purchase This is also a game where achievements add a second layer of replay ability. Can you get through the game without buying anything, or how about no deaths ever? These are just a few of the challenges achievements that add value.

The characters are in chibi style and can please those who like the cutie style. The scenarios are also beautiful, though repetitive. The animations are well done and are suitable to the movements. This style of art remotely reminds me of Braid game at times.\n\nThe sound of the game is suitable. There is nothing else in the music score or sound effects but there are no errors. Everything is very simplified but adequate.\n\nThe gameplay is a basic platform game: Jump on the spot, collect items and escape from traps and spikes. The difference is that the levels are towards the bottom. Always down. There are one or another stage which unwinds laterally. The movements are adequate, but I felt the pace of the game a little slow, especially if you compare with other games that also develop down. The sense of gravity is a little scattered.\n\nThe best of the game, really, are the scribblings and graffiti on the walls that guide us and lead us through the history of the game. The Princess texts are fun and inspired at times. Freedom Fall is a good game that should have corrected some flaws that would make a spectacular game.\n\n\nSome criticisms:\nThe game should be higher. You will finalize it quickly, no doubt. The game should be harder, faster too. The scenarios could be more varied, even in the case of a dungeon! There could be more characters. The game should have more items (there are three).\nThe game is good but it\u2019s should be better.\n\n\nArt: 6/10\t\tSound: 6/10 \t\tGameplay: 6/10 \t\tFun: 5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1473047113, "timestamp_updated": 1473047113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502633", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24151809": {"recommendationid": "24151809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062916650", "num_games_owned": 1075, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467699786}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um bom jogo de plataforma, pequeno mas no tamanho certo para que n\u00e3o ficasse repetitivo.\nA hist\u00f3ria n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada de mais, mas fiquei sempre lendo o que estava escrito nas paredes da torre, um jeito muito legal de manter contato com o jogador e ir contando a hist\u00f3ria.\nFases muito bem feitas e com uma dificuldade num n\u00edvel que n\u00e3o vai te fazer perder os cabelos mas que ainda assim oferece um desafio.\n", "timestamp_created": 1467876934, "timestamp_updated": 1467876934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23860488": {"recommendationid": "23860488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041512403", "num_games_owned": 1305, "num_reviews": 918, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469256324}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uacf5\uc8fc\uc640 \uc18c\ub144\uc758 \uacbd\uc8fc.\n\n\ud0d1\uc5d0 \uac07\ud788\uac8c \ub41c \uc18c\ub144\uc740 \ud0c8\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub2ec\ub9b0\ub2e4.\n\ubb34\uc11c\uc6b4 \ubfd4, \ud1b1\ub2c8\ubc14\ud034, \ubd88\uc744 \ubfdc\ub294 \uc7a5\uce58 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uace0\n\ub098\uc0ac\uc640 \ubd80\ud488\uc744 \ubaa8\uc544\uc11c \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uc7a5\ube44\ub97c \ud68d\ub4dd\ud55c\ub2e4.\n\n\uacf5\uc8fc\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac\uae30 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub3c4 \ud558\uace0, \uc0c1\uc5b4\ub97c \ud53c\ud574 \ud5e4\uc5c4\uce58\uace0,\n\ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uc774\uc0c1\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\uc5d0\uac8c \ud3ed\ud0c4\uc744 \ub358\uc838 \uc2b9\ub9ac\ud558\uba74 \ud0d1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0c8\ucd9c\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4.\n\n\uc810\ud504 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uac00 \ub204\ub978 \ubc29\ud5a5\ud0a4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub6f8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74 \uc88b\uaca0\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1467031701, "timestamp_updated": 1497256450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23816932": {"recommendationid": "23816932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024441646", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464055842}, "language": "english", "review": "Freedom Fall is a fun little game.

traps ( can piss you off near the end ).\n-graphicly it's really well done, cute 2D/3D drawing art style graphics.\n-the gameplay resemble to POP 4, platforming your way around the tower and avoiding traps (parkour ,jumping from wall to wall...ect ).\n- sound effect and music are really good and enjoyable but no voice acting and the story is narrated as graphitis on the walls\n-no bugs or glitches, can be very hard for some people,and you got easy achievements + cards\nrecommend it to platform lovers and pop fans ( worth the money but you can always get it on sales)\n8/10\n",

It sounds weird, but it's true. I don't want to spoiler too muc h - the princess who's taken you captive will communicate with you using paintings on the tower's wall - she tells about her life, family, best friend, while mocking you for being a prisoner who probably dies soon, has no friends (so she draws you a cockroach to have at least one pet :) ) - the princess actually has a great character - mix a naive, childish personality with the role of a princess - she kills the to-be-husbands she doesn't like without mercy, even joking about their attempts to escape the tower - while also writing things like she's having tea parties with her best friend (who happens to be a DRAGON).  And you're not invited.  Hmpf.   The game also features a checkpoint system, and this was a huge surprise - the game's story includes the checkpoints, the way you respawn at checkpoints are included in the game's narrative. The game's platforming is really fair and nicely done, but the story, and the way the game tells the backstory to the player is the most outstanding point of the game. If you're intrested in it and don't mind slight cute spoilers, check out the screenshots at the community hub, people created tons of screenies from the best paintings :)\n\n  The game consists 14 + 1 bonus levels, and plays like older platformer games - you collect bolts instead of coins, which can be used to buy a granades (can destroy some traps/objects to help progress )parachute, dragon wings to allow double jump and a hoverboard that's more like hoverboards should look like.  There are no enemies in the game besides two bossfights, but each and every level is filled to the brim with traps. Swinging axes, rotating spears, spikes, bladed wheels, bouncing huge explosive balls, mechanical venus fly traps, spiked chains and lightning. While this sounds overwhelming, the game really often divides the tower into an easy, and a hard side, so if you're not really up for a challenge or just want to finish the level in the fastest way, you can always choose the easy path every time. To balance things out, choosing the hard path will reward you more collectible bolts and ocassionally granades, if you want to collect the most possible bolts, choosing hard paths is kind of mandatory.\n  Speaking about shortest time and collectible bolts -The game is quite short, it can be completed under 2-3 hours for the first time.\n\nBut each and every level has a par value for shortest time, less deaths and most collected bolts. While all three can be done theoretically at the same time, it requires a lot of practice - but as it can be done one by one, it makes the challenge (and getting the perfect game achievement)  easier to get, while providing some extra gameplay time with distinctive goals. The game also has an achievement for finishing the story without dying - this is a little hasslework as you need to restart the actual level after dying (the game could use a hardcore mode which automatically restarts for you), this also requires a separate run. Every game can be speedrun in less than 3-3.5 minutes - considering one plays the game for fun, then for no death / collecting bolts / speedrunning (these can be done in level selection mode) - and the fact that there's three achievements which require three different ending of the story, the gameplay time can easily stretch into 5-10 hours for achievement hunters.\n\nPersonally I really enjoyed the game - I usually have low expectations, so I thought it will be an arcade-ish platformer with questionable platforming and randomgeneration, but instead got a solid platformer with great level design, easy and harder paths, a charming story and a really unique way to get to know that story - it may not be the greatest platformer of all times, but it's a really solid one, and I'm glad I picked this up in a bundle and played it.\nPrice-wise I would recommend it during a deeper sale (lowest price so far:5\u20ac) or from a bundle if you're not not into getting all achievements - while the story is good, 9\u20ac is too much for a single gameplay's time and content. The multiple endings and collectible \"on par\" goals can create a lot more content and gameplay time for player who love collecting achievements - I can recommend getting it at full price only for them (or to users who wish to support the developer).", "timestamp_created": 1453376165, "timestamp_updated": 1453383262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722469", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20364133": {"recommendationid": "20364133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119342164", "num_games_owned": 718, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452819956}, "language": "english", "review": "PLaytime is low/not representative because I also have this on iOS.\n\nI'm not usually keen on platformers, but this one, with its addictive falling mechanics, cute graphics, and wonderful storytelling through the scrawls of the Princess, has me hooked.

The platforming is excellent, with sliding, grabbing, the gadgets, and the traps. The game does a great job of being tough but not arbitratily setting times or forcing you to use trial and error and endless repetition of having to do a part perfectly, like how super meat boy does. I have to explain to derps that SMB is not how a platformer should be made as that doesn't take design skill, anyone can make a too hard level that you need to spend 20 minutes on and die 100 times and also set a stupid time limit for no reason. What takes skill is making a game that takes skill and not just repetition and memory. Also a game that is difficult and no walk in the park, but makes you feel like its your fault when you die and not the game makers. This game does a perfect job and nails it. There are some problems. The scoring at the end doesn't make sense as you lose points but you can't tell if you're losing cogs or not when you die. Also you can't see total cogs during level. The game is super short, around 1.5 hours, which is a major drawback. Also you run out of upgrades pretty soon so you collect gears for nothing, Only having 3 new things is kind of boring. Also the board does the exact same thing as the glider and isn't really any better, making it a waste for being the most expensive. The story is basically non-existant, and a bad idea to put it on the background in writing, as in a tough platformer with tons of traps where you are focused on not dying you will miss most of it as I did.

Man stirbt relativ oft und kommt am letzten Checkpoint, welche nicht weit auseinanderliegen, wieder raus. Ein paar Ideen sind jedoch ganz nett ausgefallen, wie die craftbaren Items, womit man langsam gleiten kann oder einen Doppelsprung machen kann. Diese hat man recht schnell alle erbaut aber die Schrauben(W\u00e4hrung) sind ja auch gleichzeitig Punkte.

Allgemein wirkt es sehr liebevoll gestaltet und wer ein Herz f\u00fcr Indies hat, sollte dieses Spiel spielen.\n\n\nWie in allen meinen Reviews poste ich auch hier meinen Let`s Play Kanal, in dem ich \u00f6fters mal \u00e4hnlich gute Indie Titel vorstelle: https://www.youtube.com/user/lightfire777\nAlternativ kannst du auch, wenn dir das Review gefallen hat,auch meiner Kuratorgruppe auf Steam folgen, um meine Reviews auch zu anderen Spielen zu bekommen: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Drakeschool", "timestamp_created": 1424380193, "timestamp_updated": 1477496140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552163", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14395412": {"recommendationid": "14395412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135835322", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423434479}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu court mais un jeu tr\u00e8s bon.\n\nGraphiquement, il n'y a l\u00e0 rien \u00e0 dire, c'est beau et bien anim\u00e9, la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 est d'autant plus appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e qu'elle est synonyme de nouveau gameplay.\nSur le plan sonore, on retiendra une musique sympathique en rapport avec le jeu qui intensifie l'action.\n\nJ'ai trouv\u00e9 que la hitbox du h\u00e9ros \u00e9tait cependant trop grosse par rapport au personnage, ce qui fait qu'on perd parfois alors qu'on ne touche aucun obstacle. \nLe jeu en lui m\u00eame est cependant tr\u00e8s bon et l'histoire \u00e9crite sur le mur est une id\u00e9e g\u00e9niale ! \nIl s'agit l\u00e0 d'un platformer en Die and Retry ce qui fait de ce jeu un jeu pas forc\u00e9ment dur, mais o\u00f9 la patience est de mise.\n\nC'est sur la dur\u00e9e de vie que \u00e7a p\u00eache, une fois termin\u00e9, on en veut encore...

It was one of those games in my library from all the games I've collected and thought to myself, \"I'll play this when I'm exhausted and don't need to concentrate.\" Buuuut it ended up taking my full attention. It's definitely tough, but has this flow about it that just kept me playing. The craftable powerups are actually good\u2014one of which, the wings, I think would make speedrunning very interesting. The soundtrack, rock and hip hop influenced, is really good. The graphics are fucking beautiful.\n\nIt did only take 2 hours to beat the game on Hard including the extra level, but with the intention of 100%ing it, I'd definitely say it has high replay value.\n\nSo, why the 9/10? [strike]Hitboxes are really inconsistent. Fire seems to have a hitbox far extending outside its graphic. Marsh (your little, silly faller) has extended feet hitboxes.

You may or may not get 10 hours out of it, which just depends on how you play games. Are you going to perfect it? Yeah, you'll get those hours. Are you going to play through it once and be done with it? Nah, you definitely won't get those hours.\n\nEither way, it's a fantastic game and a great port [i](from mobile, if that wasn't clear from the gameplay)[/i].\n\nEDIT: Figured I'd elaborate on what makes it a good port:\n+ No low FPS cap\n+ Custom keyboard controls\n+ Fluid graphics which don't degrade at higher resolutions\n\nEDIT 2: So I went back and perfected the game. I think there are 3 secret achievements or something? There's a guide in the community hub if you're looking to complete it. So, the 4 other runs I did after my original run made me realize the hitbox issue is strictly for fire. There's just so much huge-hitbox fire in the final levels.

I've seen this game in at least two bundles, and that's where I recommed you buy it, as Freedom Fall is simply too short for $10.  However, a massive quantity doesn't mean all the games are bad, in fact I'd argue Freedom Fall is one of the better games you can find in the Indie game scene.\n\nI just beat it a few minutes ago so the game is still fresh in my mind.  Although I remember frustrating parts and an akward jump glitch in the beginning of the game, what really sticks out is the story.  Specifically the writing on the wall that you will be reading from the beginning of the game to the end - that's why I wanted to continue playing and ended up beating the game in one sitting.  Of course if you want to know what happens go and play the game, but basically your character is imprisoned in a castle for a supposed crime and the princess of the king and queen is a psychotic b!tch who installed all kinds of traps and spikes into an escape route.  If you can escape then you are granted freedom.\n\nGameplay is basic platforming, jumping, double jumping, hovering with use of tools you buy from collecting bolts and screws, Ratchet and Clank / Megaman and Bass style.  You'll find \"shops\" throughout and you'll buy the stuff you need early on in the game.  In fact I wonder what the point of the whole system is, you get the stuff so early that you won't need the currency bolts later on, it just seems kind of pointless, they may as well have started you with the tools.  You do have a weapon by using bombs (they're more like mini-grenades) that will destroy some traps if you so wish.  But, I'd advise against using it because there are parts where the bombs are mandatory and I don't remember them being on hand anywhere.  The levels do change up the style with you going through some watery levels, fire levels, and what was the most unique was a metallic-plant level, a \"garden.\"  There are boss fights as well as an easy final boss fight with the aforementioned psychob!itch.\n\nEvery level has what I call the Angry Birds rating system, that is to say, three things you have to accomplish to fully beat every level.  I didn't three-star any of the levels but then again I played it on hard mode.  Although it does lenghen the game unquestionably, I still wish there were more levels as the game felt short on one playthrough.  You can beat it in like three hours, my time currently says four but that's because I left the computer on doing not nerdy things!\n\nSo anyway, yes, play this game, I will come back to it another time to try and complete the Angry Birds rating system!  But be warned, I COULD NOT get a controller to work with this game.  I do not have a Xbox 360 controller (I know, I must be stupid or crazy how dare I) and instead have a generic joypad.  That wasn't compatible so I tried Joy2Key and I swear the game just wants you to use a keyboard no matter what, the buttons responded but the directions, including the D-Pad and joysticks, just didn't do anything.  That's kind of a crime for a game that requires precision platforming, don't you think?

Your only chance to see the light of day again is to make your way down the tower while avoiding to die by the loads of flaming, spiking, buzzing and exploding traps and machineries, that the slightly crazy Princess has decorated the tower with.\n\n[b][u]STORY[/u][/b]\nThe story is presented in a pretty cool way: There aren't any actual dialogues that distract you from the actual gameplay but instead the Princess communicates with you through writings on the tower walls (she is mute, anyway :p). The press describes it as a \"reverse Rapunzel story\" because you actually have to get away from the Princess instead of saving her. While fitting, there's also an inarguable similarity to Portal - if GlaDOS would be a medieval Princess who likes dragons. The basic idea of the \"Escape-to-Freedom\"-theme also reminded me a bit of the movie Running Man. \n\n[b][u]HUMOR[/u][/b]\nThe game has an absolutely great sense of humour, which is both cute and cynical. It's subtle enough to not make you feel like you NEED to laugh or chuckle now - you just do because it's genuinely funny without trying to hard. Charming all the way through.\n\n[b][u]VISUALS[/u][/b]\nVisually, the game looks great and thankfully isn't another wannabe-retro 8-bit mess. All the art in the game is hand-drawn by concept artist Lisa Rye and has a colorful and vibrant feel to it. Especially Marsh and the Princess look absolutely awesome.\n\n[b][u]GAMEPLAY[/u][/b]\nAs a nice change from the typical sidescrolling platformers, the gameplay is all about getting to the bottom of the tower. To do so, you have to utilize gadgets like bombs, gliders, double jumps or hover boards, which you can unlock by purchasing them for cogs and bolts that you have to collect throughout the levels. Unfortunately, the levels don't really vary in terms of gadget utilization, so you can effectively beat the game with the glider gadget only without ever touching the double jump or hover board gadget. A missed opportunity. \n\nIt's also sort of a precision platformer but due the relatively slow pace of the game (there aren't any visible timers or such that put you under pressure), it's not even remotely as stressful as, say, Super Meat Boy, so you can actually take your time and plan out the safest or most rewarding path downwards. There also are a few \"racing\" sections where you need to be fast, but they never get to the point where you feel like you need to be inhuman to beat them.\n\nDying is part of the game (I did so 206 times during my playthrough), so you will definitely get squashed, smashed, sliced, spiked, burned, bombed and electrocuted a lot, but thanks to the frequently placed checkpoints, it's not much of an annoyance and instead actually motivates you to just be better on your next try.\n\n[b][u]PLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITY[/u][/b]\nWith roughly 2 hours for my first playthrough, the game definitely is rather short and can be beaten in one sitting if you wish to do so. However, the game features multiple endings and while I don't know how much the story varies after the split points, this definitely adds quite a bit to the replayability because it gets you intrigued as to how the story unfolds towards another ending.\n\nAdditionally, if you're a fan of leaderboards, you can try to make it to the top by finishing levels under death/time or over cog par and unlock their respective achievements. A hard mode is also available, but I have yet to try it, so right now I can't really say what the difference between normal and hard is.\n\n[b][u]CONCLUSION[/u][/b]\nI've gotten this game through a bundle and while it didn't look like a must-play-right-now type of game to me, I went on and actually tried it - and I'm absolutely glad I did. It's refreshing, fun and fairly casual, yet challenging enough to not get boring, but ultimately it's the humour and the writings and drawings that kept me going on until the end.\n\nAt it's regular non-sale price (8,99\u20ac/\u00a36.99/$9.99) some people might consider the game overpriced for what few content it has to offer, so those people are probably better off waiting for a sale or until the game pops up in another bundle, but if you're looking for ~2 hours of great humour and fun action platforming [b]right now[/b], Freedom Fall should be the game of your choice!", "timestamp_created": 1411836741, "timestamp_updated": 1411836741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12253896": {"recommendationid": "12253896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087723559", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433980319}, "language": "english", "review": "Freedom Fall is a beautiful down scrolling platformer that honors the games of yesteryear while feeling surprisingly fresh.

So if you're coming from there, fear not, it is a lot simpler to handle and will make you feel right at home next to your other controller supported games. \n\nIn that same breath, I can admit that throwing grenades seems slightly more troublesome because you can actually throw it now instead of lob it like before, so at certain times you are used to tapping the bomb and wondering why it literally hurled off the screen... they changed it. though you still can't throw up or down... Interesting oversight.\n\nAlso... It seems like the endings want to be exclusive, so instead of replaying a story without starting over like the android to unlock all 3 endings with... spoilers. You may have to start over or they may be unavailable, because the up and vanished for me, and I am aware of them. So yeah, Do what you would like to do rather than unlock everything if you're coming from android. \n\nTHERE ARE POST GAME LEVELS. I'm glad this wasn't a complete bare port and they added a lot more to it.

Well maybe not the kind I grew up with, but a platformer all the same. What does Freedom Fall do to stand out in such a crowded genre? By being a quite good game.\n\nThere's a kid imprisoned in a tower, that's you.  The cell-door is unlocked, that's good. The way out will likely cause you to die many times, that's kinda bad. Oh yeah there's also a princess who just loves to hear herself talk..or read herself write..or..anyway that's all in the background. \n\nEach stage of Freedom Fall is comprised of a variety of traps, with new ones doled out at regular intervals. You have all of the basic techniques like jumping, wall-jumping, and grabbing onto ledges to progress. While this definitely isn't necessary, you can also build a few pieces of equipment to get an edge. This requires the acquisition of gears, which are strewn all over the tower. This is a score-based game so moving quickly, dying less, and taking those difficult optional paths to collect more gears, are all essential strategies for climbing the leaderboards.\n\nOne of the things that usually bugs me about falling in a platformer, is that all too often it results in \"leaps of faith\". Aside from down, you have no idea where you're going, so death is a very real possibility. Freedom Fall features exceptionally well-designed levels. Despite having the ability to look down and get a better view of below, I was never concerned about those leaps of faith. Each level is tight and offers enough feedback so you always have an idea of what's below. Platformers are great when you don't have to think over your next move. \n\nAt first the large-size of the player's hitbox was a bit disconcerting. If so much as a single hair on the player's head is singed, it's back to the last checkpoint. After awhile though it became second nature. A smaller hitbox might be nice for those \"hey I coulda dodged that...right?\" moments but overall the game shows utmost conviction in its design. For a game where death comes easily, solid mechanics are a must. Freedom Fall succeeds not only in its hit-box design, but also in the fundamentals like jumping. This a game that just feels good to play. I like that.\n\nThe Princess deserves special mention. It's her tower and she'll remind you every step of the way. Berating your ability, insulting your mum, bragging about her dad, laughing at the misfortunes of the prisoners that died before you, it can be absolutely hilarious at times. Plus all this writing serves another purpose in telling the story of the game, without any need for cut-scenes, intros, or anything that could get in the way of the pacing (unless you're a slow reader). This is a very smartly-designed game. \n\nA play-through will run a bit over an hour (maybe less), there are far worse ways to spend that time I assure you. It's also great that Freedom Fall offers a well-designed hard difficulty setting. Unlike some games where hard difficulty apparently means no checkpoints, this game actually adds more traps to deal with. Thus you're encouraged to play better, not play safer(there is a difference).  \n\nAltogether this game is worth checking out.\n", "timestamp_created": 1409719412, "timestamp_updated": 1409719412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601640", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11850373": {"recommendationid": "11850373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079413407", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390060314}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu est... vide.

Yes, the game is short.  Not extremely short, but you may well complete it in little over an hour if you're a pro at these games.  Most people will probably take a bit longer, and die many times in their first playthrough!  I died over 20 times in my first try at some levels, I am not afraid to admit!\n\nYou are held prisoner at the top of a trap-filled tower, the domain of a purple-haired princess who loves to watch her prisoners die in their attempts to escape.\n\nThe value is there mainly for people who want to fully complete the game and get all the achievements.  You'll probably need to play through three or four times to get them all.  First, complete the game.  Ok!  Now complete it with no equipment.  Ok.  Now complete it without dying a single time.  Wow!  And these are tough, but fair to complete.  It is challenging, but without relying on pixel-perfect jumping or restrictive controls like many 'hardcore' platformers do.  It's just plain fun to play, because the protagonist controls so beautifully.\n\nThe level design is excellent.  It is so clever that they made each level fit each style of playthrough with the right level of difficulty.  The humour is wonderful too.  The princess leaves you messages painted on the walls as she descends ahead of you, and they combine the cutesy with the psychotic in a hilarious way.

For example, a glider can be built which slows your fall a bit but more importantly lets you rise upwards off of the heat the fire traps put off. I will say personally though that the power-ups make the game a bit too easy, but they aren't neccessary to finishing any of the game's levels.\nThe story of the game is presented to you by way of a princess leaving you snarky and sarcastic messages on walls. I personally find this really charming and as the story picks up a little under half way through the game it also gets very interesting to learn just how you came to be in this tower, and who this princess is.\nAll in all, while the game is really short and a bit easy it's made up for by being incredibly charming and super polished in gameplay.

As the name implies, [i]Freedom Fall[/i] takes a different approach, placing your stranded at the top of a tower and forcing you to descend through the traps an precariously placed spikes toward your escape. It's a novel idea accomplished with a lot of style, but one that was also originally done for mobile and tablet devices and on its way to the PC has had little effort into better suiting it to the platform. What follows is an enjoyable, but flawed experience that can't reach its full potential, despite being largely enjoyable much of the time.\n\nTaking the role of a nameless prisoner, placed for an unknown crime at the top of a dungeon-like tower, you're let loose with the promise that you will be pardoned if only you can make it through alive. Once you step out of your cell however, you become the plaything to a maniacal princess, taunting you through writings left on the wall which also serve to flesh out the backstory of both your character and the princess. Her dialogues are far and away my favorite thing about the game; unapologetically sociopathic musings which are both hilariously morbid and engaging, while giving your on-and-off adversary a level of depth I didn't expect to find in this game. It's disappointing then that the ending is so anticlimactic, but at least getting there is fairly entertaining.\n\nAs a down-scrolling platformer, FF plays much like any other game in the genre except with lots more, well, falling. You spend much of your time maneuvering through the air as you collect bolts to buy tools which help you access hard to reach areas and generally make progressing a lot easier. An interesting twist is that you are often given the choice between an easy and hard path, the former featuring fewer traps and a quicker way through, and the later giving you more bolts if you can survive through it. It's a smart way to allow for those looking for different levels of challenge, but my main complaint with it is that about halfway through you already have more than enough bolts to buy every upgrade, so taking the harder path becomes a bit pointless aside from your own pride getting in the way. I would have preferred if the item prices had been better balanced, or that the act of buying the items was removed altogether and you were simply given them at certain points in the game, because bolts as they are now seem superfluous and tacked on.\n\nAlthough the artwork certainly looks good in stills, the way it moves is what makes it such a joy to behold. The background and foreground subtly shift apart giving the impression of 3D, which creates a very neat effect when your character runs through it (who's hair I should mention animates beautifully). The soundtrack is an excellent collection of rock and ambient tunes, with several great guitar lines standing out as particularly memorable. \n\nUnfortunately as much as I love the art and music of FF it has some unmistakable problems. The splat popup when you die looks horrible and is completely out of place, like a forgotten placeholder that made it into the final game. Numerous bugs pop up throughout, from broken animations to consistently poor performance, and many areas could have used more polish. Unrelated to the presentation, the biggest thing holding me back from fully recommending [i]Stirefire Studio's[/i] creation is the extremely short length and unreasonable price. I completed the game in about an hour, and unless you are obsessed with climbing the leaderboards for each level there isn't any reason to go back. For the $3 it originally costed on Android it doesn't seem too bad considering the game itself is a lot of fun, but for $10 it's undoubtedly overpriced.\n\nI like [i]Freedom Fall[/i] quite a bit. It's an interesting twist on platformers with a smart tongue and a great soundtrack that feels just long enough despite its brevity. Be that as it may, for its current price I don't believe it to be worth it, and would suggest waiting for a sale for those interested in picking it up. I'm not sure why the price was raised so much for the PC version, but regardless of the reasoning I believe it silly and those who pay full price will likely be disappointed with what they get. \n\nIt's by no means bad, there is just very little of it.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2014/01/26/freedom-fall-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1390745540, "timestamp_updated": 1450131847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601017", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8852267": {"recommendationid": "8852267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063301894", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390718733}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "jogo incrivelmente bom", "timestamp_created": 1390720115, "timestamp_updated": 1390720115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8847782": {"recommendationid": "8847782", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974171741", "num_games_owned": 1998, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409497929}, "language": "english", "review": "YANDERE-HIME 100/100 GOTY", "timestamp_created": 1390687000, "timestamp_updated": 1390687000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504539", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8842824": {"recommendationid": "8842824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072504646", "num_games_owned": 5235, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390660693}, "language": "english", "review": "a nice platformer with lots of traps but not too difficult.\n+ cute arts.\n+ smooth animations.\n+ funny 'story telling'.\n+ lots of save points (because you'll die a lot). :D\n+ in certain area we can choose easier/harder path.\n\nif you think this game is too short &/ too easy,\ntry to get all its steam achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1390662851, "timestamp_updated": 1390662851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652628", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8835606": {"recommendationid": "8835606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066339830", "num_games_owned": 3559, "num_reviews": 186, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390699310}, "language": "english", "review": "With only 13 levels + 1 bonus level, this game doesn't offer much.

You can collect various screws and cogs which can then be used with workbenches to buy bombs (used to detonate traps or specific bricks) or power-ups to ease our quest. A series of check-points ensure that our premature death will not spell a restart from the beginning of the stage, even though, as a couple of achievements require us to not die at all during our run, an option to disable said check-points would have been useful.\n\nThe story is simple but told in a captivating way: as our hero is a rather taciturn one, his story can be recollected from the countless taunts that the evil princess who built this infamous tower enjoy writing on the background walls. The messages' childish and sadistic nature had me giggling and cringing at the same time very often, and were a further incentive to complete my mission and see how everything would wrap up in the end.\n\nGraphics and music are reminiscent of the golden age of 16-bit arcade titles, coated in a shiny HD presentation, while level design is a perfect mix of mnemonic knowledge and just the right space for improvisation. Once the main game ends, there's still some challenge in the form of completing stages on par with time, cogs gathered and number of deaths: unfortunately, those parameters are not displayed during your run, so you don't know how good (or bad) it is going until you manage to reach the exit.

Especially if you consider the difficulty, which is definitely too low. It was not enough of a challenge, in my opinion. Even, if you always choose the hard route (there are many parts of the levels where you can choose between an easy and a hard section), you won't have any trouble completing the game. One more thing: there is not enough variety in the platforming. Gunman Clive's campaign can be completed in half the time, but has so much more to offer (gravity flipping, rocket rides...).\n\nOn the pro side there is solid platforming (including items for double-jumping and gliding, and switching between them), nice story-telling (every few meters you can read surprisingly funny messages, the princess left there), and a nice twist to the typical platformer story cliche (you search for a princess, yes. But she is an evil, insane sadist). I really enjoyed the game, despite all the issues mentioned above.\n\nOverall Freedom Fall gets a thumbs up, but it could have been much better.

The music is about as unobtrusive as you can get, while still adding to the mood, and fits the levels very well. The art (my initial draw into this game as I follow the art director on a popular art site) is VERY well done and the animations are smooth and natural. Marsh is adorable, our dear little Highness the Princess is beautifully handled, and everything just has this almost childlike charm to it.\nThe design choice of telling the story through graffiti on the wall is excellent in ways I cannot describe.\n\nBut there is a reason I said that its frustrating. While the gameplay is smooth and the default controls are solid (though personally I would have had the three glider types set to A, S, and D rather than having to change between them in a loop with C) I keep hitting X when I mean to hit C and C when I mean to hit V and there are times where you only have a split second time frame or have to jump from a specific pixel in order to have the slightest chance of successfully completing the jump. Compared to the fluid ease of the rest of the game, these specific parts quickly become frustrating and irritating. This is made even worse by the large hitbox on obstacles in later levels (to a brutal extent in the bonus level).\nEarly on, these parts are a nice challenge, but in the later stages it it quickly becomes apparent why this game doesn't use lives.\n\nHowever, even with those issues, Freedom Fall is a nice, short game that can be completed in an hour if you know what you're doing, and three tops if you don't. Its a fun game well worth picking up and more than worth the money.\n\n\n\nDo be warned of some bugs that myself and my friends have encountered.\nI'm using a MacBook Pro OSX:\n-I have encountered random temporary \"hiccups\" in loading (all animation will cease for about half a second). These did not affect my gameplay but they are a thing.\n-On my second play through I got caught in a Lightning trap and was returned to a redstone as expected, however Marsh was stuck in the electrocuted animation loop. I did not attempt to replicate this bug, I simply restarted the level.\n\nMy PC using friends:\n-For one of my friends, Freedom Fall will fail to open. Steam will claim it is open, and Freedom Fall will claim its open, but it cannot be located. I'm unsure how he fixed this, if he did, but restarting Steam did not help.\n\n-Another friend had the game crash in the middle of the fight against Madam Sharkie Twinkletooth the 3rd. We do not know what caused it to crash, and she could not replicate it.\n-Around the \"You weren't supposed to get this far\" graffiti, the same friend's screen bugged out again, slowing down and moving Marsh to the side of the screen and going completely unresponsive. She had to close the game and reopen it to fix it, and we're not sure what was done to cause this.", "timestamp_created": 1389603099, "timestamp_updated": 1389603099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8690126": {"recommendationid": "8690126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059062034", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393771402}, "language": "english", "review": "I really happy to say Freedom Fall is good game.

With a garnish of super meat boy style difficulty. However while the platformer is difficult in areas, the difficulty curve comes too late in the game and mostly in the bonus level that appears after the game. On death you respawn at the last check point you passed and getting to the end of the level can be broken down into simply brute forcing it with failures. Only during the bonus level and a few select time rewind based check points do you actually get denied progress if you do not successfully do well enough to beat the puzzle set. I felt this mechanic could have been utilised sooner and in a much broader way to give much further depth to the earlier levels. Instead the main game plays fairly quickly and the only real challenge is in earning the awards for beating the level under a par set for time completed, deaths and amount of items collected.\n\nThe game has a nice aesthetic with clean HD graphics and a cute story that plays out through writing on the wall narrative. A one sided conversation between the protagonist and antagonist. The antagonists personality however is a little disjointed with the way she writes and the way she acts at the end of the game.\n\nTentatively Recommended: A fun game that ends before it can realize it's potential.", "timestamp_created": 1389588452, "timestamp_updated": 1389588763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8688928": {"recommendationid": "8688928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059263475", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479175376}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game Is great.The Levels are wonderfully designed in a risk-reward system that works great Beutiful Graphics Amazing Soundtrack And a good story too?

However It is very toned down in difficulty compared to other games I have played which feels like it misses the point. \n\nThe main goal is to escape a tower by reaching the bottom. This means most of your movement is falling through the air, hence the title. As you progress through the tower you can buy new gadgets changing the way you play. For me the double jump gadget is immensely more useful and ended up being my main method of moving around. Although some of the sections can get difficult, for the most part I made it passed many traps without even blinking. There are multiple paths through most of the levels which are clearly marked as easy or hard. I took both types throughout the game and for the most part didn't find any path particularly more difficult than the others. There are also numerous checkpoints scattered through each level making the times when you do die much less frustrating. The last boss is actually in my opinion easier than the rest of the game which was a little disappointing. \n\nThe game does control very well and each gadget is easy to use. The variety of traps is also nice.It was rare that I felt a death wasn't my fault. Even the swimming mechanics manage to be as little of a burden as possible.\n\nThe art is very nice and each level has just enough variety to make it feel different than the last level. The antagonist also leaves messages painted all over the walls which tell the story and can sometimes be pretty funny. The music is excellent and makes the game feel a bit more intense with its electric guitar. \n\nMy one big gripe is not the difficulty but the length. The game has only around 10 levels and because it isn't incredibly difficult can be beaten in a couple hours; if that. It does have various challenges you can go for on each stage increasing the replayability a bit. Many of them however, I obtained without even trying. After my first play-through I already had around half of them. \n\n In conclusion this game is a great introduction to unforgiving platformers but may not be enough to interest those who are looking for a real challenge.

And it doesn\u2019t disappoint, the game is an exquisitely crafted, easy on the eyes, smooth platformer in which you escape from death row by navigating an ever perilous descent out of a deadly tower.\n\nReally, this game is pretty. Perhaps because I have been playing some games that have been disregarding graphics lately but I really enjoyed the visuals in Freedom Fall. The towering heights, the deadly spikes and spinning blades, the cloudy backgrounds, and best of all the graffiti scrawled around the tower. You\u2019re treated to some equally impressive visuals if you make it to the bottom and looking around at this fantastical world.\n\nSo the justice system in this strange world involves locking people up in insanely high towers and then giving them the option to wait in their cell and be executed or attempt to find freedom by navigating a fairly suicidal descent. It\u2019s a brilliant premise and I really am almost gushing at how brilliantly the story is told in this game. Developers and game designers take some notes here! A way to tell a fairly deep and engrossing story without heavy handed cut scenes or dialogue boxes and never interrupting the flow of game-play.\n\nThe princess in the tower is not some damsel in distress that needs rescuing nor a helpful guide that you might think she is at first. No she is a monstrous, murderous, malevolent creature who has designed this mad death trap for her own amusement. Although you\u2019ve thrown a wrench into her intricate mechanism by your uncanny ability to resurrect quickly after each of your painful deaths. I guess that\u2019s why you got locked up to begin with, stealing (or being framed for stealing) the elixir of life, making you immortal.\n\nYou might be immortal but there\u2019s plenty of ways to send you back to the nearest resurrection shrine throughout your descent. The variety of deadly traps is quite impressive with spikes, blades, scythes, flames, fireballs, water, electricity, killer mechanical shark, and a dragon all out to kill you. The levels keep coming at you with more and more challenges but it\u2019s not so frantic and unforgiving that you want to quit. The best feature is the game quickly resurrecting you, not wasting time on monotonous death scenes or loading screens and instead throws you right back into the action to try again when you fail. And you will fail a lot. A LOT!\n\nThe only problem I really have with the game is it\u2019s short length. Once you\u2019ve gotten used to the various death traps and mastered the upgrades you\u2019re fighting the final boss and then it\u2019s over. Taking my time I beat the game in a little over an hour, then played again trying to go faster and beat it in under 50 minutes. Despite it\u2019s short length and price tag though I was really satisfied by this game. It is highly concentrated goodness that delivers. Better to make a really good short game than a really long, drawn out, bad game.\n\nI recommend if you pick this game up to go slow your first time, read all the notes from the princess, the story that is told is really worth it. Then after you beat the game once, try again going as fast as you can for some extra challenge. I got a nice thrill testing my blade avoiding parkour skills as I tried to beat the game a third time as fast as possible while trying to die as few times as possible. And with a built in leader board you can compare your skills with all of the internet for bragging rights. I can understand not wanting to pay the full price for a game that can be completed in under an hour but at its current 35% off sale it\u2019s definitely worth it!\n\nFinal Score:\nGraphics: 9/10\nGame Play: 9/10\nMusic / Ambiance: 8/10\nStory: 9/10\nValue: 5/10\nOverall: 8/10\n\nRead more of my indy game reviews on my blog!\nhttp://markofithian.com", "timestamp_created": 1389482367, "timestamp_updated": 1389482469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8669804": {"recommendationid": "8669804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045446309", "num_games_owned": 641, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1389480174}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a fun game designed for gamers who like fighing for the high score.

You are a prisoner who is trying find your way down to the bottom of the tower through all the traps set up by a twisted princess. The goal is to get your freedom back by escaping the tower. \n\nThe writings on the walls in the tower are funny and drives the story forward as you get to know more about the princess. If you are any kind of fan of the platformer genr\u00e9 then you should definitively try to pick this game up. The game is for Windows and Mac which is always nice and the replay value of the game is pretty good since you can try to improve your scores and times for the levels. As far as I'm aware there are two different endings you can get decided by which way you go in the tower. \n\nAt the time of writing this review the achievements are glitched but I'm sure they will fix that soon[EDIT: They have indeed fixed it]. The menu screen is good and you can have a few different save files. I personally like the art style and level design in this game and these kind of games are right up my alley. The game has full controller support but I haven't had time to try it out with a controller yet and the keyboard controls work just fine. \n\nAnother part of this game that I enjoyed was that you can choose between harder platforming and easier platforming. \nThe harder platforming rewards you with more cogs than in the easier parts, cogs which are the in-game currency that you can use to buy equipment like a pair of dragon wings or a glider. As the game progresses it gets harder but even if you aren't very good at platformer games it shouldn't get too hard and it is not a game that frustrates you as for example Super Meat Boy.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nAs a conclusion I would like to say that I recommend this game with all my heart even though it is a bit short but as I stated above the game has good enough replay value for me to still really recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good time. The music is nice and fitting for the game and there are also trading cards which everyone always seem to like :) \n\n- Liam", "timestamp_created": 1389446184, "timestamp_updated": 1428573014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8658692": {"recommendationid": "8658692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034062675", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438814267}, "language": "english", "review": "\nSo I've been silently following this game off and on through whatever means possible.  I had high hopes for it and I've been awaiting the day of release on Steam feverishly.  The day came.  And not only that, but in celebration it was on SALE.  And not to far from my birthday, so I could excuse the purchase as a \"Early gift to myself\".  Awesome!\n\nIt installs... And I run it.  Instantly I'm hit with beautifully painted and animated scenes and awesome music that I wish I could listen to outside of the game (WAV/ALAC/FLAC/etc OST please?).  The effort that went into the whole game is clear from the very beginning and I LIKE that in a game, indie title or not, and is something sorely missing from most modern games, I think.\n\nWhen I beat it, I at first felt disappointed because it was over \"so quickly\".  But then I looked at the clock; 2 hours had passed.  I mean, okay, lets be honest, two hours ISN'T huge.  But I thought it was less than half that.  This says more about the quality of the game than I can with an essay of words.  It pulled me in like a good book, wrapped me tight around it's little finger, and time seemed to pass at incredible pace.  I plan on playing it again, and soon.  Maybe I'll buy it for my Nexus 7, too.\n\nThe game itself is simple, platformer-like, and quick to grasp.  That said, it's not easy to master, and some levels may have you bald very quickly, depending on how quickly you rip your hair out in frustration.  One level, I'm ashamed to admit, had me dead 86 times.  That said, I don't think I've played a game in this style that I enjoyed this much in a long time (Unless it was an original game produced in the 80's/90's).  This is a game that will someday be mentioned in the same breath as all the retro classics and will have a special place all it's own among them.\n\nOh, and the first ending I got seemed to play at a possible sequel...

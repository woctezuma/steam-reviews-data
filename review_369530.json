You can fight, do missions, trade, mine, pirate, steal, wage wars or simply take over the system.  More than likely you will eventually end up doing a bit of most of those, some you will do yourself the rest you might get your AI minion fleets to do for you. \n\nWhat I love about this game is how it changes as you play.  Your experience during the first few hours as you do low paying jobs, struggling to earn enough credits to upgrade the rust bucket you have been given is very different from later on, where you wil go on to start commanding larger ships like corvettes, frigates and eventually destroyers. \n\nFrom flying your own trader to owning a fleet of trade ships and escorts, directing mining fleets and perhaps, even building an armada large enough to capture one of the space stations out there.  Once you do this the game again changes as you now have the ability to not only buy ships but build them and you have now transformed into a faction.  How far does your ambition go....?\n\nGameplay wise you are able to fly ANY ship in the game, from the lowliest drone fighter to the largest behemoth cruisers.  You have own many ships and jump between them as you see fit.  You can have them form their own mining or trade fleets to go and earn you money and resources, assign them to protect your assets or have them join you.  \n\nThere are a great many ships to choose from, tugs, a large number of light, medium & heavy fighters, corvettes, frigates, destroyers & cruisers and all armed with various deadly weaponry from turrets to missiles to beam weapons.  \n\nCurrently my fav is an Apollo Class light corvette that is pretty much my own personal Millenium Falcon, fast, agile and punches above her weight.  While I have pretty much upraded to a heavy beam frigate now as my ambitions sore, I will always fondly remember that ship. And yes you can name all of them :)\n\nThose that join you, you are able to control via a tactical RTS style command system or in cockpit via simple Wingmen commands.  This allows to give complex instructions to your fleet and if you wish can play out entire confrontations like an RTS if you do not feel like taking to the cockpit. \n\nThis is an EA game so there will be bugs, crashes, features to be implemented etc but it is a very flesh out game at this time and you can get many hours of enjoyment already. \n\nThe developer is VERY responsive and it is not uncommon to report a bug and have him release a patch/bugfix within a day or two once he figures out what is causing it.  As such the EA user base here is very important to highlight not only bugs but features that either work well or could use improvement. \n\nIf you like space, strategy or flying then this could be a game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1514024086, "timestamp_updated": 1514024086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525401", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38275306": {"recommendationid": "38275306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061954691", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515804562}, "language": "english", "review": "Before you buy this game, pay attention to the \"early access\" part of the description.

Still playable but the the shift/alt/ctl commands make it very hard for someone to get into it.

You can progress by carrying passengers, racing or by bounty hunting.

(Control what they produce, export, import, they can build ships for you)\n- Go mining & trading\n- Hire Mercs or buy ships to expand your fleet\n- Be a pirate and steal cargo or capture ships\n- Go bounty hunting\n- Takeover the whole sector\n- Take a walk inside a base. (Don't expect too much, you can have a look on your ship and go to the remote Terminal when owning the base)\n- Change between ships, Strategy Overview & First person whenever you like.\n- more\n\nWhat I like:\n- The total freedom, do what you want to do. Be a pirate, a merch, a warlord. Your choice\n- Modding -> There aren't many modders here yet, but it is possible to add own ships,factions,weapons&stations\n- The style - It is simple but it has its own charm.

Where Void Destroyer 2 stands out against all these games is its inclusion of the Overworld. You can actually watch ships travel from one location of the map, pick up cargo, then transport it to another location. Not only that, but you can also watch as they may become intercepted by pirates. And, if you choose, join in the battle and help the ship out.\n\nAnother great feature of Void Destroyer 2 is the way it controls. Plenty of space games offer six degrees of freedom and Newtonian physics, but in most games it serves as a burden on the player. Here, all of the ships have adequate forward and breaking thrust, making it so that most of the time you won't slam into somethings unless you're moving far beyong the intended speed limit of your ship (which is nicely bound to a single keypress). \n\nBeing in Early Access, I hope that later down the line more activities will be added as profitable playstyles, with others receiving refinements.

So far i've only tried out the combat, automated mining and patroling/securing areas from pirates. i expect auto trading/passenger transport functions much the same way so there are several ways to earn the cash needed to upgrade ships and safeguard your assets.\n\nI am looking forward to seeing more content as i can see myself playing this for a long time.", "timestamp_created": 1498589299, "timestamp_updated": 1509411783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32853467": {"recommendationid": "32853467", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987533604", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509970803}, "language": "english", "review": "The Void Destroyer Games represents everything that the gaming industry should aspire to be (Listen up EA & No Man's Sky!)\n\nCreated by a single developer, I feel this game has the potential to be one of the best Space-Sandbox games on the Indie market.

From there you earn credits by completing contracts, making allies, establishing mining operations and forging trade routes.\nYou can reinvest your profits into bigger and better ships and even build up fleets to defend your mining/trading operations.\n\nOr, if you fancy a more illegal method of profit, try some piracy! Harrass trade convoys whilst evading the Navy. Extort defenceless civilians and make an infamous name for yourself.\n\nThe latest update to appear at the time of this review has introduced an excellent Space Station capture/management system. This allows you to perform large-scale assaults on enemy stations and sieze them for yourself.

So here is what the game is and about.\nVoid destroyers 2 is an Early Access, Indie, Strategy, Sci-fi Space Sim. Its always nice to start off with pretty much nothing and working your way up into something powerful or a fleet of something powerful. For Void destroyers 2, it does just that. To becoming something powerful you will be needing money, and reputation. Money is the big part, but reputation gives you access to buying bigger ships of different factions. \nThere are 6 factions of which reputations can be earned from or loosed from: The MU, The reborn (Pirates), TSF (military), Civilians, pirates, the Bounty hunter, and the Black market. \n\nEach faction has:\n\u2022\tTheir bases scattered around the map. \n\u2022\tTheir own types of ships they sell. Except for the pirates, they got 2 separate pirate factions and ships. As well as the Black market, since they sell some of the illegal ships there). \n\u2022\tAn economy. Which you can trade resources with.\n\u2022\tEach ship is unique in their own way.\n\u2022\tEnemy\u2019s\n\u2022\tDifferent Missions (also except for black market).\n\nEarning Money:\nThere are different ways to earn money, by mining or commanding Mining ships to mine for you, destroying ships with bounties on them, buying then selling cargo or selling stolen cargo at bases, if you got your own base you can sell what is being produced, doing missions, etc.\n\nBounties:\nIf not from doing missions and mining, trading or capturing a ship then selling it. You can destroy and earn money off of destroying ships.\nThere are 3 different factions you can take bounty\u2019s off of without the use of a mission. Destroying the Bounty hunters and Military ships if your going through the pirate role or just the pirates if you stay with the civilians and bounty hunters. The bigger they are the bigger the reward. As well you can\u2019t \u201ckill steal\u201d you would have to gang the ship with your fleet or destroy it by your self.\nA Cheeky and obvious move is to wait near a military repair station (not a civilian or you wont get anything out of it) and to destroy or capture big military ships.\nBounties can also lead to getting an bounty/Wanted on you, where the military and the bounty hunters will come after you. Having a wanted score if you haven\u2019t attack any pirates will allow you to buy a ship from their base and take their mission. \n\nFaction Ships:\nThe MU has the ships infused with asteroids. a few the bigger ships are just the ship as a gun.\nThe Reborn Has ships with big cannons. As well as their own capture ship and capture bases ships and a carrier. \nThe Civilians are not helpless. They are the only faction besides the black market that sells mining ships.\nThe Military are deadly. Currently you can only buy two vehicles there, because its the military.\nThe bounty hunters, just have ships that where made to kill every type of ship.\nThe Black Market currently have no missions but randomly have different illegal ships for sale, from every faction. Like civilian capture bases ships, big military ships. But not all ships, they won\u2019t have the really big ones like the Priam from the bounty hunters, etc.\nThere are many types of weapons from bullets to rocks, to missiles to lasers. There are nice unique weapons and secondary weapons. Weapons come from the ship you cannot for most change the weapons on that ship. \n\nUpgrading:\nAfter entering a base, you can upgrade it by adding a turret for curtains small ships (like starter ship). Or increasing the ammo and maneuverability. You can also add abilities like a shield to the front of your ship when activated, a repair, a big increase in forward thrust, etc. You can also change what space looks like.\n\nPlayer own bases:\nOther than taken over a base and selling what ever is produced, in the base you can use ore to reduce the cost of building a ship in the base. \n\nControls:\nAt first if you didn\u2019t play Void Destroyers, it will feel weird. But if you are determined you can you can deal with it. Personally, I don\u2019t like flying the hornet, too fast for me in turns of turning and looking to the left or right and passing where I wanted to look at.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019ve been enjoying the game, and can\u2019t wait to see every new thing that gets added.", "timestamp_created": 1493497545, "timestamp_updated": 1493497545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31409435": {"recommendationid": "31409435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001443770", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493792630}, "language": "english", "review": "Best there currently is.", "timestamp_created": 1493359180, "timestamp_updated": 1493359180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.422031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31405301": {"recommendationid": "31405301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226982608", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493254927}, "language": "english", "review": "i think this is\n crap", "timestamp_created": 1493341020, "timestamp_updated": 1493341020, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.082886", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1494012158, "developer_response": "Sounds like you don't like the game - not sure when you bought it, but if it is within 2 weeks you can get a no-questions asked refund here - \nhttps://help.steampowered.com/en/ (also more info here - http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/ )\n\nThe refund is also sometimes granted outside of the 2 weeks, so give it a try and I hope you can use the money to buy a game you like better."}, "31404172": {"recommendationid": "31404172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067251264", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502066462}, "language": "english", "review": "Yet another fantastic indy title by this one man game dev.\n\nA TL:DR of this game would be that its Mount and Blade in space.

At $15 I found it a steal! I \"beat\" it in ~30 hours. More late-game content is planned.\n\nPROS:\n- Very well crafted combat system, smoothly going from dogfighting in a single tiny fighter to commanding enormous fleets into battle homeworld-style from a tactical view. Both styles and everything in between are very fun and rewards skills and thinking.\n- Large variety of things to do. Buy or build ships, customize themwith passive upgrades and abilities, mine asteroids and trade (or get AI ships you own to do it for you), do a huge number of varied missions, improve relationships with factions (unlocking perks like higher-tier ships, missions or auto-docking option), capture ships and bases and explore the game world.\n- Extremely friendly, mature and responsive dev. He's addressed my many bug reports and feedback promptly and gives me the feeling that this game is in very good hands.\n- Beatiful art and original ship/base designs\n- Fluid gameplay with lots of quality of life features. Huge amounts of keyboard shortcuts available. Ability to try out a ship (or upgrade) before investing your savings into it, lots of automation for trading/mining, time compression for fast travel and dilation for careful battle management, ability to create copies of a heavily customized ship when building a large fleet, etc.\n- Great sense of progression/achievement as you go from a tiny, weak fighter to a huge empire.\n- Low number of bugs for a space sandbox game (!)\n\nCONS:\n- The learning curve is fairly steep. Perhaps a bit lower than the X games, but expect to spend the first hour or two getting used to all the ways to interact with your ship(s) and the world.\n- Some of the interface for ship management needs polish when dealing with very large fleets (100+ ships)", "timestamp_created": 1493326466, "timestamp_updated": 1493326599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545179", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31172581": {"recommendationid": "31172581", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991911346", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489766244}, "language": "english", "review": "This ame is awesome very fun to play although I havn't had much time to play, I can't wait to play it again!", "timestamp_created": 1492327644, "timestamp_updated": 1492327644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30848922": {"recommendationid": "30848922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032236512", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503064622}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game concept!

If that's the case that I met my goal.\n\nFew things to note (not going to go point by point detail by detail because that would simply be too large).\n\nYou can capture bases making the game world dynamic (first steps!). There are \"black market bases\" you don't have to be a pirate to buy base/ship capture ships. The game will have a story line. \n\nCheck out the recent vids/updates/etc and keep track of the project in the news section for future additions. It seems like you missed a few.\n\nIf you say that the map is too small and it takes 20 minutes to travel it (via the hyper space/fast travel method) - but you played 40 hours. Sounds like good design to me. Less travel and more action - I hope! I even made travel faster via adding gates (again check out the news section).\n\nThe funny thing is that most likely there will be non-player fleets and player owned fleets. They won't be the \"unified GUI dynamic sandbox\" fleets you described, but they will allow for basic territory/space defense/control.\n\nWhat you suggested was a full 4X strategy game - on top of what the game already is - with a unified GUI (which in terms of game development terms - means that the entire game needs to be seamless - which means seamless space sim, fleet and overworld and 4X strategy game) - with a \"dynamic sandbox\" that apparently no one else ever made. If they have - please point it out - I'd love to play it!\n\nIts fine to criticise and suggest but adding a 4X game ontop of my plans is too much.

(Yes, even with engine optimization.)\nIt will crash eventually, and once it starts it crashes a lot.\nI have heard people complain about controls and performance issues.

And I'm not much of an RTS player, I'm a pilot. That really says something about the \"individual unit control\" the game provided. Void Destroyer 2 however, takes it to the next level. Rather than starting off with the difficult task of commanding an entire military fleet, you begin in a small utility ship, converted into a sad excuse of a fighter. And from there, you climb your way up, your fighter becomes a gunship, then a corvette, then a heavily armed battleship. And your money grows and grows as you purchase fighter escorts, trading and mining ships, and more. This game is everything I wanted from VD1, and everything I loved from it too. It has a bit of a learning curve if youve never played Void Destroyer, (pro tip, take up courier missions, and eventually you'll see an entire station swarming a single pirate frigate. Wait until its almost dead, then be the last person to hit it.) For an Early Access game, the \"To-do\" list is pretty well checked off. The only downside imo is that there is no planned multiplayer, and that the ships don't have fleshed-out cockpits and interiors. If the cockpits were more varied, and the ships had basic interiors you could walk around in and walk directly out of into a station, this game would be a 10/10 in my book.

Diversity as its best.\n\nNow to speak on a more personal approach, i'm coming from X3 and Void Destroyer 2 just overcome the latest in many points such as fleet management (RTS view, drag and drop, right click and ennemy), combat (because of newtonian physics), only the trading part (as of 11/12/16) which will be reworked doesnt scale to X3.

In other mission I failed to destroy huuuge pirate group, because it was...well huge - I ran away forgeting about them. some time later I notice that same group terrorizing the area - now my plan is to take lost of \"repair military ship\" missions so that the military could deal with them)\n- freedom - you can be Pirate, Bounty hunter, Trader or Miner.\n- Several diffrent factions with their own distinct design and ballance philosophy\n- each faction has distinct set of generic mission that player can take\n- 80+ ships for these faction, all of them with wide range of upgrades and customizations\n- flight mechanic is well balanced between newtonian flight and arcade shooter\n- you can build your own fleet of combat ships, trading freighters and mining ships\n- ability to quick and easy jump between ship combat and ship command mode (RTS style)\n- already good price to content ratio (look and above, look at the Price tag, then take a look on \"One Man's Lie\" price tag) despite it's still very early access\n- game developer is very active and open to feedback\n\n\nCons:\n- If you was already after years with Homeworld 2, you will notice that the general GUI is still very crude and require a lot of work. However as this was openly admitted by author, the GUI was low-prio for the first release. He already begun GUI tweaks and improvement in last few day. It made a huge leap in good direction.\n- There is almost no ships above Frigate size yet due to early access. If you dream about your personal battleship or carrier then you will have to wait.\n- The number and variants of generic mission is still limited due to EA, so after several days they become very repetetive.\n- the \"borderlands\" style graphic might look quite ugly at first, so depending on the taste this might be very big issue and this is the only issue not related to early access status.\n\n\nNow the last paragraph about VD2 Early Access in general.\nWe all know how \"bad\" the pernament Early Access games are in these days. Some of them ending up as almost a scam.\nVoid Destroyer is not like these \"bad\" EA.\nI bought VD1 as Early Access played for a few hours, had some fun...then forgot about the game because it was EA work in Progress. Year later I received steam mail that VD1 is now out of EA and with release status.\nI jumped back to the game and had a lot of fun playing the main story (not your average casual game, once aliens appear you need to prepare to discover new meaning for \"being screwed\" and then they joy when you finally begin to push them back).\nWhat does it mean for VD2 EA? I'm confident that author will deliver what he promised - his roadmap is clear, the core gameplay is ready, feedback from players is well processed.\n\nTo me this is best spent 15$ on a game this year.", "timestamp_created": 1477743041, "timestamp_updated": 1477743041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26280580": {"recommendationid": "26280580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038974004", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487823213}, "language": "english", "review": "I just have to say this is the most enjoyable space combat I've experienced. It's hard to really explain why... the flight mechanics, the weapons, the ships themselves... it all feels \"just right\" to me. If you're not sure, watch some of the videos where Paul (the developer) shows off some combat- that's when I was sold. \n\nYou've got thrusters for 6 directions and a newtonian flight model (\"auto-thrust\" helps compensate and can be toggled on/off any time). I've had many hours of fun dogfighting with enemy fighters and wearing down larger ships and trying to avoid their firing arcs. Learn the controls and/or change them to something that works for you and it will pay off. I went through 2 or 3 setups until I decided to map the up, down, left and right thrusters to my hat switch. Lots of ships have turrets so whatever you do, make use of those thusters!\n\nIf you're in a bigger ship, you can press F5 to go into Command Mode which makes it kind of like Bridge Commander. Take control of the ships turrets while trying to bring those big forward guns around. Very cool. I just have not used it much since I apparently like pretending to be an ace pilot.\n\nOnce you start having big fleet battles, you may want to use the tactical/RTS mode. You can slow down time while you give orders- and oh boy, can you give orders! There is more going on here than I can really tell you so I will just say tactical mode can be an incredibly powerful tool for the player. You wont be forced to use it but the more ships there are, the more useful it will be. It's a bit like Homeworld or Nexus: the Jupiter Incident, I think.\n\nThe ships are all awesome and unique, you can upgrade the heck out of them (even upgrade the amount of upgrades they can have), and they almost all have a cool secondary weapon. I still go back to flying a Brick from time to time. It's slow and weak but it can lay mines that turn into heat-seeking missiles :D\n\nRight now, the biggest ship you can fly is a frigate with cruisers, destroyers and carriers still to come. Ship capturing and base capturing are still to be implemented but the \"end game\" is that the player will be able to take over the entire sector.\n\nRandom info:\nThe game is meant to be played with mouse and keyboard so joystick is optional\nLow system requirements- my GTS 450 is still going strong\nIt's $15\nIt's not 4x but it is a sandbox- set up auto trading and mining to get those credits flowing\n\nI would say if you are looking for fun, intense space combat look no further. Even in it's Early Access state you should at least get your money's worth. \n\nP.S. Just be aware that this is not baby's first space game. When you play games like this you usually have to take some time to figure stuff out. Don't hesitate to ask questions on the forums.\n\nP.P.S.

The art style is simplistic yet consistent and enjoyable.  All the ships and weapons seem pretty well balanced.  The AI is pretty good.  Keyboard and mouse control is very tight, I prefer a joystick but I found those controls too loose and unrefined, and you can't customize axis sensitivity (yet).  Progression is good at this point, you'll be upgrading to better ships in no time after your first few missions.  I have about 12 hours so far and I've gotten a corvette, which is 1 tier below the highest available in the game so far.\n\nThere is no speed limit (!).  Most space games don't do this because simulated physics problems, but it's so immersion breaking.  It's exciting to try to outrun an opponent, which you'll have to do if you want to \"warp\" away to the overworld.  Your weapons have a limited range of around 1km, so you can't attack from super far away, nor can you effectively fly like a bat out of hell so fast and engage in combat and put down more than a few shots.\n\nSpeaking of the overworld, this is such a great way to traverse the map.  It's basically a 2D map that you fly on to simulate warp speed, you can see other ships, friend and foe while in this overworld map and get an idea if you want to attack them.  Sometimes they might pursue you too.\n\nSome negatives, but keep in mind these didn't ruin my enjoyment of the game, and it is Early Access:\n\nThe game crashed a few times on me, but it autosaves often enough that I never lost any progress.  Loading times are minimal and I was back in no time.\n\nA story is planned, but so far little is present beyond the introduction.  Their are plenty of missions to do to earn credits and get used to game mechanics, I am anxious for the story though.\n\nMost of the time the AI is good, but there are some enemy ships I would find that would just sit there and let me beat them up.

Rebel Galaxy comes to mind.\n\nObservations:\nHowever, this is a sandbox. The script driving the story has not intruded in my vast hour and a 1/2 experience. ;)\n\nMouse control is tricky - not necessarily bad, but tricky. Takes practice and settling into a style that suits. A different way to view the action other than the default cockpit view or maybe a change in tactics - strafing runs versus dogfights.\nEDIT - there is now a setting for return to dead zone - on 50% I can fly like a pro.\n\nThe artwork is different. I like it. It becomes immersive and transparent. \nThe ships types are many and varied. The ships with turrets are animated as the turrets follow targets et cetera.\nA stylized sort of Art - Deco look. A fresh visual rather than the ubiquitous Steam Punk or Homeworld - esque.\n\nThe tutorials are accessed in a base via the \"Simulator.\" I heartily suggest playing through them.\n\nThe \"Overworld\" map view is similar to Homeworld although not as detailed. Still it is functional. I have used it to skirt enemy ships I spotted on the way to a mission objective. \nEDIT - the dev is working like a madman. Since I first got the game the overworld map and its function has been enhanced & expanded.\n\nThe developer is very responsive and seems to be hard at work. Since obtaining the game (9/25) I have seen two updates? (More like 6, now) Also friendly. My first few comments were not flattering and yet I was greeted with suggestions to alleviate my problems in the game. (And they are MY problems)\nWhen I first read the timeline and expected progress I rolled my eyes and figured, \"Riiiiiiight.\" Now, I quite expect things to progress apace.\nEDIT -  no crepe. There are so many updates. I am certain the timeline is real and the expected progress is very believable. \n\nAnd I have yet to plumb the depth of the game.\nSo far, I have been playing courier and debris wrecker. \nEDIT - Now I am a Bounty Hunter. Mostly civilians because the pirates are too difficult for me at the moment. But that is the game. Choose your profession and pursue it any way you like.\n\nFunny point between the two games - in Rebel Galaxy (or Mount and Blade: Warband, Freelancer, Homeworld & X3) the graphics are of the polished, cinematic variety. Explosions are Star Wars style WOWs! In VD2, you blow up a ship or debris etc and you get a momentary white out of the screen - so much for cinema. \nEDIT Viewed from a respectable distance the explosions are a bit more cinematic, with debris spinning off etc.\nAlso there are hints that the reason the skybox appears as it does is because us \"stubs\" see the Electro-Magnetic Spectrum differently than regular humans.\nWhen the story line is implemented...I can only imagine.\n\nVoid Destroyer 2 is reminiscent of cel animations. VD2 (yeah, that makes me giggle) wins big on this one, though.\nVD2 bases are 3d objects and not pretty pixels that you \"crash\" into to hear that female, \"Docking\" exhalation.\nYou can fly circles around the bases in VD2.\nEDIT - leaving certain bases and you'll see a lot of traffic weaving in and out of the base.\n\nAs far as negative issues, I am down to one.\n\nMusic - I can name games with good soundtracks on one hand. This one is not memorable.\n\nI would very easily recommend this game if you enjoy RG and the notion of a true sandbox in which to play.\nThe plans for the game are fantastic.\n\nTwo thumbs up.", "timestamp_created": 1475561164, "timestamp_updated": 1477027362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25832789": {"recommendationid": "25832789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003340520", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480865083}, "language": "english", "review": "Its like that first time you play Borderlands, you're thinking \"looks like a cartoon... holy crap I just burned a dude to death with a SMG!\" Well this is more along the lines of \"I just killed a pirate with my cannon that shoots asteroids!\" I get the same feelings I got the first time I played X2: flying around space, running away, shootin stuff, running away, upgrading my ship, running away, getting a bigger ship, chasing stuff, running .... \n\nIt's still early access, buy very playable.", "timestamp_created": 1475465222, "timestamp_updated": 1475465222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25828664": {"recommendationid": "25828664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072772892", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493054756}, "language": "english", "review": "Mount & Blade in space with an incredibly hard working, dedicated and kind developer.

[/h1]\n\nVoid Destroyer 2 is a space sandbox game (and the sequel to Void Destroyer) developed by Iteration 11, a one-man dev \u2018team\u2019. In Void Destroyer 2 (VD2) you start with nothing, in fact you start as nothing. Confused and disoriented you wake up in a small, fighter class with two men talking you through how to fly your ship, it acts as an introduction to the premise of the game as well as a tutorial. After completing this fairly short but useful tutorial section, you\u2019re free to explore the sandbox doing as you please (within the game\u2019s limitations of course). \n\nGetting around in VD2 requires the use of VD2\u2019s \u2018Overworld View\u2019, it\u2019s pretty similar to how the Mount & Blade games work. You have an overview of the whole map and you move around between spaceports and other points of interest using it. The reason you\u2019ll want to use it is because Overworld View has Time Compression, in other words you\u2019ll get around much quicker than just flying there normally. The Overworld View displays everything from ships (different classes of ships have different icons) to asteroid fields and of course it also displays all the different spaceports. The Overview View is only available if you\u2019re a set distance away from certain objects, the distance away you need to be is usually related to the size of the object or how dangerous it is, for example a cleared out mine-field only requires you to be 1000 units away whereas you have to be 10,000 units away from hostile ships before you can enter Overworld View. You\u2019re also pulled out of Overworld View when you get too close to an object.\n\nOutside of Overworld View most of your time will be spent actually controlling your ship (there\u2019s also a tactical view which can be used to control your fleet). VD 2\u2019s controls are good and all the ship handling felt good to me. There\u2019s also a good amount of difference in handling between the different ships I\u2019ve flown so far. How well a ship can maneuver during flight depends on how fast you\u2019re going, your ship\u2019s cruise speed or lower is the optimum speed to turn at as the correction rockets are able to manage your momentum in different directions so you keep going in the direction you\u2019re actually facing. You can of course go faster than your cruise speed (as well as turn off auto-correction) but generally you\u2019ll only want to do that if you\u2019re trying to quickly leave or get to an area. \n\nAs with most space sandbox games, there are three main ways of earning money in VD2: trading, mining & completing jobs picked up from spaceports. From what I\u2019ve seen so far, trading is the best way to earn large amounts of reasonably quickly (especially if you have fleet or hired ships, more on those later). Mining is fairly self-explanatory, I\u2019ve never been a fan of mining in space sandboxes so I haven\u2019t messed around with it too much though there are ways of having ships automatically mine for you. As for the jobs, there\u2019s currently a decent variety of jobs available to you, ranging from simple courier jobs to escort missions and bounty hunting. Each spaceport offers different jobs to you, some of the jobs will require that you use a faction ship. Completing jobs (of a certain difficulty, the level of difficulty required depends on what your level already is) will increase your relationship with the faction. Some ships available to buy at spaceports require a certain faction level before you can buy them.\n\nThe main idea of the game is that you start with next to nothing and as you progress you become more powerful. You do this in two ways. The first, and most obvious way, is by purchasing increasingly better ships when the money becomes available to you. The other way is to purchase new ships (or use older ships you\u2019ve upgraded out of) to create a personal fleet of ships, as it stands there is no maximum fleet capacity or any upkeep costs. If you can\u2019t afford to buy ships but need some backup or extra cargo capacity, you can also hire ships. Hiring ships is pretty cheap right now and the way it works is that you pay a set fee for each ship you have hired (you can hire a maximum of three) each time you dock at a spaceport. Each spaceport has certain ships which are available for you to hire and you may not be able to find what you\u2019re looking for at each spaceport. \n\nAs you\u2019d expect with an Early Access games, there are some bugs. I\u2019ve had a few crashes so far as well as some minor bugs where my ship spins out of control when colliding with something or having my ship change positions randomly when trying to enter Overworld View while targeting a moving object such as debris. There have also been some issues with the way the achievements have been set up but chaosavy (the dev\u2019s Steam name) has been working on fixing that. Speaking of chaosavy, he\u2019s super active in the Steam forums (in fact posting in the forum is the easiest way to get a hold of him) which is great to see, especially with an Early Access game.\n\nMy main issue with the game as it stands is that the trading side of things feels a bit unbalanced. When I started trading I had roughly 60,000 credits and through hiring ships and after figuring out a good trade route I was sitting on 600,000 credits. It took me an hour to get to that point. I don\u2019t want it to be like it is in Elite Dangerous where you have to grind for tens of hours to afford what you want but I feel like the game would definitely benefit from it taking a tad longer to get the best ships. Alternatively, trading could be more difficult by having groups of wandering pirates who might attack you while you\u2019re travelling. If this is already in the game, then I didn\u2019t see any of them during said hour so I was able to go without upgrading my very basic ship.\n\nFurthermore, VD 2 felt a little bare to me in some areas. Not necessarily lacking content (though more job variety would be welcome) but it just didn\u2019t feel like a lived in game-world at some points. For example, when travelling close to spaceports I never saw any ships coming in or out of the spaceports. It\u2019s a relatively small detail, and at this stage it\u2019s definitely not a priority, but I would like to see it addressed at some point down the line. Another improvement in this department would be more ships \n\n[h1]Verdict [/h1]\n\nVoid Destroyer 2 is off to a good start, it isn\u2019t without issues and it can feel bare at times but it's still a very enjoyable edition to the space sandbox genre. It has a long way to go but due to how hard chaosavy/Iteration 11 has been working even since release to fix things and improve the game I\u2019m confident that a good final product will be delivered.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/lonerangerreviews]Lone Ranger Reviews.[/url][/i]\n\nEl K.", "timestamp_created": 1474776124, "timestamp_updated": 1474776274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.805755", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25683465": {"recommendationid": "25683465", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968438488", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507760806}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game for early access, really fun engaging gameplay.\n\nA few good things that caught my eye so far:\n- awesome mix of RTS and space combat;\n- exciting dogfights;\n- the score and sound design set a great atmosphere;\n- ship and station models are beautifully crafted;\n- plenty of upgrades to tweak your personal fleet;\n- highly customizable controls;\n- much to do and much more to come with development;\n- great dev;\n- runs smooth as silk for me, not a single crash so far.\n\nYup, off to build my space empire.... hopefully the wife will understand my absence", "timestamp_created": 1474773047, "timestamp_updated": 1474773047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25677879": {"recommendationid": "25677879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048729780", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514279085}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was an instant buy for me and it has many of the features I wanted in a space  combat sandbox game.

I sell the mining ships to buy a light fighters which the game described as a high grade fighterm yet while the mining ships has upgrade of auto turrets, shield generator, the new fighter has nothing but slightly better hp (meant nothing compare to the shield generator), speed (that is all it good for), and railgun (auto turrets is better since it can predict AI flight algorithm and do constant damage as long as they are insight and tell you when something is on your tail), and the upgrade pool comprised of useless stuffs. Totally kill the feeling of progression.\n\n3/ You are not even starting out as the weak one like in the trailer. If you see my 2nd point, your first ship is op, the shield generator and auto turrets is very cheap and you can get one after doing 2 or 3 missions. All you need is doing the flight simulator (which acts as the optional tutorial) once and know the basic control and the AI pirate will never be able to hit you, get shield generator and the auto turrets and you can grind straight for a freighter and ignore other ships.\n\n4/ The hyperspace mechanic need to be fix or optimized, or at least the combat response mechanic should. In an escort mission the cargo ship I had to protect got intercepted by pirates and I have to switch from world views to flight mode to response. Somehow I still in hyperspace speed, and I have to both reduce the standard speed from 3000ms to 180ms while turn around to prepare for combat (since I was riding the the new fighter without that shield generator I can't afford to take first hit). The result that my craft spin around like crazy and crash the game. \nAnd the I should be the one decide which route the cargo ship should take. The mission was stupid, the cargo ship stay from the straight path to the destination and drift straight toward the pirate ships. I am ok with conspiracy theory that the cargo ship weird pathing was an inside job, but it felt like the game just throw random shits at me.", "timestamp_created": 1516845568, "timestamp_updated": 1516846555, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1516889745, "developer_response": "If you are curious about updates here is the change log - http://steamcommunity.com/app/369530/discussions/4/358415738185478845/ - I hope that you can clearly see that the game is very frequently updated - at least weekly (every date entry is a update).\n\nMajor updates are listed here - http://steamcommunity.com/games/369530/announcements/ - including development videos.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss some of the issues you are having - the best place is on the main forums.

This review is coming from someone who avidly place space sims, from Elite to the X series. \n\nOn that note, I'd like to warn people new to this genre that the mechanics won't be the easiest to pick up on at first.

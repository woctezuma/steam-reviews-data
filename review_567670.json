Talos Principle is in there too but I haven't played it yet.  The Last Hope is a stand in one spot and shoot whetever stands in front of you style shooter.  Unfortunately it seems like that's the most common type of VR shooter.  Probably because there's far less chance of getting sick if you're not spinning around and they'er quick and easy to develope.\nSo far the best VR shooter for me has been Farpoint for the PSVR.  The locomotion mechanics of that game are the most satisfying I've experienced yet.  Serious Sam 3 VR is exactly the same as the original game, except it's been modified to work well with VR.  It's actually a heck of a lot of fun.\nBy default you're transporting around like you do in most other VR games where you have to walk around to travel.  But what's nice is you can change it so you can use the analog sticks to walk around like you would with a standard controller.  It is nice, but it does sometimes seem to stutter a little bit.  I have a 5.1 GHz 7700K, 32 GB of 3466 MHz DDR4, SLI GTX 1080 Ti's OC'd to 2160 MHz/11.3 GHz, 960 Evo SSD, Rift running via HDMI and USB 3.1, two sensors running USB 3.0 and another one running USB 2.0.  I have the settings turned all the way up and it runs pretty good.  I'm running single GPU atm, I will try SLI and edit my review if it works.  But you still get occassional stuttering, but only really when you're turning.  Which is why I changed the controls so I can still walk around but the turn it's, uh, not sure what to call it.  Jumping like 45* in whichever direction you choose like it does on similar VR games.  Since when you turn around with your physical body it changes the direction your character is facing I am able to combine the two methods of turning to allow me to play without it feeling too harsh.  I have been into 3D for quite a few years so I was immediately able to adapt to VR.  It takes a lot to give me motion sickness.  So I can play it well enough, but it's not comfortable 100% of the time.\nThe graphics are really good if you have the system to run the game at very high levels of anti alisaing, super sampling or resolution scaling.  The audio is pretty good, same as the oringal game.  You can hold a gun in both hands and there's a laser from each to tell you where you're aiming.\nIn the end I wouldn't say it's as smooth as Farpoint regarding locomotion.  But to be fair, Farpoint is bascially designed around not letting you spin completely around, they designed the game to keep your facing forward as often as possible since the PS4 has no rear tracking.  But the gun you get with that game is epic.  I would love to have one for games with my Rift.  I saw Vive has one, but don't know anything about it.\nBasically I definitely recommend this game if you're into shooters and you have a VR headset.  It very well may be the best first person shooter available on the PC at this moment.  I'm sure Doom will crush it soon enough.\n\nEDIT:\nSLI does work.  It works extremely well and scaling is really good.  Although, I can't imagine the GPU that could max out all this games settings and run this game flawlessly.  It probably won't exist for another 5 years. I mean 4x SSAA+8xMSAA and 400% Resolution Scaling.  I can run the game pretty reliably with all other settings maxed at 150% Res.

Just finished the campaign on normal difficulty (11h) and there is still a lot to do.\n\nGreat work on the port, as expected from Croteam.\nThe gameplay works perfectly. I use smooth trackpad locomotion with touch-to-move relative to controller orientation.\nSome scenes and ambiances gains a lot from VR. Combats are also more visceral.\nSometimes the assets show their age, and are a bit too much recycled, but level design makes up for it.\nOverall the pacing is great, it's hard to stop playing (want to see what's next).\n\nThe only thing that could be improved (except making Serious Sam 4 VR), is that cutscenes camera switch too much. Maybe I missed an option or something, didn't look for it as it's a very minor problem.\n\nEdit: I cannot stop listening to the OST (DLC for flat screen version).

I bought all Serious Sams right on release and enjoyed them so much that I also bought the re-releases: HD and VR. However the VR version tops it all!

Although it offers a lot of options to tailor the VR experience to your likings, I enjoy the traditional movement (into the direction you point the Vive controller at) the most: you can move like in the old days of flat gaming but you get a feeling of really beeing there and shooting the alien scum feels so extremely good in VR. Of course everything else stays the same: the same good humor, nice level design, good variation in different enemies and attack patterns.

Die VR Portierung des Originals ist wiedereinmal hervorragend gelungen. Vielen lieben Dank daf\u00fcr! \nEs ist schon herrlich mit dem Hammer wirklich zuschlagen zu k\u00f6nnen, statt einfach nur einen Knopf zu dr\u00fccken ;-)\nIch vergebe eine klare Kaufempfehlung f\u00fcr alle VR Shooter Freunde (und solche, die es werden wollen). Unterst\u00fctzt bitte diese tollen Entwickler, damit wir auch Serious Sam 4 in VR erleben d\u00fcrfen!\n\nPunkte: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1510265914, "timestamp_updated": 1510286039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636315", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36406089": {"recommendationid": "36406089", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978829443", "num_games_owned": 852, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510532970}, "language": "english", "review": "Serious Sam 3 VR: BFE is amazing.\n\nEven though I love Serious Sam First Encounter and Second Encounter in VR, and feel that The Last Hope is an excellent rail shooter, I still felt that Doom 3 BFG VR was the crown jewel of the first person shooter VR experience.\n\nAfter my first hours with SS3 VR, I think it's possibly been dethroned.\n\nSS3 is polished and different and has a (slightly) more methodical play style. It's still about mowing down hordes of interesting (though prdictable) arcade-style baddies, usually in corridors and arenas, though here the environments are sometimes a bit more complex.\n\nIt's the crown jewel in the crown of SS Fusion. I intended to write a positive SS3 review on the SS3 VR store page, but silly Steam doesn't know that I've played it since I play it in Fusion. Might have to leave the non-Fusion variant of the game running just to get a positive review up there.\n\nLong story short: same genre, plays a bit different, if anything higher quality. Don't miss it.

I do recommend this game, because for an endless runner (even though it's not endless) type game, it has a lot of variety.  There's basically 4 different runner games and 3 play similarly but the sound catcher VR mode plays a lot differently.  I believe each game mode is also randomly generated.   There's easy, normal, and hard mode.  \n\nEven at easy, you will get fatigued pretty quickly.  That's because you're moving from side to side, and crouching often.  You're dodging all kind of obstacles and trying to collect coins, candy, etc.  In the Soundcatcher VR game, you're collecting notes to play the song selected.  I'm not sure if it should be called a rhythm game, because catching the notes has more to do with getting a high score than it has to do with doing it to the beat.  At least I saw no correlation with the beat of the music and grabbing the items.   I would call it an endless runner with music and obstacles to get around.\n\nStill, I had fun.  I enjoyed the huge variety within the game type.  With the music added, there's just endless fun to be had if you enjoy this type of thing.  However, I woudln't compare it to Audioshield or any other music rhythm game.  I just don't see this game as such.  Still, it's fun, a nice workout, and easily worth the current sale price of $3.59.\n\nSale Price Rating 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1509516782, "timestamp_updated": 1509516911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35779997": {"recommendationid": "35779997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144974649", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508451968}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay what the hell.\n\nI played for 11 minutes and the last time I felt like this was when my highschool football coach made us sprint across the field and back 10 times in a row.\n\nIdk if my heart...or my fat can take this sh*t.

The gameplay involves having to catch as many coins or candies as possible, whilst avoiding and dodging obstacles. If you reach the end of a round you will receive a score in points, but if your head hits any of the obstacles the round ends and you lose. There different environments, a classic environment in which you are trying to collect coins, a Halloween themed mode in which you go through a haunted house trying to collect the candies, and a running track environment in which you press the trigger buttons repeatedly to run as fast a possible this time again catching the coins, always moving and dodging in all the environments. There are also different difficulty modes available (easy, medium and hard). The game is good for some casual fun, but also will get your heart racing, and is surprisingly challenging as you try to make it to the end without losing, so definitely has some replay value too making it perfectly priced. The design of the game is simple but very cute and quirky, I particularly liked the Halloween themed environment as little details change slightly every time you enter the house. The music is also well chosen and works well for each of the environments. The game really takes advantage of room-scale VR and would be ideal for a big play space. Overall, a fun, surprisingly challenging and enjoyable game to play (provided that you have the space).", "timestamp_created": 1501603836, "timestamp_updated": 1501625810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500903", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33867776": {"recommendationid": "33867776", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966636457", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501283654}, "language": "english", "review": "This company needs to stop doing the main game and move on to this youtube based one they have.

I wasn't sure what to expect seeing as how the only vr runners that I have played were very very bad about making me motion sick.\n\nThe only thing in this game that made me motion sick at all was one of the pill effects that twists and destorts everything. But that's what you get for taking those drugs!!!!\n\nOther then that absolutely incredible. Probably one of my favorite games out at the moment. There are a lot of good games coming out this month but I bet this will make it to my top five list of games released this month.\n\nThis game will make you move, duck, dodge, reach, grab, fall, laugh, sweat.\nThis game could very well give holopoint a run for it's money on how much this game makes me work and sweat. \n\nHands down if you like games that will make you test your endurance while playing and double as a workout then this game is worth every bit of the asking price.\n\nThe premise is simple, you dodge the obstacles and grab the coins, but it's so uppaced and addicting that I don't want to put it down!\n\n(Below is a video of the gameplay in this game, it is not a review but merely here as an example to show you the gameplay full with webcam recording.)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=717672319", "timestamp_created": 1467665194, "timestamp_updated": 1467673308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24092257": {"recommendationid": "24092257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003355829", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467664154}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Hiki tuli, hyv\u00e4 oli.", "timestamp_created": 1467664521, "timestamp_updated": 1467664521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24087249": {"recommendationid": "24087249", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960310657", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485961749}, "language": "english", "review": "Very promising and guaranteed to get a sweat on. Addictively challenging, and even if you keep failing, you can't help but immediately try again. It also helps that the level has various iterations and so is different than the last time when you retry. Looking forward to refinements and more levels, but to be honest I have yet to complete the first level! I've managed a 15 minute burst just now, and if you are looking to get in shape and exercise in a fun way, this game is it!", "timestamp_created": 1467653607, "timestamp_updated": 1467653607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512987", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}}

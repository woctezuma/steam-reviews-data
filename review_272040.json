The majority of the puzzles are relatively easy to solve and mainly serve to acquire and train useful strategies. The later puzzles, especially in the included premium section, can be ridiculously hard to perfect though.\n\nThe graphics consist of real photos of coloured paper and indicate a handmade surface texture with folding animations appearing like a haptic simulation. Appearance and sound form a theme around Japanese traditional culture and promote a relaxed puzzle environment. Since there's no time limit or other constraints, contemplating over individual moves can easily become an indulging experience lasting longer than expected.\n\nRemnant of the mobile version is the hint credit system which allegedly is still limited in uses and bound to a daily reset. Playing without hints is arguably the better experience though, as figuring out the right move after a long time of thinking is the most satisfying reward in itself. Before taking wild guesses out of frustration it's definitely better to take a break instead.\n\nKAMI's difficult solutions and beautiful aesthetics make it a great puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1516183723, "timestamp_updated": 1516183723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39187353": {"recommendationid": "39187353", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961766540", "num_games_owned": 1151, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478343420}, "language": "english", "review": "Great relaxing puzzle game", "timestamp_created": 1515433609, "timestamp_updated": 1515433609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38964446": {"recommendationid": "38964446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057787296", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492238854}, "language": "english", "review": "A short puzzle game with an aesthetically pleasing design that's equal parts challenging as it is relaxing.", "timestamp_created": 1514877940, "timestamp_updated": 1514877940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38904162": {"recommendationid": "38904162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027513073", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514731699}, "language": "english", "review": "Very relaxing puzzle that requires logical reasoning to understand how to spread colors through the table.\n\nTough levels that required more thinking are usually separated by more easier ones (at least it was so for me) so it never became frustrating.\n\nFor a real challenge, try to complete each puzzle within the number of minimal possible moves.\n\nA few final puzzles of the \"Premium\" level can be completed even with less than the minimal number of moves declared by the game.\n\nI really enjoyed it and I recommend it to anyone interested in puzzles that require observation and development of a tactic.", "timestamp_created": 1514732278, "timestamp_updated": 1514732278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38585420": {"recommendationid": "38585420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143183012", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514040346}, "language": "english", "review": "Relaxing gameplay and nice animations.

it, that you want to meet the developers and just say thank you. Well here is your chance http://www.stateofplaygames.com/about-us/\n\nKami is the name given to the type of paper used in Origami. Essentially in each puzzle you\u2019re presented with a colourful board filled with different coloured squares of Kami and your objective is to fill the board into a single colour using the shortest amount of moves possible. It might sound easy and some of the puzzles are, but as you progress your brain will definitely be challenged. There are no time requirements, no penalties for using the hint system and with the help of calming visuals and sound your time spent in this game will simply be a underwhelming satisfying puzzle Zen experience.\n\nThere are 45 Classic Kami Puzzles to solve and 17 that slightly alter the concept of the board that you\u2019re usually presented with in the premium category. While the game remains simplistic in its terms it achieves so much more than other games by delivering to the gamers something fresh, something unique and something that remains in harmony and loyal to its core theme, an attractive aesthetic puzzler that aims to relax.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wL2Ma7ZMce8\n", "timestamp_created": 1499261689, "timestamp_updated": 1499261689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637331", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33259475": {"recommendationid": "33259475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076515057", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507243163}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful little puzzle game that hits all the right notes.

The goal of every puzzle is to get the board to a single color in the fewest number of moves.\n\nKami ramps up appropriately, exploring various types of boards and helping you figure out new tricks and strategies. The puzzles are a nice blend of thinking through conceptually (what strategy should I use in deciding where to click?) and just clicking somewhere to see what happens. The puzzles can get fairly difficult, forcing you to change your plan of attack when it isn't working. Only one puzzle felt completely impossible; I tried it for an hour after beating the rest of the game but  finally gave up and used the hints. At the other end of the spectrum, maybe 30-50% of the puzzles are very easy, requiring one or two attempts.\n\nExcept for the level I couldn't solve, perfecting all the levels took about 7 hours. This is long enough to include a substantial amount of content, but not so long for the levels to feel repetitive or tedoius.\n\nThe atmosphere, graphics, and experience are smooth, with care put into the details. For example, the game allows you to click again while one click is still playing out -- this is really a no-brainer, but too many games don't have such features.\n\nCons: First, I would have appreciated some steam achievements for the game. Second, at least two later levels were solvable in fewer moves than the \"perfect\" solution; I personally would have appreciated the extra challenge. Finally, there is the minor annoyance that pressing ESC puts the game into small windowed mode instead of quitting (I'll get used to it).", "timestamp_created": 1498679098, "timestamp_updated": 1498726880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32936302": {"recommendationid": "32936302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043812518", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508956470}, "language": "english", "review": "great game for that price.", "timestamp_created": 1498658122, "timestamp_updated": 1498658122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32840784": {"recommendationid": "32840784", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996081733", "num_games_owned": 903, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "last_played": 1516253408}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like this game.

Game idea is very simple: click to change from one color to another all touching same color squares and in the end you have to make all field to same color. There isn't anything too complicated in the KAMI what makes it even more enjoyable and nice. \n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n\n[b] Satisfying. [/b] The way colors changes (unwraps like origami) is really staisfying and nice. It gives you feeling that everything is in order and there is no chaos between you and the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=913675909\n\n[b] Graphics. [/b] KAMI graphically looks really nice and there is no distractions anywhere. Developers didn't tried to overdo leavining game looking simple but beautiful.\n\n[b] Soundtrack. [/b] This game is relaxing and music just adds peace in the game. There is no tension anywhere and music hit the mark. Even though KAMI is puzzle based game I felt relaxed and calm after playing it.\n\n[h1] NEUTRAL [/h1]\n\n[b] Gameplay. [/b] Yes everything is calming and peaceful but there could be more in the gameplay. There is only 1 type of mechanics used in game and nothing more. At least there could be blocks that does different things (double colored, block that can't change color).\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1] \n\n[b] Levels design. [/b] Yeah levels design felt repetetive to me and some of levels looked very similar even though they palyed out differently still it gave feeling of repetition.\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1] \n\nI recommend to play KAMI for everyone feeling angry or bad in general because this game will make you feel more comfortable and relaxed. This game can be played by few minutes sessions and you won't forget how it is played because of simple mechanics. \n\n\nFor more reviews visit : [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/gabzysbroadcasts#curation] Gabzys the Curator\t[/url]\nIf you like it join group and follow me.

Kein Schnickschnack, nichts au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliches. \"Nur\" ca. 60 R\u00e4tsel folgender Art:\n\nEin Spielfeld aus farbigen K\u00e4stchen muss in so wenig wie m\u00f6glich Z\u00fcgen einfarbig werden. Pro Zug wird das ausgew\u00e4hlte K\u00e4stchen und alle gleichfarbigen anliegenden K\u00e4stchen mit der aktuellen Farbe gef\u00fcllt. Fertig. Das wars und kann doch ziemlich schwer werden.\n\nDer Tag \"Entspannung\" fand ich allerdings fehl am Platz. Meditativ fand ich daran nichts, es sei denn, auch \"Talos\" oder \"Portal\" empfindet man als entspannend und meditativ.\n\nDas Spiel beginnt, und das ist gut, mit ganz einfachen Aufgaben und steigert sich dann ganz erheblich. Ich h\u00e4tte nicht gedacht, dass es so schwierig werden kann, eine optimale L\u00f6sung zu finden. Hinterher (ist man kl\u00fcger, ich weiss) ist mir klar, dass man auch bei diesem R\u00e4tseltyp die Schwierigkeitsstufe beliebig steigern kann, dass keiner mehr mitkommt. Um es kurz zu machen, ich habe nicht alle R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6sen k\u00f6nnen (aber die meisten, immerhin).\n\nDie Musik ist tats\u00e4chlich nervig, aber ich schalte sie eh' ab, um mich konzentrieren zu k\u00f6nnen.\n\nEin Kritikpunkt von mir ist, dass in einer Gruppe der R\u00e4tsel die Schwierigkeit dadurch erheblich gesteigert wird, dass statt Farben gleichfarbige, unterschiedliche Muster verwendet werden. Das empfinde ich als Unfair-Play (weil aus einem Logik-R\u00e4tsel eine visuelle Herausforderung wird). Zum Gl\u00fcck sind dies nur 9 der ca. 60 R\u00e4tsel.\n\nPro & Contra:\n\n+ Gute R\u00e4tsel\n\no Muster statt Farben bei einigen R\u00e4tseln\n\n- Nervige Musik\n\nWertung: 09/10\n\nDas Spiel liefert was ich mir erhoffte: gute R\u00e4tsel. Also ist das Spiel gut. Aber 4 Euro? Da hab ich zum Gl\u00fcck im Sale zugegriffen.

Your puzzles were sweet, and your style was grand. How that sitar swooned me in the gentle february nights when I got perfects left and right.

So wrong. Your puzzles became devious, and your sparse, archaic mobile-style hint system with the only ability to wait for the timer to run down for my next set, in which I would use oh so sparingly. I needed my approving sitar, my golden perfect.\n\nOur peaceful days did not last. When in the deep of a puzzle, some where over a dozen flawless moves needed to be made, I discovered yet another transgression: no rewind button, only reset. The peace was over, and the fear of using too many hints drove me quite mad. Many times I would be a breath away from perfection, only to squander a certain move and have to start from scratch once more. Gruelling. Your cold beauty drove a steak through my puzzle loving heart.\n\nThe puzzles too, they withered in scale. No more were the clever patterns or cute little shapes, just guessing, guessing which color to start with, which amorphous shape to expand from. The challenge was gone, yet the frustration lived on. Oh KAMI, you could've been a classic, but you failed your own tenets of relaxing challenge and squandered your greatest assets as a thoughtful puzzler.\n\nKAMI, you really are quite something, but the people should know of your faults as well.

Deine Aufgabe ist es farben- und musterbasierte R\u00e4tsel dadurch zu l\u00f6sen, dass einzelne Teilfl\u00e4chen des R\u00e4tsels in ihrer Farbe ver\u00e4ndert werden bis die gesamte Fl\u00e4che einfarbig ist. \n\nZun\u00e4chst scheint Kami sowohl optisch als auch mechanisch ein recht simples Spiel zu sein, jedoch findet sich seine Sch\u00f6nheit in eben dieser Einfachheit. Die Farben des in den R\u00e4tseln verwendeten Tonpapiers sind lebendig und das Papier selbst ist fotorealistisch. Die Animationen sind glatt, Einzelst\u00fccke drehen und falten sich ansehnlich in die ausgew\u00e4hlte Farbe. Bei gro\u00dfen Fl\u00e4chen erzeugen diese \u00c4nderungen eine Art Kaleidoskop-Effekt.\n\nMusikalisch erinnert Kami an ein chilliges China-Restaurant; fast kann man die K\u00f6che in der K\u00fcche schreien h\u00f6ren. Die Musik l\u00e4sst sich insgesamt und insbesondere auch w\u00e4hrend der R\u00e4tsel an- oder ausschalten. Die Ger\u00e4usche beim Falten des Papiers sind kr\u00e4ftig und effektvoll. Man sp\u00fcrt f\u00f6rmlich das Papier zwischen den Fingern.\n\nEs gibt drei M\u00f6glichkeiten ein R\u00e4tsel zu beenden: \nmit einer perfekten Punktzahl,\nmit einem  Okay, \noder einem Fail. \n\nEine perfekte Punktzahl wird erreicht, wenn die Anzahl der \u00c4nderungen zum Erreichen einer einfarbigen Fl\u00e4che in der vom Spiel vorgegebenen Anzahl an Z\u00fcgen erreicht wird. Ein Okay ist mit der perfekten Anzahl der Spielz\u00fcge plus einem Spielzug erreicht. Alles andere ist ein Fail. Solltest Du in einem der Teils knackigen R\u00e4tsel stecken bleiben, kannst Du ein Hinweis-System nutzen.\n\nKami ist trotz seines Zen-\u00e4hnlichen Aussehens kein besonders leichtes daf\u00fcr aber ein spielenswertes R\u00e4tselspiel. Folglich empfehle ich es jedem der gerne r\u00e4tselt oder auch denjenigen die ihren lokalen Asiafood-Store zu sch\u00e4tzen wissen.

The art goes very well together with the sound design, which is mostly the sound of folding paper, but they got that one just right. Solving the puzzles means a lot of folding, but the sound and visuals never became repetitive, instead they give a constant sense of satisfaction at your progress. More importantly they don't distract you from solving the puzzles and remain a backdrop. The game also allows you to turn off the music, making contemplating the puzzles a smooth calming experience. \n\nOf course you don't play a puzzle game for the design, but to tickle your brain and at that KAMI excels. You will use your intuition and structural analysis to determine the optimal solution. The designers got the puzzle progression and the learning curve just right as I felt my skills improving until the very end of the game. As to the last and longest premium puzzle (3-9), I found a weak spot, finished it in 18 moves instead of the perfect 19 on my first try and was like \"meh\". In hindsight I see that means a very well designed puzzle(game).\n\nAt other times though, you won't see the solution, you won't get lucky and you will simply have to guess. And KAMI enables that. Restarting the puzzle and trying out other ideas are part of the gamedesign and feel natural. You are meant to do that - a lot. Sometimes trying out random things is even required before you start seeing any patterns.\n\nThere are two possible outcomes for each puzzle: the perfect solution (smallest amount of moves necessary to finish the puzzle) and an OK solution (perfect + 1 move). Any more than that and you fail - which obviously bears no consequences other than your increasing frustration. The amount of moves required is shown next to the puzzle, so you will know how well you are doing. The puzzles are meant to be finished with the perfect score, the OK solutions rarely require an eureka moment, which doesn't mean they are easy, but they definitely aren't a challenge. Even the sound the game makes after an OK solution says: \"At least you tried. Guess this will have to do.\" You can also have the game drop a limited amount of hints, though I don't recommend it, as there aren't many puzzles to begin with.\n\nThis brings me to the game's faults, of which there aren't many. Mostly, it is simply too short (which is of course only my subjective opinion). There are only 72 (45 regular + 27 premium) puzzles and the replay value is very small once you've found the perfect solutions, though with some premium puzzles you might want to examine your newfound solution in more detail. What is more, as you progress, the earlier puzzles become laughably easy. It took me about 8 hours to get everything I can out of this game.\n\nFurthermore, the second set of premium puzzles (one set is 9 puzzles) which uses abstract symbols instead of colours feels completely unnecessary. The difficulty is artificial and comes from the player having a hard time discerning between the markings. I would appreciate the change in visuals if it was well done. Alas, it is not and the puzzles in the second set are of little value.\n\nSome useful information to new players: it is possible to complete premium puzzles 3-5, 3-6, 3-8 and 3-9 in less moves than required for a perfect solution. It feels actually pretty sensible as they are somewhat tough to begin with and there is no real reason to punish the player for not finding the very bestest of solutions.\n\nAll in all I would definitely recommend getting this game for full price or on sale.

The gameplay is simple yet challenging; the goal being to convert the entire board into a single colour of paper within an alotted amount of moves. The amount of puzzles is quite large (20+ levels that contain 9 puzzles each) and they increase in difficulty over time by adding more colours of paper and through making denser shapes with them.\n\nThere are hints available to help with puzzles you're struggling with; however they are rationed daily to prevent you from rushing through the game unjustly; which I found enjoyable as it forced me to sit down and examine pieces for longer - which in turn increased my apprecation of the delicate nature of the design. \n\nMy only wish is that the thematic music (traditional japanese accents) was looped, or had a several tracks to move through. Currently the only music played is when the game is opened or when a puzzle is completed in the correct manner. These little tunes help encourage the setting intended by the designers, so it would have been nice to have more of the same - and with an option to mute or not (there is currently no mute function, meaning that if you put your own music on and complete a puzzle the in-game tunes will still play (I would have probably bought the OST as a bundle too if it was available)).\n\nBut that's just a minor complaint honestly. If you want to have a relaxing time and feel like you're being mentally challenged in a pleasing and charming way, then please buy this game. If nothing else, it's nice to have in your library when you want some quiet time to either just have some light fun or to just zone out and relax (i'd also recommened putting on some chill or classical music whilst playing, it just makes all that much more pleasing).\n", "timestamp_created": 1451086428, "timestamp_updated": 1451086428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513240", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19913069": {"recommendationid": "19913069", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972381235", "num_games_owned": 937, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1395023583}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun, relaxing game that I am happy to own on multiple devices.", "timestamp_created": 1450976609, "timestamp_updated": 1450976609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19911890": {"recommendationid": "19911890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114442907", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402928668}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0430.\u0417\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044f\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435.\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435", "timestamp_created": 1450973999, "timestamp_updated": 1450973999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19904788": {"recommendationid": "19904788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131837929", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473105214}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u773c\u82b1\u7f2d\u4e71", "timestamp_created": 1450957897, "timestamp_updated": 1450957897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19898873": {"recommendationid": "19898873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083197812", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450938823}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u70e7\u8111\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\uff0cBGM\u597d\u8bc4\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1450938957, "timestamp_updated": 1450938957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19876656": {"recommendationid": "19876656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031482056", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495017930}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like folding paper, except no paper cuts :^)", "timestamp_created": 1450884723, "timestamp_updated": 1450884723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19853964": {"recommendationid": "19853964", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970258162", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464558055}, "language": "english", "review": "Starts off all pretty and relaxing, but quickly becomes frustratingly hard.

easier at the same time. This is partly because you'll learn out-of-the-box strategies to solve some puzzles, which will show up again in later stages. Some of the trick solutions were particularly devious and brilliant, and I would never have even guessed the opening move if it weren't for the hint system.\n\nThe way the game gives you hints is fair, while still making you work for it. I played anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour every day until I finished the game, and a good chunk of that time was spent staring at puzzles because I used all my hint credits for the day, and nothing I tried was working. Only to laugh when I saw what the solution was the next day.\n\nA lot of puzzle games can be frustrating, but I found KAMI to be joyful and relaxing.

Still, since it had a very unique aesthetic, I decided to give it a go.\n\nVisually, I've got nothing to add. The game is beautiful, and it also fits the general aesthetic. The music is also good, enhancing the aesthetic, but not much in terms of immersion or gameplay... to me, anyway. Still, it's cool!\n\nThe puzzles are my problem. The first puzzles, I enjoyed! They were elegant, simple, and could still twist your brain a bit, when you found out that the most obvious solution wasn't the most efficient. I liked that. 4-6 moves was cool. The puzzles were also visually well put together! It's a gimmick, but it's well made nonetheless.\n\nThe problem, for me, comes with later puzzles, where the patterns turn into chaos, and moves going as far as 19. Without hints, there are waaaay too many possibilities with very few seams where one could start. (I'm mentioning the last level) Thankfully, the hint system helps a lot! It's also limiting, since you have a daily limit for it... Roots from mobile, I guess. One hint per level, later on, is ideal, since at least you know where to start. \n\nAll in all, it's just not my type of puzzle. There doesn't seem to be any real algorithm to solve it, and there barely are rules of approximation, later on. Initially, yes, sure. But later on, the levels are too chaotic for my taste. It's a matter of patience, at that point. \n\nThe levels have 2 solutions. One, is perfect, with the given number of moves. The other one, is \"ok\", where you have ONE additional move. It's impressive how much of a difference that one move makes!\nPerhaps it proves how ingenous the game can be. It's just not for me. It's like sliding block puzzles. I hate those!\n\nThe concept is simple, and it starts well! If it seems up your alley, go ahead! It's just not for me.\n\nThe premium levels (free on this version!) were a cool gimmick, but the middle set, in particular, had very obnoxious patterns. They were so similar that it was almost impossible to identify anything in the puzzle. The other were conveyed properly, though.\n\n\nThe solution is often awkward, not following any teaching of the game early on or anything.

It's pretty in a minimalist way with pleasant sound effects, although the limited music becomes grating quite quickly.\n\nMechanically it's simple but satisfying.  There's no progression of mechanics but there's a gentle and smooth difficulty curve, with puzzles building on what's been learned from earlier ones.  Puzzles are set out in groups of nine, but within those there are commonly subgroups of three puzzles which are increasingly difficult variations on a common theme.\n\nOn the whole I'd say the difficulty for puzzle fans is easy to moderate, although the last set of 'premium' puzzles (extra on the mobile version, included in the Steam version) are quite challenging.  After five hours' playtime I'm currently 98% complete - I have two of the 63 puzzles where I haven't hit the move budget - and I can't see there being any short-term replayability, but this is reflected in the relatively low price.", "timestamp_created": 1439906765, "timestamp_updated": 1439906765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17547879": {"recommendationid": "17547879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049386878", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 35259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454329494}, "language": "english", "review": "preety nice game", "timestamp_created": 1439629795, "timestamp_updated": 1439629795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522085", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17449413": {"recommendationid": "17449413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243402526", "num_games_owned": 1137, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441329945}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most interesting puzzle experiences yet!", "timestamp_created": 1439070631, "timestamp_updated": 1439070631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17382920": {"recommendationid": "17382920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073153589", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471705104}, "language": "german", "review": "nettes Spiel f\u00fcr zwischendurch.

Well worth the price. \n\nMy only real gripe is that the second set of the premium puzzles were much unlike the others, as instead of simple colours, the folded paper had harsh black and white patterns, which really hurt my eyes and made it difficult to focus on the screen, which meant I had to keep coming back to them later. I understand that the patterns were used to add to the difficulty, but it wasn't for me. \n\nOther than that though, the game is perfect (in my opinion, of course), and the level of difficulty is just about right. You can always aim for \"OK\" scores rather than \"perfect\" if the challenge is a bit much on some of the puzzles, but personally I love the challenge of solving the puzzle in the absolute minimum number of moves.

The colour palette is well choose, \n\nI cut the music after some time after several hours as I'm playing it in between other stuff so it was an annoyance after some time. The sound at the end of a puzzle whatever you win or loose is way to loud and I didn't see any slider for that, even in windows it's at the minimum and still too loud.\n\nI was playing strata before and it has too many puzzle, at the end I didn't felt the joy to finish each one as they were all the same. KAMI doesn't suffer from that in my opinion. The classic mode offer a large amount of different puzzle and the advanced mode give you some more, with the particularity of change the colour, which give quite a difficulty I think as it's tricking your eyes into error, I got of lot of fun doing those.\n\nHints system is good, but perhaps it's a bit much, if used on the same puzzle you can go up to 7 move on the 19 move last puzzle. But that one was crazy and I'm glad I had those helper. When I say tooo easy it's because you have 10 credits per day and the first hint cost 3, then it decreases. Even if it can feel cheating, on this game I didn't have that feeling, perhaps as I was unable to finish some of them and glad I could have an helper instead of looking for the solution ^^.\n\nSo I do recommend KAMI, for people who like puzzle game. It is a great fun.\n\n\nPS: Do not pay attention to my number of hours spent on the game as I idled a lot on it.\n\nLuuna.", "timestamp_created": 1425336156, "timestamp_updated": 1425336234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14724584": {"recommendationid": "14724584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078221334", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413810274}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u041e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430, \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437 \u043e\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0443\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0438 - \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0430\u0441.\n\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u0441 \u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432, \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435. \u0421\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e, \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0451\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u044f \u0432 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b.", "timestamp_created": 1425307340, "timestamp_updated": 1425307340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14705325": {"recommendationid": "14705325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088214798", "num_games_owned": 749, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425195453}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u76ca\u667a\u904a\u6232\u985e\u7684\u5091\u51fa\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u7576\u7136\u5728steam\u4e0a\u9762\u7684\u76ca\u667a\u904a\u6232\u90fd\u5f88\u68d2\u5566\n\u9019\u6b3e\u7684\u7279\u9ede\u5728\u65bc\u7f8e\u8853\u98a8\u683c\u4ee5\u53ca\u80cc\u666f\u97f3\u6a02\uff0c\u904a\u6232\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e5f\u7b97\u53cb\u5584\n\u50f9\u683c\u89aa\u6c11\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5165\u904e\u6148\u5584\u5305\uff0c\u6709\u8208\u8da3\u7684\u9084\u4e0d\u5feb\u5165\u624b\n\n\u7f3a\u9ede:\u4e0d\u652f\u63f4\u6210\u5c31\u7cfb\u7d71(\u4e0d\u904e\u4e5f\u9084\u597d\uff0c\u4e0d\u7528\u70ba\u4e86\u5168\u57ce\u5c31\u62da\u6b7b\u62da\u6d3b)", "timestamp_created": 1425196472, "timestamp_updated": 1425196472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.970223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14693261": {"recommendationid": "14693261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100871281", "num_games_owned": 3904, "num_reviews": 172, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425137605}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u6b3e\u89e3\u8c1c\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u662f\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u5757\u7684\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u5427\u5168\u90e8\u7684\u65b9\u5757\u90fd\u53d8\u6210\u540c\u4e00\u79cd\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u633a\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1425138067, "timestamp_updated": 1425138067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14686234": {"recommendationid": "14686234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164751765", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425005856}, "language": "english", "review": "A similar mechanic to the \"Flood\"-type games on Android, but so much more aesthetically pleasing.

In the end, you won't touch it again after solving every level, b/c there is nothing else to do (no achievements, no bonus content, maybe they'll add some levels again later, but don't count on it).

You can choose any color and change any other continuous section of squares into squares of that color. Your goal is to change the entire field of squares into a single color (though it can be any color) within a limited number of moves.\n\nStory\n\n\tAs a pure puzzle game, there is no story to this game.\n\nGameplay\n\n\tThere are no real twists to the gameplay; every level in the game operates identically. Your progress is measured in how many moves it takes for you to succeed; if you complete a stage in the minimum number of moves possible, you get a \u201cperfect\u201d grade for the stage, and if you take one extra move, you get an OK grade. If you take two or more moves more than the minimum number of moves, you fail. You can restart each stage at any time, and three times per day, you can get a hint, which simply tells you what the first move in the puzzle is.\n\t There are 9 stages in each \u201cset\u201d of stages, and 8 sets of stages overall, for a total of 56 stages. The stages start out fairly easy, but get progressively more difficult, adding more colors and more complexity to the patterns, and requiring increasingly greater numbers of moves. Early on, the puzzles can frequently be solved in three moves; by the end of the game, the final set\u2019s easiest puzzle requires 8 moves, and the hardest set requires a whopping 19 \u2013 the initial \u201cpattern\u201d on many of these later puzzles looks almost like a random set of squares.\n\tThe closest thing to a \u201ctwist\u201d the game throws at the player is a single set of puzzles which uses black and white patterns on the squares in the place of the colored squares used in all the other puzzles; unfortunately, while it looks somewhat pretty, it makes the game harder primarily via interface screw, namely making it more difficult to tell which squares have which pattern.\n\tOddly, there are a few puzzles in the game where the so-called \u201cperfect\u201d score isn\u2019t; there are a few puzzles where it is, in fact, possible to actually beat the \u201cperfect\u201d score. Whether or not this is intentional is hard to tell, though it doesn\u2019t really detract from the experience; it is just an oddity.\n\nGraphics\n\n\tThe game actually looks very nice and clean; the colored squares appear to be made out of construction paper, and the patterned squares have a very aesthetically pleasing visual appearance as well. The entire game\u2019s user-interface is very straightforward and easy to use, though the \u201cget a hint\u201d system is somewhat strange in that hints cost three \u201cpoints\u201d to use and you get ten points per day \u2013 meaning that you end up with an extra, leftover useless \u201cpoint\u201d if you use up all your hints for the day.\n\nFinal Summary\n\n\tAs a mobile game, this is a fairly reasonable choice; it is ideally suited for a touch interface, and the games are quite short, with the puzzles taking only a few minutes to solve each. Unfortunately, as a PC game, it is fairly lacking; it is not a very substantive experience, and while it is \u201cenjoyable\u201d in the same sort of way that solving a Sudoku puzzle is, it isn\u2019t especially entertaining, and similar levels of entertainment can be found for free on the internet. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with it; it just isn\u2019t a very fulfilling experience.\n", "timestamp_created": 1407570499, "timestamp_updated": 1407570499, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520077", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11595174": {"recommendationid": "11595174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058838611", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411174756}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game in a bundle, thinking it was just another silly puzzle game which could be accomplished in a matter of a couple hours. Well, not having anything to do, I started it up and was very surprised at what I got. The object of this game is to turn all the tiles one solid color. The trick is that the tiles you change will stop when they hit another color. For example, let's say there are two sides, red and blue, you turn one of the sides into the other by clicking on the side with the other color, solved. However, if there is a black tile in the blue zone, when turned red, every tile will turn except those behind the black tile, not being the same color. The visuals are fairly nice, limited but nice. The music is very nice, a calming, simple tune which is pleasent to hear. I will say that in the puzzles it is turned off. I found out just now by exploring that you can keep it on during the puzzles. Simply going to the options menu via a button, which I thought was a credits screem, will give you that option. The only negative, aside from that which is a nitpick, is that this game features two sets of puzzles: Classic and Premium. The classic puzzles are very enjoyable, increasing in difficulty but never very difficult, just hard enough. The same cannot be said for the premium puzzles. These start out fairly difficult and you will probably need a hint or two to progress. That's not a problem but the way this game handles hints, you'll run out of points easily and will need to wait about twenty-four hours before you go back to 10 hint points (which are spent as such, hint 1-3, hint 2-2, hint 3-1, hint 4-1, and so on).

The player is given a palette of 3-5 colors and is required to \u2018paint\u2019 the areas on the screen, so that they all should have the same color in a limited number of moves. \n\nI was able to complete the \u2018standard\u2019 puzzles in exactly two hours. There are 5 \u2018seasons\u2019, each of 9 riddles, which gives an average time of 2 mins per puzzle \u2013 that means they are rather on the easy-to-plain-effortless side . There is also a hint system available, but as far as the \u2018standard\u2019 puzzles are concerned, it is not really needed that much.     \n\nThe visuals of Kami are the very definition of \u2018oddly satisfying\u2019. Watching how screen fills with one particular color and listening only to the sound of paper folding is a pleasant and calming experience. This is probably the game\u2019s greatest asset: it is a perfect  choice for unwinding after a tiresome day, and as far as I am concerned, it\u2019s enough to make me return to the \u2018premium\u2019 puzzles (although, keep in mind that the 2nd \u2018season\u2019 \u2013out of 3-  of \u2018premiums\u2019 deals with black and white patterns rather than colors, which makes it EXTREMELY difficult  to discern)   and wait for the sequel.\n\nPL\n\nKami zalicza si\u0119 do gatunku gier logicznych przeniesionych z mobilnej platformy \u2013 w tym przypadku bez szkody dla samej gry, jak to czasami si\u0119 dzieje przy portach ze smartfon\u00f3w.

It combines a beautiful esthetic with simple efficacy puzzles to a very satisfying effect. The puzzles are easy to complete, but they present a challenge by encouraging you to use the fewest moves possible. I find myself doing the same puzzles multiple times because I am determined to find that perfect move set.\n\nThe visual style of Kami is simple and elegant. Using a combination of complementary colors, you strive to turn your puzzle into the singular hue of your choosing. With each click, squares of folded construction paper flow out from the selected location, slowly turning the puzzle into a satisfying uniformity of color.  The game does not restrict you to any specific move limits, and instead will continue to be playable well beyond the recommend move goal. This freedom allows you to simply play with the colors; folding and shaping your paper until your heart\u2019s content.\n\nKami's music is a beautiful rendition in a traditional Japanese style. The game gives you the option to play the music during the puzzles or you can leave the music off and solve the puzzles in near silence. Aside from the music, the only sound during the puzzle is that of folding paper which accompanies each of your moves. This makes for a mesmerizingly tactile experience.\n\nThe simple design, beautiful colors, and comforting sounds add together to make an elegant and relaxing experience that calls to me at the end of a stressful day. For the measly price this game requests it would be a shame not to experience this little slice of peace and beauty.   \n", "timestamp_created": 1404314983, "timestamp_updated": 1404314983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11009547": {"recommendationid": "11009547", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961521733", "num_games_owned": 1884, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404255422}, "language": "english", "review": "Good zen puzzle time waster.", "timestamp_created": 1404255469, "timestamp_updated": 1404255469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10978487": {"recommendationid": "10978487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044187984", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404055385}, "language": "english", "review": "This games only problem is that there is not enough of it.\nThe entire thing is splendidly designed, from the menus to the puzzles themselves.\nEvery puzzle is new and interesting, and I was so enthralled that I'd 100% completed it before I even realized.", "timestamp_created": 1404145870, "timestamp_updated": 1404145870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10973914": {"recommendationid": "10973914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025141628", "num_games_owned": 748, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420896126}, "language": "english", "review": "Zen.", "timestamp_created": 1404134353, "timestamp_updated": 1404134353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10942453": {"recommendationid": "10942453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122560446", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404059846}, "language": "english", "review": "Great puzzle game, took me a few tries in most of the puzzles to score perfect :p", "timestamp_created": 1404053373, "timestamp_updated": 1404053373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10927390": {"recommendationid": "10927390", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990700042", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459526005}, "language": "english", "review": "While this game at its core is a very simple puzzle game, I find it extremely charming.

En fait, ce jeu n'a aucun lien avec le pliage, si ce n'est l'animation qu'il propose en colorisant les cases. Le but est simplement de peindre un rectangle bariol\u00e9 afin qu'il se transforme en une surface unicolore avec un minimum de \"coups de pinceau\". Bien que plaisant et simple, la monotonie de la t\u00e2che devient rapidement ennuyeuse.\n\nAvec ce casse-t\u00eate, je n'arrive pas \u00e0 trouver les solutions logiquement. C'est plut\u00f4t mon instinct et quelques tentatives erron\u00e9es qui me guident afin de r\u00e9soudre les diff\u00e9rents probl\u00e8mes.

Selon moi, la dur\u00e9e de vie du jeu est d'environ 7-10 heures. Je terminerai sans doute KAMI en y jouant un peu de temps en temps car, comme je l'ai indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, il devient un peu trop r\u00e9p\u00e9titif (malgr\u00e9 une ambiance plut\u00f4t zen) et je commence d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 m'en lasser.", "timestamp_created": 1395132439, "timestamp_updated": 1395132957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9510513": {"recommendationid": "9510513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068761642", "num_games_owned": 1458, "num_reviews": 165, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1394992401}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u73a9\u6cd5\u975e\u5e38\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u989c\u8272\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u79cd\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u7eb8\u4e0a\u4e00\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u989c\u8272\u5168\u90e8\u67d3\u6210\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u5728\u89c4\u5b9a\u6b65\u6570\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u5373\u53ef\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u73a9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u96be\u5ea6\u7b80\u5355\u3002\u666e\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u90a3\u51e0\u5173\u5df2\u7ecf\u8ba9\u6211\u667a\u5546\u8017\u5c3d\u4e86\uff0c\u6628\u5929\u6d17\u6fa1\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u53d1\u73b0\u5934\u53d1\u90fd\u6389\u4e86\u597d\u591a\u3002\n\n\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u914d\u4e50\u4e5f\u53ea\u6709\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u51e0\u9996\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u65e5\u672c\u98ce\u975e\u5e38\u4f18\u7f8e\u52a8\u542c\u3002\u52a0\u4e0a\u5404\u79cd\u5404\u6837\u7684\u6298\u7eb8\uff0c\u770b\u7740\u4e5f\u8d4f\u5fc3\u60a6\u76ee\u3002\n\n\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u662f\u4e2a\u7d20\u8d28\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u76ca\u667a\u4f11\u95f2\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u6ca1\u6709\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u5361\u7247\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u670923\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u6839\u672c\u6ca1\u6709\u6587\u5b57\u6ca1\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u9879\u3002\u4e0d\u5efa\u8bae\u7279\u610f\u5168\u4ef7\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6148\u5584\u5305\u5165\u624b\u65e2\u53ef\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1395052823, "timestamp_updated": 1395052823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646229", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9507626": {"recommendationid": "9507626", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990794729", "num_games_owned": 5859, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404129047}, "language": "english", "review": "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND UNIQUE INDIE / CASUAL / PUZZLER GAME.

The game has you folding paper, origami-style, to solve puzzles. The game\u2019s title is the Japanese word for paper and I still have no idea how to pronounce it (I\u2019ve been saying it like \u2018CAM-E\u2019).\n\nThe method used to solve each puzzle is why this game is so unique. Each puzzle starts you off with a square sheet of paper, much like origami, with this piece of paper being covered in small triangles of varying colors. Your objective is to make the entire sheet of paper one solid color in as little clicks as possible.  There\u2019s a color palette at the bottom of each puzzle and its your choice in deciding what color the end result should be, with that hopefully being the color netting you the least amount of clicks.\n\nWhen you click on any triangle in the puzzle, any other triangle of the same color connected to the clicked triangle will change into the color you have selected. This is a bit difficult to explain, so I encourage you to look at videos, etc. This color-changing mechanic is accomponied by a neat-looking animation as well, which I would describe as a sea of paper-folding triangles.\n\nThe game\u2019s major fault lies in the amount of content offered. I wish there were more puzzles to do, as there\u2019s only 63. The game is $4 (on Steam) though, so that may be the reason. I ran out of puzzles rather quickly, although that can probably be attributed to the fact that I went for the bare minimum ranking in each puzzle, \u201cokay\u201d, instead of opting to go for the \u201cperfect\u201d ranking in each. There is another ranking as well, known as \u201cfail\u201d, and I\u2019m sure you can figure what that means on your own.\n\nThe game\u2019s difficulty curve is fantastic.

Like some other reviewers, I finished in ~4 hours with a 100% perfect score. Part of that seems to be intentional - there are some clever sequences of 3 or 4 levels where each one becomes more difficult due to a few minor tweaks in the puzzle layout. These sequences effectively teach you how to excel at this game without any instruction but a gradual stretching of your intuition.\n\nBut it doesn't necessarily have to be quite so easy to master. The second premium level - with its eye-popping geometric papers that subtly subvert your efforts to visualize the pattern - hints at the kind of difficult-but-still-not-frustrating levels that would really make this game one to return to for many hours on end.\n\nIn addition, I found myself wishing that the paper folding mechanic was a more integral part of the game, As it is, it's just an admittedly gorgeous, mesmerizing way to fill up a space.\n\nTo sum up, don't take my criticisms too harshly...I am in a bit of tough love with this game. It has a sense of taste and elegance that is really rare in the gaming world, and we need more like it. It hints tantalizingly at the possibility of more difficult, but still dolorous and delightful, sequel.

But wait, they've landed in a pattern, isn't that interesting, what would happen if you just rearranged them a little?  In KAMI, you're given the chance to find out.\n\nPuzzle games and brain teasers can be hard to properly quantify.  Is it a unique experience?  Is the game challenging?  Does it engage the player?  Does difficulty scale with skill?  Is it aesthetically pleasing and consistent?  Is it persistently replayable?  And when the player is done with a session, will they come away feeling satisfied?\n\nKAMI is created by [url=http://www.stateofplaygames.com/]State of Play[/url], the makers of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/105100/]Lume[/url], and named for a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami_paper]folding paper used in origami[/url], it is a puzzle game where the user seeks to create a single homogeneous grid of paper by changing the patterns of sections of squares.  Each level has a series of different types of kami laid out in squares forming [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=221844065 ]shapes and patterns[/url] on the play area.  When the player flips one piece of a particular kami, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=221844167 ]all linked pieces of the same type also flip[/url], cascading in a way like what a player sees in game of go when a colour gets surrounded.\n\nReminiscent of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/61600/]Zen Bound 2[/url] for it's Asian aesthetic, KAMI is a very minimalist title without any intrusive elements to detract from it's core.  There is one audio track for the game, although not an unappealing one, it can therefore become a little repetitive.  It can be disjointing when the music abruptly halts as the player enters a puzzle, and equally abruptly begins when leaving one, no music plays while a puzzle is in progress.\n\nKAMI is a puzzle game, so it will obviously not start your adrenaline pumping, and it won't shock you, but it will [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=221903365]tug at your analytical brain[/url] and make you observe the grid and seek out patterns and layers of future moves.  Playing through KAMI you must see the effects of your moves often as far as 5 steps ahead in order to get a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=221844186 ]perfect score[/url] on a puzzle.  Once into the swing of things, getting an OK is not too hard, and often getting a perfect score will take a bit more effort, but not to the point of hair pulling or profanity.\n\nThe game revolves around finding a way to unite each different kami in [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=221844101]successive order[/url], so if black touches all of the scattered reds then that is your first kami to flip.  Hints are available for those having a hard time with a particular puzzle, but you only get one hint per puzzle, and it is only the first flip of that puzzle, and while sometimes that will be enough to show a player what needs to be done next, sometimes it just isn't that [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=221903418]straight forward[/url].\n\nKAMI comes with the iOS version of the game's [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=221903449]premium content[/url], which considerably extends play time, but once completed, there is little to motivate a player to return to the game.  There are no achievements or leaderboards for the fastest completion time, no meta to the game.  It would have been nice for the developers to take advantage of online capabilities and the potential of an engaged player base by giving a puzzle creation tool to players, a remote server could store all user created puzzles, assigning them all lowest possible moves and letting players download new puzzles regularly.\n\nOverall the experience is a calming and satisfying play through, with only a few minor caveats to interfere with the title.

Sometimes I want to play a game with no frills or strings attached and just enjoy myself, welcome to KAMI. KAMI is a very \"simplistic\" game with the goal of turning all the paper into a certain colour. \n\nThis little game is quite deceiving, in a good way. Each level while having the same goal is completed in a completely different manner, though levels usually only have one solution if you want to get the perfect score, it cannot be helped though due to the simplicity of the colour scheme and how it's not based on some RNG element. You have to plan your moves 3-4 turns ahead and have to look at the big picture in order to achieve perfection. They're simple to complete, but challenging to perfect, and this balance keeps the game from becoming a chore and causing frustration.\n\nAnother thing to point out is this game is a port from the iOS, and from what I can tell not much has been changed. The menus cannot be navigated with the keyboard, it's not widescreen, lacks a decent options menu and also contains a weird hint system which seems to have been a microtransaction on the iOS.\n\nIn saying that it controls fine on the mouse and there seems to be no random mouse acceleration. It also can be played in a tiny window mode while still being fully playable, great for someone who experiences a lot of downtime at their PC. It will also run on Potato so you can just leave this running in the background without worrying about its hindereance on your PC's capabilities.\n\nThe music sticks to the Japanese theme of the game and helps maintain the mood without becoming to overpowering. Sadly the music does not play during the puzzles themselves, and while one might say it's to help concentration why not just give me the option to mute it during said puzzle? A simple icon would suffice to mute the soundtrack during gameplay.\n\nIt also goes without saying that KAMI looks amazing, animations are fluid and has a lot of subtle details that one might glance over. Things such as each paper square, though sharing a colour actually vary slighlty in texture or contrast. It has seemless transitions between all its game modes and puzzles, there's no loading screen which makes you think to yourself, just one more, just one more, and by then you've spent an hour looking at different colour paper and you've missed your bus.\n\nWhile I've been beating down on the game a bit, it's still enjoyable and the things I've discussed are condiments to an already satisfactory meal. While short you're going to enjoy your experience and will be euphoria for anyone who loves to plan turns ahead, much in the way of a game like Chess. That said I would recommend picking it up on Android or iOS for $1, same experience but save yourself some money.", "timestamp_created": 1390704109, "timestamp_updated": 1391003097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504620", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8849607": {"recommendationid": "8849607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000390924", "num_games_owned": 1150, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393558804}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, actually \"killing\" my time.

El objetivo es sencillo: Convertir el \u00e1rea de juego, compuesta por cuadrados de diferente color, en un \u00e1rea de color uniforme. Al picar con un color sobre un cuadrado \u00e9ste y todos los cuadrados adyacentes cambian a ese color. De este modo, se van consiguiendo \u00e1reas de color uniforme cada vez m\u00e1s grandes. Hasta conseguir que todo sea del mismo color... En el v\u00eddeo de presentaci\u00f3n del juego se entiende mejor. :P\n\nVisualmente es muy bonito, con esa est\u00e9tica \"handcrafted\" de Lumino City, donde todo parece hecho con papel. Y la m\u00fasica es tranquila y agradable, aunque puede volverse mon\u00f3tona cuando llevas un rato en el mismo puzzle. Aconsejo de nuevo, como con Hexcells, bajar el volumen del juego y ponerte tu propia m\u00fasica.\n\nEn las 12h que he jugado he conseguido el 100% del juego, es decir pasarme todos los niveles con el m\u00ednimo de movimientos posibles. A eso me ha ayudado ligeramente el sistema de pistas incluido, que te raciona las pistas por d\u00edas: Tienes un m\u00e1ximo de 10 puntos por d\u00eda, y la primera pista de un puzzle vale 3 puntos, la segunda 2, y las siguientes 1. Muchas veces, el primer movimiento es suficiente para intuir por donde seguir\u00e1 la soluci\u00f3n. Me parece una idea genial, y bien implementada. \n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, mientras espero a que acaben su pr\u00f3ximo juego, disfrutar\u00e9 de Lume, la precuela de Lumino City.\nY respecto a este KAMI, totalmente recomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1516384347, "timestamp_updated": 1516384347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40870063": {"recommendationid": "40870063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014922995", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "last_played": 1521305298}, "language": "german", "review": "Auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert ! \n\nWem die Musik w\u00e4hrend der R\u00e4tsel fehlt der kann so lang Zauberbart h\u00f6ren. : https://soundcloud.com/user-913609593/sets/trs", "timestamp_created": 1521285321, "timestamp_updated": 1521286023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40800500": {"recommendationid": "40800500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013349029", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499113450}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1520995033, "timestamp_updated": 1520995033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40746825": {"recommendationid": "40746825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285316246", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 564, "last_played": 1520865158}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich pers\u00f6nlich habe ca. 13 h gebraucht, um die 100% (alle Puzzles mit perfekt) voll zu machen. Allerdings habe ich auch bei dem ein oder anderen Puzzle die \"Hint\"-Funktion genutzt. Sonst h\u00e4tte ich das ein oder andere Puzzle vielleicht auch gar nicht oder zumindest ohne \"perfekt\" abgeschlossen. \n\nSpielerisch ist Kami ein Puzzle-Spiel \u00e4hnlich wie Lyne (siehe Steam), wobei das Spielziel von Kami jenes ist, dass man alle Felder in einer vorgegebenen Anzahl von Spielz\u00fcgen in eine einzige Farbe umwandelt. Dabei kann man sogar bei dem ein oder anderen Puzzle die vorgegebene Spielz\u00fcge-Vorgabe um 1-2 Z\u00fcge unterschreiten, sofern man einen effizienteren L\u00f6sungsweg als \"gedacht\" findet. Insofern k\u00f6nnte Kami auch f\u00fcr Hardcore-Puzzlefans interessant sein, wenn es darum geht, die besten L\u00f6sungswege auszuloten. \n\nPers\u00f6nlich finde ich Kami ein wenig ansprechender als Lyne, weil es sich durch das Farbenspiel und das Umklappen der einzelnen Farbkacheln, welche ja Papier simulieren sollen, einerseits \u00e4sthetischer pr\u00e4sentiert und andererseits auch von den Puzzles her etwas abwechslungsreicher gestaltet.\nSelbst wenn man ein Puzzle nicht auf Anhieb in der vorgegebenen Anzahl von Z\u00fcgen l\u00f6st, ist es doch immer wieder interessant, sich anzuschauen, wie ein Puzzle sich dann in einer einheitlichen Farbe aufl\u00f6st. Manchmal ergeben sich verschiedene L\u00f6sungswege, die in einer anderen Endfarbe enden, was eine kleine Mini-Belohnung darstellt, wenn einem das gef\u00e4llt.

I feel this way mainly because the story is far too short for the reader to really get attached to any character, including the protagonist. This is supposed to be a story about love, but it fails to elicit romantic feelings and doesn't give the reader much of a chance to even feel motivated to salvage the relationship between the MC and his girlfriend. What I do like about it is that it portrays a disabled person in a positive light and debunks the myth that a disabled person is inherently unable to take care of themselves. Many people think that once someone becomes severely disabled that they can't do anything for themselves, when it is far from the truth, and many disabled people learn to lead independent lives. \n\nBonus points for including a queer character.\n\nIt has a lot of room for improvement, but I didn't hate it.

The novel has a total of four different ending you can get (of which I have gotten all four of). One major issue I had with the game is how very little dynamic there is between each ending. There's a pretty limited amount of choices you can make, and again, four different outcomes; the ratio of choices and outcomes overall makes the game [i] extremely [/i] sensitive to your choices. This can make it difficult to achieve one ending in particular; you really have to figure out the mechanics of the game in order to get the ending you want. I think this game overstretched too simple and short of a story. Two or three possible outcomes would have better suited this VN versus four due to just how short the game really is (i've seen one person on the community hub get all four endings in 11 minutes). More on dynamic - the characters. The one character I, for some reason, seem to really dislike is the main character's girlfriend. Even though she is perhaps made out to be a protagnist (could the main character be considered an anti-hero?), I just really seem to dislike how she is personified, and she leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Perhaps it's how the devs decided to portray her PTSD and military past; I don't know.\n\nThe art style is one thing that really saves this game in terms of it being something to have in your Steam library. In short: it's beautiful. Major props to Kopianget, ReddArt, and Michaela Laws for the amazing art in this VN. The use of a monochromatic color pallet really has an impact on the story, I think. One thing that I really think the dev's missed out on is having a short scene at the beginning in bright, happy colors; this would allow for a grave contrast between the colorful life the main character lead, and the one he is currently stuck with. I think they 100% hit home in the art catagory. It's beautiful, and allows for a sense of sympathy to be strung through the audience.\n\nThere is one thing that I am still left questioning through this entire game: what was the goal?\n\n[ending spoilers after this point]\n\n\n[spoiler]After getting all the endings, I am still in wonder as to what the main goal was? Did the main character value is girlfriend, friend, or book more? It's so confusing and down-right unfinished, that it just leaves me with so many questions. When you get a bad ending, they mention how your book did get published, but was not majorly succesful - and, of course, how you broke up with your girlfriend. In another ending it mentions how your broke up with your girlfriend, yet your book was a New York Times best seller; so, what is it?[/spoiler]\n\n\nWhat was this game trying to prove?\nWhat was the point?\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nDespite all the negativity I threw towards this VN, I still highly recommend it. It's pretty short and sweet - and, not to mention cheap. Why not spend the $.99? The love story will either leave you heartbroken or warm and fuzzy - or, perhaps, somewhere inbetween.

I'd say go for it, especially if you like the genre.\n\n[h1]General Impression[/h1]\n\nI was critical of [i]Michaela Laws[/i] last game, [i]\"My Lady\"[/i], a VN of similar length and price. This is because I had been expecting an attempt at some form of challenge in the plot or at least something a little further than an interesting art style choice and a childish princess-in-a-tower story. [i]\"Blind Love\"[/i] is a return to tackling trickier themes, for good or ill, like we saw in the free (and substantially longer) [i]\"Seduce Me The Otome\"[/i]. I still hold many of the same reservations about [i]Michaela Laws[/i] writing yet I am again looking forward to see which other titles she'll bring to Steam. \n\n[i]\"Blind Love\"[/i] obviously does not have a large amount of graphics. This is a positive considering the plot--a man losing his sight. What we do see are quirky chalk outlines of what our protagonist can't. These assist in holding our attention. It's simple but effective. \n\nAs with other titles from [i]Laws[/i] the writing suffers from grammatical errors, typos, misspellings, and a somewhat inadequate writer's technique. Of course, this is not an expensive game and sometimes it is better to overlook such issues in order to follow the story. This is certainly possible.\n\nThere are a few plot aspects which, to me, feel rather unrealistic or off. These generally have nothing to do with the protagonist's blindness or his girlfriend's particular disability (in fact, I was pleasantly surprised by the depiction of the latter as I can relate to it in many ways). Instead, these had to do with certain reactions outside of that and especially how the story presents the relationship betwen two side characters. I did not feel I had all the options to deal with one of the major points of the story. Spoiler explanation: [spoiler]Josh and Tyler do not come across naturally--I should have been on Josh's side, telling him to leave Tyler or at the VERY least suggesting a break and Tyler seeing a therapist.

It feels genuine.\n\nThere's a part of the story I have to point out since it is directly responsible for making this one of the best VN's I have read. At one point early on in the story, in the months after Alex's accident and getting into a routine, it's revealed he's a writer and working on a novel. There are dialogue options here that frame a turning point for his main character and the novel as a whole. The same dialogue options here mirror two later ones in the ending of the story for Alex's relationship with Sera. Maybe I'm alone here in believing this story offers this view of how everyone has their own battlefield; Alex and his blindness, Sera and her PTSD, Josh and Tyler, Alex's main character and his love, etc. I'm sure that term and examination has been used before explaining love and the path to it or even from it, but this was done with such precise subtlety that as I read it, the honesty of this story was far more emboldened. \n\nBlind Love feels authentic, a property all stories should strive for and this story succeeds so beautifully. It explores the reality of personal difficulties and doesn't handle them with care, instead leaves real choices up to the player and allows real consequences to then occur.

'Blind Love' is a fantastic, short and cheap game which I would recommend to anyone even at the full price.\n\nThe story has various options and a few endings to see throughout your time playing the visual novel. It is quite simple and can be finished in 1.3 hours including finishing all of the achievements. \nDuring my first play through I found that the sound effects made a massive impact over my connection to the story itself, my emotions changed when hearing the whimpers and regret from the different characters.\nThe backgrounds of the characters made it seem very realistic and it flowed quite well from start to finish as everything linked back to their experiences that were explained at the beginning of the game. At certain moments your heart would ache and you would feel sympathy for the characters because of what they have been through. It definitely tugs at your emotions quite a lot when observing the multiple endings and how your words can affect other people.\nThe only negative I'd have to say is that I would have preferred more endings and more choices than what was given to me, despite this I still feel fortunate to have found this little gem.\n\n9/10 for Blind Love! <3", "timestamp_created": 1483046946, "timestamp_updated": 1483995101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591780", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28802796": {"recommendationid": "28802796", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979979948", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483041976}, "language": "english", "review": "I played through and got the best ending, and I was pretty much smiling all the way through.

The question is it a good spinoff or one that should be forgotten? After just recently 100% completing the game and getting all the achievements I think it is a yes!\n\nBon Appetit will be a fun game for those who like rhythm games, Senran Kagura, or just big anime tiddys. A fair warning on the tiddy part since if you try to play this game on hard good luck oodling the ladies while you try to attempt some insane inputs.\n\nOne important aspect of rhythm games is if they have good music and I think this game definitely fits the bra. (See what I did there?) My personal favorites are Yagyu's energetic song, Imu's happy and relaxing song, and Haruka's smooth jazzy song. Out of all of the songs the one I did not care much for was my waifu Murasaki's song being that it starts off in 8-bit while the intro sounds like Stand By Me, then goes into a nice italian sounding music (which is probably because you end with making pizza), but then the 3rd part sounds awful music wise in that it stops and goes back into 8-bit but a rock/metal sounding and then ends with italian sounding music again. Other then that they were all really good!\n\nOne other complaint I would have is that if you are a completionist there are some achievements that will stress you out and others that will bore you to death. The stressful one is \"Finally!\" In which you must reach Ninja Arts Lv. 15 which means you must activate your Ninja Art and not miss a single note for a long time. The challenging part is that the only two ways to get this is getting really go at hard mode or grinding Yomi's song on normal until you learn every single note. (I did this and i stayed up all night until 6:00 trying to get this). The boring ones are \"Cooking is My Specialty!\", \"Master of Ninja Arts\", and \"Happy Cooking.\" Happy Cooking and Cooking is My Specialty go hand and hand since one required you to hit a cumulative total of 50000 notes while the other requires you to complete 200 songs. Even if you were to do every single character story you would end up with 110 so you need to grind 90 more songs. The other achievement requires you to activate your Ninja Arts 500 times. The problem here is that leveling up your ninja arts doesn't count, so if you were to somehow do perfect on every girls story you would only be a fifth of the way there! The fastest way to get the trinity of boredom done I found out was to do Haruka's song (Since her song is the fastest), grind the song and every time your Ninja Arts fills up activate it immediately and then intentionally miss a note so you can fill up and activate it again, and then repeat this until you have them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you like rhythm games and/or Senran Kagura I would recommend it!

No he can just subsist off the idea of breasts and butts  alone. \nThe series revolves around a school of ninjas, a majority of them being women with the exception of one or two minor (I can't put enough emphasis on minor here) characters who happen to be male. But things aren't well for the students of Hanzo Academy because they're constantly attacked by other groups of ninjas. \n\nBut this isn't about that.\n\nSenran Kagura Bon Appetit! Is a cooking based rhythm game set as a side story in the Senran Kagura universe. Hanzo, Asuka's Grandfater, holds a cooking competition because I guess he's hungry. The prize of the competition is a secret ninja scroll that can grant any wish. So all of your favorite Senran Kagura characters compete for the scroll, or in the case of some, for whatever ingredients are left.\nI can relate to that, I constantly fight for food. \n\nEach character has their own story that lasts for about thirty minutes to an hour. Or two hours because I'm bad. The story plays out like a visual novel with two characters just kind of talking to another until the cooking starts. Sometimes they move, sometimes they don't. And in Asuka's case, sometimes they just so happen to have dialogue that is majority a dick joke. I admire her commitment. \n\nOh right, this is a rhythm game. \n\nAnyway, once a battle starts you are greeted by the stage where the two characters cook. Each dish has a separate animation, but you probably won't notice considering you'll be busy matching buttons. You have two rows with a circle at the end. The buttons you need to press roll over as the song starts and you need to match the button as it enters the circle. Don't make the mistake I did and think the bottom row is the opponents buttons, you have to match both circles. \n\nIts fun, but if you're like me then you're going to screw up a lot, even on normal I was having trouble keeping up with some of the songs.\nThis game was also a PS Vita game, and you can tell. The character models, while looking nice, and fairly low quality for what you would expect from at least a console port. You can also see the outlines on the model where clothing is going to rip if you pay enough attention.\n\nAlso, don't expect to get any kind of cooking ideas from the food they made, considering how low polygonal it is, you're not really going to get hungry playing the game, it certainly aint no Shougeki no Souma in the food porn department. \n\nThere was also this problem where I was starting to wig out playing the game, mostly because the speed and blurriness of the button prompts was messing with my vision. But that was entirely because my monitor is from 1989, I was mostly fixed when I turned down the FPS. \n\nIts still a fun game, though, I just wouldn't pay full price for it. The game is on sale while I'm writing this review, fourteen fun bucks is a good price. But there are better rhythm games on the market, some of them are even free, so take that as you will. \n\nSenran Kagura: Bad kitchen hygiene gets six titties on a ninja out of ten. \n\nTaiko No Tatsujin PC port never. \n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7124597/]The Dirk Ninja academy.

They're all pretty challenging with none being too tedious.  Fun.  \n\nPros/Cons:\n+ Great music.  It's very catchy and likeable.  Given the replayability of the game, this is a really good thing.  \n+ It's a bit like guitar hero in that the button presses follow the melody of the music.  It's not simply metronomic.  \n+ The animations are pretty cool-- the characters will actually stir pots or spin cotton candy or stare at a microwave depending on the dish being made.  \n+ The judge is hilarious.  \n+ The game does not take itself seriously and has some pretty silly plotlines.  \n+ The customization system is great.  There are a huge number of costumes-- not just simple recolors either.  There's also accessories that are entirely adjustable in terms of position and size.  That means you can stick a giant lollipop on someone's head or make their entire upper half a giant trout... or something more sensible, I guess.  \n+ The notes line up nicely with the music.  It's very satisfying.  \n+ Hard mode is challenging yet not overwhelming-- not a crazy mess of button mashing like some rhythm games.  \n+ It took me roughly 24 hours to get all the achievements.  Given the replayable nature of a rhythm game, I'd say the price is very worth it.  \n\n-Personally, I had a lot of trouble getting this game to run properly until I checked the discussions for a solution.  When I first booted it up, the framerate was very stuttery.  It was unplayable.  \n- Some songs are unproportionately difficult compared to others.  They're challenging even on normal difficulty.  \n- The songs are played in three segments, each being a different dish.  My issue is that, to pass a song, the first two segments don't matter in the slightest.  One can literally put their controllers down and fail the first two parts and still be able to win.  Alternatively, they could ace the first two sections then lose because they lost the last part.  It doesn't make much sense.  \n- Some of the costumes for larger characters don't scale well for smaller characters making them look sorta nightmarish and odd.  \n\n\nOverall:\nI really love this game.  It's one of the best rhythm games I've played on steam. It reminds me of guitar hero, and I absolutely love that about it.  While it certainly has heaps of fan service and rather... pneumatic characters, that is not what drew me to it.  As a huge fan of rhythm games, I have to say that this game is, well, really fun.  It's got good art, animations, and character customization.  Despite my troubles in running it, I have certainly enjoyed my time with it.  I recommend it to any fan of the more guitar hero-esque rhythm games.", "timestamp_created": 1503827683, "timestamp_updated": 1503827683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0,

But I found Senran Kagura Bon Appetit to be a really fun rhythm game. There is a wide array of characters you can select from (aka the roster from Shinovi Versus), so you can enjoy cook-offs with your favorite against everyone else. There are three main modes in Bon Appetit: Story Mode, Arcade Mode, and Free Mode.\n\nThe story in this game involves a cook-off competition, with the prize being a Secret Ninja Scroll that can grant its user any wish that she may desire. It works the same way as it did in the previous entries: Shinovi Girls' Hearts stories. You play through each characters' stories and find out what they wanted. I really enjoyed playing most of their stories because some are quite hilarious.\n\nThe songs that you play depend on who your opponent is, which I think is fine both in Story and Arcade Modes; but I wish that you could pick whichever song you wanted to play in Free Play. But I understand that the songs are to match each of the characters. Some of the songs in this game are good, and some are mediocre. For the mediocre ones, they were pleasant to listen to, but not fun to play because those songs tend to be the somewhat slow songs; and I gotta go fast.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's fun for a rhythm game, just simply press the corresponding button or key at the right time to get the most out of it, and activate Ninja Arts for maximum power. The little \"specials\" that occur during a song is distracting if you're someone like me who takes getting perfect scores seriously, but this is Senran Kagura, and we should always expect stuff like that.\n\nThe Dressing Room and the Library remain, and operate the same way as the main titles; and everything is unlocked simply by playing the game (there's no store like in the previous titles). If there is one big thing that I would have to complain about the most, it's that there's no multiplayer functionality. This should've been a feature because I want to play online against my friends and against other people around the globe. The only online feature available in the game is Leaderboards.\n\nBut overall, I recommend Senran Kagura Bon Appetit to people who like rhythm games and can deal with the theme of Senran Kagura, but I definitely recommend this game to any Senran Kagura fan.

sobre os controles, esse jogo \u00e9 bem completo, nele voc\u00ea pode jogar no teclado, no controle de xbox 360 e tamb\u00e9m no controle de PS3, eu tentei com o de PS4 mas n\u00e3o funcionou direito, eu segui o tutorial de uma pessoa aqui da steam e fiz funcionar o de PS3 com o drive oficial da Sony, ficou uma beleza, inclusive as notas dentro do jogo ficam com o layout do PS3 mesmo e isso ajuda.\nBom a conclus\u00e3o \u00e9 simples, o game vale sim a pena, voc\u00ea vai jogar horas e horas, ele falta um modo online, mas mesmo assim vale a pena, j\u00e1 que tem muita coisa para

Because it is HEAVY here.  And of course, it's a Senran Kagura game, so clothes will be flying off the girls, with the usual censorship.\n\nThat being said, this is a rhythm game, where you press the scrolling buttons as they appear.  Being set in the Senran Kagura universe, this game is about a nonsense food tournament where the girls compete against each other to attain a scroll that would grant whatever wish they so desire.  Why would such a powerful item be up for grabs in a mere cook-off?  Because this is silly.  Heck, the game says so itself.\n\nEach 'match' has three stages.  Whoever has the upper hand in each stage, the losing girl has parts of their clothes blasted off.  I think you know where this goes.  Especially when you perfect a girl.  Perfecting gives you a scene where the losing girl is 'served' with fruit as a dessert, wearing nothing but chocolate and whipped cream in certain places.  And then you can perv on them.  And since this is a SK game, you are able to unlock outfits and dress up the girls however you see fit.  Want to make them all wear the same outfit?  Go for it.  Make them wear as least as possible so that the clothes being torn off doens't really matter?  Whatever floats your boat.\n\nThe music is pretty good, as it has to be in a rhythm game.  In my opinion, the best one is Miyabi's, \"Machiavellism of Despair.\"  Seriously, go look that one up.  \n\nThere are differences in the difficulties, with easy being simple, but the other ones have you doing complex combinations.    This rhythm game has two tracks of scrolling buttons for you to... well, keep track of, requiring you to be really good at multitasking.  You got basic stuff.

This is what you'd get.\n\nSenran Kagura: Bon Appetit - Full Course is basically a rhythm game in a similar style as Guitar Hero but with a twist. You're determining the quality of a cooking contest between two anime girls (each of them with generous jiggle physics). There are three rounds per match, the first two pretty much just helps to strip off yours or your opponent's clothes (depending on whose score is lower) while the third determines the victor. The rhythm section is divided into two bars that require the usual timed button presses. I recommend playing with an XBox 360 controller just for easier gameplay.\n\nThere is no complete nudity in this game. You're limited to only stripping your opponents down to their underwear, which in some cases just means a pair of pasties and very stringy bikinis.\n\nThere are also some rather...suggestive alternate costumes that the girls can wear, such as a squid that's wrapped around them...yep...you read that right.\n\nThe game still has much of Senran Kagura's trademark humor, initially starting out with a serious sounding monologue by Hanzo, who's your steriotypical pervy old man with more than enough power he can get away with it. The monologue sounds serious but then he breaks the charade. From what I've played of it, the game is a fairly decent rhythm game. There are unlocks such as voice sets, videos and images, and...lingere for the girls. But it's still a good casual rhythm game if you're looking for one that delivers both cooking and stripping anime babes...again, with the generous jiggle physics.", "timestamp_created": 1489243802, "timestamp_updated": 1489243802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680780", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30440869": {"recommendationid": "30440869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277876584", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490604077}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u597d\u597d\u73a9\u97f3\u6cb9\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u5f88\u96be\u540c\u65f6\u6b23\u8d4f\u9ad8\u5206\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u798f\u5229\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u770b\u798f\u5229\uff0c\u4f60\u5c31\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613miss\u51e0\u4e2a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u751a\u81f3\u6700\u540e\u8f93\u6389\n\u8ba9\u4f60\u6df1\u523b\u4f53\u4f1a\u5230\u9c7c\u4e0e\u718a\u638c\u4e0d\u53ef\u517c\u5f97\u7684\u9053\u7406", "timestamp_created": 1489216010, "timestamp_updated": 1489216010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 33, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863235", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30439298": {"recommendationid": "30439298", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967165685", "num_games_owned": 398, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505823027}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u9ad8\u89e3\u6790\u5ea6 8*\u53cd\u92f8\u9f52 60FPS\n\u7136\u5f8c\u5b57\u5e55\u6709\u4e2d\u6587!\u6709\u4e2d\u6587!\u6709\u4e2d\u6587!\n\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u6240\u4ee5\u8aaa\u4e09\u6b21", "timestamp_created": 1489207998, "timestamp_updated": 1489207998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30436587": {"recommendationid": "30436587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159785717", "num_games_owned": 1642, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497949408}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6709\u5bb6\u6709\u7231\u6709\u6b27\u6d3e~", "timestamp_created": 1489194585, "timestamp_updated": 1489194585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675157", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30401920": {"recommendationid": "30401920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152334016", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483701011}, "language": "english", "review": "This game kept the heat up, and my heart racing... in more ways than one.\n\n10/10 would recommend to my colleagues.", "timestamp_created": 1489029145, "timestamp_updated": 1489029145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30353120": {"recommendationid": "30353120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129562087", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493474196}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e21\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e34\u0e40\u0e40\u0e25\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e32\u0e18\u0e34\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e14\u0e35\u0e43\u0e19\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19.......\u0e40\u0e40\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e14\u0e16\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e23\u0e39\u0e1b\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e17\u0e31\u0e19\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e19\u0e30\u0e08\u0e30\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e14\u0e35 555+ (\u0e01\u0e14\u0e40\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1a\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e17\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\u0e40\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e49\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e08\u0e19\u0e01\u0e14\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e16\u0e39\u0e01 555+)", "timestamp_created": 1488793136, "timestamp_updated": 1488793236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514423", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30348534": {"recommendationid": "30348534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091346529", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488761984}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a professional gamer.

It should be said that this game is DEFINITELY more for people who are already fans of the Senran Kagura games than hardcore rhythm game fans; BUT if you like rhythm games and dig gloriuosly gratuitious T&A, then you may very well enjoy this too.\n\nThere are some frame drops here and there when the cooking gets more intensive, but the visuals are a very nice upgrade from the Vita nonetheless. Gameplay is pretty simple just hit the corresponding buttons when they land on the point like most any other rhythm game. I'd recommend a controller, but you could probaly do fine with a keyboard. \n\nThe main issue I have with this game is the difficulty spikes it has. While the majority of songs on easy/normal/hard are relatively respective to those difficulties, there are five or six that are absurdly more difficult or absurdly easier than they should be for their difficulty class. I speak in particular about the difficulty spikes in Rin and Daidouji's songs. When on Easy, those songs feel more like they should be on Medium. On Medium, they feel like they're more suited for Hard, and on Hard they're just pure hell. This is really the only REAL issue, I believe.  \n\nOverall, coming from someone who's a fan of the Senran Kagura series, it's fairly solid.

win some scroll that grants any one wish by having a cook-off. I would have prefered one of the main entries to the series, but I suppose if you have any thoughts of getting this game, I might as well attempt to give this review a bash. \n\nFirst off, this is a PS Vita port so the texture quality is unsurprisingly poor, but otherwise it functions just like what I expect from a PC port with a decent selection of 16:9 resolution options, rebindable keys, volume sliders, and of course, runs at 60fps with no technical issues to point out as far as I can tell. Honestly what surprised me the most was in game looking at the button prompts for each note and it actually gives me keyboard prompts according to what I have bound at the time. Why did it even surprise me in the first place? I guess most Japanese ports usually gives you generic gamepad button prompts forcing you to guess which keys did the developers arbitrarily assigned.\n\nThere are 3 modes of play which are mostly the same thing, being free mode, arcade mode, and story mode. Free mode is just one song where you pick your waifu and your opponent of choice which determines the song that\u2019s going to be played, while story mode is just picking one character and read through the story with 6 opponents within each playthrough that spans around 30 minutes and the arcade mode is basically the same thing but without the story elements. With that being said, there are only 22 songs in the entire game with 3 levels of difficulty so whether that\u2019s enough variety is entirely up to you.\n\nLevel completion is a little bit weird in the sense that it\u2019s not based on how well you did percentage wise, but is mostly dependant on a domination meter that\u2019s fairly unforgiving with each song separated into 3 segments with the first 2 segments being completely irrelevant to beating the song. In fact, it is still possible to get an A rank if you nearly flawless the third segment, it\u2019s just that if you don\u2019t bother to try to flawless the entire song, you will miss out on Grandpa Hanzo\u2019s sporadic fantasies and the sexy bonus at the end.\n\nI will recommend this game on the mere basis of it being a good PC port and a solid rhythm game to sink a bit of time into, so if you like Senran Kagura and/or you like big anime racks, then this game is a good pick up for you.", "timestamp_created": 1481353135, "timestamp_updated": 1481353186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28197763": {"recommendationid": "28197763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201768386", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486148119}, "language": "english", "review": "Dont Look at me with those eyes, its just a cooking battle....\n\nbut in all seriousness, i like how the series kinda surprised us with a button Rhythm Game that is actually really enjoyable, you get to play as almost all of your favorite characters from the Senran Kagura Franchise, with Hanzo being the Judge,  Being Perfect never felt so rewarding in this game, not only do you get a special  bonus at the end, you also get to see hanzo doing hilarious things as he eats his food. like sailing off into space from the middle of the ocean on a sandwhich ship....im serious. it happened. \n\nwhat makes this game difficult is trying to stay focused! there are so many distractions...(you'll find out what i mean)  and if you fail on the third round you lose, doesnt matter how well you did on the first or second, which i find that weird. but it does give a challenge, and thats good. just makes winning that much more rewarding.\n\nNow If you'll Excuse me, i gotta prove that im the best cook.\n\n;)", "timestamp_created": 1480911237, "timestamp_updated": 1480911237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28167086": {"recommendationid": "28167086", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987485219", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514281748}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a pretty good PC port.

Mostly Jpop, but also has some hints of traditional Japanese music in them.\n+ Very nice, solid framerate. I have a really crappy computer, but even on the highest settings my computer only hiccups when I take screenshots and when there's a LOT going on on screen (at that point it drops to around 40 fps, but the audio doesn't slug so keeping a steady rhythm isn't hard at all.)\n+ Amusing stories. Keeps the humourous tone throughout the whole game unlike Shinovi. Not that I found that to be a problem, but, given this game's specific mechanics, it wouldn't fit very well if it were otherwise.\n+ Responsive buttons; no input lag.\n+ Massive anime boobs (and one loli for the degenerates.)\n+ You can still molest the girls in the dressing room.\n+ Murasaki.\n\nCONS:\n- This could just be my computer, but there are a lot of graphical glitches in the background of my game. A lot of the background turns black for some reason.\n- Repetitive gameplay with no variety. (Aside from the music itself.)\n- No multiplayer. Can't rekt my friends in a rhythm game with giant anime tiddies.\n- Stories are really short. Only 3 character interactions (and 2 randomly selected characters) then you're done with that character.\n- Learning curve is pretty steep in my opinion. For context, in Normal mode, I lost to Rin 7 times before I got past her in Ryona's story, but I full combo'd Minori's song first try, without having heard it beforehand. Take that as you will.\n- No way to view your gameplay over unless you manually record it, so you can't see Murasaki shaking her booty at you because you have to focus on the buttons so hard :(\n- Rin's song.

Get perfect victory and you'll be rewarded with [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=797331060]the ultimate dish[/url]. Ready to be served!\n\nFor game difficulty, 3 options available; easy for genuinely enjoying the scene, normal for casual play with some tapping buttons, hard for testing your concentration and focus!\n\nFor game modes, there are Story Mode which tells the story about why the girls entered the cooking tournament; Arcade Mode to play 6 battles and gather points for your rank in leaderboards; Free Mode where you play freely with an opponent of your choice, and of course the trademarked Dressing Room for playing Barbie. (well not really a gamemode but still)\n\nFor port quality, fps limit can be set to 30 or 60, supports up to 1080 resolution, borderless fullscreen, and 8x AA.\n\nThere are still some bugs like [strike]controller rebinding[/strike], [strike]achievement issues[/strike], sudden framerate drops. I expected the devs will act fast like they did with [i]Shinovi Versus[/i] (they even add more quality of life settings!) but as [i]Bon Appetit![/i] it has been 2 weeks and I heard nothing from them.\n\nFor the same price as [i]Shinovi Versus[/i], I'd recommend SV for more actions and replayability. \n\nBut who am I kidding? Nan Yaegashi's art style is my favorite and I support every single of his works even it's unlocalized.

Teniendo en cuenta, que hay diferentes juegos de Senran Kagura y son diferentes, vamos a analizar esto tal y como es, un juego r\u00edtmico de cocina.\n\nPara analizar esto, simplemente dir\u00e9 que el juego entretiene un rato, no est\u00e1 mal, es gracioso y las canciones pegadizas. Tiene varios modos de juego, historia, arcade y libre. Cuenta con una serie de \"desbloqueables\" que van desde m\u00fasica, imagenes, voces a trajes y accesorios para nuestras \"cocineras\".\n\nEl juego tiene bastantes personajes con los que jugar y trajes para cambiar, todo por partes iguales... Una vez te pones a jugar es casi imposible desviar la mirada de lo que estamos pulsando (A menos que seamos unos pervertidos y nos mole mirar las tetas), haciendo del juego una buena experiencia en cuanto a su genero.\n\nOs dir\u00e9 que no os dej\u00e9is enga\u00f1ar por la est\u00e9tica del juego, pues al igual que pasa con Gal*Gun: Double Peace, son buenos juegos con unas cuantas horas de duraci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s este viene con todos los DLC, as\u00ed que bueno...

playthrough on a single path can tell you all you need to know.  I grabbed it because I generally enjoy rhythm games and this sat on the top of the charts for a bit, I was also surprised and shocked at how much I enjoyed the previous beat-em-up from the same franchise.  My opinion of this one is a little more tepid.  I sat for a while wondering what it is about this game I don't like but other rhythm games have and in short-it's the funk and soul I see in the others I don't see here.\n\nFirst, the rhythm portion uses controller button presses to manage beats in time with a song.  If you've played any rhythm game since amplitude, the controls are immediately familiar.  The taps fall in time with the song playing in the background and the gameplay is familiar, if copied, from previous generations.  Not necessarilly a bad thing.\n\nThe songs however, are mostly jpop even when the tracks try to switch to a different genre the jpop remains familiar in the background.  This is a preference thing, you may enjoy jpop a lot, I like japanese folk music more and that will tell you how aged my preferences in japanese music are.\n\nWhat is happening is well, anime girls with big gainax boobies take a break from beating each other up to competing in a cooking competition.  Some strange old guy judges.  His reactions to the winning dish can include, at its most extreme, growing a large pair of big gainax anime boobies himself.  He then blasts the clothing off of the losing contestant with his mouth laser.  It sounds like a twisted mix which came out of Japanese games like D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die.  Incedentally, it comes off as being just strange and not strange and amusing.\n\nThe combination of cooking, titilation, and rhythm comes off as a bit off-putting and unusual as in it probably doesn't work well together.  It's like if that old Stephen Chow flick \"God of Cookery\" got mixed together with jpop and anime boobies, it sounds wierd enough to be enjoyable but something seems a bit off.\n\nI like rhythm games enough to open it and slog through a bit more every now and again but even with what's available on steam, there are better alternatives and maybe this one should be passed.", "timestamp_created":

Each girl has their own song, so which song you play is decided by the opponent you pick. If you are clearing story modes, this means you will be repeating songs by necessity.\n\nBut the fundamentals are strong. The dopey Senran stories from SKSV are ramped up to 10 in ridiculousness here. If you wanted to know what lay ahead for Yumi after she learned what justice truly was in SKSV, this is surely your game. \n\nNaturally, the dressing room, clothes getting blasted off, and the bounciness you have come to expect from SK is all still here.\n\nFair warning: Hard is pretty hard and even ignoring the distractions up above, the note track isn't the easiest to read.

get together for an Iron Chef tournament (controlled via rhythm game). Arcade mode gives you a brief storyline tailored for each individual character. As a spinoff parody, the plots aren't taken too seriously which works in the game's favor, offering a very relaxed experience.\u00a0\n\nThere's three difficulty settings. If you're unfamiliar with rhythm games or otherwise...distracted, then don't worry, you aren't gonna be roadblocked by hilariously challenging levels unless you want to face them specifically. Even better, each arcade campaign is relatively brief. so I can easily see every storyline through to the end!\u00a0\n\nEven so, you'll want to play as precisely as you can. Excellent playing is rewarded with a MOUNTAN of fanservice. The referee, upon tasting your masterpiece, will engage in a fully animated, hilarious cutscene. For example, in the level you give him shaved ice he imagines devouring a literal mountain of it, leaving only two smaller mounds with the red syrup flavoring on the tip of both. The camera zooms out to reveal he's left the shaved ice in the shape of breasts. Amazing.\u00a0\n\nPlay well enough and the clothes from the other girl you're competing against just burst off her body! As the match draws to a close you'll see her bare, compromised form planted onto a gigantic plate of chocolate and whipped cream. You read that correctly. On a decisive victory you're given a special view of your opponent covered ONLY in dessert toppings. Sweet.\u00a0\n\nThe fanservice doesn't even stop there either!\n\nIn between rounds you can change your own character's outfit, hair style, accessories--the dressing room in this game makes the one from the original game look smalltime. With so many more clothes and options to play with your favorite girls, you can spend hours dressing them up only to rip their clothes off and fondle their half-naked bodies. You can even pet them on the head! Too hot for Nintendo!\u00a0\n\nIf you love anime oppai then this is absolutely a must-buy for you. Nothing is taken too seriously and you can pass through it without much challenge on lower difficulties. Everything in this game was tailored exquisitely around the lewd fanservice. I refuse to pretend I have any shame in indulging myself with this.", "timestamp_created": 1478834990, "timestamp_updated": 1478836011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 18,

The only real criticisms levelled at this game is a lack of recognizable tunes (if you\u2019re not Japanese) and the fact the art design could have used a few more effects to give the characters more colour depth. Other than that the game does what it says on the tin.\n\nSenran Kagura Bon Appetit seems like it\u2019s designed purely to view the ladies in a variety of cooking scenarios which make their well endowed chests heave and wobble as much as possible. It\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s an anime fetish game especially with the sauce covered ladies in their special scenes as rewards. Still, if you\u2019re a fan of ogling anime characters then this one is highly suggestive even if it\u2019s tame compared to more racy adult content available. If you\u2019re into the franchise then this is very much a fun distraction and if you\u2019re not and want to sample some Japanese cultural differences then you can get that here in spades. Anyone else, especially those of a sensitive nature need to look away\u2026forever lest they taint their vision with over-sexualized young ladies in provocative scenes designed purely to titillate in a fun kind of way.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gL-7V7u4qfA", "timestamp_created": 1478813680, "timestamp_updated": 1478813680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26525031": {"recommendationid": "26525031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010303078", "num_games_owned": 620, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483838581}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is still a Vita port, so if you're expecting some PS4 level remaster, you're not getting it for the right reasons.\n\nThe game is fairly simple in its controls, loaded with fanservice, and has a story that isn't so much of a story as it is the \"Girl's missions\" for the other games padded by a ryhthm minigame that goes from \"So easy grandma can do it\" to \"I bet Korean Starcraft II tournaments are easier than this.\"\n\nThe game has an unlockable/outfit system which you can use and abuse to your libido's limits that works by beating various characters, and story modes to unlock items you can use in the dressing room. On top of that, between each challenge, you can hit the dresisng room immediately to put those cat ears on your ninja of choice.\n\nI think the game, personally, is a bit up there in fanservice. It gets really hard to hit the right buttons when giant breasts pop up and take command of the scene, but other than that. If you're into that, great. I got it mostly to know more about Senran Kagura story (lol [no really, I like the ninjas and all but knowing more about a character is plain fun ] ) and sharpen up my rythym skills so I can play other games like STepmania and Crypt of the Necrodancer a bit easier. It seems like a promising way to get better at those as well.\n\ntl;dr : It's a titty comedy.

Gameplay aspects are well-made with tight controls, but the visual aspects are a bit more disappointing.  Its lineage from the Vita is definitely apparent, with low-res textures galore. I mean seriously, even G-strings (which are practically straight goddamn lines down the crack, here) can have their pixels individually counted, just looking very muddy in general.\n\n The character models look a bit rugged, with vertices appearing in odd places. This is all magnified by the cell-shading effect that the characters have, which honestly makes them look odd, and very out of place with their surroundings (which aren't cell-shaded.) The naked-in-dessert reward scenes are a good example of this, with the chocolate textures on the girls looking terribly low-res, and super out of place with the nice non-cell-shaded food props on and around them. (whipped cream, etc.) Feel like they would honestly look nicer without the effect.\n\n There also seems to be an issue of an enormous difficulty spike between easy and normal modes. I can be completely bored and get 100%-Perfect when playing on easy, and be failing desperately with 100% unsatisfactory ratings abound on normal mode, which left me feeling like a difficulty in between the two would be perfect for my level. (Should mention that i'm not very experienced with rhythm games in general.) \n\nBeen a fan for a while of the Senran Kagura games, but it's reaching a point where it could really use an overhaul. If you like rhythm games, the Senran games in general, or even dress-up games (which this has in spades) you'll probably like this game.

What a game![/b]\n\nThis game is a bit different to all the other Senran Kagura games. It is a spinoff like the \"Versus\" games. The difference is that you don\u00b4t have to fight your opponents in a \"King of the Fights\" style! instead of that you have to beat them in a cooking competition.\n\n[b]The plot is really complex! There is none! Suprised? Well - it is a Senran Kagura game after all! You will just get a short explanation why cute ninja girls do cute and lewdy things! Don\u00b4t expect a story like Dragon Age.[/b]\n\nThe gameplay is simple and easy. It is a rhythm game and shares many similarities with games like \"Guitar Hero\"! You have two lines on the bottom of the screen. Symbols (the keys on your keyboard or your gamepad) will appear and slide from the right to the left. Hit the right button at the right moment and you will succeed! If you win you will shred your opponents clothes to shreds! If you lose... well it is your turn to lose some fabrics!\nIf you do a perfect round it is even getting more lewd! But I don\u00b4t want to spoil it for now...\n\nThe story mode offers you to play with each girl (each girl has a unique mini story). You also have a tournament mode. It sure can get a bit repetitive after a while, but the different music tracks are well made.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXkoMcl0Jgw&index=10&list=PL7P4fpaQWDhh_aGCG9Cy5ogzTiDnGGosb\nFor those who are not used to rhythm games: This is not OSU! or DDR! You can choose between different difficulty settings. Easy mode is easy mode! I would also suggest you to play with a gamepad. It makes the gameplay way easier!\n\nI have to say that I enjoyed this game so far! I highly suggest it to people who wants to get into a rhythm game at all (and because of the lewdy bits)! For all Senran Kagura fans it is a must have!\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nNow some self promotion!

Un effort a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sur le sc\u00e9nario, chaque fille ayant ses motivations propres pour participer au concours de cuisine qui sert de toile de fond au r\u00e9cit. Sans atteindre bien entendu les talents d\u2019\u00e9criture du studio Obsidian, il r\u00e9ussit l\u00e0 o\u00f9 beaucoup d\u2019autres \u00e9chouent : proposer une histoire que l\u2019on n\u2019a pas forc\u00e9ment envie de passer, afin de voir jusqu\u2019o\u00f9 les sc\u00e9naristes sont all\u00e9s ! Et le moins que l\u2019on puisse dire, c\u2019est qu\u2019ils sont all\u00e9s loin\u2026\n\nUn autre de ses points forts est la customisation : Bon Appetit! nous vient sur PC dans une \u00e9dition GOTY, dite Full Course. Avant m\u00eame d\u2019avoir d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9 quoi que ce soit, nous avons donc des possibilit\u00e9s tr\u00e8s grandes pour changer les v\u00eatements selon nos envies, rajouter des accessoires, changer les coupes de cheveux\u2026Bref, une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 qui fait plaisir !\n\nBien que nous ayons acc\u00e8s \u00e0 moult tenues, les graphismes ne font h\u00e9las pas honneur \u00e0 celles-ci : Senran Kagura Bon Appetit! \u00e9tait sorti sur Vita, et \u00e7a se voit. On n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contre un travail suppl\u00e9mentaire, sur les personnages par exemple, qui sont bien lisses. Cela aurait exig\u00e9 un co\u00fbt de d\u00e9veloppement  suppl\u00e9mentaire, qui, malheureusement, n\u2019aurait certainement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rentable\u2026Le portage est n\u00e9anmoins tr\u00e8s bon, n\u2019ayant eu aucun bug et ma manette Xbox One ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue nativement. \n\nD\u2019un point de vue gameplay, on assimile rapidement les bases : si vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 jou\u00e9 \u00e0 un jeu de rythme, vous ne serez pas d\u00e9pays\u00e9 : le concept est addictif, simple \u00e0 prendre en main, et efficace. La playlist n\u2019est toutefois pas assez vari\u00e9e : pour terminer l\u2019histoire d\u2019un personnage, il faut faire cinq musiques \u00e0 la suite. Il y a vingt-deux personnages, et chacun d\u2019eux en a une sp\u00e9cifique. Elles reviennent donc extr\u00eamement rapidement, et, pour peu que nous encha\u00eenions trois-quatre histoires \u00e0 la suite, on se retrouve \u00e0 faire deux, voire trois fois la m\u00eame ! Pour plus de vari\u00e9t\u00e9, on aurait aim\u00e9 que chaque personnage en ait deux diff\u00e9rentes, m\u00eame si l\u00e0 encore, le co\u00fbt de d\u00e9veloppement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien plus \u00e9lev\u00e9...\n\nOn conseillera donc de faire ce jeu par petites sessions, pour \u00e9viter de se lasser trop rapidement : deux personnages que vous faites pendant une soir\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s le travail par exemple, est une bonne moyenne. La difficult\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tant d\u2019ailleurs pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e, hormis deux-trois musiques qui n\u00e9cessitent de recommencer,  il est parfait pour se d\u00e9tendre, \u00e0 moins que vous vouliez tenter le mode difficile : celui-ci n\u00e9cessite beaucoup d\u2019entra\u00eenement et d\u2019essais avant de r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 faire un score convenable. \n\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 un de ses d\u00e9fauts : \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que nous faisons les histoires des personnages dans l\u2019ordre que nous souhaitons, il n\u2019y a pas de courbe de difficult\u00e9, nous n\u2019avons pas vraiment de sentiment de progression. Qu\u2019on vienne de commencer le jeu ou qu\u2019on l\u2019ait termin\u00e9, le mode difficile pose les m\u00eames obstacles, \u00e0 peine plus facilement surmontables pour celui qui a fait l\u2019histoire de tous les personnages\u2026\n\nIl n\u2019en reste pas moins que Senran Kagura Bon Appetit!, sans \u00eatre excellent, fait passer de tr\u00e8s bons moments : on s\u2019y amuse, on rit, on est \u00e9bahi, on se demande jusqu\u2019o\u00f9 \u00e7a va aller, \u00e7a va encore plus loin que ce qu\u2019on imaginait, bref, une curiosit\u00e9 venue tout droit du Japon qu\u2019on aurait tort de n\u00e9gliger !", "timestamp_created": 1519840331, "timestamp_updated": 1519858876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40461931": {"recommendationid": "40461931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204758163", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519826129}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u845b\u57ce\u8d85\u68d2der~\n\u7206\u91cf\u6b27\u6d3e\u723d\u6b7b\n\u672c\u6e38\u620f\u4e00\u5171\u6709\u516b\u4e2a\u5224\u5b9a\u6309\u952e\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u4e3awasd\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u952e\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u4e24\u7ec4\u6309\u952e\u6362\u4e3a\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u6c34\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u4e24\u7ec44\u4e2a\u6309\u952e\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u4e0d\u4f1a\u56e0\u4e3a\u624b\u6307\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u808c\u8089\u8bb0\u5fc6\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u672c\u4eba\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u662fwasd\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u65b9\u5411\u952e\u5bf9\u5e94\u6539\u4e3aijkl", "timestamp_created": 1519826394, "timestamp_updated": 1519826394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40374853": {"recommendationid": "40374853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198418172224", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 263, "last_played": 1521681945}, "language": "english", "review": "Bretty gud rhythm game.

While I like the idea of Rhythm Games, I usually need an interesting conceit to try it out. Turning it into a cooking competiton, a la Food Wars, is that in spades. First off, this is a hard game. You have have two scrolling tracks to pay attention to and (I played this on controller so I don't know how it is with keyboard) you have match both directional inputs and button inputs. The thing is directionals and buttons are colored the same (e.g. left and X are both blue, right and B are pink) so you get a lot of buttons popping up it's very easy to mess up and lose a round you were nailing just a second ago.\n\nSecond, the music is awesome. I've been playing this off and on since the Winter sale and those songs just get stuck n my head. My favorite is Murasaki's which goes from chiptune to metal. Another great thing is that you get the whole soundtrack with it to listen to when not playing, pretty good deal.\n\nOh, and by the way, boobs. Lots of boobs. I think that is the only thing that could drive people away and that's completely understandable. Some of the motives characters have at the start of their story is kinda \"wtf\" in relation to their appearences, usually the size of their breasts, but by the time you finish the story mode for them, their self-image is iproved to not worry about such things. But most of the stories are just weird fetishes like romantical involved with bean sprouts; wanting to be tempura; and needing long, thick futamaki rolls all the time. \n\nIf you don't care for sexualized content and blatant inneuendos, don't even tempt the though of getting this.

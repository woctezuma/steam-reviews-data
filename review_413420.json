One thing leads to another and you find yourself trying to find which one of your 'friends' killed the person you kind of liked. You gather evidence, usually while you, as the player, formulate your own theories about what happened and once you have every neccessary piece a class trial is initiated (which is essentially you and your buddies acting as jurors). For actual real life detectives, it might be disappointing to discover the game doesn't allow you to find the murderer alone, but for the rest of us plebiens the trial is spent slowly but surely piecing together the killer's identity using your own logic and contributions from the class.\n\nWhile you aren't alone, you are always the key character in solving the mystery. Most of the actual deduction is performed during class discussions and one on one 'rebuttal duels' with other students. Unfortunately, the game has several additional minigames you need to pass to solve the mystery.\n\nThe most broken of these is 'Hangman's gambit' where you have to play a minigame about putting together letters forming a phrase which is key to the discussion (and therefore mystery) at hand. The gameplay itself is fine, but it has one glaring problem. It only accepts one specific phrase. This is, I believe, a problem resulting from the japanese translation, because in japanese there is probably no synonyms for the object or action. Problem is in English, when you try to enter something like (for example) 'water bottle', it doesn't work, and the game turns into a trial and error game where you enter an extremely confused state as you realise what you thought is wrong and the entire investigation has shifted oh my god. Then after ten minutes of fiddling around, you find that the word you were supposed to enter is actually 'drink bottle'.\nThis is a broken minigame, and you do it about least twice every trial.\n\nAnother problem is a weird rhythm minigame which resulted from the developers not knowing why people play the game (hint: it's not for the sick beats and autotuned phrases). It's out of place, and slightly annoying but it wouldn't be such a problem if the tutorials weren't so thoroughly fucked.\n\nThe tutorials are entirely text based. This isn't too bad, except when the translators perfectly copied what is in japanese (which isn't too much of a problem in character interactions) and you don't know what the fuck they're talking about, especially seeing as you have no pictures to reference. It turns the first time playing a minigame into another trial and error piece of dogshite, but after you're done with all of them, you're usually alright.\n\nAnother problem (which is actually pretty subjective) is that between deaths and trials you spend your time faffing about with the other kids. It's alright, but not super interesting. The game also spends a lot of effort trying to set you up with 94M3R waifu, which is annoying but not obtrusive. While it is neccesary for the sake of the trial to look at the locations before the murder, its boring and the game kind of forces you to do it.\nBut that's not nearly as bad as I'm making it out to be.\n\n\nWhy do I play the game? I really, really enjoy the convoluted mysteries and the slow edging towards the killer. It's well done, and unless you are actually some sort of uber detective or have fourth wall technology, you only have an incomplete picture of how the killing was carried out (due to the fact you are piecing it together as your collect evidence). Ironically, it's only during the class trials, the only time where you play from 3rd person, that you truly feel like you are in the game. It's not because the main character's shit, it's because the mysteries are just so engaging, and the game usually does a great job of making you feel like you are actually solving it.\n\nThese are easily the best parts of the game, despite all the issues I have with them. The feeling of being some sort of beta-male uber detective is just too good. You're not dodging bullets, or saving princesses, you are using your head, engaging with the world of the game and solving crimes. That's fun.\n\nFor those worrying that the game gets too anime, don't worry. It does, but only with a few characters and moments which are infrequently spaced, and you kind of zone it out after a while. Don't let that stop you from playing this game.\n\n\nEDIT: It does get pretty anime.\n\nAlso don't watch the 3rd series anime because I'm 99 percent sure they lose sight of the themes and just focus on plot.", "timestamp_created": 1514185579, "timestamp_updated": 1514295276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38644209": {"recommendationid": "38644209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084631833", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "last_played": 1514534355}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty terrible game\nit's like they tried shoving every gameplay mechanic into this game, and the sad thing is none of it works\nI found all the characters to be unbelievably annoying.

Instead of a hero that is relentlessly optimistic, we have a protagonist who is grounded in reality, virtually normal in all ways, but still intelligent and sharp, and his way of solving murders and talking to friends is different than Makoto Naegi.\n\nThe gameplay is more refined, although some minigames could stand to be a little more polished. The non-stop debates are back, and they're as fun as ever. Like usual, you have to use the evidence to find holes and twists, and this time, you don't just say people are wrong. You agree with them, back up their statements, reinforce points.\n\nThe cast of characters is just wonderfully entertaining. There are bound to be favorites. I know I've chosen my favorite waifu(s), and it makes it all the more painful when you see them become a victim or become a blackened.\n\nThe story kept me heavily invested and I was on the edge of my seat wondering what evidence and whose testimony would change the course of the trials. The many moral dilemmas that each characters face made me consider what I would do in a similar situation.\n\nThere is also a good chunk of post-story content that'll keep you coming back for more. Minigames are fun, but the main attraction here is the dating sim. Now you can date your favorite character! What's not to like?\n\nDanganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is a story that invests a lot into its story, its characters, and its presentation. It takes what made the first game good and makes it better, exceeding the first game in almost every way.

So they improved the overall aspects of the game. \n\nThe charachters and settings are like comparing Apples or Oranges you will have your own opinions but they are great in both games! I feel like Danganronpa is a series you can accidentally spoil very easily so be careful when you view discussions of this game. Once it's spoiled it's not really fun. Because it's a mystery game.

I couldn't be happier with that decision.  The first game was one of the most unique, interesting, and compelling single player games I've experienced in years.  After completing the first game I immediately purchased the sequel that everyone seemed to like even more.  I'll be honest, for the first few chapters I didn't find myself enjoying this game as much as the first one.  I still liked it but I genuinely cared about the characters from the first game so much that starting with an entirely new cast meant this sequel was fighting an uphill battle from the start.  Despite that obstacle this game has managed to easily become one of my favorites that I've ever played.  A gameplay loop of build relationships/alliances to survive, introduction of the motivation of the week (ie you'll all starve until someone kills), investigate the murder of one or more of those same people you're trying to work with, trial to figure out/prove whodunnit, elaborate execution of the convicted, and having every day end with the philosophical ponderings of what can only be described as a psychotic teddy bear is something I never I never would have guessed would be so compelling.  The games would easily fall apart if they weren't fantastically written and neatly wrapped in their colorful art style that belies a series with some of the darkest tones I've ever experienced in a game but they manage to hold together and pull it off beutifully.

Tambi\u00e9n, el nivel de dificultad est\u00e1 mal equilibrado: nivel facil es excesivamente f\u00e1cil; nivel medio es  f\u00e1cil; y nivel dif\u00edcil es complicado.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, si lo que quieres es una historia muy entretenida, con personajes con un carisma brutal y pasar muchas horas de entretenimento puro sumando la campa\u00f1a y lo mini-juegos que se desbloquean tras el modo historia (tambi\u00e9n son enetretenidos), este es tu juego; pero si lo que quieres es ver un drama increible, con evoluci\u00f3n de todos los personajes por la perdida de sus compa\u00f1eros o un juego que deje con la pregunta \"\u00bfCu\u00e1ndo considero a una persona mi amigo? - \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo debo confiar en alguien?\" (temas que intenta tratar el juego pero se los lleva el viento),

time spent on, but as I see things, I believe that the first game was way better in almost all aspects, despite that there are new amazing characters, and the storyline is fantastic.\n\nspoilers ahead\n\nWhat I liked\n- Some characters\n- Characters funny appearances\n- Characters design\n- Great storyline idea\n- Approach of killings and crimes\n- Chapter 4 and 5 crimes\n- Chapter 6 by itself\n- New amazing tracks on top of the 10/10 first game ost\n- Slightly funnier tone of the game\n- Plot twists\n- Old characters appearance\n\nWhat I did not liked\n- No logic in ending at all, story resolved by itself\n- fanservice \n- First three crimes pretty not interesting, there's absolutely no feeling of logic, deduction, and accomplishment in them\n- 6 likable characters out of 16\n- Some characters too clich\u00e9 and exceptionally annoying\n- Another word to the class trials\n- Another word to the logic, motivations, and common sense\n- Another word to the anime sides of the game\n\nDespite those weak points, overall this game was amazing!\nIt really plays well, and intriguing 'till the very end.\nAnother shoutout to those likable characters, storyline, soundtrack, and three last chapters.\n\nThere's really not that much from the most popular visual novels that can be count fully as the video game, on this level of production, and made with such passion, and just for the sake of story I can rate this game as good 4 out of 5.\n\nGladly I can look for the continuation!\nBecause there's Danganronpa v3.", "timestamp_created": 1513229261, "timestamp_updated":

tal nivel ... me alegro de haberme equivocado xD. Dejando a parte que para mi la primera parte no la puede superar, puedo decir que llega al mismo nivel perfectamente. Desde el comienzo ya empieza a romperte la cabeza con cosas extra\u00f1as que viniendo del primero no te esperas... pero en cuanto aparece monokuma yo pens\u00e9 que todo volver\u00eda a repetirse de nuevo.... Pero a pesar de que si, el concepto se repite, el argumento va por otros cauces y los personajes nuevos tambi\u00e9n son geniales y muy variados, creando situaciones totalmente diferentes. De hecho es gracioso como el gui\u00f3n juega con los fans sabiendo que vamos de listos y nos esperamos lo mismo que en el primero y hasta te echan en cara que no va a repetirse algo tan tipico como lo que pas\u00f3 en tal momento de la primera parte xD.\n\nNo quiero spoilear nada, as\u00ed que simplemente dir\u00e9 que el gui\u00f3n de nuevo es una maravilla super bien llevada de principio a final, sabiendo dar los giros argumentales de manera magnif\u00edca (me han dejado medio tonto con alguno de los giros que tiene con muchos WTF xD, como me pas\u00f3 en el primero vamos ) y dar pistas poco a poco para que puedas ir dando tu tus deducciones tanto del caso que toca como del argumento general del cual hay pistas desde el comienzo. Y de nuevo, no te esperas nada. Bueno, alguna cosa quizas si eres tan de tramas detectivescas como yo si que vas notando con tus dotes de observaci\u00f3n xD. \n\nA nivel de gameplay mantiene el estilo del primer juego, con el mismo sistema de novela visual + juicios a lo phoenix wright por decir un simil cercano. Tambi\u00e9n hay lo de interactuar en el tiempo libre con los demas y dar regalos con los que ir mejorando la relacion con ellos. Como novedad, en los juicios hay nuevas habilidades y nuevos minijuegos para ir averiguando las diferentes contradicciones y pistas...y os aseguro que la cosa de complica que da gusto!  Un sistema que ya funcionaba en el primero y que no necesitaba mucho as\u00ed que simplemente hay algunas novedades que a\u00f1aden m\u00e1s dificultad y variedad. \n\nA nivel tecnico es exactamente igual que el primero y es que no necesita de nada m\u00e1s, adem\u00e1s que el apartado visual es muy marca de la saga e incluso tiene sentido dentro de ese universo. (Aunque siempre me he planteado que si la sangre es rosa, \u00bfquiere decir que los que tienen ojos o pelos rojos realmente son rosas? xD) . Eso si, hay un mapa muchisimo mas grande y variado, algo que el primero se hacia algo monotono y lo han solucionado aqu\u00ed a lo grande. Y con el movimiento han aprovechado para poder hacer un tamagochi integrado con tus pasos xD.\n\nEl gui\u00f3n como he dicho es genial y los personajes muy buenos y os har\u00e1n comer la oya m\u00e1s de la cuenta sabiendo de d\u00f3nde venimos con el 1. Aunque tengo que decir que el grupo del primero, en conjunto me gust\u00f3 m\u00e1s. Quiero decir que en este nuevo hay un par que para mi son mas flojuchos(el resto son geniales eso si), en el primero todos eran geniales, hasta la que duraba naa y menos xD. Eso si, en este hay un par de waifus geniales para mi... xD. Aunque es peligroso encari\u00f1arse en estos juegos T_T. Peligroso en todos los sentidos, todos sabemos lo buena que est\u00e1 cierta Junko... xD. Ah y el protagonista est\u00e1 muy bien porque es bastante diferente al del primero (a pesar de tambi\u00e9n ser muy bueno con las deducciones xD)\nY bueno, como es f\u00e1cil de deducir, es necesario 100% haber jugado al primer Danganronpa, si no esto no tiene ningun sentido. \n\n\u00bfDuracion deciis? Pues un pelin mas corto que el primero quiz\u00e1s (o no, quizas es simplemente porque sab\u00eda m\u00e1s como funcionaba el juego ). Depende la velocidad de lectura por supuesto... ah\u00ed est\u00e1 lo unico negativo del juego, que est\u00e1 en ingles.... aunque me han comentado que los fans casi lo tienen traducido ya como hicieron con el primero, as\u00ed que podreis jugarlo sin excusa del idioma en cuanto lo tengan. Y bueno, me lo he pasado pero tengo que seguir porque al pasartelo se te desbloquean dos extras: una novela y un capitulo extra de hechos alternativos que vete a saber cuanto dura xD. Tambi\u00e9n tiene algun minijuego extra con lo que es de lo m\u00e1s completito.\n\nPor sacar algo negativo, yo cambiaria el sistema de relaciones haciendo algo m\u00e1s profundo... es verdad que es dificil con el tema de los asesinatos pero podria estar bien que al conseguir mas relacion con alguna (o alguno si prefieres tu xD) se notase en las conversaciones que teneis mejor relacion, que te apoyase m\u00e1s, te ayudase en los juicios, luego un poco de jugueteo en el apartamento, porque si mueres pues al menos que te vayas contento... xD.\n\nEn fin, no volver\u00e9 a decir que es imposible que el siguiente mantenga tal nivel despu\u00e9s de lo visto... pero es dif\u00edcil! Tengo ganas ya de coger el 3!. As\u00ed que si, recomendad\u00edsimo a los fans de las novelas visuales, sobre todo los que os gusten las originales y con m\u00e1s interacci\u00f3n y... bueno, los que hayais jugado al primero y os haya gustado, seguro que no os defrauda esta segunda parte.

Es decir, Danganronpa 2 es t\u00e9cnicamente mi primer juego que compro.\nLa verdad tengo sentimientos encontrados, me parece un gran juego con una gran historia y excelentes personajes pero las mec\u00e1nicas de juego durante los juicios NO me gustaron, se me hacen confusas y nada amigables al jugador. Para ilustrar mi queja, y sin af\u00e1n de presumir, les comento que el segundo y tercer caso se me hicieron muy f\u00e1ciles, sabia desde el comienzo exactamente quien era el asesino y aunque no sabia sus motivos si sabia como realiz\u00f3 el asesinato.....sin embargo durante los juicios fracas\u00e9 varias veces.....la raz\u00f3n de esto es que aunque estaba preparado para presentar las pruebas muchas veces fall\u00e9 por no saber jugar correctamente. El juego no se limita solo a presentar las pruebas tienes que jugar minijuegos (los cuales en mi opini\u00f3n no son explicados correctamente) ya sea disparandole (literalmente) a los argumentos de los personajes, usando un cuchillo para cortar palabras o jugar un minijuego de \"ahorcado\" (hangman) medio raro, entre otros, todos estos minijuegos con limites de tiempo. Esto significa que si solo buscas un juego para investigar y pensar, prep\u00e1rate porque vas a necesitar muchos reflejos tambi\u00e9n.\nAdem\u00e1s, siento que los minijuegos no todos son necesarios, por ejemplo, durante un juicio aparecer\u00e1 constantemente un minijuego de andar en patineta.........andar en patineta........durante un juicio......Porque Dios, porque? En mi opini\u00f3n siento que los desarrolladores hacen estos minijuegos porque no conf\u00edan en su historia, quiz\u00e1s sienten que el jugador se aburrir\u00eda si no hubieran estos, pero la historia es FANT\u00c1STICA!!!, es interesante, es divertida, puede volverse amarga y te encari\u00f1as de los personajes (hasta de los mas odiosos) as\u00ed que no creo que nadie se llegara a quejar incluso si el juego tuviera menos minijuegos y durara menos.\nPor cierto, quiz\u00e1s te va a dar dolor de cuello porque las palabras a veces salen a toda velocidad inclinada o de cabeza y tendr\u00e1s que voltear varias veces la cabeza para leerlas. De ah\u00ed en fuera totalmente recomiendo el juego, te engancha mucho y el ultimo capitulo se me hizo MUY BUENO. \nSin embargo antes de comprar hay otras cosas que quiz\u00e1s deber\u00edas considerar antes de comprar el juego:\n- El juego NO est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol, solo ingl\u00e9s y japon\u00e9s. Adem\u00e1s necesitas m\u00ednimo un ingl\u00e9s medio porque no solo vas a leer, necesitas adivinar palabras en ingl\u00e9s y necesitar\u00e1s pensarlas r\u00e1pido porque los juicios tienen limite de tiempo.\n - Es recomendable jugar el primer juego (o ver el anime como yo hice) porque eventualmente el juego empieza a soltarte referencias a la entrega anterior y a enlazar la trama. No es imprescindible, pero la historia la disfrutar\u00e1s mas si conoces la trama del primero.\n\nEs una buena compra, con o sin descuentos, disfrutar\u00e1s la trama, los personajes, hay un mont\u00f3n de referencias a otros juegos y animes, la m\u00fasica es excelente. Solo recuerda que no es solo una novela visual porque hay varios minijuegos que tendr\u00e1s que jugar de si o si para seguir avanzando.", "timestamp_created": 1512962087, "timestamp_updated": 1512962087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38225334": {"recommendationid": "38225334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104316199", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513274148}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't like Tetris anymore.", "timestamp_created": 1512955935, "timestamp_updated": 1512955935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 50, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782192", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38224697": {"recommendationid": "38224697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260861833", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "last_played": 1513826695}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, good vn, shit girls except for mikan :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1512953226, "timestamp_updated": 1512953226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38223652": {"recommendationid": "38223652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119919827", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513646002}, "language": "english", "review": "say goodbye to your favorite characters", "timestamp_created": 1512948927, "timestamp_updated": 1512948927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38222274": {"recommendationid": "38222274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258641674", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "last_played": 1513755078}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7f6a\u6728\u871c\u67d1\u662f\u6211\u8001\u5a46\n\u6211\u6c38\u8fdc\u559c\u6b22\u7f6a\u6728\u871c\u67d1", "timestamp_created": 1512943849, "timestamp_updated": 1512943849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38214412": {"recommendationid": "38214412", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990448462", "num_games_owned": 638, "num_reviews": 163, "playtime_forever": 2002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512894957}, "language": "english", "review": "Danganronpa 2 has some small quality of life improvements over the first game and the story gets a good bit more interesting toward the end, but on the whole, it doesn't match up to its predecessor.\n\nThe single worst offender is that just like the first, Danganronpa 2 gleefully wastes your time as it pads out the game. By breaking the story into discrete days and nights, it forces you to sit through an announcement at night, a dream sequence immediately thereafter, an announcement in the morning, and breakfast after that. You basically have player agency taken away from you for 5-10 minutes of IRL time every damn day in the game. One would've hoped the sequel would drop this practice.\n\nBut while even the first game padded itself out like that, Danganronpa 2 distinguishes itself with flatter characters that are a lot harder to care about. While a large-cast visual novel is rarely going to have deep characterization, here we have one-note disappointments like \"Screaming man who yells about bowel movements a lot,\" and \"Christ, we get it; you're meek and accident prone,\" and \"Excessively rude girl.\" When one character dies, the game insists over and over that she was the heart of the group and had an unwavering force of personality to cover up for the fact that the game does nothing to characterize this bland, blank slate.\n\nThis is on top of cases that just don't match up to the first game's. While the murders are more complex, key details come up during the trial rather than the investigation, which makes many of them beyond the reach of your deduction. Instead you just sit there and play some minigames to hammer out convoluted details that the writers couldn't figure out how to get the character to realize by way of the evidence.\n\nAnd the minigames. My god the minigames. They're bigger, more intrusive, and so much more tedious than in the previous game. \n\nWhere I said of the first game that its mysteries were so fun that players might look past the padding and tedium, the math just doesn't add up this time around. With weaker mysteries and a LOT more baggage, Danganronpa 2 never really gets off the ground like its predecessor did.\n\nThis, of course, will be lost in the sea of positive reviews, because anime-likers are the worst people.", "timestamp_created": 1512922713, "timestamp_updated": 1512923062, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38208110": {"recommendationid": "38208110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022642758", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512574609}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Mini games ficaram piores, n\u00e3o tem mais o fator surpresa do primeiro game, os dois animais de pelucia s\u00e3o um saco, os personagens s\u00e3o gen\u00e9ricos, at\u00e9 o nome do personagem principal \u00e9 gen\u00e9rico, o primeiro jogo se passava em uma escola , esse se passa em um arquip\u00e9lago paradis\u00edaco, leva mais tempo pra passar de um lado pro outro. \n\nHist\u00f3ria que deveria ser o foco desse jogo \u00e9 pior que a do primeiro game.

There are improvements with the topics that I complained about in the last game, like repetitive BGMs. The BGMs are now varied! \n\nThe ending of the game could be viewed as a weak cop-out because it contains both of the positives of either option that were given to survivors of this game. Due to the vague ending of this game, it is really up to interpretation, I don't think it is a bad ending because it offers a lot of philosophical life advice. It really gets you thinking about your past and just accepting it. I won't get into much detail because it is a topic that is still getting discussed on the Danganronpa Subreddit/Steam Community Discussions. \n\n===THE BAD===\nThe majority of the characters are very weak! Most of the characters that don't get much recognization are mostly the weak ones. However, there are a select of amazing characters that people proclaim as either their husbando or waifu -Chiaki, Nagito, Hajime, and etc. The ones that don't do well is Mahiru, Byakuya(fat version), Hyoko, and fat cooking guy; these characters don't have much to offer but just to be another person to move the plot. That's fine to make them plot devices because you gotta do it somehow, but I just feel that they could have done it a bit better and making us feel bad rather than playing the sad BGM.\n\nThe gameplay offers a bad Logic Dive mini-game. I just wish that they just offer something that keep you in the class trial rather than pulling you out because it just kills the pace of the game. The pace does get messed up a lot when Logic Dive comes around because you have to kill time by playing it. \n\nOverall, it's a good gamme!

"Monokuma's back in this thrilling continuation of the Danganronpa series. \n\nThis time, sixteen students have found themselves trapped on the uninhabited Jabberwock Island. However, just like before, these aren't just ANY sixteen students. They're sixteen ULTIMATE students from Hope's Peak Academy. Also, like the orginal colourful cast, the new students all are very characterized and fleshed out. Trust me, you won't be dissapointed. \n\nSolve murders, discover secrets about the island, and learn the truth about what Monokuma is planning this time around (and yes, this plan is full of despair). But that's not all! The story about the Danganronpa universe in this game picks up from where the last game left off, throwing in various elements, old and new. (I won't say anymore about it, as it's best to go into this game knowing as little as humanly possible). \n\nSo in conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The murders were engrossing, the characters were detailed and well thought out, and the story was AMAZING. This is a worthy edition of the Danganronpa series, in more ways than one (But I won't spoil!). \n\nHighly reccommended! I gurantee that fans of the series will love this!\n\nP.S: I'm SO ready for the third volume!! But it's so expensive ;-;\n\nP.P.S: In my opinion, this game was even better than the first (in terms of character and story). My brain exploded in the finale reveal. It was aaaaamazing.

The murders are sufficiently clever, although they felt disproportionately difficult to complete... But at least they brought in a purpose to free time!

After the ending of Danganronpa 1 i couldn't live without the Dangan anymore, so i played this right after.\nAnd yes, this will be full of Spoilers, so if you haven't played this Game, F*ck Off!\n\n[h1]Chapter 1:[/h1]\n\nSo we are standing in front of Hope's Peak Academy again, and we are Makoto. Wait....This is not Makoto..B-but...The Hair? And...\nWell no, we are now Hajime Hinata, he isn't as a bad as \"We will totally stop killing each other now- Naegi\". But he still had his moments where i wanted to bash his f*cking ahoge in.\nSo the whole Academy thing was a prank, now theres some rabbit, we are on an island and basically everybody got bamboozled. So Hajime walks around and meets his new friendly friends.\nFirst he meets a mixture of Geralt of Riva and Makoto who tries to flirt with him. And no i wont explain everyone, but here are the best:\n\n1. A cute english princess who wants to have a little nighty-fun with murderers.\n\n2. A Baby-Gangster with the Catchphrase \"Dont F*ck With Me!\" who is even better.\n\n3. And finally the best of them all, the Man with the Cuteness even in his name and his beautiful \"Aw Maaan's\" that come out of his pretty shark face.\n\nSo and then there is Byakuya, but now he's fat.\nThe Rabbit's older brother comes in...oh surprise its Monokuma. He once again explains everything and destroys the peaceful atmosphere.\nFat B dies first, and some pervert kills him, who then gets executed.\n\n[h1] Chapter 2: [/h1]\nThey play some creepy game, Mahiru dies...Whos Mahiru? I don't even know nor do i care. and Peko kills her, well f*ck Peko...Wait...no don't do this... Fuyuhiko then opens up to Peko before she gets executed and we find out she sacrificed herself so he could live... FIRST TIME I CRIED.\n\n[h1] Chapter 3: [/h1]\n\nEverbody gets sick, Hajime tries to sleep with Gamer Girl, Geralt and the Nurse.\nwell Ibuki and Hiyoko die, Nurse was it and gets executed, bla bla bla.\n\n[h1] Chapter 4: [/h1]\n\nSonia, Fuyuhiko and Soda are still the cutest Cinnamon Roles in town and they get locked up in some castle, Nag...i mean Geralt plays Russian Roulette with 5 bullets and finds out that Hajime is the only one with no talent...he then does the only plausible thing and starts to bully him. Hajime meanwhile is concentrating on getting some Gamer GF Ass.\nNekomaru dies the 2. time (he died first somewhere in between) And Marilyn Manson killed him. Marilyn then gets executed and flies to Heaven....SECOND TIME I CRIED\n\n[h1] Chapter 5: [/h1]\n\nGeralt has torture-sex with himself and trusts his luck to find out who helped him kill himself without even knowing it.\nSorry Hajimate, but this will hurt. Gamer Girl is actually just a program and is the one who killed geralt and gets executed.....And now Everyone's in a program....What? Wait what!?\n\n[h1] Finale... Chapter 6: [/h1]\n\nEverything starts bugging. Then Hajime comes in and...Wait? No? W-wha? OH THIS IS MAKOTO NOW? So Makoto comes in and is like \"Yes you People....hah, you did some crazy stuff with Junko's Body..and this is the program of future foundation, im trying to save you people from your DEEEESPAIR, but i used Internet Explorer so it wasn't save and we have a Virus now. So you can decide either you stay in here and happy or you go out and become the DEEEEESPAIR.\" \nThen Monokuma explodes and the Virus is Actually Junko as an AI. So i have Junko again....my Heart doesnt need more....but then the real Byakuya comes in and i have to hold myself from Cumming on the Keyboard. \nJunko then tells Hajime \"You are actually Kamukura Kamukura Yas Queen. you are the reason everything went super bad.\"\nHajime then cries, but then he says \"Yo, you know what? I had enough of this, i'm leaving, but as a nice man. I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR RULES, I WILL LEAVE AND DESTROY THE JUNKO VIRUS!!!\".\n\nAnd you know our Boy Hajimeme, if he wants something, he gets it. So he makes it work.\nAt the End we see Kyoko and Byakuya bullying Makoto because he is going to get his ass kicked by the Future Foundation. \n\n[h1] I Have Won The Game: [/h1]\n\nWell, well, well...Sonia, Fuyuhiko and Kazuichi were my favourite characters...all of them survived until the end....I officially won a Danganronpa Game....

deserved\n3) You really should play the first game before this!\n\n\nSo Danganronpa 2 follows a similar style to the original in that kids are forced to kill each other to survive. After each kill there is a \"Class trial\" with 2 possible outcomes:\n1) You find the killer and they are executed\n2) You do not find the killer, the killer can go home, and everyone else is executed\n\nI won't say too much as the story has so many twists and turns that spoilers are far too easy to casually hand out - but this one had my jaw drop on several occasions - especially in the act 5 trial!! The story and, importantly, the localisation is absolutely fantastic!\n\nBoth games are on sale at the time that I write this, you really do owe it to yourself to give both a try.

Fabula jest rozwinieta i ciekawa, a niektore dialogi miedzy postaciami sprawiaja, ze nie chce ich przewijac( niestety tylko niektore). Czesto jednak mam wrazenie, ze postacie w czesci pierwszej byly znacznie ciekawsze i wzbudzaly wiecej sympatii. Nie dosc, ze postacie z D1 byly lepiej wedlug mnie napisane to ich design tez byl znacznie lepszy. Kazdy mial w sobie cos charakterystycznego. W D2 praktycznie zadna z postaci do mnie nie przemawia i nie jestem w stanie szczerze polubic zadnej z nich chociaz na tyle, zeby mi bylo przykro kiedy umiera. Nie jest to moze najistotniejsza rzecz, ale sprawia, ze gra nie jest tak wciagajaca jak jej poprzedniczka. Troche trudno sie przemieszczac jak juz przychodzi do chodzenia i troche trudno zrozumiec po co sa niektore funkcje ( jak te ze sprzataniem kup i krolikiem). Gra nadal jest podzielona na chaptery, ktore sa podzielone na historie, morderstwo, investigation i trial. Czasem trudno przebrnac przez poczatki chapterow, bo sa bardzo nudne, ale chyba warto, bo investigation jest jedna z ciekawszych czesci (pozwala graczowi na zebranie dowodow). Trial jest rowniez ciekawe, ale trudne do przejscia( chociaz to pewnie zalezy od umiejetnosci gracza). Na szczescie jest duzo poradnikow, co jest plusem, bo jesli masz bardzo zly refleks i ciezko ci trafiac w odpowiednie slowa czesci dyskusji, to mozesz zostac uratowany :) Gra ogolnie polecana, bo dla

It improves in so many areas from the first game, but is dragged down by a few problems. Two of my main problems from the first game were how some things were easy to predict and the ending. In this game, there was never a point where I could predict what was going to happen next. As for the ending, it still is a mind f***, a little cheesy, and a little dumb, but at least it's not as dumb as the first game's ending. This game series has a problem with screwing up endings, where they just go from 10 to 20 in seconds and it is all convoluted as all h***. The majority of the game is gripping and interesting, but the ending just makes me go \"What the f***? Did I or the author just drop acid. I mean, it's still better than first's ending by f***ing miles, but how do you go from these complex and intelligent murder mysteries to this?\"\n\nThe characters in this game are better than in the first game. They had more layers than the originals and they also felt more real than the original characters. I cared about almost everyone and that made each death more powerful than the first game.\n\nWarning: DO NOT GET A WAIFU, THEY WILL DIE! I know that maybe hard because the waifus in this game are far better than any of the waifus in the first game, except Chihiro. #Chihiro4Life. I fell for the trap again and I was hurt really badly.\n\nSome problems I had with this game were with the game's presentation and the very beginning. You need to endure the beginning in order to get to the good stuff. Your time from when you arrive at the island to when Monokuma makes his appearance, is utter painful. I would have quit if lasted even 30 minutes longer. As for the presentation, when you are walking from place to place, Hajime's walking animation looks like s*** and doesn't mesh well with the background and foreground objects go behind him too. And don't forget about that Tamagotchi s*** who's only purpose for existing is to lock two skills and a trophy behind it.\n\nAll in all, a great game with some problems.\n9/10 Would get traumatized

possibility that you'd love this one even more.\nStorywise, the game expands upon so much of the Hope's Peak Academy ark that was introduced in the first game.\nThe game gives you a brand new cast of characters, which you'll quickly find yourself getting used to and before you know it, feel emotional towards. In fact, this cast is far more exciting than the last one. They have various characteristics, which make them anything but dull. As you can already tell, they have funkier and edgier designs. You may or may not forget you're playing a cast of high schoolers. The twists in turns that are provided by revelations and plot twists are still there. In this game, the plot twists are even more exciting. \n\nThere is no anime to watch before playing this game, however i do recommend watching the second season of the anime (Danganronpa 3) to see what happens before and after the game.\nThis game is a visual novel, but unlike  most visual novels, there are a lot of immersive experiences in the game. There are about 30 hours of gameplay in my opinion. I took a long time to finish the game due to falling asleep and having the game run in the background. I'm also a slow reader, but this game kept me interested more than any book ever could.\nThe advancement in production level of this game compared to its predecessor  is exponentially noticeable. Especially in terms of visuals. I played the game in Japanese so I can not speak so much for the English dub.\n\nThe game was an overall great experience and I'd recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1508292772, "timestamp_updated": 1508320476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35805225": {"recommendationid": "35805225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352281741", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512693834}, "language": "english", "review": "Island Saw Simulator 2018", "timestamp_created": 1508276342, "timestamp_updated": 1508276342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496963", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35804656": {"recommendationid": "35804656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281701367", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512175525}, "language": "english", "review": "Definately lives up to the first game!

The story was very interesting and won't spoil too much of the story but I will say I really love the ending. Unlike the first Danganronpa, this time it takes place on an island then a school. The island has 5 different islands and each of them are unique in their own way. \n\n As chapters go on you learn more about the island and learn the truth behind it. It's very fascinating, the class trials are even better and the minigames are tons of fun. Logic Dive being my absolute favorite amongst the other minigames. Really loved answering questions while avoding obstacles. The new improved Hangman's Gambit imo was a littler better compared to the first ones mostly because the first ones Hangman's Gambit had me confused. This one I can tolerate.\n\n Rebuttal showdown is also really cool too. This mostly happens when one of your classmates tries to refute one of your arguments and you must slice there arguments in half mostly the white text. During the second phase of it you have to pick one of the arguments to back up your statement. If you slice the wrong one then the student can have an advantage I had to quickly pick the right bullet or i'll go back to the first phase.\n\nThe class trials in this game are way more fun the previous one just because of the variety of minigames it has. The characters as always are colorful and cool to be around with. Mikan and Fuyuhiko being my favorites. The other characters are great in their own right. \n\nThe only negatives I can think of is the free roaming is still the same ol same ol from the previous with little things to do aside from interacting with the students, buying gifts for a said student or looking for monokumas. I really wish there were more things to do in such a colorful enivornment like an island. Maybe a few minigames that are only exclusive to free roaming and some of them in specific islands. But that's just me. \n\nThe soundtrack as always is a killer to listen too despite some of them being reused from the first game and some new tracks. In conclusion Danganronpa 2 is a great game and a worthy sucessor to the first one with a very great story and characters. The class trials are a blast with variety of minigames. I recommend this game to anyone who loves mystery solving, visual novels and waifus.", "timestamp_created": 1507473636, "timestamp_updated": 1507474780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10,

Plenty of things that applied to the old game in terms of being terrible apply to this one too. Aside from that, there's notable differences.\n\nPros:\n1. There's actually one memorable case that's well written.\n2. The (female) characters have more sex appeal this time around.\n3. The game has two memorable and fun characters, pushing it from zero from the last title.\n4. The characters become wittier this time around and actually contribute to the class trials besides asking the main character to solve the mystery for them. \nCons:\n1. Hajime's japanese voice sounds godawful.\n2. The rest of the characters are so forgettable even the writers forgot they existed. See: the loli, the photographer girl, the swordgirl, and the survivors who weren't Hajime. I'd imagine all of their stories were written after they had an idea of the main plot and they couldn't fit them in without either killing them, having them kill someone else, or having them survive.\n3. Plants the seed of the meta story that accounts for why Danganronpa 3 was so poorly written.\n4. \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"IMPROVED\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" hangman's gambit\n\nOther than that the plot is the same series of silly red herrings that are used to jab the audience. Sometimes they even spoil the plot for you in an obvious matter and expect you to never notice it: see the very start where everything looks like a computer simulation, clearly this entire game isn't inside of a computer or anything.\nThe red herrings I mention are: There's a doppelganger but he never does anything, pink-despair bear also does nothing other than arbitrarily open up access to the islands and act as comedic relief, the entirety of the second case's motivation is a red herring because the killer had absolutely nothing to do with it and the whole thing is never brought up again, not even when you actually get context behind the machine.\n\nI guess there's also more gameplay stuff. Not like anyone cares. Not treading over previous ground:\n\n1. \"Improved\" hangman's gambit: Actually the worst thing anyone could've ever created. An absolute cluster of garbage fills your screen and mashes into eachother while you can only hope the right letter appears and that you're spelling it correctly.\n\n2. Cross-Swords Rebuttal or whatever it was called: Interesting for story purposes and actually takes a bit of thought to it.\n\n3. Logic Dive: Breaks up the pace so Hajime can spend what seems like hours deducing a simple point.\n\nAside from the fact that it treads old ground with the way the plot is handled, the plot is also written in pretty much the same way on its key points. Normal guy goes to an ultimate highschool and then faints. Afterwards he meets some sidekick, but the sidekick won't be there because if you had a sidekick then you could actually trust somebody (the difference between 1 and 2 largely being that the sidekick doesn't die). There's then a super smart girl and a social pairah who basically write the entirety of the main plot with their existences (even after Nagito and Chiaki both kick the bucket, they're still writing the main plot with their actions. Literally the entire cast could be rewritten except for those two and Hajime and everything would be exactly the same as far as it's concerned.) Then you find out that your memory is erased (for 1)/why it's erased (for 2) because Junko (for both games) tells you that she wanted to cause more despair because she's a goddamn hypersue. A pointless argument persists where the protagonist tries to convince himself and all the others that living for hope isn't actually just a pointless gambit because everyone else is dead and our brains have been messed with. They win, Junko kills herself/gets delorted and everything ends before you're able to see what actually happens after your actions.\n\nthen you go watch the anime and do the same thing junko does\n\nOf course, I'm not going to say that isn't a bit too generalized, but if you're trying to write a game that's supposed to sideline the player there shouldn't be so many obvious cliches that people can spot and predict the game about from a mile away. Other than that:\n1. Most of the music still sucks and gives me a headache.\n2.

If you\u2019re interested at all in the series, this means that you should definitely start with the first game. Dangan Ronpa 2 more or less is the same game as far as structure and mechanics, so it\u2019s not anything like \u201cThe definitive Dangan Ronpa experience\u201d or anything. However, if you\u2019ve already played Dangan Ronpa 1 and are looking to see if this is worth it, well, like I said above, it\u2019s more of the same in a way. So if you liked interacting with characters and going through the steps of investigating a murder and doing a class trial every chapter, then this is an easy buy. Things like the characters and murders may or may not be as good depending on how you feel, but you\u2019re still getting the Dangan Ronpa experience from this one and a plot that hands you off into the next game. If you DIDN\u2019T like Dangan Ronpa 1 and are wondering if this game is different enough for you, then I would say it isn\u2019t and you might be better off without. \nBefore I go into a bit more detail about the game that people who are super spoiler-sensitive may worry about, I think it\u2019s important to note that each chapter took me ~7 hours (the Prologue took 2 hours), with the trials themselves taking 2 hours because I would let the narration play. I say, for remembering what happened during investigations, the best way to play is spend an hour or two exploring the new area and doing free time, then take a break, then return to do the rest of the chapter. Doing it all in one go was pretty draining after a while. Otherwise, the main game took me 39 hours to complete, with the post-game Dangan Island (to get all of the Hope Fragments) taking an additional 6 hours. It\u2019s definitely not a small game.\n\nAs for the game itself, I\u2019m going to not spoil any details here. However, if you\u2019re rather not have a general idea of how the game and characters go, I understand. So if you\u2019re pretty sure you want to play this yourself, I\u2019d say you could stop here and get it. But if you want to know more, let me tell ya about the game by splitting it up into its main parts.\nCharacters: I would say that Dangan Ronpa 2 has a weaker character lineup than the first game. They aren\u2019t bad by any means (in fact, Teruteru and Hiyoko are the only two that were below middling to me\u2026but they were pretty far down there), but they suffer from two things. First, when they\u2019re introduced, there seems to be a two-dimensional running gag with a good amount of them and it completely envelopes their character. Things like eating all the time, needing to shit, being overly wimpy, being a pervert, obsessing over another character, etc. I think the writers didn\u2019t quite make them feel like actual humans with these quirks until it felt too late. At least by that point you get to understand who they actually are and get to like them, but it makes me wish they were like that since the beginning. It\u2019s only a handful of character and the rest are actually really good, but when that handful starts talking it made me think, \u201cThis again, huh?\u201d The other problem is that I feel like a good amount of character archetypes are shared from the cast in the first game (sporty girl, buff person, ruse dude, etc). It\u2019s not THAT bad; you get to know the characters more and they feel more distinct. However, it\u2019s still something you have to get over. Though, ultimately, it is really good that a lot of the characters end up moving up the rating scale the more they show up/you talk to them. I definitely recommend Dangan Island in the postgame for any Free Time dialogue you missed.\nEnvironment: Dangan Ronpa 2 taking place on an open tropical island is a nice difference from the first game\u2019s enclosed building. There are plenty of interesting areas that are great eye candy, plus they serve as good places for murder scenes and finding clues for said scenes. My main problem is that it feels like a wide-but-shallow sea. You visit a lot of the areas once and that\u2019s it for literally the entire game. It felt like wasted potential a lot of time, but at the same time didn\u2019t really hold the game back.\nMotives: I\u2019m not gonna say anything about the motives themselves, but I feel like they\u2019re weaker than the first game\u2019s. Dangan Ronpa 1 had pretty interesting motives where the reveal twist as to why the murderer did what they did made even the odder of motives believable (at least, from what I remember years ago). This one kinda felt like they either weren\u2019t strong enough for murder or just were nonsensical. Motives per chapter aren\u2019t really THAT big in the whole scheme of things. But if you\u2019re like me and kinda looked forward to what dastardly thing Monokuma would pressure the cast with every time, I wouldn\u2019t get your hopes up too much.\nMurders and Trials: This game was very good about keeping you on your toes when figuring out what REALLY happened during a murder. After a point, you realize that anything is possible with the absurd things the murderers pulled off that, when explained by the end, actually ended up being believable. Granted, the class trials aren\u2019t free of some outright stupid solutions that end up feeling like guess-and-check for some segments (and I found myself not looking too forward to minigames what weren\u2019t Truth Bullets\u2026especially Hangman\u2019s Gambit\u2026). However, it was fun looking over the clues before a trial, formulating what I think happened to cause that clue, then seeing if I was right and tweaking it with each new development until the real answer was clear. Also, the regenerating health perk really helped with letting me feel free to figure out the right answers, so I definitely recommend that.\n\nI\u2019d say Dangan Ronpa 2 is an enjoyable and lengthy experience, but it has some noticeable flaws as well. As far as being a Dangan Ronpa game, it excels in retaining the formula that works and having great murders and class trials that define the series. It stumbles somewhat with making a chunk of the characters interesting, but eventually they do end up growing on you. Despite being self-contained for the most part, the plot and its little mysteries about the character and island keep an added interest on top of the murders that have a huge payout in the end. So yeah, I\u2019d say give it a go if you liked the first game (and be careful when looking things up for it)!", "timestamp_created": 1506836551, "timestamp_updated": 1506836551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35360220": {"recommendationid": "35360220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188738794", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514561202}, "language": "english", "review": "This is honestly the best Danganronpa game out today not counting V3.

It surpassed my expecttions! The characters were (mostly) likeable, the art was great, and the executions were a-ma-zing! They very much surpassed the first game's in my opinion, not afraid to get symbolic and wacky. \nThe ending was actually pretty unexpected, and when I first hear it, I thought it would just be a copout, but after beating the game it makes sense, except the epilogue, after the final class trial. It defied what we'd been told earlier, I think. Whatever, happy ending is happy.\nThe only thing I didn't personally like was ost of the trial minigames. Logic Dive was very fun but Improved Hangman's Gambit and Panic Talk Action didn't really click with me, and were more frustrating than fun.\n\nIn closing: I really liked this game and think it is an improvement from the first game. Now all I need to do is buy the third game and play that...", "timestamp_created": 1506691463, "timestamp_updated": 1506691463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35287191": {"recommendationid": "35287191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218991804", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1514699138}, "language": "schinese", "review": " \u6781\u68d2", "timestamp_created": 1506676535, "timestamp_updated": 1506676535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35280066": {"recommendationid": "35280066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185972997", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506646783}, "language": "english", "review": "how do i get past the prologue pls", "timestamp_created": 1506652687, "timestamp_updated": 1506652687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35278867": {"recommendationid": "35278867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074871661", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506634614}, "language": "english", "review": "To start off, I would just like to say I would reccommend this game to ANYONE I know, especially if they love a good thriller/murder mystery. I started off watching the anime (Danganronpa [1]) and I LOVED it. I then finished the season in one day, which I normally don't do, and I was ready to watch the second season. I then realized there was only a first and third season so I instantly bought the second game xD. It's a really cheap price (compared to most games these day which are around $60), and it has so much stuff to do even after the game. But the story line is fantastic and the class trials were great, they were definitely not easy! I was on the regular difficulty for it and I still died multiple times in the class trial. The plot twists were amazing, and I didn't even see them coming which normally I do. I'm not gonna sit here and bore you to death with details that can be found in other reviews, but this game was FANTASTIC! I definitely reccommend this, 10/10! \u2665", "timestamp_created": 1506649059, "timestamp_updated": 1506649059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

They act like real friends (or rivals). Even Monokuma has a counterpart, Monomi who is also hilarious.\n_ Murders and Punishment have more violence.\n- Investigations now have even more plot twists than before.\n_ Judgement (Class Trials) are longer than before, what is very nice. Every class trial takes like 3 hours of a lot of plot twists and mind blow.\n_ Story is direct linked to DR1.\n_ Story mode is like to 40 to 50 hours of gameplay (depending of difficulty and your determination to explore). \n_ A lot of your friends will die (like DR1, of course).\n_ 97% of steam community approvation.\n\nI strongly recommend this little gem of investigation games.", "timestamp_created": 1505960268, "timestamp_updated": 1511711837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35093681": {"recommendationid": "35093681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422498790", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506201134}, "language": "english", "review": "i fUCKING love this game", "timestamp_created": 1505949440, "timestamp_updated": 1505949440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35092661": {"recommendationid": "35092661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048266869", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490126634}, "language": "english", "review": "Just like the first game, This game is absolutely amazing in its story-telling and the continuation of the anime only makes it better.

Voire le surpasser ? \u00c0 chacun son avis, mais \u00e0 priori, si vous avez aim\u00e9 le 1, [i]Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair[/i] vous plaira.\nLe jeu reprend les codes et les m\u00e9caniques de son grand fr\u00e8re, aussi bien au niveau de l'histoire qu'au niveau du gameplay. On est donc bien \u00e0 nouveau dans un Visual Novel de type d\u00e9tective/myst\u00e8re, et dans un jeu qu'on est bien oblig\u00e9 de comparer \u00e0 son pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur.\n\nCette fois, on incarne Hajime Hinata, un \u00e9tudiant ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 pour entrer dans la plus prestigieuse \u00e9cole du pays : la Hope's Peak Academy. Son r\u00eave devient r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Mais comme une impression de d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, le r\u00eave se transforme vite en cauchemar. Hajime se retrouve sur une \u00eele \u00e9trange avec 15 autres jeunes gens, \u00e9tudiants \u00e0 la Hope's Peak Academy \u00e9galement, apparemment pour un voyage scolaire. Et malheureusement, la sortie scolaire vire en enfer avec le retour du Killing Game de Monokuma. L'id\u00e9e est la m\u00eame que dans le jeu pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, le seul moyen de quitter l'\u00eele est de commettre un meurtre et de ne pas se faire accuser d'en \u00eatre l'auteur \u00e0 l'issue du proc\u00e8s (Class Trial).\n\nL'histoire est \u00e0 nouveau longue et int\u00e9ressante, ce coup-ci c'est 39 heures qu'il m'a fallu pour juste terminer l'histoire. Toutefois, certaines longueurs peuvent se faire ressentir. L'environnement \u00e9trange dans lequel on se trouve pourra en laisser plus d'un perplexe...mais heureusement, la fin de l'histoire expliquera tout ce qui aura sembl\u00e9 bizarre. Quand la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00e9clate, on se rend compte que l'histoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi bien men\u00e9e que celle du premier \u00e9pisode.\nLe c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"d\u00e9tective\" est le m\u00eame que dans le 1, on ne peut louper aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment important puisque qu'on ne peut pas acc\u00e9der au proc\u00e8s sans avoir trouv\u00e9 tous les indices. On a encore toutes les cartes en mains pour \u00e9tablir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. \n\nIl faut relever quelques changements par rapport au premier jeu au niveau des mini-jeux pendant les proc\u00e8s, ils sont tous plus compliqu\u00e9s. Le Hangman's Gambit (=pendu) notamment a compl\u00e8tement chang\u00e9, il est plus long et plus dur parce qu'il faut maintenant fusionner (au moins) deux m\u00eames lettres pour la s\u00e9lectionner, sans qu'aucune autre ne rentre en contact avec. En anglais en plus, des fois ce n'est vraiment pas simple. De plus, deux nouveaux mini-jeux font leur apparition : le Logic Dive, une esp\u00e8ce de jeu de course/plateforme dans lequel il faut r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des questions, et le Rebuttal Showdown, qui combine les aspects du Nonstop Debate avec du slash.\nEn plus d'ajouter une bonne dose de difficult\u00e9 aux proc\u00e8s, cela ajoute aussi pas mal de temps de jeu parce que ces mini-jeux sont longs. Est-ce une bonne chose ? Cela va d\u00e9pendre des gens... Personnellement, je trouve que \u00e7a n'en est pas une. Au lieu de se fondre dans le proc\u00e8s comme avant, les mini-jeux marquent maintenant une esp\u00e8ce de cassure dans le rythme du proc\u00e8s. Le temps de jeu rajouter par ces \u00e9tapes se fait trop ressentir, de m\u00eame que la difficult\u00e9. J'ai aussi trouv\u00e9 qu'un mini-jeu de course/plateforme n'avait rien \u00e0 faire dans ce type de jeu...\nCela a vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 le point noir du jeu pour moi.\n\n\u00c0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de \u00e7a, il y a eu d'autres ajouts sympas.\nPremi\u00e8rement, on a maintenant un \"Pet\" qu'on peut \u00e9lever \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re d'un Tamagochi, mais en tr\u00e8s basique. La b\u00eab\u00eate grandit avec le nombre de pas qu'on fait, et il n'y a pas besoin de le nourir, le laver, le faire dormir. Tout ce qu'il faut faire, c'est augmenter sa barre d'espoir avec des cadeaux, et emp\u00eacher sa barre de d\u00e9sespoir d'augmenter en tirant la chasse pour \u00e9vacuer son caca et ne pas le laisser dedans. En fonction de ces deux barres, l'animal \u00e9volue en diff\u00e9rentes cr\u00e9atures et nous donne diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9compenses.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, un nouveau mode de jeu tout \u00e0 fait secondaire appel\u00e9 \"Magical Girl Miracle \u2605 Monomi\". Dans la peau du lapin Usami/Monomi, on combat les \"gardiens\" de l'\u00eele et leurs minions. En les battant, on gagne al\u00e9atoirement des objets pour am\u00e9liorer les stats du lapin. Bref, un petit jeu annexe histoire d'augmenter encore la dur\u00e9e de vie du jeu.\n\nOn peut toujours, pendant l'histoire, se rapprocher des autres personnages afin de connaitre leurs histoires, et une fois le sc\u00e9nario termin\u00e9 on d\u00e9bloque \u00e0 nouveau un mode permettant de d\u00e9couvrir ces histoires beaucoup plus facilement.\n\nSc\u00e9naristiquement, le jeu est tr\u00e8s bon, m\u00eame si bien s\u00fbr il n'y a pas vraiment le m\u00eame c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"nouveau\" qu'avait le premier. Comme je l'ai dit, ce qui parait \u00e9trange est expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin, allez jusqu'au bout pour \u00e9viter [strike]le d\u00e9sespoir[/strike] la d\u00e9ception. La nouvelle fourn\u00e9e de personnages ne paie peut-\u00eatre pas de mine, mais on s'attache sans mal \u00e0 beaucoup d'entre eux au fil de l'aventure. Pour ceux qui se veulent d\u00e9testables, le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est qu'ils sont tr\u00e8s dou\u00e9s en la mati\u00e8re...\nGraphiquement, c'est la m\u00eame palette que le 1. Musicalement, c'est pareil aussi puisque le jeu r\u00e9utilise les m\u00eames musiques, mais avec quand m\u00eame quelques musiques suppl\u00e9mentaires. \u00c7a colle toujours tr\u00e8s bien \u00e0 l'ambiance. Et comme dans le 1 encore, tous les dialogues, sauf les pens\u00e9es, sont doubl\u00e9s pendant les proc\u00e8s, avec les voix en anglais ou japonais, au choix. Le jeu est en anglais (ou japonais, ou chinois si vous voulez).\n\nSi j'ai tout de m\u00eame pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 le premier Danganronpa, [i]Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair[/i] reste malgr\u00e9 tout un tr\u00e8s bon jeu et une tr\u00e8s bonne suite, continuant l'histoire et reprenant les m\u00e9canismes du premier volet, et pas cher maintenant qu'il est pass\u00e9 de 27,99\u20ac \u00e0 19,99\u20ac. Mais ne commencez pas par celui-l\u00e0 si vous voulez d\u00e9marrer la s\u00e9rie, il est plus dur, et bien s\u00fbr il va vous manquer beaucoup d'informations pour vraiment appr\u00e9cier l'histoire.\n\n[code]Vous avez aim\u00e9 cette \u00e9valuation ?

The only difference from the first game story telling wise is that it takes much longer for the story to take the nose dive into the meat of the story.\n\nThe characters for this game are just as good and more over the top then the first games.\n\nIsland mode(this games version of school mode) i fell was handled a lot better then the first game, making it more streamlined and faster to complete.\n\nThe negatives of this game would have to be some of the \"improvements\" and some new modes added to the trials. The Rebuttal showdown and panic talk action modes just dont feel right at all. with the former just not making much sense at times and button masher in essence, and the later just not working timing wise at all. hangmans gambit takes a lot to get used to aswell. I am not a fan at all of the new 2d movement system the game uses in its overworld. I encountered numerous minor graphical annoyances like the background images having floating pixels(as if the artists didnt fully clean the canvas of isolated pixels) and some images going negative when infront of another colour or image, or just outright disappearing. there is also a still of chiaki that has a solid black square on her that is obviously not supposed to be there. I also dont understand why the decided to add monomis island game mode, its just not fun at all and by far the worst part of the game.

The gameplay of DR2 is notable uptake from the original, but I feel that class trials often go on for very long without any gameplay whatsoever. While variation in DR2 is stronger than Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, the number of actual playable segments are just barely increased, which is a problem as trials in this game are almost twice as long than from the first. Nonetheless what really makes DR2 a worthwhile game is the cast. The cast of this game, I would defend, are more unique and interesting than the characters of DR1. Characters like Ibuki, Gundham, Sonia, Chiaki and Nagito were great to have around and even though I knew what would happen to some of the cast, I still felt sadness whenever I came across the murders or executions.

Daily Life and Deadly Life are the same as the first game, giving you time to bond with your classmates and exploring the island and giving you time to investigate the murder of your classmates respectively.\n\nThe Class Trial is broken up in the same way as well, with there being novel sections that show revelations in the plot and in the murder case, and numerous mini games that lead into these novel sections. The minigames, however, are very different from the first game. The only minigames that retained its format from the first game are Bullet Time Battle (renamed to Panic Talk Action) Nonstop Debate. (Improved) Hangmans Gambit has been altered from a point and click spelling game into a matching puzzle game where you actually have to think about what you're doing. Rebuttal Showdown and Logic Dive are the new minigames introduced in Danganronpa 2. Rebuttal Showdown is a lot like nonstop debate, but instead of sitting through a series of statements from numerous different people, you slice through statements made by a single person with the WASD keys, and then you use Truth Blades to cut through contradictions within their arguments. Logic Dive is the other new minigame and is played as a runner style game where you jump over pits, and dodge blockades while answering questions to get further in the case.\n\nTL;DR\nStory: 9.5/10 No obvious plotholes, but some minor pacing issues\nGameplay: 9/10 Gameplay is extremely fun for almost the entire game, but it has its dull moments.\nMusic: 9.5/10 Soundtrack is superb\nOverall Rating:

same. Unlike in the original the first chapter of this second entry doesn't quite hit the same high notes. But rather it begins a deceptive mystery that becomes more complex as the story progresses. For anyone who is unsure after the first two hours. Stick with this game and you will experience a masterful sequel, that brings so much depth to the original story. These two games were made to be played together.\n\nThe trial system has been given quite an overhaul. You can now agree with other characters and also perform a logic dive action sequence. This adds some good action and logic puzzles. Hangman's Gambit is... not exactly better but it is different and a little bit harder if nothing else. Some decisions during the investigation and free time segements will seem a bit strange at first (Such as the sidescrolling travel between areas); But considering the games almost doubled length and scope when compared to the original, these additions become very welcome. \n\nThe characters are charming, there's so much life in each of them that even the first ones to go will be easily remembered throughout the 40 ish hour adventure. Despite a slightly weak start Danganronpa 2 is an amazing game. Does it top the original? In some ways yes and in some not exactly.

It ofcourse is a sequel to the first game and this time there's students on an island instead of in a school. A lot of stuff didn't make sense at first and it felt more unrealistic and random than the first game however it's all good. I can't say much without spoiling it but trust me it's alright. There's a few more little cool things in this game compared to the first one, for example you can collect monokuma dolls throughout the game which is cool and then the thing where you talk to people to increase friendship with them is improved compared to the first game. There's quite a few new things in there. The graphics are about the same however which is unfortunate but since it was originally a PS Vita game I can't complain much. \n\nThere's a few problems I have with the game like some of the questions and stuff you need to answer in the trials is quite annoying at times, especially since sometimes it involves you having to remember distinct stuff people said or things about someone that you forgot since that was like 20 hours ago you learned that stuff. Basically the trials are a bit annoying even on gentle difficulty which is a bit of a shame but most of it is alright so its not too bad. The only other problem really is that like you don't get enough time to talk to everyone and unlock the skills, there's over 30 yet you can only talk to people like 30 times throughout the whole game yet you have to talk to each person 6 times so that's way too much, I understand some stuff being for completionists but still, I would have liked to interact with people more since the trials are quite hard and the skills are useful. One other thing is that some of the kills were so outrageously performed I'd be surprised if anyone would be able to figure them out without the games help, a lot of random stuff you wouldn't have ever guessed is quite prevalent unfortunately.\n\nAside from that overall the game is pretty damn good, can't say much more without spoiling it but ofcourse if you've played the first game this is just as good and also a bit longer.

I haven't played the first game, but i have watched the first season of the anime. Yes, i know that people think that the anime is shi*ty, but back then, i didnt own a PC, let alone the money to buy PS VITA. One thing though, just from browsing youtube gameplays, i think that Danganronpa 2 is a huge improvement from the first one.\n\nThankfully, i understood the whole story, and trust me when i say it's MINDBLOWING.. The story itself keeps getting better and better and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, there's no replayability since it's kinda linear and the game only has one ending.\n\nThe gameplay includes lots of reading, class trial (debates) filled with  minigames like : Hangman's Gambit, Logic Dive. As a newcomer to the series, I was overwhelmed with all the features, but i decided to keep playing on Kind difficulty (similar with 'normal'). I got used to the features, though.\n\nOne of the best parts of the game is you can actually interact and deepen your friendships with all of your classmates. Each character has their own personality, they're not shallow, they're lovable and they have great character developments. Be ready to get attached to the characters. Upon completing your hope fragments, you'll get a reward from them, such as.... their favorite underwear.\n\nThe soundtracks are great, but they're kinda repetitive. But, it's okay since it didn't bother me much when i played the game. The graphics are simply beautiful, i have no complaints. Japanese dub is just flawless.\nAfter finishing the game, you will unlock two modes, one is Island Mode, which basically is a management minigame to complete your hope fragments. This is the mode where you will ship the main character (Hajime Hinata) with someone else a.k.a Hajime x Everyone (i personally love Hajime x Akane). The other one is Danganronpa IF, it's a light novel that you can read.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\nTruly a masterpiece you need to buy and play after finishing the first game or atleast the first season of the anime. Get ready to spend more than 40+ hours when playing this game because it's just so fun and intense. Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is easily a 10/10 from me, even an 11/10. The game just exceeded my expectations that it's worthy enough to get a better score than 10.\n\n\nBest girl (waifu)? Gotta be Akane Owari for me, underrated yet so lovable.\nBest boys? Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu and Gundham Tanaka, period..\n\nMy body is ready for Danganronpa V3 : Killing Harmony. When it's available to preorder, i'm gonna mash that 'add to cart' button so hard. This series deserves to be bought at full price..\n\nEDIT: I've bought Danganronpa V3. It's expensive, but man the game itself is so GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1504968403, "timestamp_updated": 1511428475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746552", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34837274": {"recommendationid": "34837274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343812294", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504387216}, "language": "english", "review": "love this game", "timestamp_created": 1504963226, "timestamp_updated": 1504963226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34830409": {"recommendationid": "34830409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290121766", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487345873}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7528\u7535\u8111\u6253\u5f00\u5c31\u4e00\u76f4\u5361\u987f\u662f\u600e\u4e48\u56de\u4e8b", "timestamp_created": 1504938799, "timestamp_updated": 1504938799, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34827588": {"recommendationid": "34827588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274252948", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513197935}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so much fun.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed DR2.  It's dark and wacky.  The mysteries were very intricate and a lot of attention was put into the details of each case.  The game is far from perfect, though.  My biggest complaint is with the dialogue.  Too many times characters love to point out the obvious, or they'll outright explain jokes immediately after the punchline as if to say \"That was a joke!  Did you get it?\"  Characters also lack any real depth, and tend to ramble on too long.  Additionally, each court case followed an increasingly predictible pattern (e.g. [spoiler]the first person accused of the crime is always innocent[/spoiler]).  Minigames are hit and miss.  I liked Logic Dive and Rebuttal Showdown.  Hangman's Gambit was passable, but Panic Talk Action was really awful.  During nonstop debates, I found that the memorizing a truth bullet mechanic was very underused, which caused frustration when time came to use the mechanic and I had forgotten all about it.  Ah well.\n\nSo what compelled me to keep playing?  Well, as I said, the mysteries are complex and interesting.  And despite how one-dimensional the characters are, I still found myself enjoying most of their interactions.  It also helps that the story's pacing is done very well.  There's a lot of intrigue, and I loved the morbid humor.  The court cases were actually a much thicker piece of the game than I was expecting, which is a good thing.  Mean Logic difficulty provided a decent challenge, and despite my minor gripes about memorizing truth bullets, the nonstop debates are a lot of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1502791965,

bought this game during the Steam summer sale.\n\nI'd already bought the first game and fell in love. If you haven't played it, go play THAT one first then come back here. You'll still enjoy it either way, but you might not understand as much of the background story or the winks to the player. There were all sorts of winks and nods throughout this game and definitely a lot of breaking the fourth wall (in a good way).\n\nIf you didn't like the first game, why are you here?\n\nPros:\n-THE CHARACTERS! They were great! I felt so much more attached to the characters from this game than I did with the first. \n-The motives were a million times better. Screw 10 million dollars Monokuma, I want [i] murder\t[/i] . The motives were heartwrenching and certainly accomplished what they were set out to do. \n-The executions had me holding my breath. I felt so much more despair with each one. \n- There were all kinds of bits and pieces added in this game that were not in the first game which definitely made gameplay better. Things like allowing you to choose your difficulty settings before every class trial (which, by the way, have now become more challenging!)\n-Monokuma isn't fucking around this time\n\nCons:\n-Unlike the first game, I felt like we were unraveling the mystery so much slower. Only being fed morsels of information out of context is frustrating. [spoiler] Then at the end of the game, they spend FOREVER explaining everything. They had to spend FOREVER explaining everything because they had not explained a damn thing very well before this. It just got boring, you know?\t[/spoiler]\n-Same as the last game there were a few moments of gender stereostypes being enforced (looking at you, Mahiru..)\n- I guess it's called \"fanservice\" or something but there was no reason the female characters needed to be posed with parts just barely censored (especially one character who looked like a child). I didn't play the first game for the hot girls, why would I play the second one for them?\n\nIn short, I loved all of the added changes in gameplay! I did not like the apparent targeting towards a certain pervy fanbase.

The series has improved so much since the first game! I can't wait to see what happens with the upcoming [i]Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony[/i].\n\nGeneral words of advice: You can play with both keyboard and gamepad controls. I didn't find gamepad to be needed for myself until the latter half of the game's trials in a segment called \"Logic Dive\". Forget the \"(Improved) Hangman's Gambit\", the real hell of game mechanics is \"Logic Dive\" by far.

Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair plays off of that stage, but feels more of an appetizer than a main course.  Although it effectively is a *longer* game somehow, it actually felt shorter.  I was less excited to launch Danganronpa 2 between sessions, whereas the first Danganronpa lowered my productivity at work as it was always on the mind.  Some reasons for this?  Well, Danganronpa 2 is \"more of the same\" - which in this universe is NOT a bad thing - but it was so much easier to predict events, because it was almost identical to the first game of the series.  If you think about it really hard, I could effectively be saying \"this game would have been better if I didn't play the first one,\" which is a catch twenty-two, because without playing the first one, this one is just a garbled mess of information that won't really add up in your mind.\n\nFurthermore, the story is still great - you'll start out absolutely confused, because that's clearly the authors point, and later have clarity when the pieces start falling together.  It's a great mind-**** the second time around, that's for sure (no matter how similar the game is to its predecessor, you can't predict every curveball)!\n\nThe mini games in this Danganronpa suck worse, too; the \"improved\" Hangman's Gambit can **** ** **** because I hated that so much.  The Logic Drive was interesting, but otherwise annoying... overall though, it did add a change of pace to the stage.\n\nAlthough my commentary may lean somewhat negative, don't take this as a negative review at all.  At the end of the day, Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is *more of the same* to the first game, and know that Danganronpa: Happy Trigger Havoc was absolutely amazing - therefore, this game is also amazing - but it's a sliver behind, so a super-close second place.  If it were less predictable (in other words: why did you use the same tricks?), I probably would have loved it that much more - but truly at times, I pushed through the game just to get to the end.\n\nI won't give up on the Danganronpa series though, oh no!

After finally convincing myself, I was slightly disappointed with first half an hour of gameplay due to the slow start and easily dislikable characters. You don't have to play the original to understand and enjoy the game, but it'll make you appreciate both games a lot more. The majority of the characters struck me as annoying and two dimensional when the game began, but as I progressed even my least favorites didn't seem too bad. A major improvement that was made in comparison to the original is the minigames ranging from pets, to trial features, to Magical Miracle Girl Monami (which reminded me of Sakura's Revenge). The movement to different locations and new hangman's gambit seemed a little clunky at first, but became more enjoyable as you adapt to them. Overall, Danganronpa 2 felt harder than the first in terms of finding the indentity of the killers and proving it in the class trial (due to occasionally confusing  nonstop debates and sometimes outrageous inferences). While originally skeptical about whether Danganronpa 2 would be worth the money and live up to the first, I quickly realized it would live up to expectations and would even consider buying at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1500770641, "timestamp_updated": 1500770641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33719766": {"recommendationid": "33719766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275906042", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507042337}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u5e79\u4f60\u5c0f\u9ad8", "timestamp_created": 1500725977, "timestamp_updated": 1500725977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33717164": {"recommendationid": "33717164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143841543", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500698394}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7528\u4e8650\u591a\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u7ec8\u4e8e\u628a\u5168\u7a0b\u5c31\u89e3\u9501\u4e86......\n\u5355\u8bf4\u4e3b\u7ebf\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8282\u594f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5feb\uff0c\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u2192\u975e\u65e5\u5e38\u641c\u67e5\u2192\u5b66\u7ea7\u88c1\u5224\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6839\u672c\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765\uff01\uff01\uff01\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b66\u7ea7\u88c1\u5224\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e00\u7fa4\u4eba\u8ba8\u8bba\u771f\u51f6\u65f6\u7684\u9488\u950b\u76f8\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e00\u6b65\u6b65\u903c\u8fd1\u771f\u76f8\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u611f\u4ee4\u4eba\u6b32\u7f62\u4e0d\u80fd\uff08\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350\u628a\u96be\u5ea6\u5168\u90e8\u8c03\u6210\u4eb2\u5207\uff09\u3002\u4ece\u8fd9\u70b9\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u5f39\u4e38\u8bba\u78342\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u4e0d\u5bb9\u9519\u8fc7\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fa9\u8bba\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u8bf4\u5230\u652f\u7ebf......\u7231\u5c9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u9ed1\u767d\u7f8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u975e\u65e5\u5e38\u7bc7\u7684\u53cd\u5dee\u5341\u5206\u5f3a\u70c8\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u83b7\u5f97\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u652f\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7528\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u4e3b\u7ebf\u591a\u5f97\u591a(\u0ca5 _ \u0ca5)\u3002\u73a9\u4e86\u4e4b\u540e\u987f\u65f6\u611f\u89c9\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u604b\u7231\u517b\u6210\u548c4399\uff08?????\uff09\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5f88\u65e0\u804a......\n\u603b\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u60f3\u8981\u5168\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e26\u7ed9\u4f60\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1500717581, "timestamp_updated": 1500717581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33691520": {"recommendationid": "33691520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021864258", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 4699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509440837}, "language": "italian", "review": "GREAT game: a worthy sequel of Danganronpa 1: Trigger Happy Havoc.\n\nAnd here is my comparison:\n- graphic art: this second Danganronpa game is less refined then the first one;\n+ gameplay: it is far better, because there are new mini-games and the old ones have been improved;\n/ plot: until chapter 5, I found the plot very good but not exceptional; thanks to the last chapter (pure genius for me) the game reaches the same level of Danganronpa 1.

entirely. I was proven wrong. Simply put, I love Trigger Happy Havoc and I love this one even more. The story is so much weirder yet it offers even more intrigue and the writing is fantastic. There's an extreme level of self-awareness the original was too shy to muster but Goodbye Despair pulls off flawlessly. It takes jabs at the previous game's story as well as absurd tropes and the characters go as out of their ways as possible to defeat their stereotypes. The story is so much more unpredictable and unhinged, keeping the player constantly on edge and the murders this time around are even more interesting and crazy. The art style carries over from the original effortlessly and the music, as it was in the previous game, is fantastic. Some standout pieces are Homicide and the new intro theme. The voice acting is great and doesn't grate the ears. Gameplay is about the same as last time with the minigames having been changed up and having had some new ones added into the class trials. Most are decent, but the new Hangman's Gambit is gutter trash and obnoxious. The game is lengthy but never feels like a drag due to how quickly things unfold. If you've enjoyed the original, this is a must. Oh and there's now mid-trial saves so you can take breaks.

Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. Let's start with the heart of this game and the entire series really, the story, in Danganronpa 2 you play the role of Hajime Hinata, an average kid who got accepted into Hope's Peak Academy, an elite school that picks the best of the best, the school is special, there's no entry exam and there's only two requirements to get in the school. 1.You must be a High School Student and 2. You must be picked for the school based on your abilities. Some examples of these would be the Ultimate Breeder, Ultimate Mechanic, and Ultimate Nurse, so the Ultimates meet upwith an android like bunny called Usami, and she takes our class on a field trip to Jabberwock Island, a tropical island resort, making it an ideal tourist location, but there's something strange, only Hajime and the others are on the island, and there's no other people fro miles, or a way to communicate, even leave the island, there is a way though, gather all the Hope Fragments, however Monokuma, an android like bear ruins the fun as he breaks Usami's magic stick and remodels her as Monomi, calling her his little sister, he also blocks off the other islands with giant robots called Monobeasts, ensuring everything is set, he tells the the students that this Heart-Throbbing School Trip is super boring, so he decided to have a little fun and mess with the rules, instead of escaping the island by gathering Hope Fragments, the students must now escape using a different way,a deadlier way, you see the only way to escape the island is, to kill a classmate and get away with it,if the guilty party is exposed they'll be punished,if not everyone but the blackened gets punished and they get to leave. Gameplay wise Danagnronpa is simple, there's three sections, Daily Life, Deadly Life, and the class trial", "timestamp_created": 1499569083, "timestamp_updated": 1499656699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33390904": {"recommendationid": "33390904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053069108", "num_games_owned": 625, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508370623}, "language": "english", "review": "Heavily recommended.\nI absolutely loved the first game. Because of that at first I thought this game wasn't as good. The characters didn't seem as interesting and realistic (at first), the murders didn't seem as logical (2 out of 5 still don't), the trial action was annoying at times (the logic dive takes ages and the hangman's gambit is impossible to beat with no damage taken) and, personally, I didn't like the setting of a tropic island. But when the plot started thickening, the game became a roller coaster of mind-blows and emotions. The first game was amazing, but this game made me cry for a prolonged period of time. If you liked the first game - you are obligated to play this one.\nAll the petty complaints I listed above are nothing. They aren't just easy to overlook, you won't remember them, like they are a part of your life at Hope's Peak Academy. I even got depressed when it was over, which doesn't happen to me often.\n\nAlso, I have found perfection.

I enjoy the Island setting, the characters are great again and the story is of course always interesting and has a good pacing. The best thing about Danganronpa to me is the over the top humour that is only possible with anime. It always hits the mark and isn't overdone or gets annoying at some point. Even in serious moments there is a fitting joke here and there that lifts the mood a little.\nThe visual style is beautiful but playing on a big screen you can tell that this was developed for the PS Vita. The soundtrack is beyond any doubt but very similar to the first game.\nGameplay is not very complicated and gets the job done which is all it needs to do. Only in the trials it gets interesting. The different game modes in the trials are fun and bring variety. They can get very challenging and after a trial which can last a couple of hours I was welcoming of the return to the point an click adventure playstyle.\nAs for negatives I don't really have any. Maybe that sometimes it isn't quite clear what evidence is asked for by the game and you basically have to guess between multiple options.\nAlso now that I played Danganronpa steam just drownes me in recommendations for cheap animu visual novels but since you can blacklist tags it's not really a big deal. I just feel bad for the occasional good ones there may be out there.\n\nOther than that I fully recommend this game, definitely worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1499250198, "timestamp_updated": 1499250198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33262672": {"recommendationid": "33262672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267476343", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500255199}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u968f\u7740\u5267\u60c5\u53d1\u5c55\u5f15\u4eba\u5165\u80dc\uff0c\u8be0\u91ca\u4e86\u5e78\u8fd0EX\u771f\u662f\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u6280\u80fd", "timestamp_created": 1499236004, "timestamp_updated": 1499236004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33252644": {"recommendationid": "33252644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319571202", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 531, "last_played": 1514845963}, "language": "french", "review": "Dans ce nouvel \u00e9pisode de Danganronpa, qui est une suite direct au premier, nous nous retrouvons aux commandes d'un jeune lyc\u00e9en du nom d'Hajime Hinata, prisonnier sur une \u00eele aux airs plus ou moins paradisiaque en compagnie de sa classe enti\u00e8re et de leur professeur, un lapin en peluche Magical Girl, qui essaye de les rassurer en affirmant qu'il s'agit d'un simple \"voyage scolaire\".\nC'est avec l'apparition de Monokuma, un ours en peluche cette fois-ci, que l'on comprend le vrai but de ce soit disant voyage : ils sont au coeur d'un killing game. \nLa suite se passe comme dans le premier jeu. Pour esp\u00e9rer pouvoir sortir de l'\u00eele, il faut tuer sans se faire prendre. \n\nLe gameplay est tr\u00e8s ressemblant, voir identique, au premier opus. La difficult\u00e9 des Class Trial est elle par contre, un peu plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Les personnages sont plus int\u00e9ressants, le duo Monokuma/Monomi ridicule au possible, un 4\u00e8me mur inexistant et malgr\u00e9 des dialogues toujours aussi longs, je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9 le temps de m'ennuyer. \n\nPour mieux comprendre l'histoire, je conseille de terminer Danganronpa : Trigger Happy Havoc, avant de commencer par Danganronpa 2 : Goodbye Despair.

The story is well written, characters are enjoyable, etc etc.\n\nHowever, this game has been pretty harsh on me by changing my controls from Keyboard and Mouse to Controller in the middle of the game (So I have no idea how to do a majority of the things required in the cases) and NOT SAVING MY GAME AT ALL. (It happened four fucking times in the first three cases. Still haven't gone past Case Three since I lost my save.) \n\nSome of my complaints may just be me, and if so I'm just unlucky, but that's not all.\n\nSome of the games played in the cases (Hangman's Gambit, Make your Argument, BTB/PTA, etc) have been changed and not exactly for the better. For example: Hangman's Gambit was, in the first game, a simple word game where they'd present a word with some letters missing and you'd figure it out by shooting the letters. Simple, quick, fun.\n\nIn this game, Hangman's Gambit is a simple word game where they give you a phrase with no hints besides the length of the words in it, you must match the letters by pressing Z(Remember, I have had troubles getting my controls due to a random switch mid-game caused by the game.) on one and shooting it at the same letters by pressing LeftClick. Okay, doesn't seem bad at first. By doing so, they stay on screen without movement, and increase in size. You can get rid of the combined letter by either shooting them with Z, which gets rid of them entirely, or LeftClick which will act as you trying to place the letter there. Alright, still good. The letters now move across a screen and you must make sure they either touch the same letter and avoid all other letters. Still makes sense, but what was wrong with the other one? \n\nA couple new mini-games were introduced like Logic Dive and Rebuttal Battles, both of which are fine.\n\nHell, I'd dare say Logic Dive is the best thing in Danganronpa 2. It adds a much needed action segment to break up the logic heavy segments. Sometimes it's nice to not think too hard.\n\nRebuttal Battles are a nice change into arguments since it adds a little more depth. Having to fight the counter-arguments of the classmates in order to continue the trial is cool. It's not much different from the actually arguments in how you complete them (SHOOT BULLET [Called Truth Blades in Rebuttals] AT LOGICAL ERROR AND WIN) but it's a nice little add-on.\n\n\nSo again, It's an iffy recommendation since I've had nothing but problems with it but the game itself is fine.\n\nI would love to sing praises about the game but I can't. I can't finish it unless I do it in one sitting. I CAN'T BEAT THE GAME UNLESS IT'S ONE SITTING. FROM PROLOUGE START TO END OF GAME. IT WON'T SAVE FOR ME.\n\n\n\nIf you do buy it, though. As long as no technical issues arise, you're in for a fun game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499055928, "timestamp_updated": 1499055928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

so much smoother, and added features, such as the fact that NPCs can rebuke your statements and trigger a new minigame, make for a far more intriguing trial overall. the characters in SDR2 have been regarded as less realistic than those in DR1 by some, which i can understand, but they're just as lovable as those from the first game, if not more so. this game also adds backstory and context that DR1 couldn't incorporate, such as the (endgame spoilers) [spoiler]NWP, and the like-SAO-but-better \"ingame death = brain failure\" concept[/spoiler]. it definitely surpasses DR1 in my eyes--not that DR1 was bad, but compared to SDR2 it definitely seems like a prequel for the sake of a prequel. overall, i definitely recommend this game and am completely satisfied with knowing i spent my money

Wright and Zero Escape, you owe it to yourself to play Danganronpa. It takes the murder mysteries and \"present the evidence on the statement\" trial gameplay of Phoenix Wright, mixes it with the dark, complex, twist-filled death game narrative of Zero Escape, and adds in its own dark but absurd comedic tone and wacky but engaging cast.\n\nDanganronpa 2 in particular doubles down on the sheer bonkers-ness of it all. Like, if you've played the first one and think you know what you're in for (and if you haven't played the first one you really need to do that first), trust me, this game will beat all of your assumptions to a pulp. I was watching someone's LP of this game recently, and had a good laugh at how utterly dumbfounded the first hour or so left them.

The premise is close to the first one: Murder someone to escape the island! After someone get killed, you search for clues and hints who done it for the upcoming class trail. If you are unable to find the culpit all other besides the murderer gets executed, so the stacks are pretty high.\n\nGameplay:\nYou have \"Free time\" which is basicly an opportunity to interact with other characters and get to know their backstory.\nAfter some dialogs the main story progresses.\nAs stated above, the biggest part is the detectiv work. After a murder case happened you search every nock and crany to find the evidence the killer has left behind. But dont worry, you dont have a timelimit. The trail always starts when you found all the clues you need.\nIn the class trail itself you try to reconstruct the case and argue with your schoolmates, always with the danger of being killed if you are wrong in the back of your head.\n\nThe story itself is such a good mindtwisting piece of art, everybody should enjoyed it. When you think you know what happens next, the game throw you a curveball.\n\nSince its impossible to get to know every character fully in the main game, there is another mode after you beat the game. \"Island mode\" (the school mode from the first game) feature a slightly different premise. You have much more free time and no killing whatsoever, so you can get to know your favorite chara (you will have one, trust me) alot faster. The goal in this mode is it to craft stuff like hairpins etc. for Monomi. You get the ressources by searching areas in a simplyfied fashion.\n\nPros:\n-A great follow up on the first story.\n-Alot (ALOT!!!!) deeper then it seems at first glance\n-Clever trails where you need to remember the facts about the case to find lies or contradictions\n-Different modes, minigames and collectables keep it fresh for a long time\n-If you replay a chapter the fast forward/skip option is a blessing\n\nNeutral:\n-To enjoy it to the fullest you need to play the first part (as it is with most sequals)\n\nCons:\n-Somehow a few class trail minigames are every worse then in the first part.\n-You need several playthroughts for the island mode to get all character endings/ filled report cards\n- For achievment lover this game is quite the grind. Appart from several playthroughts of island mode, you need to walk half the earth to hatch all animals. And then comes the \"Magical Girl Monomi\" mode to grind for equipment...\n-The replay value is pretty low because the game lives from its plot.\n\nOverall verdict:\nBuy it or the four divas will come and smite you!\nCompared to the first part, it falls short on some ends BUT its still on the highend. The story goes deeper and you understand the events surrounding Hopepeak academy better. It has a fresh feeling and is enjoyable till the end.\nPlay the first, then this and then end it all with the anime \"the end of hope peak academy\" for the best effect (for the love of everything, skip the Anime \"Danganronpa: The Animation\", which is the first part just in anime form. It misses so much).", "timestamp_created": 1498630294, "timestamp_updated": 1498630294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739437", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32911946": {"recommendationid": "32911946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098178696", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462314445}, "language": "english", "review": "A really good visual novel or something, I don't know how to catalogue this game, but it's good if you don't mind reading", "timestamp_created": 1498626211, "timestamp_updated": 1498626211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32911187": {"recommendationid": "32911187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067101948", "num_games_owned": 922, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498416872}, "language": "english", "review": "Danganronpa 2 is an excellent sequel, but don't expect it to innovate much past the first game.

There are a few new deduction minigames used during the trials, and also a 999-esque escape room section, however.

A unique experience for sure, but it was a let down in a number of ways. Danganronpa 2 however, is the bomb. In terms of difficulty and gameplay mechanics, it continues right from the end of Danganronpa; seriously, the first trial in this is way harder than anything in Danganronpa, and some of the story twists rely on you having played Danganronpa, so absolutely do not start the series here. The greatest improvement without a doubt is the murders; where in Danganronpa they were usually pretty easy to figure out, almost every murder in this one is one total mindscrew followed by another. The cast of characters in this one is also much more likable in this one, Nagito Komaeda being one of my favorite characters in any VN, period. \n\nIf there's one gripe I have about it, it's the fact that 1.

J'ai donc achet\u00e9 le deuxi\u00e8me jeu Super Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair sans savoir \u00e0 quoi m'attendre (c'est dr\u00f4le on dirait une pub pour produits m\u00e9nager), et j'avoue au d\u00e9but du jeu avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 sceptique: j'avais trouv\u00e9 le prologue lonnnng, et les graphismes \"d\u00e9plaisants\". Mais finalement, \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 une grosse surprise. \n\nD'abord, synopsis:\n Hope's Peak School est une acad\u00e9mie qui n'accueille que les adolescents les plus dou\u00e9s dans un domaine particulier (ex: l'Ultime Photographe, l'Ultime H\u00e9ritier, l'Ultime Cuisinier). Un jour, emprisonn\u00e9s par un ours en peluche appel\u00e9 Monokuma,  les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sont contraints de participer \u00e0 un jeu morbide s'ils veulent s'\u00e9chapper: pour cela, un \u00e9l\u00e8ve doit en tuer un autre. Si une telle chose se produit, un Tribunal aura lieu (apr\u00e8s un temps d'investigation du lieu du crime) pendant lequel les \u00e9l\u00e8ves restants discuteront et d\u00e9bateront pour trouver le responsable. Si le coupable n'est pas d\u00e9masqu\u00e9, tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves sauf celui-ci sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, et il pourra s'\u00e9chapper, lav\u00e9 de son crime. Si les \u00e9l\u00e8ves r\u00e9ussissent \u00e0 trouver le coupable, celui-ci est ex\u00e9cut\u00e9, et les \u00e9l\u00e8ves restants continuent leur vie dans la \"prison\" que leur a impos\u00e9 Monokuma.\n\nEt Bon Dieu c'que ce jeu est prenant. Comme je l'ai dit, j'ai trouv\u00e9 le d\u00e9but assez long, certainement parce que je m'attendais \u00e0 autre chose; c'est un Visual Novel, mais il ne faut absolument pas passer \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de \u00e7a. D\u00e8s l'annonce du premier meurtre, \u00e7a devient tout simplement captivant. On est alors in\u00e9vitablement pris dans l'ambiance, surtout gr\u00e2ce au travail du compositeur qui a fait un excellent travail pour ce qui est des musiques, notamment lors des Investigations (pour r\u00e9colter des informations avant le Class Trial) avec la musique \"Homicide\".\nS'en suit apr\u00e8s chaque Investigation un Class Trial (ou Tribunal). Ces Class Trials sont g\u00e9niaux: on d\u00e9couvre la mani\u00e8re dont un meurtre s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9, en d\u00e9battant, en supposant, en contredisant les hypoth\u00e8ses des autres, tout en s'approchant petit \u00e0 petit du coupable...  et ce avec diff\u00e9rentes phases de Gameplay. Il faut dire que tous les meurtres sont tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieux, et c'est \u00e0 chaque fois une v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9lectation d'en d\u00e9couvrir le d\u00e9roulement (cf le 5\u00e8me CT tmtc). \nAu-del\u00e0 du stress g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 par les limites de temps et notre \"barre de vie\" qui diminue quand on se foire, il y a le doute : quel personnage est le coupable. Un point fort: on s'attache vraiment aux personnages, certains plus que d'autres; et puis lorsqu'on se rapproche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et que des soup\u00e7ons se cr\u00e9ent ou se confirment sur notre personnage pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, c'est terrible. Aussi, pendant le jeu, des jours s'\u00e9coulent, et chaque matin est d\u00e9but\u00e9 par une annonce de Monokuma : c'est \u00e0 chaque fois un petit coup de stress, appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 par la possible annonce qu'un corps a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9, peut-\u00eatre celui de son personnage pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9. L'angoisse ou le stress qu'on peut ressentir sont malgr\u00e9 tout accompagn\u00e9s d'un peu d'humour bienvenu, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ces personnages loufoques et \u00e0 certaines situations saugrenues.\nConcernant le visuel: je n'aimais pas trop au d\u00e9but mais j'ai appris \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier. Pour les ex\u00e9cutions et d\u00e9couvertes de corps, il existe de petites animations tr\u00e8s sympathiques, qui sont vraiment un \"+\". Concernant les Character Designs, ils sont originaux et tr\u00e8s bons. \n\nVu que je sais pas quoi dire d'autre, je vais finir sur trois choses:\n1) Une ma\u00eetrise de l'anglais (ou bien du japonais) est n\u00e9cessaire pour y jouer. Ceci dit, il y aura apparemment bient\u00f4t une version fran\u00e7aise donc oklm les gens.\n2) Je sais que c'est \u00e9vident mais on sait jamais: mieux vaut jouer au premier jeu Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc ou avoir vu Danganronpa the animation avant de jouer \u00e0 Super Danganronpa 2: Goodbye despair. \n3) L'anime Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak School est susceptible de spoiler des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du jeu. Je conseille donc de jouer imp\u00e9rativement \u00e0 SDR2:GD avant de voir cet anime au risque de vous faire spoiler SDR2 et de ne rien comprendre \u00e0 DR3 (c'est ce qui m'est malheureusement arriv\u00e9, mais \u00e7a ne m'a pas trop g\u00e2ch\u00e9 l'exp\u00e9rience pour autant).\n  Donc voil\u00e0 achetez-le si vous cherchez un bon jeu de Myst\u00e8re, Suspens, Survival Game, D\u00e9tective (j'ai peut-\u00eatre invent\u00e9 des genres mais shhh), dans un univers un peu excentrique (mais pas trop).\nVoil\u00e0 j'esp\u00e8re que j'ai pas trop \u00e9crit mais de toute fa\u00e7on personne ne lira donc caput.\nEt je vais aussi mettre une note pcq c'est ma critique et je fais ce que je veux: 17,75/20 parce que ouais, c'est bien.", "timestamp_created": 1497990481, "timestamp_updated": 1497990644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32597468": {"recommendationid": "32597468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043907834", "num_games_owned": 558, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498062618}, "language": "english", "review": "I want Mikan to sit on my face.\n\n11037/10", "timestamp_created": 1497978681, "timestamp_updated": 1497978776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 545, "votes_funny": 312, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681954", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32588561": {"recommendationid": "32588561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128961402", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503830953}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this game because it bundles with DR1, so happy DR2 comes to PC, but....i have already \"played\" it by watching random youtube channel, already know the story and mystery, AND NOW TOO LAZY TO PLAY IT FOR REAL\n\n10/10 Story\n9/10 asking to make the anime, plz (???)\n11/10 will despair and hope", "timestamp_created": 1497954145, "timestamp_updated": 1497954145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32587910": {"recommendationid": "32587910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325744344", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488465639}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u591a\u8bf4\u65e0\u7528\u98df\u6211\u5b89\u5229\u5566\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1497951985, "timestamp_updated": 1497951985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32565425": {"recommendationid": "32565425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243396526", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 357, "last_played": 1514343006}, "language": "english", "review": "The final boss is a [spoiler]cell phone[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1497878786, "timestamp_updated": 1498082598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32545768": {"recommendationid": "32545768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098989618", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507228531}, "language": "english", "review": "This is probably my favorite Danganronpa game.

I mean, maybe I'm not that qualified to give my opinion on this, because I was already not really a big fan of the first game; but even though the first one had quite a few flaws, like the ridiculous story and a few irritating characters, overall it was still enjoyable to me. The sequel on the other hand takes all these flaws and turns them up to eleven:\n\n- The story and murder cases this time around are utterly retarded and nonsensical.\n\n- While the first game had a desperate and isolated atmosphere, truly fitting for the overall theme of despair, everything in this game just feels so goofy, exaggerated and overblown, that I couldn't take half of it seriously. Oh, and expect lots and lots of 4th wall breaks and self referential humor. Gotta love those, right?\n\n- Somehow they managed to make the minigames even more annoying and unintuitive.\n\n- The various characters, arguably the heart of these games, are so much worse than its predecessor, that it's not even funny. They are way too over the top, to the point that they just become grating to deal with. It goes way beyond being one dimensional or stereotypical; you just can't imagine these lunatics ever existing or functioning in real life. Everyone is crazy, everyone has a messed up past and strange values. One person is a glutton, she will think about nothing but food even in life and death situations. One character is sad someone turned out to be a murderer, the next moment she happily forgives him and recites the catchphrase of this game: \"We gotta do our best, for his sake!\" It all just feels so artificial.  It's a flaw a lot of japanese media has IMO: style over substance.\nEven if you bother to spend time with them, some character may reveal a superficial character flaw after a while, wich will never be brought up again and doesn't really matter. Oh, but you get their underwear as a reward. Aren't you glad you wasted time on this?\n\n- The characters motivations for doing stuff and especially their motives for commiting murder dont make any lick of sense half of the time, which doesn't really help with endearing them to the player. It's probably not a good sign, that, while I was often saddened by the death of characters in the first game, I couldn't care less when someone died in this game. On the contrary, most of the time I was glad when someone finally bites the dust.\nIt's fair to say I was pretty much on Monokuma's side the whole time.\n\n-As for positive things: music is still enjoyable, graphics are alright and I encountered no bugs or glitches while playing.\n\nDamn, that turned out longer than I wanted. So in conclusion, if you are like me and already had to massively strain your suspension of disbelief and tolerance for anime tropes during the first game, especially in regards to characters and story, avoid this one. Seriously, it feels like a different dev-team worked on this game. If you don't give a crap about this, get it on a sale, because that price is ridiculous for a VN.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1497209712, "timestamp_updated": 1497209712, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519904", "comment_count": "18", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32347815": {"recommendationid": "32347815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282997392", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497201825}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u5abd\u7684  \u9084\u6211\u4e03\u6d77\u5343\u79cb+\u6faa\u7530\u552f\u5439!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1497202014, "timestamp_updated": 1497202053, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.340601", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32315185": {"recommendationid": "32315185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062089233", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505834447}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u633a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff0c\u6ca1\u73a9\u8fc71\u7684\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1497093614, "timestamp_updated": 1497093614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32286091": {"recommendationid": "32286091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354766342", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511928475}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good.

It has the same dark bizarre humor and over the top characters, and clever murders. Although honestly I found the humor could be a little obnoxious at times as opposed to bizarely amusing, which wasn't a problem I had with the first game. \nThe gameplay adds a couple new elements, but gameplay is still obviously not the main point of the game, the main draw is solving the murders, particularly putting together small clues to form the whole picture, and of course, plot twists! There are very clever and intriguing mysteries in this game, and a couple I didn't even begin to figure out until the middle of the class trial\n\nThere are two main criticisms I have with this game, 1. There were a couple times where I knew the answer or clue I needed to trigger the next section of a trial, but the wording sequence needed in game was very counter intuitive. There were definetly times where the trial mini games just felt like chores\n\n2. This was a criticism I also had for the first game: You can build relationships with characters, but those relationships don't matter.

As expected, the game was better. A little fast paced, but it was not like how the anime rushed it. With this in mind, I was curious on what more there was of the series. Low and behold, I found the sequel. Honestly, I lowered my expectations when I purchased it. I considered the sequel may be inconsistent to the storyline, become dull in comparison to the first game, and I would chuck it in my library to never see the light of day, buried alongside a handful of visual novels covered by my crippling disappointment.\n\nHoly crap, was I wrong about that assumption. \n\nThis was actually a really awesome game. I was beside myself by how invigorating all the concepts and development turned out to be. I wondered if the characters would be watered down by the large casting, but there was honestly a lot of thought put behind them. They had minor roles, but not enough to not make them at least somewhat interesting. Each had a quirk of their own, making them all lovable.\n\nOh, and did I mention there is a Yakuza boss with a Napoleon Complex?\n\n... That's just hilarious. XD\n\nHere's a quick rundown of what to expect:\n\n~Story mode~\n\nConsists of:\n-Doki doki moments\n-You're on a beach! Splash around to your heart's content! (Wtf?)\n-The talking maniacal teddy bear returns\n-Double the trouble with a fluffy version of that maniacal bear\n-Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu\n-Moments when everyone questions their sanity\n-In turn, you question your own sanity on purchasing the sequel. You wonder why you would ever think the story could not become more traumatizing. Was it worth paying this much-Hey, midget yakuza boss. Cool. \n-Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu\n\n~Free Time~\n\nConsists of: \n-Quality time with the husbando or waifu of your choice\n-Cheating is not applicable\n-Obtain your own harem as fast as possible\n-Don't leave behind your personal Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu\n-Hope your waifus don't end their laifus\n-You have the opportunity to create beautiful bromances with the men of your choice\n-Put on your yaoi goggles for one choice in particular...\n-It's basically Pokemon: We \"gotta catch 'em all\"\n\n~Trial Mode~\n\nConsists of: \n-Epic rip off \"Objections\" like the first game\n-Interesting mechanics with ear splitting gunshots\n-Constant argumentative characters all up in your grill\n-Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu will be the most notable nemesis\n-You will be overwhelmed by the \"tsun tsun\" train of Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu\n-Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu achieves the title of \"most consistent pain in the ass edgelord\"\n-You will find this strangely endearing\n-If all else fails, find ways to counteract characters being all up in your grill\n-You can play Hangman\n-Surf the deep web of your mind\n-Hysterical teens\n-Rainbow button mashing while 1v1ing hysterical teens\n-Feel like you're taking a trip through Caramelldansen town all over again\n\nHusbando/Waifu potential?

To the point where Monokuma gives huge spoilers to the first game, and pokes fun at it being cheap that the reveal was saved until the final moment.\n;Compared to the first, characters are way more fleshed out.  I actually found myself liking everyone in this game, and relating to a lot of aspects of each of them. (Especially Nekomaru's obsession with shitting.)\n;There's a lot more humour in this one, which makes the sad moments much more sad (but that's also thanks to better writing too).\n;The story overall is pretty much the first game but on an island, and with a new protagonist as well. The traitor reveal was heart-wrenching, especially learning the events of the Danganronpa 3 Anime shortly after. But, there is also another plot twist in the ending that made me facepalm, though a little less than the first game thanks to being prepared for something cheap like that but also it just not being as bad.\n;The trials are better, having more gameplay styles and a lot more to look forward to when it does come trial time. Older elements have been improved and the new additions are pretty well implemented.\n;Killings and investigations are vastly more interesting than the first, creating scenarios that are a lot more creative than the first (and as a result, a little more of a challenge to figure out.).\n;Free Time is pretty much the same, and this is actually pretty fine.\n;Island Mode is like School Mode, but with a lot easier of a premise to grasp. More believable because it actually follows the plot this time instead of breaking the fourth wall constantly. Pretty much the same crafting and seaching game and the same great character building through Hanging Out and Trip Tickets.\n;Monomi's Adventure Supreme can go fuck itself, the sidegame itself is pretty lackluster and I was so unhappy having to spend about 5 hours unlocking all the items for 100%ing it. They're all random drops and you have to rely on pure luck for that shit to go faster.\n;Finding the secret events was difficult, and finding the secret monokumas were also pretty difficult (there was only one I had to google, the one in the hospital room).\n\nI'd recommend playing the game through, maybe gathering all the hope fragments and possibly beating Island Mode if you like the game. 100%'ing the game becomes boring and borderline frustrating. However, the base game is very solid and I'd probably even play it through again in the future. There is also Danganronpa Another Episode, as well as the Danganronpa 3 and 2.5 Anime series which I almost instantly watched as soon as I knew it even existed in the first place. I didn't expect for this game and DR1 to kickstart my love for this franchise, because I wasn't actually aware of how much I'd be into it. So I would recommend this game if you played the first and liked that, and would recommend this if you want to give it a shot too. It's worth it, but possibly not if you dislike the first game. It might be a VN, but it's not a bad VN, and actually tries with it's gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1495202886, "timestamp_updated": 1495203063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Lets go in order of how I structured my review of the first game.\n\nThe Good - \n\nFirst the art. I praised the first game for its artstyle in the sense that its a single setting but no two rooms looked alike (despite the class-rooms of course), so given a setting like multiple ISLANDS to explore you'd expect even better right? Damn right, and damn right did they deliver. Each island has a theme to follow and the express each theme beautifully. For real, this is probably one of the best anime styled games to look at out there, for its pop-up book artistic style matched with all the vibrant colours and props, every island and area was a joy to look at.\n\nThe story was something I both loved and hated with the first game, and its a similar love hate relationship with this. However, the story is FAR superior to the first with only a few flaws in comparison. For starters, the writing is so much more well polished. Its not perfect, but its much more solid. Nothing feels overly stupid which the first did a lot, so thank god for that. More importantly though the ending actually felt satisfying. The big problem with the first game was not only was it poorly written but the ending felt sudden, rushed and unfinished. Even after finishing the second game we STILL don't know what truly happened after the first, some more questions have been answered sure but at the same time even more question arose. But thats the first games problems not the second. The second game did truly have a satisfying ending to the point you wouldn't mind it ending there all together. But because of Ultra Despair Girls and the Danganronpa 3 anime we know that doesn't happen.\n\nAgain, the Voice acting in this game for the most part is great, you still have your irritable voices but go figure, its anime its gotta happen. However two big issues arise in this game compared to the first. Why can none of these voice actors do good crying? Every time someone cries in this game I wanna pull my hair out. This could come under the issues with writing but... the other problem I had was when a Blackend was found out, a fir portion of them had accent/personality shifts which became really dull after the second time it happened. \n\nThe soundtrack again is great, there was a fair few reused tracks which is disappointing but all the original music was great.\n\nGameplay wise... comes my biggest issues with the second game, but the positives are that exploring didn't feel like a chore anymore. The awkward first person stiff controls of the first game are still here but they aren't used nearly as much. Instead they opted for a 2D scrolling style exploration of the islands which felt much more fluid. The free-time events are still present although they felt a tad bit longer in this which kinda dragged out after having 4+ free-times in succession. This time around you also get mini objectives like finding hidden Monokuma's throughout the island... more to explain in the cons. You also get a Tamagochi style pet which after caring for it will reward you with currency and gifts for the other students and even a skill used in trials. The Trials this time around, while following the same basic format are... interesting, you still have your non-stop debates, panic talk actions and final arguments but a couple new additions made it... less enjoyable.\n\nThe Bad -\n\nThe story for the most-part as I said was a huge improvement over the last. However its the investigation before the final trial that really killed it for me. Its long, there is a TON of info you need to absorb and overall you kind of shut out only skimming over the text because it became a chore. Other than that, its was pretty decent.\n\nI said In my last review the characters were generic and stereotypical of their 'Ultimate Talents' and I said how from what little I knew of this game the problem would still persist. I wasn't wrong. While the characters certainly have more personality in this game compared to the first game again, you had generic looks for what their talent was. I also said how some characters took too much inspiration from the first game. Again, I wasn't wrong, A good portion of characters shared the same characteristics with characters from the first, though a couple had good reasons. Though props to the writers for having a female 'Ultimate Gamer', nice break from the norm. \n\nNow the gameplay. The Hidden Monokuma's I mentioned earlier? Yeah there are 30 of them. Again not a probelm. Wanna know something though? YOU ARE NOT REWARDED FOR GETTING THEM ALL. No Skills, No hidden story, No Hidden CG, NOTHING. Its such a waste of time and potential it makes you wonder why they bothered. Now, the class trials were butchered in this game. The standard features and writing were still solid don't get me wrong. But two things nearly ruined it for me. Hangmans Gambit and Logic Drive. Christ what made them think this was a good idea. While yes I complained Hangman's Gambit was far too easy in the first game and its difficulty is improved in the second for sure, but the mini-game itself is an absolute bore and a complete mess as well as being literally UNFAIR at times making some letters IMPOSSIBLE to avoid clashing. I wanted HG to change, but I wanted it to be fun, not a cheat. The new Rebuttal showdown... its definitely the best of the new modes and I would even go as far to say it should have fully replaced Panic Talk Action (which yes still suck). But the game didn't do the best job in explaining how it works and all around just felt clunky, not terrible, but still a pain. And Logic Drive, oh boy where do I start. Its basically a Q&A with a Third-Person... Skating? Segment in a cylindrical tube. Your forced to avoid objects, jump gaps all to get to a checkpoint where you answer a question which even makes the Hangmans Gambit from the first game look difficult. If there was ever a mini-game that felt out of place it was logic drive, easily the worst mistake they made with this game. \n\nAnd yes, still hate the pink blood but sometimes there is red blood nonsense.\n\nTl;Dr, the game still suffers from some annoyances, but I think we all come to expect games to have those. But overall it is a much stronger entry in the series compared to the first and I highly recommend playing it if you haven't already.", "timestamp_created": 1494372226, "timestamp_updated":

I am just going to say that it made me love a very underrated character.\nSecond one being the Island Mode, where it's like TTH's School Mode. But it feels expanded.\nIt still has similar gameplay styles and similar graphics, but it just feels larger in a sense.\nProbably because you're playing in an Island instead of a school.\nAnd third and final thing I wanna talk about is the Monomi Mini Game.\nHoly SHIT is this game brutal to complete.\nRNGesus is not happy with me.\nIf you don't believe me, play it for yourself.\nThe controls are wonky and off putting. But it still can be fun.\n\nSpike, you did it again.\nNOW BRING US v3!", "timestamp_created": 1493546446, "timestamp_updated": 1493546446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505095", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31455223": {"recommendationid": "31455223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079020079", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513103185}, "language": "english", "review": "gundham did not deserve to die", "timestamp_created": 1493526878, "timestamp_updated": 1493526878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31448881": {"recommendationid": "31448881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199150261", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509216822}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1] \u041e\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0417\u041d\u0410\u0427\u041d\u041e MUST HAVE!

bonds or feelings towards the characters as the story goes on. Cough Cough The ones that survived in the end. I contains most of the concept of the last game but changing things like hangman gambit and adding special events. Island mode can be really tedious after a while as you do over and over again to get the few acheivments surrounding island mode. Magical Miracle Girl Mode is to be honest a pain as one acheivement makes you get all the equipment which will take ages as well my luck was horrible. There is also this horrible glitch when you into momomi you screen is covered with pink and white lines. The light novel included in the game was enjoyable as I have played the previous game and sometimes rememeber some things in the previous game. But the light novel is a bit long as a event is at the end of the novel. You have to click for long time just read the end and then if you were  like me I read the light novel after. The leveling up of lvl to 99 takes patience and the power to hold the Shift and <- -> while you kill plenty of your virtual pet. The game is better then Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc as many things has improved as the graphic are better. The first murder was way better than the previous game first murder, To old players: Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc first murder were so obvious that most hit our heads on the table. The murders are pretty interesting and some complicated.", "timestamp_created": 1492869322, "timestamp_updated": 1492869322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

"last_played": 1491739580}, "language": "english", "review": "Danganronpa 2 improves much of DR1's problems while still inheriting some of its flaws. WIthout spoiling too much, the game is structurally similar to DR1 in its premise and execution, but with quite a few differences in the details.\n\nThe first difference is an improvement in characters. Characters are much less one-note in this game.They are heavily-defined by their talents, but those talents are a small part of the characters and their back stories. If I do have one critique, there seems to be an over-reliance on sexual assault as a comedic plot device, as I've not finished every character's arc, but two of the handful I've done already have some form of (serious) sexual assault against them played up as really unfitting comedy.\n\nMuch like DR1's localization, DR2's localization has some issues. It feels like it's worse in the beginning, but there are a lot of just really weird dialogue moments that have some pretty unnatural sounding speech. It's not a deal-breaker, but I hope they continue to improve upon moving the game from East to West, as there are many more moments in this game where I felt like the localization team made some good strides in translating a character to Western audiences, and I hope to see them improve with each iteration.\n\nThe problem with the game's writing, much like DR1, comes at the end. I've got to say that the ending plot sequences are just the worst kind of anime crap. They are cringey, and throw in so many \"plot twists\" that the mystery sections they make you solve are nonsensical and and just end up tainting the better parts of the story.\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite similar to DR1. You get free time to spend with characters and do some side activities to pick up presents. There's a mini-game now also that lets you use up un-wanted presents to get bonuses, which is a welcome feature. Eventually, someone will get murdered, you'll have to find every clue, and then start a class trial, using logic and mini-games to solve the mystery. The mini-games are a mixed bag. Some like, the truth bullet system from the first game are alright, but others are a miss. \n\nI'm especially not fond of the Panic Talk Action, which simulates you trying to shout through an opponent's flimsy defenses by winning a rhythm game. Unfortunately, there seems to be no actual sense to the rhythm as it doesn't really mesh up with any sort of tempo in the song, and seems to be more of a visual thing, which is incredibly distracting and hard to pull off without a power-up the game eventually throws you later in the story that almost completely breaks this. It's like the developers knew it was poorly implemented. Beyond that, there's a clunky snowboarding-esque minigame called Logic Dive that's a mixture of boring and badly made, but I didn't find too many other mini-games too offensive. \n\nThe mysteries themselves are part of the main appeal for me as I enjoy games like Phoenix Wright, and the only complaint I have is that the last trial, like in DR1 is a sort of plot deconstruction one where it feels like you have a dozen clues that are the exact same thing and the challenge is trying to figure out what the hell the developer's logic for the answers are.\n\nBeyond the main campaign, there are some bonus modes. One of them is kind of like this task simulator that's mostly there to give you a chance to max out character arcs of characters who may have died too early in the main game or you just didn't get around to finishing. The other is a manga detailing events of the first game, and the other is a pretty boring and bad arcade action-adventure thing that gold old really quickly.\n\nDespite those complaints, I really do enjoy DR2. Its story up until the end is engaging, the mysteries are creative, the characters are largely much improved over DR1, and I didn't spend 30 hours plowing through this over a few days for no reason.", "timestamp_created": 1492357291, "timestamp_updated": 1492357291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31178417": {"recommendationid": "31178417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328921795", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489933259}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8d4c\u4e0a\u6027\u547d\u7684\u5b66\u7ea7\u5ba1\u5224", "timestamp_created": 1492349687, "timestamp_updated": 1492349687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31177974": {"recommendationid": "31177974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138904972", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492959693}, "language": "english", "review": "Very interesting game.

After watching Danganronpa The Animation and got into this crazy fandom, I thought it was aight. But after seeing the games for the first time, I was simply blown away. Unfortunately, I didn't get the joy of playing it blind since I watched a playthrough of DR2 before I played it (NicoB, btw). But the fact that I got so many good reactions out of just sitting and watching sold me on this game and instantly made it my favourite.\n\nEnough backstory tho. Let's talk about the things that this game does well.\n\n-Characters-\n\nFor a game where you know way more than half the characters are gonna die, the characters here are really well made. I will admit, some more so than others. Now I could spend hours talking about all the characters and why I love or hate them, but for the sake of your potential uninterest, I won't. We'll cover this quickly.\n\nThe character variety in this game is pretty damn neat. There are some easy to love, and some easy to hate, and some you're not quite sure. And although there is only one character here that I hate, that's not a bad thing at all. I don't hate him because I think he's a bad character. Far from it. I hate him because his character was designed to be hateable. This goes to show that they did a good job at making this character. But at the same time, I know a lot of people who love him, so there's a lot of different ways that you can interpret each character, which I think is really nice and it helps keep the fandom alive. Of course no one's gonna agree. My favourite might be someone else's hated Mary Sue. And of course you won't get to know each character fully in the main story because they'll die before you get to. Luckily, there's a bonus mode after you complete the main story that lets you do so. And, trust me, you'll most likely get very attached to at least one of them. Just hope that they don't end up dead.\n\n-Plot-\n\nMuch like the first game, the plot in this game rarely, if not ever fails to go into the perfect amount of detail. And at the same time, it leaves a lot of mystery. It's a really good balance of the two. This doesn't just go for the overall plot, but for each individual trial too. Admittedly, some have more questions left to answer than others, but that doesn't mean any of them are bad. \n\nAs for the overall plot, everything just seems to fit together so well, and that includes some details from the first game. It truly succeeds as a sequel by developing the series more and more with each chapter, and bringing it all together for what would have to be my favourite finale in any video game. And yet there's still more. But let's not get off track by talking about the other games.\n\n-Challenge-\n\nNow, if we're talking about this like it's an action game, I can't say that it has a huge difficulty level...or even a relatively high one for that matter. Rather than being challenging on the hands controlling it, it's challenging on the mind. It took me a while to figure out some of the solutions to some of the cases, but the feeling of satisfaction when you finally get it is awesome. There are a few minigames that require some action gameplay, and they can get quite difficult. Sometimes not because it's meant to be. But I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that this game is flawless. Luckily, you can set difficulty between 3 levels with both action and logic.\n\n-Follow Up-\n\nAs I've already said, this game really succeeds as a sequel. I feel like it does almost everything better than the first game. The plot is more interesting, the characters are better, the trials are longer and more engaging, etc. Although this is the case, it is really worth playing the first game first if you're worried about spoilers. \n\n-Waifus-\n\nOkay, let's be real for a second. This game...no, this series as a whole has some great fuckin' waifus. Like oh my god. Like I can name 5, maybe 6 from this game alone. Sure, it's a silly point to make and coud've easily gone in the Characters section, but my bebs deserve more.\n\nDanganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is my favourite game of all time as of right now.

"last_played": 1490342627}, "language": "english", "review": "Sometimes more is less.\n\nDanganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair has the unfortunate job of having to say \"How do I follow up that?\" The original Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, had final relevations that would, without spoiling, make further installments tricky. Danganronpa 2, therefore, sidesteps the larger narrative already set up to tell a smaller but still engaging story. This one isn't really a standalone - though you can probably go through it without playing Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, I would urge anybody interested to play the original first. While for the most part this stands alone, the parts that don't are pretty vital.\n\nSo, D2: GD keeps with the blend of visual novel text and minigames established in the original. There still isn't any signficant branching other than what students you choose to bond with during a given playthrough, though there's seemingly a hidden scene or two I may have missed, looking at the gallery. Instead, it relies more on the murder mysteries and minigames to engage, and those felt relatively strong, though one case left me rather cold. In general, those who have played D:THH will feel at home again. The core gameplay of \"meet friends, watch them die, solve the mystery\" remains the same, but there are a more few new distractions.\n\nIn keeping with sequelitis, some of the minigames have been changed and a new one has been added, but sometimes not for the better. The core debate mechanics are still strong and remain the core. A new debate style where you \"cut\" words is a middling addition - it's difficulty seemed to wander wildly to the point I felt one sequence was nearly impossible on Hard, but thankfully only nearly so. Hangman's Bluff gets a unnecessarily obtuse addition of moving letters that can crash into each other, which I just felt was distraction. A new minigame, Logic Dive, has you hoverboarding down the tube of... your mind?... and selecting different conclusions by boarding down different paths. To me, it felt like an unnecessarily reflex-and-memorization version of Ace Attorney Investigations' logic mechanic. Ultimately, though, they still fulfill their purpose of adding tension to the trial segments and breaking up what otherwise would probably be a tiring wall of text. Mystery deduction remains engaging for the most part, with only one mystery that had me squinting at how the player was supposed to puzzle a thing or two out.\n\nAlso new to the series are leveling and a virtual pet mechanic, which is easily the worst new addition. You can warp between locations quickly, or you can walk slowly from area to area on the new island environment. Walking levels your character, but also there's a virtual pet you get you can grow by walking as well. However, your virtual pet will shit itself to death if left unattended, so you have to enter a menu, select the pet option, and occassionally press \"X\" to clean its shit up and allow it to grow. Leveling can be done other ways as well, mind. Your level controls how many skills (gained by making bonds with others, still) you can equip for trails, and the pet can be given gifts to raise its \"hope\" to get it to evolve into different forms. It's all a bunch of fiddly bullshit to reward people willing to play a Desert Bus-quality minigame that hopefully won't make a return, because it's real, real bad. The pets don't do anything interesting but shower your in monocoins, which are used once again to buy gifts to make bonds with the other students and unlock stuff in the gallery.\n\nIf that wasn't all, there's a fairly average arcade \"magical girl\" side-game to play, as well as a alternate story mode and novella that are unlocked upon finishing the game - I've played the former but not the two latter games yet.\n\nAs an aside, just get guides for gift-giving or pet raising in that regard. It's not worth sussing out on your own. Similarly, the random gacha machine tries to trick you into spending more than on monocoin at a time, but it's only worth it if you're buried in them and you're down to that last 10% or 5% of items to unlock. It retains the bad mechanic of just throwing in tens or hundreds of coins one at a time to get the best result.\n\nThis may sound all really harsh, but I still enjoyed it. And it's hard to talk about why, because the biggest elements of D2:GD are the relationships, reveals, and a deeply Japanese sense of humor and wit. If you've played D:THH - which you once again should have before playing this - you should already have a pretty good idea of what you're in for. The new characters are generally interesting and entertaining with only a few misses, and I wouldn't mind another go-round to see more once I have the time. It's unfortunate to have some of the albatross-like mechanics added to what otherwise is a fairly strong narrative, though hemmed somewhat by the relevations of the original. There are some handwavey portions that disappointed me somewhat, but overall it left me wanting to poke some more through the bizarre pile of questionable quality that is what the Danganronpa *transmedia franchise* at this point. Is it good? Hmmm. Is it fun? I think it's pretty fun so far.\n\nDanganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair remains a relatively clever visual novel with just enough spice of minigame and adventure game crossbreeding to keep me entertained, A lot of whether people like this depends on your tolerance for visual novels, Japanese quirk, and some degree of monkeycheese, but it's not the sort of experience you'll get much of anywhere else save perhaps the Phoenix Wright games, and those games aren't on Steam.\n\nPlayed through with both difficulties on hard. Had to resort to a guide once to get an answer and once to get a clue that led me to the answer. Leveled to 99, god help me, and pretty sure I raised all the pets but the pet achievement never triggered. Finished the magical girl minigame. Bonded with 3 other students to maximum.\n\nTL;DR: Easily worth your time for the narrative if you enjoyed the original, but it's not without some annoyances to put up with, so if you're easily bugged by some garbo mechanics or time-wasting elements it may not be for you. If you haven't played the original, don't play this.", "timestamp_created": 1490375809, "timestamp_updated": 1490375809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30706902": {"recommendationid": "30706902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141312179", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495128615}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de los mejores juegos que he tenido la suerte de disfrutar, es excelente y me quedo corta. \nDefinitivamente Danganropa lleva el concepto de novelas visuales a otro nivel.

My feedback about this game is more challenging than the first Danganronpa. There are many reasons why this game is more challenging than the first game. First, I play 8 hours in every chapter that has raising my level and solving the case that makes my character level 69 its almost level 70. Second, the class trial mechanic is more challenging than the mechanic of the first danganronpa that makes me getting more missteps than first, and Third the characters of this game is also challenging includes their personalities, ultimate talent, and of course likes and dislikes. So therefore I conclude that this game is actually more challenging than the first and so what this game theme is like retro style or references on it. And hey, I love Chiaki Nanami as well because I got her 5 hope fragments from her too.

I've yet to complete the pc version but i think i've played enough to be able to write a review about it. Despite being a sequel Danganronpa 2 can in fact be played without playing the first game, although doing so isn't recommended. For this game a new cast of characters find themselves in a new setting, but the concept is largely the same. To escape from their island paradise/prison you need to commit murder and get away with it. If they do not then they face excecution. \nThe gameplay is very similar to the first though some changes have been made to the exploration and trial minigames. While the trial changes are welcome as they make some of the more boring minigames less worthless, i'm not to fond of the exploration, as i much preffered what was present in the first game instead. However, there being a fast travel feature alleviates this somewhat. The story itself feels like it takes a while longer to get going compared to the first one and i really wish it would hurry up a little bit in the beginning, the prologue especially. Thankfully the pacing is a bit more to my liking towards the end, and i do like the story quite a lot. Though, again, i didn't like it as much as the first. the trials are still as fun as they ever were, and its still a great feeling putting together the pieces of the cases.\nSpeaking of things not as good as the first game, let's talk about the characters. As i said before we get an entirely new cast of characters for this game(well, for the most part, at least). I do enjoy a lot of these new characters, don't get me wrong, but in equal regard, some of them irritated the crap out of me through the course of the game. Granted, i was annoyed by a couple of the characters in the first Danganronpa as well, so when i say the characters in the first game were better, i mean the ratio of good to bad was higher. Also dissapointing was that there was no character in this game equal to the person who would become my favorite character of the franchise, who i'm not going to name because i'm not sure if that would be counted as spoilers or not.\nWith all the important bits out of the way, i'll wrap things up. The music is good, nothing i'd want to buy and listen to by itself, but stil good. Some of the character designs look a bit weird to me, but they're pretty good for the mostpart. I played the game in english and the voice acting was both pretty good and pretty consistent.\nSo in this review i may sound like i think that Danganronpa 2 is an inferior product to the first and... yeah, i kind of do. But i don't think it's a bad game, quite the opposite. It's a great game, just not as good.\n", "timestamp_created": 1490203570, "timestamp_updated": 1490203570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488",

What a fancy-mancy game judging from that desperation-free title and that cute little picture... No it's not apparently.\nHave you ever wanted to test your talent of being the detective or your knowledge in psychology, perhaps criminology, and solve cases, also jerking off with others relationship? You can do it here.\n\nIt had come back for more.......\n\nDanganronpa series is one of that daing-detective-sims game that gives you good plots in the series in self with a tasks that gives you headache, class-trial especially. This is the game that require a good bit of vitamins you ate to process certain tasks to be able to continue the game (Well there's always \"Save'n'Load button\" to rewind mistakes). It's not just single category though. Logics, humans behaviour, friendship, romance (girls), emotions and satisfaction (That feel when you complete a complicated case) they give you all, as much as you are capable to handle. I personally feel it that way\n\n== WARNING, THE CONTENT IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH MAY CONTAINED (LIGHT) SPOILERS ==\n\n\n\nEnough of brain-harming, Danganronpa series had a prequel and sequel for players to enjoy, I personally recommended you to check the others product of Danganronpa as well. Also there's an \"Anime\" of this series for you to watch and enjoy too, Danganronpa 3 it's named. It's both prequel and sequel stories of Danganronpa 2. If you're one of those in the early days who anticipated the consequence of an event in Danganronpa 3 when the episode are not released yet, then it's would be an exciting predict of what will happen next (For me, I find this quite entertaining).\n\nThe plots and stories and actually interesting, it's quite enjoyable, If you liked Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc, then you would find the the story and the gameplay quite addicting. The characters had their own stories and their unique personality. The background has (somewhat) improved. New functions and gameplay mechanics, minigames inclusive. The soundtracks are glorious, mysteriously glorious.... and last but not least, there is a character that signatured this game, \"Monokuma\", well everybody love how villainous he is right? ....... right?\n\nSo, does it worth for the money you paid? Absolutely, for person who like mysteries and visual novel + dating sim\n\n10/10 would be grabbing more vitamins for this game", "timestamp_created": 1488565496, "timestamp_updated": 1488565496,

masterpiece and you should definitely get it if you're even remotedly into mystery. It's very visual novel like, with a heavy focus on the amazing story, while being very linear. For me, that didn't matter though since I got sucked into the immersive setting right from the start - the story never gets boring and has a ton of twists, and the characters are great inthemselves, each with their own very distinct personality. Don't get too emotionally attached to your favorite waifu though, chance is high that she'll die at some point. \nThe only minor negative point about the game for me are the unnecessarily long tutorials (especially during the class trial phase) and some of the trial minigames, as they are sometimes hard to follow and make sense of.\n\nLastly, if you want to play this game, I'd highly recommend you  to play part 1 - Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc first, as Goodbye Despair ties closely into the overall story with lots of references and major spoilers to the first part.", "timestamp_created": 1486924598, "timestamp_updated": 1486924598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29862131": {"recommendationid": "29862131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281450851", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487476634}, "language": "english", "review": "Be careful not to lose yourself in that I have struggled between hope and despair.", "timestamp_created": 1486864275, "timestamp_updated": 1486864275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29860249": {"recommendationid": "29860249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013911804", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486846273}, "language": "english", "review": "Spoiler-free thoughts about the game, TLDR in the end\nThis review expects that you have already completed the first Danganronpa.\n\nThe story is bigger and better, but after the opening scenes it progresses quite slowly until the midpoint of the game: Danganronpa1 had a steadier flow going thorough the game, but the last half of D2 beats the ending of D1 hands down. To avoid spoilers I'm not going to say anything more about that.\n\nCompared to D1, the main cast is much more eccentric. While the first game had pretty colourful characters set in a relatively dark athmosphere, D2 goes all out with the character designs, which might be off-putting to some people, especially if you're not used to Japanese style of humor. I personally would've preferred if the cast wasn't as weird as it was presented, but this wasn't a huge deal because:\na) There's actually some character development this time around, so some characters will grow as persons.\nb) More information about the characters can be gained during the free-time conversations, which will help you understand the cast better, therefore they become more tolerable.\nc) There's a good chance that the character you despise the most will die at some point lol.\n\nWhile the main cast is mostly more one-dimensional than it was in the first game, the villains this time are just awesome. Instead of having arbitrary motives linked to the despair theme like in the first game, the reasons of the killing game and character actions become very clear. The case and story twists are huge and twisted af, I loved it.\n\nThe game had some of the best murder cases I've yet to play in any game so far (5th case omg). Most of them focus in small areas, usually just in the room or the house the murder took place, so the investigation, trial and logic proceedings stay more cohesive. Because of this there're less of those far-fetched moments where the player finds possible plot holes or logical near-impossibilities.\n\nThe trial mechanics are improved, tho I still dislike the action based logic games.\nWhen it comes to the logic puzzles, the pieces of the puzzle should be the key to the solution, not vice versa, where the player already knows the answer, but the artificial difficulty of the puzzle makes him waste time and effort just for submitting the answer.\nThe best example of this is the Hangman's Gambit, where you have to shoot down flying letters to form a sentence to answer a question. The intention of the game is that the letters would act like helpful hints, but usually the player can figure out the answer after inputting a couple of letters. After that you're just waiting for the correct letters to appear on the screen, and the game becomes a time wasting formality. There is an option to turn down the action puzzle difficulty, but as I'm aware it doesn't really shorten the time you have to spend in those games.\n\nThe trial mechanic where the game really shines, Make Your Argument, is improved even further. The time limits are stricter, time bonuses have been nerfed, and because of the more compact theme of the murders the logic flows more solidly. There are still some moments where you struggle submitting the answer just because you can't figure out which statement to shoot down, but those are rare now, I had to dig a hint from a walkhrough only once during the whole playthrough.\n\nThe graphical detail and style are again excellent: the visuals have aged really well considering this was originally a PSVita title. There are some minor but very glaring issues though; I don't understand why the 2D hub world was put together so sloppily, because you'd figure that kind of solution would be easy to execute properly. The character movement animation is terrible, the sprites are jagged and pixelated, and the texture layers between the foreground and the character overlap incorrectly. Also when the background sprites happen to overlap each other, there're occasional graphical errors that are mostly caused by bad object cropping. Texture popping is also a thing, which is probably a remnant from the Vita version, it could've been removed from this PC version.\n\nWhen it comes to selecting the voice acting language, I recommend Japanese due to practical reasons. This allows you to read the dialogue more fluently when the characters are speaking virtually gibberish, and moving to the next text box in mid-sentence is also less abrupt. \n\nTLDR\nThe writing and dialogue are again excellent outside some \"Japanese\" moments, which this game has more than in D1. Especially the ending and the murder cases greatly exceed the first game, this stuff is wonderfully f*cked up.\nThe character designs are more eccentric and one-dimensional, but there's more character development around this time.\nThe villains on the other hand are superior, the motives and character actions are rock-solid, which was very satisfying.\nTrial minigames have been changed for the better, tho they are still just artificial time-wasters if you don't like their core mechanics.\nPlay with Japanese voices, and be not afraid to max out the logic difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1486856417, "timestamp_updated": 1507882448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29856300": {"recommendationid": "29856300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165754136", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471292261}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, full of plot twists and with an amazing writing an lovely characters.\nIf you don' t mind visual novel kind of games and like some investigations and deductions, this is the game for you.

say Danganronpa 2 is indeed much better in pretty much all aspects. \n\nThe setting is more interesting, the story is much more engrossing and, most of all, the cast of characters is much more carismatic. Quite a lot of them actually have some full-fledged dramatical, humanizing moments, which is great when you consider how whacky they are designed to be. Not that the characters in Danganronpa 1 were bad, but they weren't really interesting to me either. \nThe creativity and convolutedness (in a good way) of all the cases is also very much improved, with most if not all cases having their fair share of plot-twists and intense moments. Danganronpa 2 clearly wanted to play with players' expectations a bit, and I think it was well done.\n\nMentioning expectations, whereas I found the plot of Danganronpa 1  to be pretty standard and heavily predictable (I pretty much predicted the central plot twist from the very get-go) that is thankfully not the case with 2. Most of the major twists were cleverly hidden and not obvious at all, which is always a plus.\n\nIt still carries over some major faults from 1, though: first, the \"free-time events\" are way too few and far between, meaning you either give attention solely to a few characters (and pray they last long enough for you to complete more of their events) or you pretty much lose quite a lot of character development, especially from the ones that bite the dust early on. Just like 1, there is a post-game mode meant for you to complete all the events, but it would've been much better to get more opportunities in the actual story mode. \n\nSecond, some mini-games feel like padding or are just not really that fun to play. The improved Hangman's Gambit is just a pain in the ass to go through (since the English words use more letters than Japanese ones, you can expect your screen to become a chaotic exploding mess that drains your life-bar very quickly), and Logic Dive, while kinda neat, felt pretty pointless since hopping through flying lanes with a hoverboard doesn't seem very connected to logic-thinking. The tamagotchi raising game that counted your steps was also kinda lame. The word cutting game is pretty good though.\n\nThe sound-track is good, but not much in my particular opinion. It does it's job, but nothing sticks itself to my mind aside from perhaps the Danganronpa theme-song.\n\nAlso, while the port is solid, it's a bit annoying it doesn't feature a mouse-clicking option for going through menus.

I honestly liked this one better than the first, although that might just be because I was playing it myself. \n\nHOW IS IT: It does everything the first one nailed and more. It has hard and interesting trials with better gameplay, great characters, perfectly unnerving music and chilling ambiance. And The first one was mostly focused on the trials and trying to get out of the school, but the story in Danganronpa 2 is 100x more devastating. There\u2019s so much lore and so much actual plot in addition to the killing school life.\nThis is the kind of game that can toy with your emotions. My actual least favourite character at the beginning was Fuyuhiko because he was rude, grumpy, didn\u2019t care about anyone and was ready to let everyone die. A few chapters later all I want to do is talk to him during free time and he\u2019s my favourite character.\nAnd the boring characters that I didn't like (there were only about 3) were either short lived or evolved and grew as the story went on, EXCEPT FOR  *SPOILERS* [spoiler]  HIYOKO I COULDN'T STAND HER EVEN UNTIL SHE DIED [/spoiler]\nAlso warning it's just as annoying as the first in that your favourite characters WILL DIE, ridiculously crazy plot twists will arise, you'll probably cry a lot if you're me and you'll second guess absolutely everyone. \n\nPROS:\nGameplay\nCharacters\nSoundtrack\nHuge plot\nComplex Trials \nThe setting\nEveryone you love dies\nGraphics\nNAGITO\n\n-\nCONS:\n\nExecutions aren't as unnerving\nMonomi pet gets annoying\nMonomi and Monokuma's english voices are annoying\nHangman's Gambit\nEveryone you love dies\nSlightly confusing intructions\nNAGITO\n\nAnyway everything unfolds perfectly by the end. Coming from someone who isn't an anime fan and hardly plays video games BUY THIS GAME it's worth it. \n\n11/10 would wanna kill nagito again", "timestamp_created": 1486320786, "timestamp_updated": 1486320786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29724973": {"recommendationid": "29724973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012650407", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486317277}, "language": "english", "review": "DanganRONPAUL", "timestamp_created": 1486317414, "timestamp_updated": 1486317414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29716763": {"recommendationid": "29716763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214684839", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503069978}, "language": "koreana", "review": " \ud0ac\ub9c1 \ud0c0\uc784\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uac01\ub0a0 \ub584\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ud2c8\ud2c8\ud788 \ud558\uae30 \uc88b\uc740 \uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1486295828, "timestamp_updated": 1486295828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29707296": {"recommendationid": "29707296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300076022", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487196546}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a really good game, story wise it's around the same as the first game but I found these characters more interesting and likeable.

I also prefer the new monokuma coins system (the way I play games, it really slowed me down to click on every single thing to find coins in the first game) and earning coins through raising pets.

Then you won't been disappointed with the second installment. \n\nArt: 8.5/10 \u2013 The art style feels a little more refined in this installment. The game continues to deliver on many unique character poses like the first. They certainly didn't leave the funky character designs at home for this installment either, lots of crazy characters.\n\nStory: 9/10 -  More excellent murder mysteries delivered in the same context as the first. A vicious school battle show down. There is also a nice twist at the end that you might not see coming.\n\nMusic: 8.5/10- Great like in the first installment, I love Monomi's funky theme along with Monokuma's. The one downside is that there aren't nearly as many new tracks on the sequel so you might get bored with the repeats. \n\nGame Mechanics: 7.5/10-  Great mysteries again. Nice that they changed up the mini games from the first. The only thing that made me angry is being unable to skip some of the minigames. I hate the platformer part and I just wanted to answer the questions without all the bs minigame.\n\n\nPositive: Had to exercise my brain muscles again on the mysteries in this game. Kept me on my toes with twists and turns like the first. I also felt that there was more depth in the characters this time.\n\nNegative: Again I wanted to have multiple endings with different characters.\n", "timestamp_created": 1486010067, "timestamp_updated": 1486010067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29636289": {"recommendationid": "29636289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034439043", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475801939}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1485983492, "timestamp_updated": 1485983492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29631972": {"recommendationid": "29631972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048907324", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485537452}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Acho que vou fazer a primeira review negativa desse jogo em PT-BR mas vamos l\u00e1. Primeiro, N\u00c3O jogue, EM H\u00cdPOTESE ALGUMA, esse jogo se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o jogou Danganronpa 1. Isso vai afetar sua experi\u00eancia e entendimento do jogo de forma bastante relevante. Tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o recomendo essa franquia se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o gosta de anime/mang\u00e1.\n\nEu sabia que DanganRonpa tinha semelhan\u00e7as com um dos meus jogos favoritos, Ace Attorney. Tinha ouvido v\u00e1rias recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es e elogios de amigos a DR, ent\u00e3o, quando saiu na Steam, resolvi comprar os dois jogos numa promo\u00e7\u00e3o. N\u00e3o gostei tanto mas vou come\u00e7ar com os pontos de SDR2 que gostei:\n\n- Minigames dos Class Trials: Apesar de me incomodar um pouco como esse jogo se importa com minigames e inova\u00e7\u00e3o de jogabilidade (sendo uma VN, isso \u00e9 desnecess\u00e1rio, mas ok, tem coisas bem divertidas), achei a maioria dos minigames nos trials apraz\u00edveis, principalmente, na minha opini\u00e3o, o Logic Dive. Eu me entretia nos trials.\n\n- Pet: Bem, eu gostava de ficar olhando o Pet, experimentando os n\u00edveis de esperan\u00e7a e desespero e de ficar andando por a\u00ed para fazer o Pet crescer. Era melhor que fazer a hist\u00f3ria.\n\n- A trilha sonora \u00e9, no geral, muito boa e os gr\u00e1ficos tamb\u00e9m. D\u00e1 pra ver que teve muito empenho nisso.\n\nAgora, os contras:\n\n- Hist\u00f3ria: Segue a mesma ideia do primeiro jogo, s\u00f3 que DR1 tinha uma atmosfera mais s\u00e9ria, com algum fanservice e umas piadinhas. DR2 \u00e9 basicamente um fanservice tentando ser engra\u00e7ado com, \u00e0s vezes, alguns momentos s\u00e9rios, constratando totalmente com a proposta e os fatos in-game. O humor \u00e9 totalmente deslocado, a Monomi e o Monokuma tentando ser dupla de sitcom s\u00e3o simplesmente irritantes e o jogo confia muito que voc\u00ea vai achar divertidas as refer\u00eancias \u00e0 cultura nerd pop oriental e ao jogo anterior. A impress\u00e3o \u00e9 que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o tentou tanto fazer algo engra\u00e7ado que acabou matando o clima do jogo. Os casos n\u00e3o fazem muito sentido e s\u00e3o for\u00e7ados at\u00e9 dizer chega, parece que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o primeiro pensava em \"plot twists muito maneiros que a galera vai pirar\" depois tentava juntar tudo num caso ao inv\u00e9s de montar um caso bom e consistente e a\u00ed pensar em como dificult\u00e1-lo. Todo assassino nesse jogo \u00e9 quase um serial killer, pela forma como planejam as mortes, n\u00e3o \u00e9 nem um pouco compat\u00edvel com a idade/maturidade dos personagens, mesmo considerando o final, [spoiler]mesmo sendo parte do Ultimate Despair e mais velhos, eles ali s\u00e3o apenas os adolescentes que eram antes de entrar em Hope Peak ent\u00e3o realmente n\u00e3o faz nenhum sentido[/spoiler]. At\u00e9 quando matam algu\u00e9m \"no calor do momento\", o esfor\u00e7o que fazem para encobrir a cena do crime \u00e9 t\u00e3o absurdo que n\u00e3o d\u00e1 pra engolir. Se fosse assim em um ou outro caso, at\u00e9 vai, mas em todos? Pelo amor. Por mais que n\u00e3o esteja claro quem \u00e9 o culpado no come\u00e7o, as respostas durante os trials s\u00e3o, na maioria das vezes, f\u00e1ceis de supor, mesmo quando elas n\u00e3o parecem fazer sentido l\u00f3gico no mundo real. O jogo d\u00e1 uma volta toda num papo maluco sobre esperan\u00e7a e desespero para terminar com frase clich\u00ea de anime.\n\n- Di\u00e1logos: Simplesmente p\u00e9ssimos. S\u00e3o mal-escritos (ou mal-traduzidos), desinteressantes, repetitivos e n\u00e3o acrescentam em nada. Quando tentam ser engra\u00e7ados, geralmente falham. O personagem principal faz mon\u00f3logos pregui\u00e7osos quase o tempo todo e quase toda hora tem algu\u00e9m para falar coisas como \"I'll do my best\" ou \"Let's do our best\", enfim, esse papo batido de personagem de anime. Se fosse uma vez ou outra, tudo ok, mas o tempo todo disso \u00e9 extremamente chato. Como \u00e9 tudo mal-escrito ou mal-traduzido, esses di\u00e1logos n\u00e3o servem nem para imers\u00e3o ou para criar qualquer v\u00ednculo com os personagens ou com o jogo. Voc\u00ea facilmente pode terminar esse jogo pulando pelo menos metade das falas e n\u00e3o vai perder nenhuma informa\u00e7\u00e3o importante ou interessante.\n\n- Personagens: Bem, ao longo da hist\u00f3ria principal, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 como desenvolver todos os personagens, j\u00e1 que s\u00e3o muitos, mas, imo, isso n\u00e3o justifica eles ficarem t\u00e3o presos ao esteri\u00f3tipo animesco que representam. Alguns personagens representam esteri\u00f3tipos que parecem paradoxais aos seus respectivos talentos, para prop\u00f3sitos de humor, por\u00e9m, como \u00e9 tudo bastante for\u00e7ado, n\u00e3o tem gra\u00e7a nenhuma. Apenas nos Free Times conseguimos conhec\u00ea-los melhor, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel, jogando apenas uma vez, conhecer todos. Bem, dos Free Times que vi, n\u00e3o havia nada demais nos personagens, eles n\u00e3o eram t\u00e3o interessantes, havendo algumas promissoras exce\u00e7\u00f5es. Mas a maioria \u00e9 irritante, fora que quase todas as personagens femininas parecem ter sido feitas para ser algum tipo de \"waifu\". Uma delas parece existir apenas pelo fanservice. Existe  um maior desenvolvimento de certos personagens, principalmente os que v\u00e3o sobrevivendo mas, no geral, n\u00e3o me convenceu.\n\nTL;DR: Na minha opini\u00e3o, esse jogo parece ter sido feito pensando primeiro no p\u00fablico e, depois, no roteiro ou experi\u00eancia do jogador. Para alguns, tudo isso funciona muito bem e, realmente, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada de errado em gostar de DR. Mas, se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o faz parte desse p\u00fablico ou n\u00e3o gosta desse estilo narrativo, n\u00e3o \u00e9 um jogo muito interessante e o bot\u00e3o CTRL (skip) \u00e9 o seu melhor amigo.", "timestamp_created": 1485968931, "timestamp_updated": 1485991691, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464088", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29626125": {"recommendationid": "29626125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187102897", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500360768}, "language": "english", "review": "This and the original are both masterpieces. 10/10 would feel despair from lack of sleep again.", "timestamp_created": 1485950586, "timestamp_updated": 1485950586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29622172": {"recommendationid": "29622172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317374214", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509611890}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f39\u4e38\u8bba\u7834\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0d\u6127\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u795e\u4f5c\uff0c2\u4ee3\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u6bd41\u4ee3\u6765\u8bf4\u66f4\u52a0\u60ca\u8273\uff0c\u4e00\u6b65\u4e00\u6b65\u5730\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u540e\u7684\u771f\u76f8\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u5341\u5206\u523a\u6fc0\uff0c\u4e5f\u7279\u522b\u559c\u72312\u4ee3\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u4eba\u7269\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u7269\u90fd\u7279\u522b\u559c\u6b22\u554a\uff0c\u671f\u5f853\u4ee3\u6e38\u620f\u65e9\u65e5\u767b\u9646steam\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1485932649, "timestamp_updated": 1485932649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29605692": {"recommendationid": "29605692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309841246", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502185429}, "language": "english", "review": "waiting for v3", "timestamp_created": 1485870000, "timestamp_updated": 1485870000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29598874": {"recommendationid": "29598874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099807178", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488551386}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f39\u4e38\u7cfb\u5217\u771f\u7684\u592a\u68d2\u4e86\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u901a\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ae0\uff0c\u5f88\u671f\u5f85\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\n\u5fc3\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u795e\u4f5c\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1485840302, "timestamp_updated": 1485840302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29587475": {"recommendationid": "29587475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146935545", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503493160}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8865\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u4e0d\u9519", "timestamp_created": 1485791328, "timestamp_updated": 1485791328, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.296522", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29582160": {"recommendationid": "29582160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062301493", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463267040}, "language": "english", "review": "This is coming from a guy that doesn't normally like zany hackneyed anime characters, but in this game I really enjoyed both them and the story -- maybe with a few minor nitpicks.

In my opinion the characters in this title have more variety and some even remind me of characters in Danganronpa 1 (Asahina - Akane). The trials are more difficult and have lots more of gameplay. The main roles are all sympathic and the game has a BIIIIIIG Plotstwist.\nIn my opinion one of the best games that i played but sometimes I had enough from reading so there is no much gameplay. But doesn't care. It's great.

provided.\n\nThis time youre stuck on a tropical Island, and Monokuma is up to his old tricks again.\n\nThe Characters are great once again, youve got your lovable characters, and then you have the characters that cant get killed quickly enough, but seeing how varied peoples favorite characters is, I think they did a really good job.\n\nOnce again, you must kill someone and get away with it to get off the island.\n\nThere are some new minigames, which are decent fun, they \"improved\" Hangmans Gambit, which is now even worse than before, and for non-native english speakers, some of the words can be pretty hard to figure out, as they tend to chose pretty obscure words.\n\nA solid sequel, which again will destroy your emotions with 10 pound of murdering your favorite characters, and leaving you with the feeling of despair, as people get killed again in this Happy Fun Time Island Vacation.\n\nI highly recommend this game to people who arent afraid of darker subject matters, and

Well, guess what?! This game proves those skeptics wrong in a MULTITUDE OF WAYS!\n\nFor those of you who've already played Trigger Happy Havoc, you should have a general idea of what Goodbye Despair is about: Students at the upper-tier Hope's Peak Academy are forced into a Killing Game, where victory is only possible if you kill one of your classmates and not get caught. The difference here? You're on an archipelago called Jabberwock Island, there's a rabbit version of Monokuma that's more obsessed with Hope than Despair, and things got a little bit MORE complicated in terms of gameplay... And all of this is wonderful.\n\nLike the previous game, gameplay is split between three main segments: Daily Life, Deadly Life, and the Class Trial. Daily Life and Deadly Life are more-or-less the same as in Trigger Happy Havoc, however the new mechanic of Hope Fragments as a form of currency to buy skills for the Class Trials AND the addition of the Level System allows for some more diversity than just talking to someone and hope you get either a good skill or a boost to your PP limit. \n\nClass Trials have kept their normal finding the contradictions, hangman's gambit, Bullet-Time-Battle (now called Panic-Talk-Action) and the Closing Argument Recap, but a few newer events appear, alongside revamped versions of previous events: Including the Rebuttal Battle (engage in one-on-one arguments with your classmates to cut through their beliefs with your blades of truth) and the Logic Dive (an obstacle course-like trial in which you evade various obstacles to solve the trickier questions). The new additions, as well as the old spins on the classics, are a welcome bunch to the hectic and dramatic Class Trials.\n\nLastly, but CERTAINLY not least, the characters are phenomenal. While the Trigger Happy Havoc cast were enjoyable, many of them fell into character archetype pitfalls that made them feel predictable. The Goodbye Despair cast, although also being archetypes themselves, feel even more real than compared to the previous cast, each one bringing something new to the table that you probably wouldn't expect, including a few surprising choices like the Ultimate Yakuza and even a returning face nobody really expected (and surprisingly thought they wanted). Of course, Monokuma is in full-swing, and as much as he is a despicable bastard of a bear, he's still too much fun, especially when using his little sister Monomi as a foil.\n\nMy review wouldn't do this game justice, all I can say is that Goodbye Despair is definitely a must-buy for anyone who enjoys mystery, comedy, and above all, enjoyed Trigger Happy Havoc. So, I give this game a 9/10 \"Must Play\" recommendation, and hope you all give it a play. \n\nOtherwise Monokuma has a very special Punishment prepaired just for you!

I was a bit reluctant at first, but this game really is better than the first Danganronpa - even though it was also excellent. The story in itself is kind of similar to the first game, except that the killing game occurs on an island. This is so excellent that I don't even know where to start.\n\nFirst, this game is funny. Yes, even though there are murders, creepy murders and all.. it'll make you laugh. It's all thanks to a certain Monomi. To begin with, put japanese voices ! I don't know how english voices are like, but I can assure you that japanese voices couldn't be better than they already are. In fact, even if the entire cast but Monomi had bad voices - which is not the case, I'd still suggest you to put them. You'll probably understand what I'm talking about as you progress in the game later on.\n\nNow, let's talk about something more important. Is the plot really that good ? Well.. of course it is, but how good is it ? Like I said, Danganronpa 2 really is better than the previous game, in every aspect. I have to warn you, though. Don't play this game if you expect a \"\"realistic\"\" story. You'd better play games where you play the role of a spiky-haired lawyer in blue suit, which fits better your expectations. Just like the first game.. I have my doubts as to whether or not the writers took some illegal drugs before writing the plot. Anyway, if it doesn't bother you, then I can assure you that you will enjoy this story, it can't be otherwise. There are so many good mysteries, murders..\n\nAs for the music, they're not exceptional but still enjoyable. If you've played the first game - and you should because this game is full of spoilers - then you'll probably be happy to rediscover the \"Closing Argument\", a bit better than it already was. In fact, pretty much all sequences from the Class Trials have been improved since the last game, but the Closing Argument is by far my favorite.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a must-read. Don't lose any more time and just take the plunge.\n\nAnd now, New Danganronpa V3 is waiting for me... :-)", "timestamp_created": 1484401322, "timestamp_updated": 1484409023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527931", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29239266": {"recommendationid": "29239266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318340384", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493388832}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u4ecb\u7ecd\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\uff0c\u4e00\u4ee3\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u201c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4eba\u4ec0\u4e48\u90fd\u6ca1\u8bf4\u600e\u4e48\u5c31\u6b7b\u4e86\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u6bd4\u8f83\u5c11\u4e86\u201d\u3002\u672c\u5730\u5316\u505a\u7684\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u90a3\u4e2a\u8f89\u8f89\u8bf4\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u2026\u2026[spoiler]\u731c\u51fa\u6765\u4e2d\u6587\u5316\u4ee5\u540e\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u7684\u6b63\u4f53\u662f\u5565\u6ca1[/spoiler]\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\u2026\u2026\u73ed\u7ea7\u5ba1\u5224\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u73af\u8282\u7684\u8bf4\u660e\u8ddf\u524d\u4ee3\u4e00\u6837\u4e0d\u6e05\u4e0d\u695a\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u516c\u53f8\u5199\u6e38\u620f\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bf4\u660e\u7684\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u8981\u7ed9\u73a9\u5bb6\u571f\u4e0b\u5ea7\u54e6\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1484368006, "timestamp_updated": 1484368006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29237361": {"recommendationid": "29237361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338800424", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504000393}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u770b\u8fc7\u5f39\u4e382\u6765\u88651\u771f\u7684\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u867d\u7136\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b28\u8981\u770b\u653b\u7565", "timestamp_created": 1484358777, "timestamp_updated": 1484358777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29227954": {"recommendationid": "29227954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142049990", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486422963}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing,", "timestamp_created": 1484327601, "timestamp_updated": 1484327601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29227443": {"recommendationid": "29227443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112042987", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500431059}, "language": "english", "review": "This series a favorite of mine.

Now that that is out of the way..\n\nThis game is truly a worthy sequel to Trigger Happy Havoc. The new little mechanics (quick-travel, running, the ability to MOVE THE DAMN CAMERA WHEN YOU HIT \"TAB\" INSTEAD OF BEING LOCKED IN PLACE FOR A SOLID 4 TO 5 SECONDS EVERY TIME) make gameplay much more enjoyable. The courtroom minigames are engaging (though at times near the end of the game, the Revised Hangman's Gambit killed my no-damage streaks... I probably just need to Git Gud) and the new ones are pretty cool! \n\nAs for the characters; wow! What a colorful and cute cast! I was afraid I'd forget half the characters by the time I was done since I'm really quite awful with names, but much to my pleasure, I was able to remember everyone's first and last names, their talents, their personalities, and all that good stuff! (By the way; Chiaki is the only GF that matters. I'll fight anyone that says otherwise.) \n\nAaaaand Monokuma is a lovable pain in the arse as always! The quips and throwbacks to the previous game all really make dealing with his presence again worth it.\n\nThen there's the storyline. I've made my way through a handful of visual novels with crazy twists in them, and this one's twists... Well. I won't say much for fear of spoiling the end, through there is a lot of foreshadowing (and thinking back, it all should have been obvious from the beginning) and the shock factor is constantly raised so every time you think you've hit the climax and you try to breathe for a second it turns out that something more dramatic was lurking right around the corner! I don't cry easily, but my vision got all blurry during the ending credits because my silly self was teary-eyed!\n\nAh, I almost forgot! The other minigames! Island Mode and the Usami side game! Because of these minigames I am still not done playing this game to its completion. I will probably be investing another handful of hours while I try to hunt for achievements (and while I read the included novel; Danganronpa IF!). Not that that's bad!! I am very pleased that this game includes good post-game content. The more hours I can invest in this game; the better.\n\nIn conclusion! If you enjoyed the first game, I can guarantee (with 97.3%* certainty) that you will enjoy its sequel!\n\n(The remaining 2.7% is for the people that may be unsatisfied with the ending since [spoiler]it follows the whole \"it was all a ~dream~ (or in this case; a ~simulation~)\" trope that lots of people see as a cop out, lol[/spoiler].

Amazing storyline with many twists, turns and shocks that are going to leave you on the edge of your seat.\n\n2.At first, unless you've played the previous game, the trials will prove to be quite difficult, especially on the rebuttal \ninstances. The game will get much easier after you get used to the controls and how to play the game.\n\n3. I recomend you play the first game or watch the anime first before you play this game.\n\n4.There is a LOT of reading to do. When i say a lot, i mean, a lot. Unfortunately this is one of the reasons i got bored in certain parts of the game, The storyline is completely worth all of your spent time reading the dialogue.\n\n5. After you complete the game, there is still more to do. You not only get a whole story,which ties into the first one, it's pretty exclusive, beware though, unlike the main story, its all just reading, no artwork or people to look at other than the background. You get several other games to play as well, along with artwork of all the characters, music and a cutscene theater. Of course these cost monokoins(in game currency that you can get through doing certain things throughout the game.)\n\n6, Finally the characters. One of the greatest things about this game is the diverse characters and their personalities. Not to long after starting the game i got attached to the characters and enjoyed seeing them interact with each other.

Nearly every aspect has been downgraded. Some of the characters are more annoying ripoffs of characters from the first game, including what is obviously an older, crazier version of the first game's protagonist and what is literally a character from the first game, but REALLY fat. Some of the new characters are tropey as shown by the pervy cook and the baby face with a napoleon complex. They even introduce a female Monokuma counterpart which simply cries and gives an excuse for monokuma to hit something.\n \nThe new setting feels very sloppily made with the character running animation having lower quality than your average flashgame and foreground art acting like background art when the character walks past it. New gameplay elements are lackluster variations on ideas presented in the first game, including a frustratingly slow paced take on Hangman's Gambit.\n\nDialogue is filled with plodding exposition and internal monologues, which to some extent was a part of the first game, but here much of it feels lazy and unoriginal with people droning on about doing their best and not giving up. It's the kind of dialogue where every character in the room always gets to say one small snippet about doing their best, but in their own words. One of the major twists from the first game is just casually mentioned to everyone and people accept the idea of the killing game pretty quickly, with one character threatening everyone else not long after a motive is set.\n\neven the item system seems to have somehow gotten a downgrade. many of the presents from the first game are still here, but everything has turned 8bit.

It's essentially more of the same, so there's plenty for fans to enjoy, but likely won't convert anyone who didnt like the other game.

I'll split this into chunks:\n\nStory: The main story is a mildly interesting framing device explaining why so many different people (from a jerk of a little girl dancer to a trenchcoat-wearing man who speaks of how evil he is and is utterly devoted to his Four Dark Devas of Destruction-his pet hamsters) have been brought together to try to kill each other to escape. The story reuses some general themes and devices from the first game, and although there's something of a justification in some later-game twists, I would have rather they came up with something more original. The story really shines when it comes to each murder mystery, however; I have never seen mysteries written this well in a game. Even when the answer is obvious, it's usually a trap or things aren't quite what they seem. Attentive players can pick up on some of these thanks to choice foreshadowing and less obvious clues, but plenty caught my trope-overdosed brain by surprise.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay consists two parts: visual novel/investigation segments, with standard \"talk to NPCs, find clues, etc\" that anyone who's played a game in this genre should be familiar with. I have little to say about this save that it's straightforward and doesn't waste your time with much backtracking or pixel hunting for clues. And then there are the trials, the other half of the gameplay, which consist of a mixed bag of mini-games and logic puzzles to determine who killed the latest victim, and these range from excellent (Nonstop Debate) to inexcusible (Panic Talk Action) to perfect in every way (Closing Argument). On the whole, they make for an enjoyable experience, and I have to say no game like this has given me quite the sense of accomplishment that Danganronpa 2 gives when you piece every little bit of the case together and lay every mystery bare to shove it right in the villain's face, all to haunting yet upbeat music.\n\nSound: Voice acting is on point here, even in the dub. Special mention should go to the VAs for Gundham, Nagito, and (SPOILER) for really owning the characters and going the extra mile to drive home the lines. I usually skip ahead in games like this because I read much faster than the characters speak, but I found myself often letting the lines play out with the game's Auto mode. The music is also fantastic, suiting the mood from calm exploration to tense interrogation.\n\nExtras: There's a surprising amount of unlockable content the game hands to you. There's the expected art and sound gallery, along with cutscene theater. However, the game has a few side stories that are completely optional, some of which don't relate to the game at all and expand on the greater universe of the franchise. Unfortunately, these to me felt unimpressive and lackluster compared to how tight and rewarding the base game feels. Although, being able to get everyone's visual novel sections was appreciated.\n\nOn the whole, this game is well worth your money for the core experience. If you like solving mysteries and can roll with the game changing up gameplay with some action in your sleuthing, this game will be absolutely perfect for you.

For those who already played danganronpa 1, let's start by saying what is worse because that list is much shorter. \n\n-->We start with the ambiance of danganronpa 2, which is different than the first game. The game feels much more open because of the size and the way you move between places and islands, that doesn't mean it's worse, but you feel much less claustrophobic which in my opinion is worse because of the nature of the game. \n-->The second aspect of the game which is, again, subjectively worse than the first one is the balance of the characters personalities. the characters are just as good or even better than the first game, but the balancing is off in terms of seriousness, that means the cast become much more silly or serious ( not gonna spoil) and doesnt achiev the same cool balance of the first game.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can go to the pros. The game is absolutely fantastic, you can feel improvments in almost every aspect of the game execpt maybe the tutorials for the minigames of the class trials. The story manages to also impact the story of the first game in a very positive way, shedding light in a lot of elements that the first story left pushed aside. The game immediatly throws you 2 very mysterious characters, that forces you to think about the characters in the first game, and with that you are left with not even knowing if the events of the second game are after or before the events of the first game at the start. This time, in a tropical island, you are going to feel much more connected with the characters because of the better balancing between the plot and the social events, you will feel even more part of the group, and, therefore, feel much more despair as things go ugly. The class trials are better in a lot of ways, the main aspect is the difficulty. The game feels like it knows you played a full game already and its much less kind with the difficulty, making the trials much more challenging in a good way. The minigames are, imo, better but still it's subjective, aside from that, the trial shows quality of life improvments, only the tutorials are bad.\n\nTLDR: the game is better in almost all aspects but the ambiance is less claustrophobic and the cast has problems with the personalities balancing throughout the story. Overall, the game is a must have for who played danganronpa 1 for sure, and the majority will probably like the second game even more.", "timestamp_created": 1483397112, "timestamp_updated": 1483397112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28928934": {"recommendationid": "28928934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071240414", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483391993}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite character died.\n0/10 \nWorst game ever\n\n\nBut in all seriousness this is one of the most enjoyable games that I have ever played.  After making the fatal mistake of only watching the first season of Danganronpa, I did not have high hopes for this game.  However, after my roughly 30 playthrough, I am extremely happy that I was able to experience this.  I liked the cast of DR2 much more than the original DR.  I actually felt upset on multiple occasions when characters were killed off unlike the first season (again, this is probably because I only watched the first season, but I felt it's worth mentioning).  There were many brain-wracking moments that had me constantly coming back to the game, no matter how much I struggled at some points.  \n\n\nAs a story/experience, this game would probably fall into my top 5 games: however the one gripe I have with this game is that I do not see any replayability value in it other than achievement hunting.  Whether or not this plays a heavy role on your decision to buy this game is up to you, but I highly recommend that you get this game, regarldess of the replayability!\n\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied that I played this game, and I cannot wait to start watching DR3!", "timestamp_created": 1483335421, "timestamp_updated": 1483335421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28894511": {"recommendationid": "28894511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133533507", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483453358}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc815\ub9d0 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud588\ub358 \uadf8 \uc5b4\ub290 \ucd94\ub9ac\uac8c\uc784\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub3c4 \ud0c4\ud0c4\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\ubbf8 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1483257252, "timestamp_updated": 1483257252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28893997": {"recommendationid": "28893997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047690181", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 3215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507713015}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of the most memorable games I've ever played.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1483255540, "timestamp_updated": 1483255540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495458", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28876224": {"recommendationid": "28876224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064296791", "num_games_owned": 471, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483423271}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u52a8\u753b \u6e38\u620f \u5c0f\u8bf4 \u6f2b\u753b \u4e3b\u673a \u638c\u673a\u4e00\u6761\u9f99\n\u4ec0\u4e48?  \u4f60\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5e93\u91cc\u5c45\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f?\n\u771f\u662f\u7edd\u671b\u554a \u6ca1\u6709\u5f39\u4e38\u7684\u4f60\u5c31\u8ddf\u6ca1\u6709\u624d\u80fd\u7684\u666e\u901a\u4eba\u4e00\u6837", "timestamp_created": 1483205589, "timestamp_updated": 1483205589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705423", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28871838": {"recommendationid": "28871838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253260479", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 360, "last_played": 1514810440}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc815\ub9d0 \uba4b\uc9c4\uac8c\uc784 \uc784\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1483197123, "timestamp_updated": 1483197123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28814823": {"recommendationid": "28814823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097744677", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484007458}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Mist\u00e9rios complexos, pistas as quais voc\u00ea n\u00e3o via a revel\u00e2ncia e debates recheados de solu\u00e7\u00e3o e mini-games.\n\nDanganronpa 2 \u00e9 surpreendente e n\u00e3o deixou nada a desejar ao antecessor.

That's why I loved the first Danganronpa game as it fufilled that and even more, but Danganronpa 2 takes what the first game built on a takes to a whole new level of despair and hope. I honestly never really expected for a PS Vita game to make to the Steam store, let alone for it to one the best ports out there as you can hardly tell that it was originally on another game system, unlike some ports. COUGH! COUGH! Tale of Symphonia. COUGH! COUGH! This game is great for those who love game like Ace Attorney, but want a little more than a visual novel with no gameplay mechanics that couldn't be done by a 3 legged turtle. It's also nice that it has a difficultly setting so you do not have to worry about being too stupid or not being able to use logic like you want to, and before you say I'm calling anyone except myself an idiot, I am directing this comment at myself. I can be very stupid at times and an essential idiot handicap is almost always appericiated with me because I do not know when my moments of sheer \"why isn't my brain thinking the bestest\" will happen. Now while it is not necessary to play the first game and be able to understand this game's story, I would highly recommend playing the first game before this one as it will make the storyline the last few chapters a LOT more clearer. Playing the first game is also a good way to understand if you really will like this game as the game mechanics are a bit easier to learn and you'll get an idea of what you're getting into by the end of the first trial. It's really incredible though because *insert spoiler here*! Overall, if you're looking for a good visual style novel to get into on your day off or you'd like something that'll make you question the state of the world and why aren't you doing anything about in the wee hours of the night, then Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair (and goodbye any peaceful dreams after beating it) is your horror story to play through!", "timestamp_created": 1480432505, "timestamp_updated": 1480432505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28055713": {"recommendationid": "28055713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119335732", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472669902}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy watching your favourite characters die one at a time.

Danganronpa. One of my absolute FAVOURITE series.\n\nI have absolutely LOVED this series since I first watched the fan translation of Danganronpa on youtube. Mind you, this was WAY before an official English game was announced.\n\nOn Danganronpa, I explained my feelings on the anime and English VA. Compared to the cast of DR, I don't mind the VA for DR2. I feel they're much better, but I still much prefer the Japanese VA. There's more emotion put in than the first, but it still just doesn't compare to the Japanese VA.\n\nOne example is a scene in the first trial. One of the characters has a bit of a psychotic moment, laughing maniacally. Watching the scene in Japanese just blew me away.  The moment I watched the same scene, but in English, I felt so... underwhelmed. They just... sounded like they were trying to laugh with a sore throat. It just... I couldn't continue.\n\nYet again, as much as I love this game, the downfall for me is the English voices.

Every person you meet in the game has a unique personality that you either hate or love which makes them kinda realistic in my opinion. The story has the same premise as the first game, while still providing the player new informations about the world that Danganronpa takes place. Also, did I mention the plot twist at the end? What else makes this game awsome? Oh yes, the music. Every song has a vibe which conveys a feeling perfectly matching with the scenes they are paired with. The visuals are also gorgeous, well drawn, and stylish. \nOverall Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is a fun game with loads of stuff to do (after you finish the game new gamemodes appear), loads of chracters you can love, fantastic storytelling and catchy music, with only one problem of the puzzles sometimes making no sense or somebody being just too anoying.

If you're a fan of detective-type games, you'll surely love this. At first glance, it really doesn't seem like anything too special, but the more you play it, you get wrapped into it and get even more entranced with the story. While the gameplay isn't anything too special, it's quite unique in its own way as well. \nThis game is quite lengthy, so, if you do get it, make sure to set some time in your schedule to get in at least one chapter. In my playthrough, each chapter was roughly 11 hours, including the 5 or 6 hours of the trial at the end of each chapter. The trials in this game are even better than the first as well, for they touch up a bit more on the debates and even introduced some new mechanics on top of the old ones that the previous game gave us, and even revised some of the older mechanics.\nThe music of this game is amazing, but if you're not a fan of the musical style, you may end up getting tired of the same loop you hear in the various areas of the game.\nThis is probably my most favorite game I've ever played, because it worked itself inside of my very being, and struck the heart strings that games generally cannot reach inside of me.\n", "timestamp_created": 1479968465, "timestamp_updated": 1479968465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0,

That is, kill someone and then not get caught in the class trial. In terms of the murder mysteries that occur, think Ace Attorney on LSD. Especially with the final murder.\n\nI feel like I'm just copying and pasting my review of the first game, but the gameplay really hasn't changed at all, and it didn't need to because the narrative and characters were what you played it for. And, really, this game does both of those well.\n\nThe characters in this game are (almost) all better than the first game's cast (my avatar may give an indicator as to potential exceptions), and this makes up for the story not being quite as good. Where the first game had people concentrating on trying to get out of their enclosed space, this one is focussing on them trying to figure out who among them is a traitor. As such the narrative really revolves around the character interactions a lot more, which isn't a problem because the characters are all that much better, but it leads to moments of frustration when none of them are trying to figure out an escape.\n\nIn between the trials, investigations, and compulsory narrative, you get to spend your time talking to whichever characters you want to. This really brings out the depth in all the characters, but because of everyone's poor survival chances, it makes the game harder to deal with. Especially when in two consecutive chapters they killed off my four favourite characters. And they become your favourite because you spent gametime with them that could've been spent with anyone else, and now they're gone. Though, like the first game, the postgame is quite a nice conclusion despite the torment it put you through.\n\nNominated for the \"I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye\" Award.\nHonourable mention for being nominated for the \"Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!\" Award, just because of everything.

After playing the original game I naturally had a set of expectations going into the sequel. This game exceeded my expectations for a great sequel and as a result I think the sequel is better crafted than the original game.\n\nFirst off, I think the sequel has a better written story that is just as engaging if not more engaging than the story in the first game. Not only is the overall story better, the cases are so much more complex and better written than the cases in the first game and as a result they feel more satisfying to solve. I also think the sequel has an overall better cast of characters because most of them have character development outside of filling out of their report cards and I became more attached to these characters as a result.\n\nSecondly, I think the second game has a better set of minigames than the first. There are returning minigames that have been improved such as the Nonstop Debate, M.T.B Battles which now go under the name P.T.A, The Closing Argument, and Hangman's Gambit which feel more satisfying to complete than the versions in the first game. The two new minigames go under the names Rebuttal Showdown and Logic Dive. In Rebuttal Showdown a character will usually object towards one of your statements and come up with an argument of their own. You must cut through their words and come up with a counter argument which will prove that they are incorrect. In Logic Dive you must surf through a matrix obstacle course and answer a series of questions and piece them together to form an answer which will help move the case forward. Both of these minigames are very fun and satisfying to complete.\n\nThirdly, I love how much more expansive the island of Danganronpa 2 is compared to the high school enviroment of Danganronpa 1. I also think that Danganronpa 2 is more visually appealing because of the more varied enviroments of the individual islands. I also like the small features that they added like the ability to raise different kinds of virtual pets, hidden monokumas in each chapter, and Island Mode a mode which is a what if game mode where no murders happen and you can get different endings for each character. As a result this gives Danganronpa 2 a lot of replay value.\n\nLastly, Danganronpa 2 still has an amazing soundtrack which plays in all the right moments and overall has a better sound than Danganronpa 1.\n\nOverall, Danganronpa 2 is an amazing sequel which I think surpasses the original in every way. 10/10 one of my favorite video game sequels.", "timestamp_created": 1478752334, "timestamp_updated": 1478752334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26501415": {"recommendationid": "26501415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048044770", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480445176}, "language": "english", "review": "Nagito did nothing wrong.", "timestamp_created": 1478688138, "timestamp_updated": 1480014249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26497167": {"recommendationid": "26497167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134827240", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495610228}, "language": "english", "review": "As expected another great game ! if you like the first Danganronpa you will definatly like the second as well.

happy havoc because I watched the anime already) and man was I in for a ride. At first I was a little skeptical about the trials of the game and how difficult they would be to figure out. For every trial I thought I knew who the killer was, but I turned out to be wrong for all but one of them. As for the story it was unexpectedly of the highest quality, it contained crazy yet reasonable plot twists and dark yet meaningful themes. The characters were very well developed and I found myself being attached to many of them which made things quite emotional for me as this is obviously a game where many people die. Despite the tragic content of the game, I found that the inclusion of humor helped supplement my desire to play it even more as it added more diversity too it. After I finished I even found myself desperate to find more danganropa content. I watched the new danganropa anime and spent hours trying to find info on the new game that is to be released in january 2017 on ps4 in Japan. In other words it was extremely addicting :)\n\nFinal Verdict: 8.5/10 (Extremely high quality and addictive)", "timestamp_created": 1478287535, "timestamp_updated": 1478287535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26418880": {"recommendationid": "26418880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092976375", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476452779}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u809d\u4e86\u4e09\u5929\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f458\u5c0f\u65f6\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u7edd\u671b\u4e86\u3002\u6211\u73a9\u6e38\u620f\u5411\u6765\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u770b\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u5bf9galgame\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u5174\u8da3\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u73a9\u4e0d\u591a\u3002\u4f46\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u6ca1\u6253\u8fc7\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u770b\u5230\u6e38\u620f\u5267\u60c5\u8fd9\u4e48\u66b4\u8d70\uff0c\u7f16\u5267\u4e0d\u505c\u6316\u5751\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5751\u8fd8\u662f\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u7ae0\u624d\u6316\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u4e24\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u5267\u60c5\u6765\u586b\u4e0a\u7684\u3002\n\n\u7cfb\u5217\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u6211\u662f\u5728NDS\u4e0a\u73a9\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b9e\u5728\u809d\u4e0d\u52a8\u6240\u4ee5\u5f53\u65f6\u53ea\u6253\u4e86\u4e00\u534a\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u662f\u9760\u52a8\u753b\u8865\u4e0a\u7684\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u7adf\u7136\u5c31\u4e0d\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u51fa\u4e86\u4e8c\u4ee3\u7684\u524d\u4f20\u548c\u540e\u7bc7\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u52fe\u7ed3G\u80d6\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u753b\u64ad\u653e\u671f\u95f4\u6253\u8d77\u4e86\u6298\u3002\u8fd9\u62db\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u592aTM \u9ad8\u660e\u4e86\uff0c\u6211\u4e70\u8fd8\u4e0d\u884c\u5417\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\n\u5267\u60c5\u662f\u8111\u6d1e\u5411\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u522b\u6307\u671b\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u4ec0\u4e48\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u54f2\u7406\u548c\u4eba\u751f\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff0c\u8981\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bf7\u51fa\u95e8\u5de6\u8f6c\u627eCLANNAD\u3002\n\n\u6574\u4eba\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u5b66\u7ea7\u88c1\u5224\u7b80\u76f4\u8ba9\u4eba\u7edd\u671b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0a\u591a\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5f88\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f60\u662f\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6ca1\u770b\u61c2\u6e38\u620f\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6e38\u620f\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86\uff0c\u5f53\u4f60\u60f3\u56de\u5934\u770b\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u624d\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u73af\u8282\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u80fd\u770b\u56de\u770b\u804a\u5929\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u50cf\u6e38\u620f\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u8bbe\u5b9a\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u201c\u4f60\u4f53\u9a8c\u8fc7\u7edd\u671b\u5417\uff1f\u201d\n\n\u4f60\u8981\u95ee\u6211\u6ecb\u4e0d\u6ecb\u74f7\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u662f\u6ecb\u74f7\u7684\u3002\u5e73\u65f6\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b8c\uff0c\u5f88\u7d2f\uff0c\u518d\u6765\u4e24\u76d8dota\u7b80\u76f4\u662f\u627e\u8650\u3002GAL\u6700\u5927\u7684\u597d\u5904\u5728\u4e8e\u6253\u8d77\u6765\u8f7b\u677e\uff0c\u6740\u6740\u65f6\u95f4\u3002[spoiler] \u53cd\u6b63\u6211\u53c8\u6ca1\u5973\u670b\u53cb[/spoiler]\n\n\u7565\u6709\u626f\u8fdc\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8fd8\u662f\u63a8\u8350\u4e00\u4e0b\u5f39\u4e38\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6e38\u620f\u54c1\u8d28\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u5728GAL\u4e2d\u5c5e\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e58\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u4e5f\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8bf4\u4e00\u4e2a\u624b\u67c4\u4e00\u4e2aA\u952e\u6309\u5230\u5e95\uff0c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u8282\u594f\uff0c\u4f18\u8d28\u7684\u7acb\u7ed8\uff0c\u6070\u5230\u597d\u5904\u7684BGM\uff0c\u518d\u52a0\u4e0a\u58f0\u4f18\u7684\u5356\u529b\u6f14\u51fa\u52a0\u6301\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u52a8\u753b\u98df\u7528\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f73\u5728\u3002\n\nGAL\u4e2d\uff0c10\u5206\u6ee1\u5206\u6211\u80fd\u7ed9\u4e2a8.5\u5206\u3002\n\n[spoiler] \u6700\u540e\u7684\u6700\u540e\u2014\u2014\u6211\u8981\u7acb\u5fd7\u6210\u4e3a\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7ea7\u7684\u80d6\u6b21\u6536\u85cf\u5bb6\uff01[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1478277096, "timestamp_updated": 1478277432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26416339": {"recommendationid": "26416339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021358923", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477743971}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked Phoenix Wright, you'll probably enjoy this. If you liked Danganronpa 1, you'll enjoy this even more.\n\nThe plot is even more fucked up and amazing than in the previous game. Very linear, which is a tad annoying at times, but overall linearity didn't feel like a detriment to the game.\nTrials, which are the most fun part of the game, feel tense and powerful.\nDon't expect very complex gameplay, it's a visual novel after all. However, gameplay in the sequel has expanded upon the original.\nMusic is great in my opinion, I enjoyed it a lot. Same goes for the characters.\nVoice acting is mostly limited to cutscenes and trials, the quality of it is on par.\nAlso, the game is pretty long. A single chapter can take as long as 5 hours. However it's not required to sit through a chapter in one sitting, the game does an alright job splitting chapters into segments.", "timestamp_created": 1478267366, "timestamp_updated": 1478267366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26415359": {"recommendationid": "26415359", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986913231", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461527330}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1] \u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0432 Steam[/h1]\n\n\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. \u041d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044b, \u0448\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438, \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442, \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f. \u0422\u044b \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0436\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0432 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d, \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u0438\u0437 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044e \u0441 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430. \u041f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044c \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0443. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0436\u0435 \u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442, \u0442\u043e \u044f \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0443 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f, \u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u044e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0438 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043c \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f\u043c \"\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044b\" \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1478263233, "timestamp_updated": 1478263233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26404474": {"recommendationid": "26404474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060274390", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475077787}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

En un principio se nos dice que estamos de \"viaje escolar para hacernos amigos y conocernos mejor\" pero como podr\u00e9is esperar con la aparici\u00f3n de Monokuma se le da la vuelta al asunto y el feliz viaje se convierte en un terrible juego de asesinos donde solo el ganador podr\u00e1 abandonar la isla.\n\nAl estar atrapados en una isla desierta y no en una escuela, nos da la oportunidad de poder visitar gran variedad de escenarios donde podr\u00e1n ocurrir todo tipo de eventos, investigando la isla en busca de una salida, podremos ver desde un resort hasta una base militar pasando por un gran n\u00famero de escenarios de todo tipo. Los nuevos y carism\u00e1ticos personajes aportan a\u00fan m\u00e1s diversidad al juego ya que cada uno es diferente y no hay dos personas con la misma personalidad y/o el mismo car\u00e1cter. Incluyendo los asesinatos que cada uno es m\u00e1s curioso y misterioso que el anterior.\n\nLa banda sonora tambi\u00e9n ha mejorado lo suyo aportando nuevas y fant\u00e1sticas canciones (Como por ejemplo \"Ekoroshia\" ) y a\u00f1adiendo varias del primer juego con peque\u00f1os cambios (Ejemplo: Re_Trial Underground) que van a la perfecci\u00f3n con las diversas situaciones en las que nos encontramos en el juego.\n\nOtro aspecto que hay que destacar son los nuevos \"minijuegos\" o \"puzles\" de los Class Trial. Como por ejemplo \"Rebuttal Showdown\" o \"Logic Dive\" que le dan variedad al juego y te ayudan a resolver mejor el caso e interactuar con las opiniones y los argumentos de los dem\u00e1s personajes para llegar a resolver el caso. Tambi\u00e9n podemos ver que han mejorado algunos aspectos de los minijuegos con respecto al primer juego. \n\n---------------------\n\n(Esto es opini\u00f3n 100% pura y dura x'D)\n\nTodo lo bueno tambi\u00e9n tiene cosas malas... En mi opini\u00f3n aunque el juego me parece bastante mejor que el primero aun se podr\u00edan pulir varias cositas, principalmente el minijuego de \"The Hangman's Gambit\" ya que han dado un paso atr\u00e1s y no me gusta su funcionamiento ya que si te descuidas un segundo la pantalla se te llena de letras que al chocar unas con otras te bajan la vida de forma considerable. (Gran parte de mis Game Over han sido por este minijuego x'D).\n\nOtra cosa que no me acaba de gustar es el minijuego de la mascota de Monomi, siendo sincera no est\u00e1 mal pero lo veo totalmente in\u00fatil ya que no te aporta nada a la historia y con \u00e9l solo te dan varios logros en steam (si mal no recuerdo).\n\nPara finalizar quiero a\u00f1adir que he disfrutado much\u00edsimo el juego y que lo recomiendo much\u00edsimo. Al finalizarlo tambi\u00e9n recomiendo ver los animes \"Danganronpa 3: Future/Desepair Arc\" ya que ayudan a entender m\u00e1s la historia y complementan varios aspectos y eventos que se mencionan en este juego.\n", "timestamp_created": 1476980255, "timestamp_updated": 1476980255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26125035": {"recommendationid": "26125035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159057244", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483518581}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u771f\u5fc3\u597d\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u622a\u4e86500\u591a\u5f20\u56fe\uff08\u6ed1\u7a3d", "timestamp_created": 1476939503, "timestamp_updated": 1476939503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26122205": {"recommendationid": "26122205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308851489", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490997675}, "language": "czech", "review": "it has teruteru\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/10 would play agen", "timestamp_created": 1476917289, "timestamp_updated": 1476917289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26117030": {"recommendationid": "26117030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047775535", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477036678}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u795e\u4f5c \u7121\u8ad6\u662f1\u4ee3\u9084\u662f2\u4ee3 \u5287\u60c5\u90fd\u662f\u4e00\u6d41 \u8a2d\u60f3\u5927\u81bd \u63a8\u7406\u904e\u7a0b\u7cbe\u91c7\n\u89d2\u8272\u6211\u662f\u5169\u4ee3\u90fd\u559c\u6b61 \u6700\u611b\u72db\u679d!! \u5927\u63a8!!", "timestamp_created": 1476893112, "timestamp_updated": 1476893112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26115994": {"recommendationid": "26115994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238571144", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511413557}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8d30\u5927\u90a3\u9b3c\u755c\u7684\u7b11\u58f0\u50cf\u6781\u4e86\u91d1\u9986\u957f\u771f\u53d7\u4e0d\u9e1f\u554a\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\n\u73a9\u5b8c\u518d\u505a\u6df1\u5165\u8bc4\u6d4b", "timestamp_created": 1476888590, "timestamp_updated": 1476888590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500964", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26114212": {"recommendationid": "26114212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004754662", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476885589}, "language": "english", "review": "\"I cannot belive that mere humans could produce such an Masterpiece of Art.

Testing ...\nHello boys and girls! It is time for a review!\n\nMy first one, actually ... weird ...\n\nAnyway, to simply put my upcoming statements and opinions into a simple sentence:\n[h1]Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is an amazing game ... but only for the group of people who would be interested in playing it.[/h1]\n\nSure Sure Sure, that sounds like the same thing you should say for any game, right? However, I find that that is very true of this particular game. This game can be very selective on who would, and wouldn't, enjoy it. I do believe that anyone can pick up, play this game, and completely enjoy everything about it, even though they don't normally like the kind of games that DR2GD (that's short for Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair) is in the same category of, but this game still isn't the perfect game that would appeal to all of the people! However, it is safe to say that if you like games with a lot of mystery and solving those mysteries (Like Ace Attorney games and whatnot) then you'll like this one mainly because that is the biggest and most defining element for this game series ... except for one of the games in the series, but you won't find that game on Steam! Yet! ... maybe  ... puhuhuhuhuhuuuuu!\n\n[b]PREREQUISITES[/b]\n\nFirst of all, you [b]HAVE[/b] to play the first game: Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc!\nIt is equally amazing and sets the stage for a lot of what happens in this game. I mean, this game is the [u]SEQUEL[/u] to that game! So, go give Danganronpa 1 a shot before going into this game. If you don't like Danganronpa 1 for its [u]story-telling[/u], [u]gameplay[/u], [u]overall design[/u], or WHATEVER, then this game may not be for you. It will build off of the things that you hated in the first one, so it may be just more of what you hate.\n\nGot it? Alright! If you've played the first Danganronpa, and/or are curious about whether the game is a worthy successor to the first one and/or a good game in general and/or just kinda bored and thought you'de go on a steam-review-reading-frenzy because ... well I don't know ... you're bored or something? ... then buckle up and get ready to FEEL DESPAIR!\nI mean ... read the review! Yeah ... that ...\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\n\nI am NOT going to spoil the story for DR2GD for two reasons:\n[olist]\n[*]If I spoiled the game, why would you want to play it?\n[*]IT WOULD TAKE WAY TO LONG TO SAY THE ENTIRE STORY AT CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT ON A MONDAY! I AM NOT PREPARED FOR THAT KIND OF COMMITMENT!\n[/olist]\n\nI can, however, summarize the basic gist of the story so that you know what you are in for. If you've played the first Danganronpa game, then you know what is basically going to happen:\n[list]\n[*]You are boy.\n[*]You wake up on strange island with a class of people you have never met before.\n[*]Everything seems strange and unsettling, but soon becomes sunshine and rainbows!\n[*]The future seems hopeful and the other people on the island seem nice.\n[*]PSYCH!\n[*]You and your friends are now apart of a horrible game where everyone is forced to try to kill eachother without getting caught by a trial run by that same group of friends.\n[*]You are the main boy who plays a large role in helping to catch the killer, or the \"blackened\" as a certain stuffed-bear in the game calls them.\n[*]Everything pretty much goes downhill from there.\n[/list]\n\nThe story is kinda sad, honestly. You spend a lot of time getting to know these characters, whom you know as your friends, only to end up watching them die at the hands of the people you still feel are your friends. It really bums you out! I would feel slightly depressed from all of the stuff that happens in the game, and a lot of that depressing stuff is in the form of horrible murders that you have to investigate and then have to pin on one of your friends with evidence! However, all of this sadness plays into the bigger parts of the story, and makes the ending feel amazing to witness. In order to know how the game ends, you have to beat the game ... after you beat the first one too ... because it's all one intertwined mess ... AND I LOVE IT!\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\n\nThe main game is split into two styles: Daily Life and Deadly Life.\nDaily Life is when you can walk around the island and talk to the other students! You can use these opportunities to give them gifts that you can buy with coins that you collect from [u]PLAYING THE GAME[/u]! By giving characters gifts, you can become closer to them, and learn more information about them. A lot of these characters are very interesting, so I think you'll find at least one person that you'de like to get to know better! However, becoming friends with characters DOES NOT CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE MURDERS! You may end up becoming friends with someone who gets killed or is the killer! Your heart may be broken by this, and it sucks! You'll sometimes be trying to get to know everything about someone to get an achievment or just to know them as another character, BUT THEY'LL DIE BEFORE YOU EVEN GET THE CHANCE!\nSpoiler about this game mechanic: [spoiler] I beat the game on the hardest difficulty and was able to unlock Island Mode, which is basically just Daily Life forever, AND NOBODY DIES so you can become friends with everyone! [/spoiler]\n\nThe second part of the gameplay is the Deadly Life. Deadly Life is the investigation part that happens after a body has been discovered. You will look for clues and then participate in a class trial to find the true killer! Finding evidence involves [i]some[/i] walking around, but is mostly just pointing and clicking things in rooms that pertain to the case. The class trail is a bunch of minigames that revolve around everyone trying to answer questions about the case, defend themselves, or piece together the events of the case. Most of this is also pointing and clicking, but there are sometimes word-puzzles, multiple choice questions, a platformer-decision-making minigame, and rhythm games.\n\nThis game involves a lot of clicking. You will sometimes use the keyboard to get to the main menu and walk around, but most of the game is clicking.\n\nAnother big part of the game is reading! Please be able to read when playing this game! ALSO BE READY TO SIT THROUGH A LOT OF DIALOGUE! If you are the kind of person who hates cutscenes and would rather play the game, ignore the urge to skip through text. THE DIALOGUE IS IMPORTANT! It conveys the story and gives clues to what the evidence means and how it can relate to the case! There are also sounds, and sometimes entire lines have voice overs for them, so be ready to hear a lot of \"hmms\" and \"HEY BASTARD\"s and \"I see ...\"s and \"YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE\"s during your playtime.\n\nThe sounds are actually pretty good, I must say ...\n\n[b]E V E R Y T H I N G - E L S E[/b]\n\nUhh ... listen ... this game is just good ...\nIf you like mild horror and a lot of suspense and thrills: Play this game.\nIf you enjoy mystery based games: Play this game.\nIf you played the first game and loved that game to pieces: Play this game.\nIf you got two hands and one has a plate of cookies on it and the cookies are made of $100 bills: Let me have some of those \"cookies\", buy this game, and then play this game.\n\nThis is the part of my first review where I get really tired and rethink my life choices ...\nI might revisit this review to \"finish\" it ... but not right now ... becuase sleep ... and boredom ...", "timestamp_created": 1476766853, "timestamp_updated": 1476769969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504016", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26096229": {"recommendationid": "26096229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264304164", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490837122}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good.", "timestamp_created": 1476762575, "timestamp_updated": 1476762575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496032", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26092369": {"recommendationid": "26092369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022456064", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469597393}, "language": "english", "review": "Well if you played the first Danganronpa, chances are you are gonna love this sequel even more IMO.

The story is just as interesting and engaging as it was in the first game, possibly even more so, and the twists will keep you on your toes the entire time.

So I decided to make an [i] actual [/i] review this time. In the last one I only said that the game's freaking good - which is true, but probably wouldn't convince anyone to actually play it. So yup, making a new one.\n\nSo, why is Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair so good? If you've played the first one, you already know what the game is like. Investigation. Friendship. Murder. Yup, pretty much all that repeats in DR2. And yet, this one is even better than the first. The characters are so unique here. Your (Hajime's) interactions with them and their interactions with each other are so meaningful, and everything is just so real. When one of them dies, you kind of feel like a part of you have died too. You really are able to form a [b] bond [/b] with all of them.\n\nIIIIf amazing & unique characters aren't enough for you, well, I must also say that the cases are REALLY interesting and full of amazing plot twists in DR2. Even when you think you know what's going on, even when you think you know everything that is going to happen, BOOOOM PLOTWIST! Sometimes, the character you love the most will be the killer - Sometimes they will be the victim. That's just how it is here. \n\nI need to mention that the soundtrack is aaaaamaaaaaazing as well. It can change the mood completely. The characters' voice fit their personalities perfectly, too. There are some memorable laughs ([spoiler] Komaeda <3 Mikan <3 [/spoiler]) and speeches that are sure to stay in your head.\n\nDamn, this game is awesome. It's worth every penny.

Overall, I highly recommend this game to people who enjoyed the original.", "timestamp_created": 1475807310, "timestamp_updated": 1475807310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481276", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25894167": {"recommendationid": "25894167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005346937", "num_games_owned": 549, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 2208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475801050}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1475801075, "timestamp_updated": 1475801075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25894136": {"recommendationid": "25894136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111740112", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475726041}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u96be\u5ea6\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8bf4\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u8fdc\u5f3a\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u8fde\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u4e00\u5171\u7528\u4e86\u5927\u698250\u5c0f\u65f6\u901a\u5173\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u5267\u60c5\u54e6\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u6ca1\u53bb\u78b0\u65e5\u5e38\u4ea4\u53cb\u6a21\u5f0f0.0\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u5ea6\u4e5f\u6709\u4e9b\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u6e38\u620f\u5e94\u8be5\u63a8\u7406\u7231\u597d\u8005\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e5\u6f2b\u7231\u597d\u8005\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u7231\u597d\u8005\uff0c\u4e00\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7cfb\u5217\u6253\u6298\u4e86\uff0c\u5c31\u8fc5\u901f\u5165\u624b\u4e86\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u7b2c\u56db\u7ae0\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u96be\u61c2\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\u5f97\u90fd\u5f80\u5f80\u5ba1\u5224\u524d\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u6a21\u7cca\u731c\u51fa\u51f6\u624b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\u51f6\u624b\u8981\u4e0d\u5168\u7a0b\u4e0d\u8bf4\u8bdd\uff01\uff01\uff01\u8981\u4e0d\u4ed6\u5c31\u778eBB\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\u8fd9\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8~\u5f53\u7136\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5c31\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u5ea6\u660e\u663e\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5f53\u7136\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u4e5f\u660e\u663e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5267\u60c5\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u662f\u6211\u6b23\u8d4f\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u6211\u79c9\u7740\u8ba4\u771f\u8d1f\u8d23\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u628aB\u7ad9\u4e0a\u5f39\u4e383\u7edd\u671b\u548c\u672a\u6765\u770b\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u5b8c\u5168\u6210\u4e3a\u8be5\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u7c89\u3002\u63a8\u8350\u5927\u5bb6\u5148\u73a9\u6e38\u620f\u518d\u770b\u52a8\u6f2b\uff0c1\u90e8\uff0c2\u90e8\uff0c\u7edd\u671b\u7bc7\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7bc7\u8fd9\u4e48\u770b\uff0c\u7edd\u5bf9\u7edd\u671b\u5c11\u5973\u6211\u662f\u6ca1\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u7f51\u4e0a\u8d44\u6e90\u4fe1\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u6015\u75c5\u6bd2Oez\n\n\n\u6700\u540e\u8bf4\u4e00\u53e5\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u4e03\u6d77\u515a\uff0c\u76fe\u5b50\u515a\u4f60\u7b49\u7740\uff01\uff01\u4f60\u4e2b\u522b\u8dd1", "timestamp_created": 1475800896, "timestamp_updated": 1475800896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514349", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25890889": {"recommendationid": "25890889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012829728", "num_games_owned": 697, "num_reviews": 215, "playtime_forever": 1847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475719519}, "language": "english", "review": "A flawless sequel to the original game with quite a few improvements. 2 new gamemodes for the trials, 1 of them is shit and the other is good, also including \"improved\" versions of older gamemodes(Hangman's Gambit is still shit).

"last_played": 1475386188}, "language": "english", "review": "Where do I start with this game..  At first it felt like a thoughtless sequel that attempts to copy the original while trying to make everything bigger and better. You thought some characters in the first game were too exaggerated/comical? Now [i]every[/i] character is a silly caricature. You thought the first story was stupid at times? Now it's completely off the charts and abandons all realism. The world is bigger, there're more trial mini-games and now there're time-wasting mini-games even outside of trials. The murders are even more convoluted and at times don't make any sense whatsoever.  Halfway through the game I was almost ready to leave it unfinished and uninstall it, so frustrated I was with it.  \n\nBut despite all I decided to complete it for the sake of completion. I arrived at the last chapter and suddenly things got interesting again. And then suddenly everything started to make sense. And then suddenly it was 6am because I spent all night playing. \nLooking back most grievances I've had with the game make complete sense within the story now that I have the big picture. In fact, it's very difficult to view them as grievances at all anymore. Was the twist worth the frustration? It kind of was, the ending was very satisfying. It was probably also partly my fault not to see the twist coming and to just assume that the writers are stupid. \nThat being said, the point about the trials still stands.

best game I've in a long time. I try to play games from every genre so I can discover new game elements that I really enjoy, and therefore better determine which games I should and shouldn't buy. While I have enjoyed playing visual novel games in the past, they've never really left me feeling too impressed. My problem with the genresis that you can often just watch a walkthough of these games and get pretty much the same experience since they tend to be entirely plot driven with little, if any, gameplay. However, I quickly discovered that Danganronpa is nothing like most visual novels.\n\nSo you might be thinking, \"There's no way a game where you mostly read text can have good gameplay!.\" \nWell then, ALLOW ME TO CUT THROUGH THOSE WORDS.\n\nThe gameplay features exploration, searching for clues, literally shooting the words out of peoples mouths, and praying to every god to spare the lives of your favorite characters (Side Note: If you play strategy games, don't expect any help from RNGesus). The main gameplay takes place during the Trials. Here, you use your own logic to prove or disprove your classmates assertations, figure out how the clues you've gathered fit together, and determine truth behind each murder. The game also has a variety of minigames with each trial that require a mix between logic and some skill to complete. While the trial can get difficult at times, the game offers three difficulty settings for both the minigames and the trials; appealling to players that would prefer to progress through the story or, alternatively, overcome despair through an incredible challenge.\n\n\"Well, if the developer's put this much effort into the gameplay, then the story must not be that great.\" \nNO, THAT'S WRONG!!!\n\nThe story-telling in this game is beyond compare (except, to it's predecessor). The story in this game will put you on an emotional rollercoaster. The whole time you will be filled with suspense, heartbreak, excitement, depression, fear, anxiety, and determination. All while being caught in a tug-of-war between hope and despair. \n\n\"But a game's plot is never enough, unless the characters are also great!\" \nI AGREE WITH THAT!\n\nWhich is each and every character in this game are so well developed. As progress through the game and learn more to about each of them, you'll slowly find yourself emotionally attached to them. I'd say be careful not to get too attached like every other reviewer will tell you, but the reality is, you won't have choice. And honestly, befriending and becoming close to characters in this game is arguably the best part about it. It sucks when you lose your favorite character, but it makes you that much happier when they survive. And even when they do die, you come to appreciate the impact they had on you, and you become determined to keep moving forward for thier sake.\n\n\"WOW THIS GAMES SOUNDS AMAZING NOW! But how do I know that this game is really worth spending my money on?\"\nI CAN PROVE IT WITH THIS!\n\nYou've already read this far into my review. If you didn't think you would buy this game this game, you would have ignored this review because of how long it was and looked at the really funny reviews instead. Clearly, you're too interested to not play this game.\n\n(Side Note: If you haven't already, make sure you play the first game before this one. While I personally think this one has better gameplay and a much storyline, you'll enjoy it even more if you play through the first game. And if you have played the first game, why are you reading this review. You should playing this game right now.)\n\nNow stop reading this and press that \"Add to Cart button\". DO IT.

S\u00ec, avete una ragazza. Un po' sulle sue, e vi d\u00e0 fastidio, con un bel fisico naturale, non derivante dal fitness, un bel seno e una bella faccia. Non ama particolarmente gli animali mentre voi s\u00ec, e sebbene vorreste avere sei gatti e un cane \u00e8 gi\u00e0 tanto se potete metterli come sfondo del desktop. Poi un giorno vi svegliate e trovate lei con la sua pancia piatta ad accentuare quella quarta abbondante, gatti che ti miagolano da sotto le lenzuola mentre il cane ti scodinzola perch\u00e9 vuole che lo porti a spasso. \nEcco, quel \"sogno divenuto realt\u00e0\" \u00e8 Danganronpa 2, mentre la vita che facevate prima era Danganronpa 1. Tutto sommato, Danganronpa 1 era bello, proponeva qualcosa di \"\"nuovo\"\" (tra virgolette perch\u00e9 scenari del genere si erano comunque gi\u00e0 visti) e i personaggi ti prendevano.\nMa Danganronpa 2 ha una qualit\u00e0 intrinseca *nettamente* maggiore, tra colpi di scena che vi distruggeranno il cervello (io, ad oggi, ancora piango e rido istericamente) e personaggi (specie uno, chiss\u00e0 chi) che vi attanaglieranno l'anima per farla loro. Solo l'ambientazione, a mio avviso, \u00e8 inferiore a quella del primo Danganronpa, ma fidatevi che non ha senso discuterne, di una piccolezza simile.\nGiusto per, perch\u00e9 di solito faccio analisi per persone che gi\u00e0 \"conoscono\" e non per chi si informa da zero tramite Steam, Danganronpa 2 riprende esattamente il concept del capostipite: un'intera classe scolastica si ritrova \"rinchiusa\" in un'ambientazione dalla quale \u00e8 impossibile fuggire senza seguire le regole di chi li ha imprigionati, e la regola principale \u00e8, sostanzialmente, uccidersi a vicenda. La cosa buffa sta nel fatto che non sono *costretti* a uccidersi: hanno la possibilit\u00e0 di vivere per sempre l\u00e0, con cibo, bevande e tutto ci\u00f2 che vogliono, ma per un motivo o per un altro degli omicidi avverranno comunque.\nTralasciando il lato storyline/narrativo, di cui \u00e8 altamente difficile parlare per via dei possibilissimi spoilers (ma, ripeto, si sta a livelli eccelsi, con picchi che prendono a schiaffi robe come la morte di Jenny di The Darkness), Danganronpa 2 riesce a migliorarsi anche in qualcosa di leggermente pi\u00f9 complesso, il gameplay. Essendo la serie (principale, visto che Another Episode \u00e8 gi\u00e0 un altro genere) una visual novel, \u00e8 difficile aspettarsi un gameplay degno di nota o anche solo appagante, eppure gi\u00e0 il primo Danganronpa non annoiava mai sotto questo punto di vista ma anzi, intratteneva in modo pi\u00f9 che buono. E Danganronpa 2 introduce, appunto, sessioni giocate ancora migliori, pi\u00f9 divertenti.\nEppure si torna a quanto detto poco fa: ci interessa poco del gameplay, perch\u00e9 resta comunque una visual novel. Sicuramente sar\u00e0 meno pesante da giocare per chi non \u00e8 abituato al genere, perch\u00e9 invece di avviare il gioco e aspettarti un libro, si avvier\u00e0 un *vero* gioco con semplicemente molti dialoghi, ma... ecco, la serie va giocata per ci\u00f2 che offre al livello di storia, personaggi e caratterizzazione, un po' come la serie Zero Escape (anche se l\u00ec gi\u00e0 ci sono i puzzles veri e propri), e in particolare Danganronpa 2 va giocato per gli schiaffoni in faccia che ti tira quando meno te l'aspetti, per gli shin shoryuken che ti tira in due punti specifici, e per quel Nagito Komaeda che, signori, \u00e8 l'ago della bilancia della vostra esistenza: se non vi piace, avete buttato anni a strascicarvi in una sopravvivenza inutile.", "timestamp_created": 1474624757, "timestamp_updated": 1474624757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.742328", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25647398": {"recommendationid": "25647398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285122586", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474621490}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6bcf\u5f53\u6211\u88ab3\u4ee3\u52a8\u753b\u4f24\u4e86\u5fc3\uff0c\u5c31\u6253\u5f00\u6e38\u620f\u51b7\u9759\u4e00\u4e0b", "timestamp_created": 1474620821, "timestamp_updated": 1474620821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512966", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25647098": {"recommendationid": "25647098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061131337", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463212812}, "language": "english", "review": "Seeing the waifu you pick disappears after another feels me with great despair.\n\n10/10 just like real life.", "timestamp_created": 1474618511, "timestamp_updated": 1474618511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25646165": {"recommendationid": "25646165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130718317", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467078239}, "language": "english", "review": "Play the first one before this one, because story wise you absolutely need it, and its also amazing.

It is best to go into this series blind, so get a friend and tell them this is the happiest game on earth and watch them doubt you after the prologue.)\n\nNow on to my review:\n\nThis game is set on a tropical island.  The characters consist of students of Hope's Peak Academy, a school that only accepts the most talent filled people.  Each character has a talent that defines them.\n\nYour job as the main character is to befriend everyone on the island as they enjoy the tropical environment.  You give gifts to your favorite characters and chat with them under the sun as you work labor under the authority of a magical rabbit.  After reaching the highest in your affinity with your character of choice, you get their underwear. (Because every main character of Danganronpa has to be shipped with every single classmate)\n\n\nOh, and apparently the world has gone to hell and meanwhile you're  trapped on a tropical island with a malevolent bear who likes to toy with people like marionettes so.... (If you're wondering about the bunny, she's still there.... as a punching bag)\n\nThe gameplay consists of investigating murders as Monokuma tempts your classmates to kill each other in order to escape the island.  After finding clues, you are then taken to the class trial, where you solve the mystery behind each murder.  You fire \"truth\" bullets at characters statements and use many other methods to paint your way to the truth.  There are other methods as well such as Logic Dive, where you ride a snowboard down Hajime's mind, Hangman's Gambit, which is traffic simulator, and finally pasting panels together to paint the entire story of the investigation. There's also a part in the game where you play a point and click trapped room puzzle (Could never figure out the code without a hint).\n\nThe environments are very colorful and diverse.  Each island has a theme, and every area on said island fits the style.  4th Island is probably my favorite for it's catchy and colorful vibes.\n\nThe characters are unique and charming with personality.  As you hang out with each of them, you learn about them and bond, and soon, you too shall have a collection of underwear to hang on your wall.  These are well-written characters, and it is well worth the time to read through their dialogue, as you can sort of relate to some of the characters.\n\nThe story is well-structured.  It starts out confusing, but trust me, it will make sense as you play through.  The game gives you hints to various scenes that will happen later on, but you probably won't catch them until your second playthrough.  For the game to make sense, multiple playthroughs are required.  Feel yourself drown in Despair again as your classmates die again.\n\nDid I also mention that your favorite character dies?  Your favorite character always die... Always.\n\nDo I have any gripes about this game? Yes I do, they are minor but...\n\nI dislike Chapter 2 , more specifically the extra event.  It felt forced and took me out of the experience of the game for a bit.  Chapter 2 is ok, but I really hate \"A Man's Nut\"; it's the only time in the game where Hajime breaks character and it annoyed me.\n\nThere was a certain thing that happened in Chapter 3 that felt rushed and unfinished (those that played the game will probably know what I am talking about.) \n\nThere are some parts of the game that were translated incorrectly.  I mean, it's not that bad, it just annoys me a bit because I'm somewhat of a grammer nazi.\n\nNow on to my spoiler-y part of my review. Not really a review; just some spoiler-ish saying that will hopefully make you giggle:\n\n[spoiler] RIP Fatogami    I will never forget your lecture on the greatness of fried chicken[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Teruteru      I always hated your perverted ways; your cooking was the best part of you[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Mahiru       We were starting to get along and then you died[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Peko           You will always be the love of Fuyuhiko's life[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Fuyuhiko     I know you didn't die, but your poor eye ball[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Ibuki           You were always there to cheer people up with your music[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Hiyoko        I hated your guts and part of me was sort of happy when you died[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Mikan          I felt so sorry for you at first, but now I don't know[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Nekomaru  The Rejects club feels empty without you[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Gundham   The Demon with a heart of gold who left his hamsters to a meat eater[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Nagito        You will always be my favorite psychodic piece of trash[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Chiaki         You will always be best girl in my heart[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Monomi       You fail at your job as a teacher[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Junko          I never wanted you to come back, but you did anyway[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Hajime        You will never be the same lovable boy again [/spoiler]\n[spoiler] RIP Tomagachi   I forgot to clean your poop for the 10th time now[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1474589866, "timestamp_updated": 1480031563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25642981": {"recommendationid": "25642981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264230547", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474178012}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Okay, so since i'm a big fan of the series I obviously loved the first one, however (even though it's difficult to me to accept it) I really enjoyed more this one, the cases were a lot more difficult, you really had to think.

Danganronpa 2 is just as good as the first. Infact in ways it could be classed as better. The setting of the islands I wasnt as big a fan of, I prefered the hopes peak academy from the first game as a setting, but by no means was it bad. Jabberwock island is an amazing setting still. The characters were more detailed personality-wise, more friendly, and in times more unpredictable. This was by far the best sequel to danganronpa that I could imagine. \n\nThe pc port was all in all amazing, had one issue with the first class trial, [spoiler]When inspecting Byakuya's corpse there was an object that didnt show up when I pressed the y button on the controller and didnt do anything when I hovered over it, unfortunately forgot what object it was as it was a while ago so probably has been fixed by now[/spoiler]\n\nControls I have no idea about as I used controller, so I can say the controller controls are really good.\n\nGraphics are very similar to the first one, I love the style used though I can imagine some people wouldnt like the 2d sprites for everything.\n\nAll in all, this game is 10/10, same as the first one. I really hope when danganronpa 3 comes out we get a pc port.

its prequel and I dare say, shouldn't be played before DR1. The grievances I have w/ the first game still stick, namely its unnecessary inclusion of trial minigames and dated look (though I still like the artstyle).\n\nThe killing game takes place in an island, which made it lost the claustrophobic feel I had w/ DR1. Being a sequel, DR2 also dumps a lot of information--especially towards the last two chapters--which might lose you had you not played DR1. The chemistry between the characters here are considerably less apparent than in the first killing game. So DR2 plays more with your brain than your heart, probably partly due to not having the novelty of the first game or having to continue a relatively complicated story.\n\nThat said, playing with your brain is definitely what its good at. The game is very, very creative and I loved all its cases, particularly the one in the Funhouse. It maintains a sense of mystery throughout and is constantly full of surprises, with a canon story that follows DR1 really, really well and wraps up satisfyingly towards the end. Just like the first game, I can safely say that this game is worth playing for its story alone.\n\nDR2 is much larger in scale than DR1, is heavy on the exposition but makes a brilliant mystery game. The trials are still easy, but the story is still amazing. The last two chapters are a huge rollercoaster ride and there're a lot of references to the first game as well as cameos which got me by surprise <3.", "timestamp_created": 1473656573, "timestamp_updated": 1473656615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675364", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25473567": {"recommendationid": "25473567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069310885", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473647962}, "language": "english", "review": "This game strangely made me want to be a better person.", "timestamp_created": 1473648188, "timestamp_updated": 1473648188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.998001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25468965": {"recommendationid": "25468965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310749970", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492530611}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0420\u043e\u043d\u043f\u0430, \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435, \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0435. \u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e, \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e 2 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 1 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443 \u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u044b, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c.

I even think it's better than DR1. I went into this game knowing nothing about the story, characters, ect and I loved every second of it. If you loved DR1, you'll love this. I guess this game is also pretty great as a standalone game. But, if you play this without playing DR1, you might get confused during the last chapter. \n\n[h1][b]Story:[/b][/h1]\nThe story is almost the same as DR1's. You play as a boy named Hajime Hinata who gets enrolled into Hope's Peak Academy- a school for insanely talented teenagers. Soon after you get there, you and your classmates suddenly go on a \"school trip\" to a strange island. The school trip was meant to be happy and fun, but then Monokuma shows up and ruins everything. Like the first game, he makes all the students participate in a killing game where they must kill each other if they want to leave the island.\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay:[/b][/h1]\nOne thing I really liked about this game is that they improved the Class Trial mini-games and made them a bit harder. In fact, the Class Trials are just harder in general. I was actually caught off guard by how hard they were. I expected them to be just as easy (or maybe a LITTLE harder) as the ones in DR1, but the first trial in this game took me 3 hours to complete because I failed... a lot.\n\nNot only that, but they also added 2 NEW mini-games called \"Rebuttal Showdown\" and \"Logic Dive\" and I think they're pretty fun- especially Logic Dive. At first I didn't like Rebuttal Showdown because I didn't understand it, but it didn't take me long to figure it out. \n\nThe only bad thing about the new Class Trials is \"Improved Hangman's Gambit.\" They basically just took Hangman's Gambit from DR1 and made it harder, but also made it more annoying and not fun. \n\n[h1][b]Characters:[/b][/h1]\nThis game introduces a new colorful cast of characters. And honestly, I love the cast from this game more than DR1's characters. DR2's characters seem a lot more interesting. The new characters each have their own unique personalities and they all have pretty awesome character designs. The Japanese voice acting is also great! (I don't use dubs, so I can't really say if it's good or not.)\n\n[h1][b]Other Things:[/b][/h1]\nThere's also a couple of new features in this game. For one: when you open your e-handbook there's now a \"Pets\" tab. Yes, you get to raise your own pet! You're supposed to give it gifts so you can raise its \"hope\" status and every once in a while you're supposed to check it and clean up its shit. The pet grows the more steps you take in the game. There's different pets you can raise (there's a guide on Steam that tells you how to get each pet) and if you raise it well, you'll get rewards! Most pets just give you some Monocoins and a couple of gifts but 2 of the pets will reward you with a skill that can be used in the Class Trials. \n\nAnother new feature is a mini-game that can be accessed from the main menu called \"Magical Girl Monomi.\" Though, I believe you can't play it right away. I think you have to progress in the main game a bit first. But anyways, in the mini-game, you play as Monomi and you basically have to fight these robot things. I've seen people complain about this game a lot. Even though I only played it to unlock the related achievements, I still enjoyed it. I thought it was pretty fun. \n\nAnd for those of you who have played Danganronpa 1 and are familiar with \"School Mode\", it returns in this game! Except it's called \"Island Mode\" instead. But it's basically the same exact thing. In Island Mode, Monomi wants you and your classmates to create things for her. Just like School Mode, Island Mode is an easy way to unlock the character's Free Time events so you can learn more about them.\n\n[h1][b]Overall:[/b][/h1]\nI rate this game a fucking 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1472267625, "timestamp_updated": 1472267659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531250", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25160768": {"recommendationid": "25160768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038551970", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479583027}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud575\uc7bc", "timestamp_created": 1472214540, "timestamp_updated": 1472214540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25157209": {"recommendationid": "25157209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059749352", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472123320}, "language": "english", "review": "WHY DOES EVERYONE I LOVE DIE?!", "timestamp_created": 1472197842, "timestamp_updated": 1472197842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25132848": {"recommendationid": "25132848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179718881", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472135123}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u66f4\u65b0\u4e00\u4e0b\u8bed\u8a00\u5305\uff0c\u5b58\u6863\u5c31\u4e0d\u89c1\u4e86\uff0c\u597d\u6c14\u554a", "timestamp_created": 1472134363, "timestamp_updated": 1472134363, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434340", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25132438": {"recommendationid": "25132438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046653712", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472147228}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR: This game is far more difficult than the first one, but if you pay attention, you will be fine. The story is amazing just like the first game.\n\nAt first, I despised this game, I thought it destroyed what the first game had accomplished. The first trial was a mess for me (Hangman's Gambit is a bitch). But then, I realized I cruised my way through the first title, but that may not be the case in this title. IT IS SAFE TO SAY THIS GAME IS FAR MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE FIRST ONE. As long as you pay attention during the investigations, the game isn't TOO difficult (although there is some conclusions in the game that no one would get without a guide imo). But one thing DR can never lose, is it's amazing story. While very farfetched, the story brings in interesting twists to get the most bored of players ingrossed in the game. If you loved the first one, this game makes a lot of improvements, but also butchered others (such as the afore mentioned Hangman's Gambit, and the fact that the PC port of the game has an almost game-breaking bug, where Bullet Time Battle/Panic Talk Action's rhythm is slightly off, meaning it is almost impossible to hit them unless you push the button far in advance).

The setting and the topics it deals with are a goofy, cartoony mess that lacks depth.\n- Contrived storyline [btw, these are the three most important fundamentals of any novel or work of fiction]\n- Abysmal pacing [you will spend 30-40 hours before anything meaningful to the overall story takes place]\n- Unclear game mechanics\n- Anachronisms\n- Nonsensical dialogue that is impossible to interpret at times\n- Sugesstive \"humor\" that isn't particularly clever [it feels a bit like you're watching Beavis and Butthead. Characters will just start talking about their boobs/penises without any motivation and derail the conversation to no comedic effect]\n- Murder trials that start out goofy and irrational, and progressively deteriorate to the point where jarring contradictions are completely overlooked and never explained [as if the developers just gave up and assumed that the player wouldn't notice or care]\n- Verbiage, there is no need for about 2/3rds of the game's dialogue. The characters tend to talk cyclically.\n- One of the worst endings that I have personally experienced. It provides resolutions to most of the story's conflict, but it ultimately leaves the player without fulfillment. You won't walk away from this game with a new perspective on life or anything like that. You'll just be happy that it's over.\n\nThat's about all I can say without spoiling anything. Overall, [b]this game sacrifices depth and emotion for self-aware, cartoony, ridiculousness[/b]. To the very end. When you have a crappy setting/theme, crappy characters, crappy dialogue, and a storyline that forces itself way too hard, you get a crappy novel. You get a crappy game.\n\n3/10, it looks pretty and it is generally functional, but I would not recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1471884063, "timestamp_updated": 1471884063, "voted_up": false,

I watched the anime. So I didn't really know what I was getting into with this. Nonetheless, I chose to play it on MEAN MODE, because come on-- you gotta be a little masochistic to play a game about beloved characters getting picked off one by one in the first place.\n\nI was constantly impressed by how unique and charming the characters were. They all had complex, rich lives that I wanted to know more and more about-- but that was a little hard because MURDER.\n\nOh, and the soundtrack during the murder investigations and trials? Daaaaaaang, son. I want that playing every time I'm trying to solve a problem.\n\n\"Hey, how can we split the tab between five of us if Kate only had water?\"\n*bow wow wow na naaaa na naaa na naaa*\n\nThe murders were fascinating. Each setup was shocking, unique, and heartbreaking. The class trials were enormous fun that kept me up late into the night. Once I was on the case, I couldn't stop. Chapter 5 was especially gripping. Dude.\n\nSome of the gameplay mechanics were a little frustrating. Maybe it was because I played it on PC, but certain trial elements never seemed to function that well-- particularly the end one. I'm blanking on its name, but it's the one where you have to hit the button on the beat to destroy the shields. I've been a musician for about 2 decades and yet I could never line up the button right, unless I was in Fever Mode, when all my button mashings were deemed successes. Huh. Other than that, I figured out most of it.\n\nSome of the trial \"answers\" were logically ridiculous so I referred to a walkthrough (where others were complaining about the same thing), but those times were few and far between.\n\nFor all the swear words and bloodshed, some of the game was too cutesy and fanservice-y for my taste. I got easily bored with Monokuma and Monomi's interactions. I also wasn't super invested in the over-arching Future Foundation storyline, though towards the end I did get more interested in it as twists were revealed. Speaking of the end -- no spoilers here -- oh gosh, soooo much dialogue. I mean, I get that it's a Visual Novel, so that's forgivable other places, but certain characters seemed to talk in circles. (The voice acting is A+ throughout, though.)\n\nI liked the end overall, though. It put an interesting spin on the previous gameplay, and I felt satisfied with everything. It carried the main themes through til the last line, and I loved the message, despite the constant bleakness of the scenarios.\n\nThank goodness for ISLAND MODE because I don't know how else I'm supposed to fill this hole in me now.", "timestamp_created": 1471483734, "timestamp_updated": 1471483734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100",

play the first game, but watched the anime and plan to go back and play the first game.)\n\nI'm going to give the pros and cons of the game and a little explination of why it is a pro or a con.\n\nPros:\nOST-Probably the best OST I've ever heard and each song that is player perfectly fits the scenario. Some of the songs are so good you might even want to get them on your phone or something.\n\nStory-This has the best story of any game I've ever played. You will be be sad enough that you want to cry. You will be exited enough that you start to dance in your chair. You will not expect most of the twists that happen in this game. You constantly be intrigued by the story that you will get lost in the game. You'll start up the game at 8:00 PM and then realize that's it 6:00 AM once you finally feel like turning your head away from the screen.\n\nCharacters-The characters in this game have such great design that you will develop relationships with these characters that you will cherish, too bad you'll feel much of the despair the game promises when they die though.\n\nPuzzles-The puzzles in this game aren't to hard, but they aren't too easy either. They give you a perfect balance between the two. The minigames that are played for this are very well designed (Hangman's Gambit may be a bit controversial) that they are fun, and also make sense in there situation.\n\nVoice Acting-It is absolutely amazing with some of the best voice actors out there such as Fukuyama Jun and Sugita Tomokazu; however, I can't stand the english voice acting so I highly, highly recommend the Japanese voice acting.\n\nArt-Art is very well done which helps you totally capture the distress or happiness a character is feeling, or perhaps the creepy ambiance of a location.\n\nEnding-One of the best endings I've seen. That's all I'm saying.\n\nCons:\n-Look sensitivity while walking around is too low.\n-Contains an unnecessary amount of saliva and snot (not a serious con)\n\nOverall review:\nBUY THIS GAME! At a $30 price tag you have no reason not to buy this game. However, I highly recommend you play the first game before you jump into this game as you'd be very lost to what's going on.", "timestamp_created": 1471427669, "timestamp_updated": 1471427669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24967297": {"recommendationid": "24967297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134935051", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472287953}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game forever.

No spoilers. No Killing. No Despair. But some high- class humor.      C|8_{D  \n\n''What is Danganronpa?'' Glad you ask lad. Well simply put: Your new teacher believes a class trip is the best way to begin a new school year. Accordingly, she beams you to a tropical island in the middle of nowhere. Why, you ask? Because you all ought to strengthen the bonds between everyone in your class, which consists of highschool students, who all have a specific talent. ''Now, where's the fun in that?''. Good question. Unfortunately an old aquaintance appears on stage. Those who know the first game, are aware as to who that could be and it is really not a secret, yet I will leave it at that. ''But what does he do, to add to the already amazing suspense of a class trip?''. Oh, I thought you'd never ask. Now, you are not only instructed to get closer to your schoolmates, no..., while doing that, said villain urges all of you diligent pupils, to dispose of each other. ''What?! I will have to murder innocent highschoolers?!'' Goodness, no. Instead, you will have to try and solve the murder mysteries presented to you, as you are one of the few who choose not to kill, naturally. You will gather all significant evidence and unveil your findings during the class trial. ''A trial without certainty as to who the murderer is? That seems rather odd...'' You know it is not just some trial. The class trial will decide who the murderer is... by majority vote. So make sure to persuade your fellas, or you may be the one to go. ''That can't be right, that's not fair!'' Upupu. I almost forgot. Everyone else except the succesful and undetected killer will die along the one who was wrongfully selected. ,,How cruel!'' Then prevent it! Be the one to outsmart them all and win by exposing the evildoers among your friends. Should you correctly uncover the identity of the killer by argument and minigames, only he or she will die. ''But is it all about these killings?'' Obviously not! You will have deep conversations of which you will probably speed read all those unrelated to murderers or persons in the game you actually like. Since I know that decadent generation of yours, I will mention an additional part of the game: Free Time. Can you believe it, humans passing their time by simulating free time In-Game, bonkers. There you will have the opportunity to engage in short conversations with your fellow captives and read a few sentences about what happened during free time, instead of you actually having anything out of it. ''But why bother, then?'' Well, it is not completely in vain, you know. You can give them gifts, that you purchased with coins earned by finding puppets of Mr. Villian, that are spread all over the island. Oh, and getting closer to some people, which may or may not help you later in the game. ''Is there anything else I should know?'' That might be about it. Even though some people may need to get used to playing a game with a lot of Visual Novel elements, it is worth investing time in it, since you will leave as the Ultimate .... what was it again?

I sometimes tell people I played it on the PS Vita so then they don't judge me, but really I just watched it on youtube.

The writing is fantastic, but if you aren't in it for the long haul, you might not want to even bother with it. Although, if you aren't sure, maybe watch the prologue or something on youtube, just a TINY bit, and see if you are interested. Also, [b]PLAY THE FIRST GAME BEFORE THIS ONE PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND SACRED[/b]. This one spoils EVERYTHING from the first. And speaking of spoilers, DONT LOOK UP ANYTHING AT ALL. NOTHING. ONLY GO TO THE STORE PAGE AND BUY IT, THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO DO.\n\nThat said, I will try to say things that will apply to BOTH games, because they are similar and both awesome.\n\nSo what's the premise? Well, I'll just tell you what happens in the prologue because, let's be real, that's not at all spoiler territory. So there's this place called Hopes Peak Academy, and if something graduates from there, they are basically set for life, but they need to meet 2 qualifications. \n1.) Be currently enrolled in high school\n2.) Be they very best at what you do, and become an \"Ultimate\". For example, if you are amazing at singing, you would be invited as the \"Ultimate Singer\", or if you have a sexy as all hell accent, you would be the \"Ultimate Sexy Accent\".\nSo anyways, you play as Generic Anime Protaganist, but under different names depending on if it's the first or second game, and they were just invited to Hopes peak Academy. However, spooky things happen, and you wake up at a mysterious place and meet all of your classmates, aka the other characters, who all range from literally insane, to pervert, to hellspawn, to the resident cute shy girl who is literally best girl. And then the mascot character shows up and is like \"If you want to leave, you need to murder one of your classmates and get away with it\", thus steering the series into the murder mystery genre.\n\nSo, without spoilers, how is the story? It's fantastic. It's the main draw of this series. All of these things happening all the side and the mysteries of the main plot building up and then they get solved anD ILOJFDNDJRFEWHFD IT'S GREAT. The story also has a lot of emphasis on that characters, and all of them are great. Not all of them are LIKEABLE, but they are all written well. And you will find yourself getting attached to certain characters as they contribute to the story and then eventually they probably got freaking killed. Oh, and don't be fooled, people WILL die. And some deaths may hit you VERY hard, particularly if it's one of your favorites. But don't worry, it's all a part of the danganronpa experience.\n\nThe murder mystery parts are also very well written. Figuring out \"whodunnit\" is always interesting, and the further you go in the more complicated it gets. Which is another reason to start with the first game, IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO FIGURE OUT. It's more like a warm-up for the second. While some of the trials have some details that could made me mad, but overall it's pretty great.\n\nSo how's the gameplay? It's pretty good. 1/3 of it is a visual novel, moving along in the story and going from place to place to trigger the next event in the story. 1/3 is a dating sim, where you spend free time with the currently surviving characters and give them presents, and if you give them something the actually like by reading item description and paying attention to the characters, you get little events that tell you more about them. And then the last 1/3 of it is a murder mystery, where a murder happens, and you need to look around and gather evidence, and then go to a trial and use it to solve the case. The gameplay helps you feel like you are getting closer to the characters and solving the mysteries yourself, and it's cool.\n\nAs for other important stuff, the soundtrack is pretty great. There are a few tracks that I just can't get out of my head sometimes. And also, the voice acting for both the English and Japanese is pretty solid. Also, yes, you can have English text and Japanese voices if you prefer, and apparently the Japanese cast has some very, VERY well known people. Like, one person in the second game is voiced by the same person who did the japanese voice for, ah, let's see here, Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist, Temari from Naruto, Finn from Adventure Time, freaking PHARAH FROM OVERWATCH, need I go on?\n\n\nSo, you may be thinking, \"This jumbled wall of text is nice and everything, but what's so amazing about it?\" Well, it's really hard to truly put it into my words, but the writing just engrosses you. It wraps you up in a ball and it won't let you go until you know what happens. Between the characters, and the mystery, and just the foreshadowing dropped here and there and it's just DOJSHNEFJDVKOGBKLE; IT'S JUST FREAKING GREAT. I've been OBSESSED with this series every since I heard about it. And now is an EXCELLENT time to hop on the bandwagon, with the TWO ANIMES that are CURRENTLY AIRING. One is the VERY END, and one is the VERY BEGINNING. But just like the other things, DON'T WATCH THESE UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED THE FIRST AND SECOND GAME.\n\nI'm using all caps a lot and this is very long because I'm VERY passionate about this series. IT'S SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD 10 OUT OF FREAKING 10 GO BUY THE FIRST GAME NOW. Well okay MAYBE wait until it's on sale but GET IT SOON IF YOU CAN IT'S JUST SO FREAKING AMAZING.", "timestamp_created": 1470361588, "timestamp_updated": 1470396478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24710304": {"recommendationid": "24710304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143679296", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468349999}, "language": "english", "review": "Danganronpa 2 is the only Danganronpa game that doesn't have a tl;dr anime season to tell it's story.

C\u2019est la suite directe du premier opus, m\u00eame si ce n\u2019est pas de suite \u00e9vident.\n\n\nTout d\u2019abord, je vais pr\u00e9senter dans les grandes lignes le GROS point fort de DR2 : son sc\u00e9nario. Pour faire simple, le jeu reprend les m\u00eames bases que le jeu original : on incarne un \u00e9tudiant, Hajime Hinata, fraichement admis \u00e0 Hope's Peak Academy, une universit\u00e9 pour les \u00e9tudiants qui poss\u00e8dent tous un talent particulier (on les nomme les Ultimates). Cependant, une fois dans la classe, un lapin rose, Usami, appara\u00eet et les transporte sur une \u00eele tropicale pour qu'ils deviennent tous amis et collectionnent des fragments d\u2019espoir. Mais bien s\u00fbr, Monokuma arrive et lance le Killing School Trip. Comme dans le premier jeu, pour s'\u00e9chapper de l'\u00eele, les Ultimates doivent tuer un de leurs camarades et ne pas \u00eatre d\u00e9masqu\u00e9 lors des Class Trials (on y revient plus tard). Se lance alors un jeu mortel o\u00f9 les amiti\u00e9s nouvellement cr\u00e9\u00e9es sont mises en doute et o\u00f9 la confiance est une chose bien rare et fragile.\n\n\nVoil\u00e0 pour le sc\u00e9nario. Maintenant abordons le gameplay. Celui-ci est peu ou prou le m\u00eame que le premier jeu. On encha\u00eene les free time o\u00f9 l'on parle aux personnages pour faire avancer l'histoire jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'un \u00e9v\u00e8nement arrive. Noter que maintenant, \u00e0 chaque fois qu'on parle \u00e0 un personnage on gagne donc des \"fragments d'espoir\" ce qui permet d'acheter des comp\u00e9tences pour les Class.\n\nLes d\u00e9placements sont un peu modifi\u00e9s : on se d\u00e9place toujours \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re personne dans les grands espaces ferm\u00e9s, mais d\u00e8s qu'on est sur l\u2019\u00eele, les d\u00e9placements s'effectuent \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me personne en 2D. C\u2019est agr\u00e9able mais ne change pas grand-chose. Cependant les d\u00e9placements 3D sont ralentis lorsque l'on tourne, ce qui freine la fluidit\u00e9.\n\nEnsuite les enqu\u00eate des meurtres sont classiques : on examine les objets et on parle aux autres personnages pour recueillir leur t\u00e9moignage, parfois significatif, parfois non, mais toujours utile au final.\n\nEt enfin, les Class Trials. L\u00e0 par contre de nombreux changements sont \u00e0 not\u00e9s.\n\nLes Non-Stop Debates o\u00f9 l'on ne pouvait que r\u00e9futer une d\u00e9claration en tirant une balle s'enrichissent d'une nouvelle possibilit\u00e9, on peut maintenant approuver les propositions des autres \u00e9tudiants de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on.\n\nEnsuite, le pendu se complexifie : il faut maintenant que deux m\u00eames lettres se heurtent pour pouvoir l'utiliser, et lorsque l'\u00e9cran est plein de lettres, c'est tr\u00e8s dure de ne pas perdre de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 (je conseille pour cette phase le gameplay \u00e0 la sourie, plus r\u00e9actif que la manette).\n\nEn revanche les phases de manga pour r\u00e9sumer l'affaire sont simplifi\u00e9es en nous permettant de n'avoir acc\u00e8s qu'\u00e0 seulement un \u00e9chantillon des vignettes.\n\nEn plus de c'est changements mineurs dans les m\u00e9caniques d\u00e9j\u00e0 existantes, deux nouvelles phases ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rajout\u00e9es. D'abord le Rebbutal Showdown. Maintenant, le h\u00e9ros ne sera plus le seul \u00e0 pouvoir r\u00e9futer des d\u00e9clarations : les autres personnages vont eux aussi pouvoir objecter \u00e0 vos d\u00e9ductions. Il faudra alors briser leurs r\u00e9futations \u00e0 l'aide de coups d'\u00e9p\u00e9e et les achever gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une preuve. Cet ajout rajoute de la coh\u00e9rence aux Class Trials et les dynamise.\n\nPuis deuxi\u00e8me ajout, le Logic Dive. On se retrouve dans le cerveau de Hajime pour faire du surf et r\u00e9pondre aux questions de l'enqu\u00eate en empruntant diff\u00e9rents chemins. Petit b\u00e9mol pour cette phase, les r\u00e9ponses sont souvent assez \u00e9videntes et on pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerait un QCM, mais le gameplay est plut\u00f4t fun et on attend chaque descente avec impatience.\n\nLe jeu s\u2019enrichit \u00e9galement un syst\u00e8me d'XP qui augmente en marchant et en examinant des objets. Cela permet d'activer plusieurs \"skills\" lors des Class Trials.\n\nOn peut maintenant \u00e9lever (de fa\u00e7on minimaliste) un animal de compagnie, \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d\u2019un Tamagotchi, qui grandira gr\u00e2ce au nombre de pas. Il faudra aussi lui offrir des cadeaux pour que sa jauge de d\u00e9sespoir n'augmente pas jusqu'\u00e0 la mort.\n\nVoil\u00e0 pour les modifications de gameplay.\n\n\nParlons maintenant du doublage, car bien que le doublage ne soit pas courant dans les visual novel, se limitant g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 quelques mots pour rythmer l'action (comme les c\u00e9l\u00e8bres interjections des Ace Attorney), la s\u00e9rie des Danganronpa se paie le luxe de doubler une grande majorit\u00e9 des personnages. Chaque Class Trial est doubl\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement (sauf les pens\u00e9es et les phrases d'\u00e9chec) et le reste du jeu est compos\u00e9 de petites phrases caract\u00e9ristiques de chaque personnage durant les Free. Cependant, bien que ces phrases soit toujours \u00e0 leur place dans le contexte, elles sont rarement les vraies paroles des personnages. J'ai fait le jeu avec les voix anglaises et entendre et lire en m\u00eame temps des choses diff\u00e9rentes est assez d\u00e9stabilisant. Mais \u00e7a n'est pas un gros probl\u00e8me. Concernant le doublage anglais en lui-m\u00eame, je l'ai trouv\u00e9 tr\u00e8s convaincant et tr\u00e8s juste. Le doublage japonais l'est s\u00fbrement tout autant.\n\n\nMaintenant abordons les graphismes et la musique. Pour moi rien \u00e0 redire. Le chara design est inspir\u00e9 et plus bariol\u00e9 que le premier jeu. Chaque personnage poss\u00e8de de nombreux sprits couvrant une large gamme d\u2019\u00e9motions (toujours en 2D, la direction artistique \u00e9tant encore une fois si reconnaissable). Les ex\u00e9cutions, sans trop spoiler, sont toujours parfaitement r\u00e9alis\u00e9es dans leur design si caract\u00e9ristique. Les environnements sont travaill\u00e9s et diversifi\u00e9s. Et je suis amoureux de la parallaxe! Les musiques sont excellentes et font tr\u00e8s vacances tropicale, mais savent se nuancer avec des notes malsaines.\n\n\n\u00c0 la fin du jeu, on d\u00e9bloque l'Island Mode. C'est un jeu de gestion m\u00e9lang\u00e9 \u00e0 un Date Simulator... C'est ce qui ce serait pass\u00e9 si Monokuma n'avait jamais pris le pouvoir. Le mode est sympa mais sans plus. Il permet surtout d'avoir tous les Free Time de tous les personnages et de passer plus de temps avec ses personnages pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s (Mahiru!!!). Si l\u2019on passe beaucoup de temps avec un personnage dans un lieu qu\u2019il appr\u00e9cie, on d\u00e9bloque une fin secr\u00e8te (\u00e0 noter que ces fins peuvent se cumuler).\n\nOn a aussi acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la lecture de la nouvelle Danganronpa IF qui raconte ce qui se serait pass\u00e9 dans le premier jeu si Makoto avait retrouv\u00e9 le m\u00e9moire avant le premier meurtre.\n\nOn peut aussi incarner Monomi et combattre les Monobeasts dans un jeu typ\u00e9 arcade (une sorte de beat\u2019em up) tr\u00e8s r\u00e9p\u00e9titif.\n\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 dur\u00e9e de vie, l'histoire principale vous prendra 40-50 heures en prenant son temps puis si vous visez les 100% il vous faudra bien 70-75 heures.\n\n\nEn conclusion, Danganronpa 2 : Goodbye Despair est un excellent jeu qui d\u00e9passe pour moi le premier jeu de loin (meilleurs personnages, meilleurs enqu\u00eates, meilleur plot twist de fin (encore plus WTF mais plus \"logique\"), gameplay plus vari\u00e9). Il ne faut plus qu'esp\u00e9rer que Spike Chunsoft sorte sur Steam Ultra Despair Girls et Danganronpa V3.

weight between characters (for me) than the original\n- Definitely recommended for those who love VN and a bit of murder mystery solving. \n\nCons:\n- Sometimes the truth bullets that needed to be matched up to the correct statement were impossible to deduct with logic - I think something got lost in translation when turning from Japanese to English which made for some fustrating moments in the debates\n- Some characters set up VERY obvious death flags so it was very easy to guess who was going to die next unlike the first Danganronpa and ruined the suspense of wondering who was going to get murdered.\n- For me (personally) I found very little replay value except to look at the extra little unique cutscenes I missed with the necessary key items.\n- It seemed a lot easier to guess what had happened in each murder and how it was done, I'm not sure if it was because playing the first Danganronpa made it this way but I found myself less satisfied with resolving the turn of events because I

to kill each other (Highly simplified explanation). Nobody would kill their friends of course, right? Probably yes, but here, if someone kills someone else and passes a class trial they get to go free and everyone wants to get out. This creates an engaging story of wondering who will be killed next and then focusing on who could have killed them, gathering up all the clues you can before the class trial to determine your fate with some fairly simple gameplay mechanics. I must admit, the highlight of the game for me comes from when the killer is found out. If the killer does get caught... they get brutally executed. Watching what execution Monokuma has come up with for the character's speciality is always a joy. The only real problem I have with the game is the end, [spoiler] which completely invalidates everything that has happened. No-one actually died, it was a virtual world and everyone was in a coma. I felt that was really shitty but only the survivors got out of their coma and everyone else was stuck in theirs.

I finally did, and boy was it worth it. I believe that the first game is required to understand this game towards the end, but that's not even a gripe I had with it. It was a perfect next installation to the series and one of the few sequels that was much better than the first in every way imaginable. I can only hope Ultra Despair Girls releases onto steam sometime soon, as I've found myself hooked on this franchise and I personally can't wait for the third installment. However, knowing how long it takes for a Dangan Ronpa game to make it to the states, let alone added to Steam, it may be a while.

In short, skip the game and read the manga or novels.\n\nStory: \nThe story is bad until chapter 3 and then it gets interesting. It is the only good part of this game. The bad part of the story is that they try to shoe horn in everyone\u2019s reaction. It is really annoying in the beginning because maybe 2 or 3 are relevant and the other 15 are just noise.\n\nGame-play: \nThe game-play is bad. They try to hide it by adding lots of different types of game-play. However, not one single type is decent. The worst part of this game are the games itself. None of them are fun and I found myself trying to rush through them to get back to the dialog. I would have enjoyed this game more if they took them out completely.\n\nArt style: \nThere are several different art styles in the game, they should have picked one for two. It is weird. The first person 3D graphics of this game are worse than the original Quake. They should have stuck to 2D.\n\nControls: \nSaving the game is a crap shoot. You have to finish the mini game to save the game. Sometimes even when the menu is available, it won't let you save the game.

Hajime and 15 other students are taken on a school trip to a tropical island by a rabbit thing that calls herself Usami. The island is actually 6 different islands. There's an island in the middle with the 5 other islands circling it. The students need to collect Hope Fragments during the whole trip by interacting with each other and becoming friends. Hajime explores the island and meets everyone with the Ultimate Lucky Student, Nagito Komaeda. After that, Usami calls everyone to the beach where she gives them swimsuits. They all decide to swim in the ocean.\n\n[h1][b]So, it begins...[/b][/h1]\nHajime is about to join everyone when suddenly, a strange voice calls everyone to the middle island, where a park is located. Jabberwock Park. This island is Jabberwock Island. Once everyone arrives, everyone's favorite antagionist appears...That's right. Monokuma! He takes away Usami's powers, transforms her in his image as Monomi, and tells everyone that they have to kill each other. The students object to this. Monokuma proceeds to bring out his \"Monobeasts\" and kills Monomi, only to show everyone his strength. Everyone has to face the reality of \"You can trust no one.\"\n\n[h1][b]Normal daily life...[/b][/h1]\nThe (not so) normal daily life of the 16 students has begun. With everyone on edge, surely nobody is gonna kill anyone else! The students all decide to hang out and have fun for a few days, also known as [b]Free Time.[/b] During Free Time, you--as Hajime--can do whatever you want with your favorite characters and get to know them more. As you spend time with them, there is a chance you get a Free Time Event, where they reveal some stuff about them. After these events, you get a Hope Fragment. Collect all the Hope Fragments! Anyways, after that, Byakuya decides to throw a party for everyone, where attendance is mandatory. Everyone decides to use the Old Building next to the hotel for the party. But it needs to be cleaned first. So, Nagito decides to make everyone draw straws, uh um, I mean, sticks. The person who gets the stick with the red marking on it has to clean the WHOLE Old Building. And Nagito, being the Ultimate Lucky Student, gets the red marked stick. Apparently he's pretty good at cleaning, so it'll be no problem for him. Teruteru has to cook the dishes. And everyone else can just...get prepared...? Pretty much. Of course, Byakuya had the greatest idea of having it all throughout the night. So, everyone spends their day and then BOOM, party time! Byakuya bodychecks everyone and takes every sharp object in the building, so no one can get killed. Everyone is having a great time at the party: Akane eating all the food, Nekomaru has to take a shit, Peko guards the sharp objects in the office, and the lights decide to ruin it by randomly turning off for a few minutes, causing everyone to panic. After they come back on, everyone finds Mikan on the floor fallen in...some erotic pose, wondering how she can just fall on accident like that. After they help her up, everyone realizes: Byakuya's missing. Akane smells something under a table in the corner with a lamp. Hajime goes and checks it out, and finds...\n\n[h1][b]Investigation Time![/b][/h1]\n...Byakuya dead under the table with blood EVERYWHERE under that table. Everyone is surprised, blah blah blah, Monokuma File, blah blah blah, and the investigation starts. Okay, this is where the spoilers for the Prolouge and Chapter 1 stop and we start talking about more game mechanics! After a murder happens, you have a set amount of time, which you can use however you like, to [b]Investigate[/b] the crime scene. Technically, it's not timed, you just need to find all of the evidence. Which gets inserted into your e-Handbook as [i]Truth Bullets.[/i] You'll use Truth Bullets later, for now, just collect all of them. You may be asking, \"Well, how DO you find these 'Truth Bullet' things?\" Easy. You have a cursor. You control it by either your mouse or your right analog stick. Hover the cursor over an object and press the A button or the right mouse button. And depending on what it is, it may be a piece of evidence or just something you can inspect. Once you've collected all of the Truth Bullets, the investigation will end and you'll enter the Class Trial.\n\n[h1]The Class Trial![/h1]\n\"What the hell is this 'Class Trial' you're suddenly talking about?!\" This is where everyone debates about the case, much like actual murder trials. You debate about anything from how the murder played out to the cause of death. There are multiple components to the class trial. First is the Nonstop Debate, where all of your classmates will debate. Your job is to find contradictions in what they say and refute it. BUT. This time, you're able to agree with them. Be careful, make sure to figure out whether you're supposed to refute or agree with them. Next is the Advanced Hangman's Gambit. Like before, you need to spell out the answer. But this time, it's way harder. The letters will fly across the screen left, right, up, and down. And you need to pair them up before you can fire them into the spelling space. Alright, let's get to the new stuff, such as the Dive Drive. In this, you have to, um...slide across what is pretty much an obstacle course (in your mind) and answer up to four questions about something everyone got stuck on. You might have to think about it for a while though. Hopefully none of your classmates become impatient and rush the trial while you're lost in thought... Randomly, you'll get objected to and will enter the Cross Swords. You will have to cut through your classmate's words and stab some sense into them. Lastly, I present the best for last to you: the Panic Talk Action, aka P.T.A. Okay, so this isn't exactly totally new, as it's very similar to the B.T.B., but it's controlled diferently and has new music. It's also slightly harder. In the P.T.A., you face off against a classmate that you have backed into a corner. You have to destroy their insults, excuses, and whatnot to completely break them and have all of your other classmates agree with you. It's not as bad as it sounds. It's rhythm-based gameplay that is really fun! In this game, you have to hold down the button and let go of it. It doesn't sound too bad, right? Wrong. You have to time it with the beat counter that is indefinitely scrolling across your screen. When you hold it down and let go of it, it has to be on the beat. You have a separate button to shoot down their statement thing and a button to reload your bullet counter. When you get a high enough combo, the tempo changes and BPM gets bigger, meaning the music gets faster...which means the beat counter scrolls faster. Once you've weakened them enough, you'll enter the final blow mode where you have to spell out the word(s) that will refute their final statement. When you successfully refute that last statement, you completely screw them over (usually) and win. Puhuhu~. Happy arguing, you bastards!\n\n[h1]Wrap-Up![/h1]\nOverall, the game is a pretty fun and interesting experience with happy times, sad times, hope, despair, and tough choices. This one is way, way, WAY longer than the first game. The Class Trials have recesses in the middle of them, spliting it into two halves. If you thought you experienced despair in the first game, oh boy, are you totally wrong. This game presents to you the true meaning of despair. I won't spoil the game anymore, puhuhu~. After all, Monokuma has a distaste for spoilers, so I don't want to get executed. He only allowed me to spoil only the prologue, since it's not very important and it's when he makes his appearance in the game, and half of Chapter 1, since he wants me to talk about the class trial, the best part of the whole game.

playing this one. \nThis franchise (games and anime included) has easily became one of my favorite franchises ever. Of course that's because I love games with good stories, which this game does have, but in my opinion you really have to play both games to understand it. I like how the class trials work, only thing I kind of dislike is Hangman's gambit (which is one of the mini games), it's not bad but it just takes way too long to finish at times. But a new addition to the game which they didn't have in the last one is the Logic Dive, which is actually pretty fun if you ask me.\nThe characters are awesome and full of personality, of course there are one or two you might think are forgettable, but in the end the character development is pretty good.\nThe pet system is another new addition to the franchise, although I didn't really mess around with it all all basically, it's still sad when you get a notification saying (oh your pet is dead btw).\nI'd recommend this game for whoever is really into story telling more than the actual gameplay, because this is certainly what this game bring to the table, a good story with interesting characters, laughs, and feels ;-;", "timestamp_created": 1468450004, "timestamp_updated":

The gameplay feels more like a 'hard mode' of the first game, and might seem more unforgiving to those new to the series.

Well, the best way to describe it is \"Phoenix Wright on steroids\". At it's core, this is a mystery visual novel-style game with some \"action\" elements fused into it.\n\nMinor spoiler into the central mechanic of the game : Class Trials (and why they happen)\n[spoiler]The central mechanic of this series is pointing finger at killers (yes, there will be killing) during Class Trials (no, seriously, I wasn't joking when I said this was Phoenix Wright on steroids).[/spoiler]\n\n\nFor all intents and purposes, your goal is to...well...solve the mysteries you are presented with. I could go on a long rant about the elements of the game, but the tutorial explains them pretty well, but I guess I should give you a summary so you understand how this game is \"played\". This is done in \"phases\" (played on maximum difficulty settings):\n[list]\n[*] Non-Stop Debate - most common phase during the Class Trial. Basically a \"different\" version of Phoenix Wright's series witness testimonies. People talk, some statements have words that can be \"shot\" with a Truth Bullet (read: evidence that this information contradicts). Although there are parts where you must \"present evidence\" from your inventory, for the most part, you just need to choose from the ones game gives you for the section (it gets changed for each debate, you get 3-10 Truth Bullets to select the right one from during the debate). There are also \"agree spots\". Instead of shotting to [b]prove they are wrong[/b], you need to shoot them with evidence that [b]proves they are right[/b]\n[*] Hangman's Gambit - meeeehhh. Most of the things they ask you to spell make sense, but some things don't (or are not immediately appearent as to [b]how they want you to phrase them[/b].\nLetters fly, you collide same-ones and then either choose to remove them or to place them in the answer (1 letter at a time). With increased difficulty, later ones (one in specific in Chapter 4) can become rather...difficult (since we don't have stylus-based touch controls).\n[*] Rebuttal Showdown - awesome music during this section. Basically, you \"cut\" some useless statements, advance to parts where there are weak points (like Non-Stop Debate) and select one of the \"Truth Blades\" (yeah, this game is clever...) to \"cut\" the statement. If you don't see how this resembles a one-on-one Non-Stop Debate...well, I just told you that it does.\n[*] Panic Talk Action - a rhythm game (not joking). You click/release the left mouse button based on rhythm to destroy your opponent's remarks. Once you have done so long enough, you are presented with a weak statement that you need to press W/A/S/D in correct order to spell out the answer.\n[*] Logic Dive - ermmm...surfing...game...thing? Really, you go through a forward-autoscrolling obstacle course (camera view from behind) and at certain points, you get to choose the correct \"road\" to go onto. If you choose the wrong one, you restart from a nearby checkpoint (those are pretty common). All in all, an easy and straightforward section.\n[/list]\n\nAnd that's basically it for how the game is played. I can't really tell you what's the plot/synopsis/etc for this game without giving away spoilers...so gameplay description will have to do.

The characters are a lot more complex and developed, like the protagonist Hajime Hinata (who has more personality than the prequel's protagonist, Makoto Naegi) and forgetting Nagito Komaeda, the deuteragonist, in this sense is practically a sin, since he's one of the most unique and psychologically interesting characters I have ever seen in a game ever (and has become a favorite of mine). All the other characters you will a care a lot about, like Fuyuhiko, Chiaki and Akane. It's an amazing cast of characters, really. And Island Mode, sweet goodness, Island Mode. You know the trope Sidetracked by Golden Saucer? It fits perfectly here.\n\nThe storyline...I can't say anything about it, because I will spoil if I do. Let's just say it's epic. That's all.

Danganronpa 2 is totally worth its salt when it comes to solid writing, characters, and story. The pace is a bit on the slow side - I've played on and off for maybe 6 hours before things got really into it and I reached what could be considered the 'meat' of the game, but it's worth it. \n\nThe game is basically divided into about four parts - Everyday Life, wherein the story that's not the other three parts is presented in a typical visual novel format, Free Time, where you can choose who you spend time with and learn about the other characters, Investigation, where you learn as much as you can about a murder that has recently occurred, building up evidence and testimonies, and finally, the Class Trial, where everything comes to a head and you must find the killer or die alongside everyone besides the killer.\n\nThe game both shines and falters a little during the CLass Trial, the heart-pounding segments of fast-paced deliberation and argument surrounding a recent murder of another character. The cast is, by necessity, rather large, as if to accommadate the fact that in order for the plot to progress at least two characters need to die - the victim and the guilty party. The Class Trial, especially the first one, is loaded with maybe six or seven totally discrete minigames, each one with its own mechanics and failure states, which can be daunting. I personally flubbed each one for maybe a few confused minutes before it finally snapped into place what was meant for me to actually do. It's the only real shaking point, and once I managed to extricate what was expected of me, the 'aha!' moments were real and powerful. The format reminds me most of Ace Attorney, but the biggest difference is that the difference between the main character figuring it out and yourself figuring it out is far more graceful in this game. I didn't have nearly the massive frustration in this game I did in AA yelling at Pheonix who did it, and I never had the feeling that I was leading my spike-haired hero to my own conclusion through presenting information. \n\nTHe main mechanic, rather than 'presenting' evidence against a testimony, is a scene where other characters make statements one after another. Many of these statements have fallacies that either are untrue or mislead, and your various pieces of evidence are Truth Bullets that you 'shoot' at relevant falsehoods. Later in the first trial you can also use Truth Bullets to concur with statements that are true. The game offers a helping hand by only loading truth bullets that are relevant to the matter at hand - at most five at a time out of maybe fifteen or more - so you can eventually figure out what it's asking you sooner or later. \n\nThe other minigames are a bit more absurd, and are a definite stumbling block. I really didn't understand what Hangman's Gambit was asking of me (Just so you know: You're trying to build the answer to the question by combining two of the same letter and 'firing' them with the same button as the Truth Bullets by hovering over the combined letters. The tutorial's a bit badly phrased.) and the Closing Argument segment was a bit wonky in execution. \n\nOverall, though, Danganronpa 2 is  very well done in its execution of its concept.

I was surprised to know this year that both games went to Steam and personally, I feel like that was ultimately a good decision to expand these bizarre yet great games to other people who don't own a Vita or don't want to import or emulate the PSP versions.\n\nJust like the first game, you and your classmates are forced into a killing game where you need to find the murderer and only they get to be executed but if you choose wrongly, everyone else instead of the killer gets executed. This time though, it's on an island instead of a school and the game is more off the walls than its predecessor.\n\nTo keep things fresh, Spike Chunsoft added and refined some of the segments during trials. Nonstop Debates are back but are refined so you can agree with classmates instead of just pointing out flaws in their arguments. There's also Hangmans Gambit which is retooled but in my opinion, is not as good as the first one because this time you need to grab the letters, match them, and select them to put them in and making sure they don't hit a different letter which sometimes feels impossible. MTBS are back in the form PTAS(Panic Talk Action) and are similar to the first games MTBS but this time you gotta form the word. Closing Arguments are back and are virtually the same.\n\nNew to the trials though are Rebuttal Showdowns and Logic Dives. Rebuttal Showdowns make you \"slash\" at peoples words and basically \"cut\" into their argument which is nice. Logic Dives however is basically like a snowboarding mini-game into your mind where you need to jump, dodge obstacles, and choose the correct pathway to figure out a part of a case and in my opinion, I don't like them since it gets annoying trying to jump all narrow spots.\n\nIn my personal opinion the new cast of characters is great and have some of my most favorites in the entire series. Like the first game you can interact with them through some Free Time Events so  you can get to know them better, gain some hope shards so you can buy some skills, and even gain said characters exclusive skill.\n\nTo people new to DanganRonpa, I heavily recommend going through the first game first before touching the 2nd game so you can understand everything better. To people who are into Visual novels, Mystery games, fans of the first game, or into something off the wall, I recommend this to you.", "timestamp_created": 1466361806, "timestamp_updated":

It's a bizarre combination of Battle Royale or Hunger Games and a Phoenix Wright game with an art style that says, \"I couldn't give less of a shit.\" It's whacky, strange, funny, and most importantly, you get to helplessly watch everyone you've ever cared about tear eachother apart and die in increasingly over-the-top or brutal ways, until you wonder why you ever held hope in the first place and give in to absolute despair.\n\nThen Danganronpa 2 took everything I loved about Danganronpa, and made it so much better*.\n\nDanganronpa's puzzles had the occasionally iffy answer, but I never had that problem in DR2. DR2's puzzles were much harder, and this time you don't have Kyoko around to shove you into the answer. While some characters do nudge you in the right direction, the hints never feel like the game's treating you like a -complete- idiot. They gave you all the clues you need, so figure it out, shithead.\n\nA lot of the soundtrack is repeats or remixes from DR1, but it's fine, because DR1's soundtrack is great. DR2's original songs, however, are absolutely fantastic. The characters are all nicely fleshed out and three-dimensional, well, you know, aside from the lack of literal depth. Get it. Because they're sprites...mymomtellsmeI'mfunny.\n\nNow, DR1 isn't a bad game, and I would very, very highly recommend playing DR1 first. On top of still being a pretty good game, the stories are sort of linked here and there. And really, if you're playing a point-and-click adventure or a VN, it's for the plot, right? DR1&2 are about 50~60 hours long combined, so you'll probably get your money's worth for both of them. (I would also recommend setting both Puzzle and Action difficulty to Mean, personally.)\n\nI would say Danganronpa is a must for people into murder mysteries, especially something like Phoenix Wright, and even if you aren't into all this anime, at least give it a shot and see if you warm up to the art style.\n\n\n\n*(Improved) Hangman's Gambit can go suck a million dicks and die in a fire, though.", "timestamp_created": 1465889211, "timestamp_updated": 1465889211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530981", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23541497": {"recommendationid": "23541497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095889614", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472528815}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game so much, I love the characters in this one more than DR1 but...\nI feel like the trials and executions weren't as good as DR1,\nIf you decide to play DR2 you should play DR1 first, a lot of plot points from the first game get brought up and you won't understand the ending if you don't. \nI love DR2 as a sequel and I feel like it did a good job overall, but I feel like it could have done a few things better.\nI do recommend playing it but you should play DR1 first if you haven't already.", "timestamp_created": 1465845965, "timestamp_updated": 1465845965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23539296": {"recommendationid": "23539296", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981776655", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 2286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497708521}, "language": "english", "review": "The sequel to the best visual novel game.

Now nearly a 100 hrs clocked in for the sequel, I can safely say it's very solid sequel.\n\nDanganropa 2: Goodbye Despair is a light novel mystery game that similar to Phoenix Wright series but has it's own flavor to make it stand out for itself. Similar to the events of the previous game, sixteen students of Hope Peak's Academy are on a vacation trip within an isolated resort known as Jabberwock Island. Things went from a peaceful school trip to a killing school trip when a familiar saboteur known as Monokuma gains control of the island for his new playground of murders. Now playing as Hajime Hinata, you must solve the island's mysteries while surviving the horrors of your classmates killing each other.\n\nStory:\nThe story is similar in ways with the previous game but has its own twists and turns that makes it a little different. The player plays as Hajime Hinata, an ordinary high schooler joining a high ranked school known as Hope Peak's Academy. Weirdly, he is awaken with fifteen other students on an tropical island with a magical bunny Usami. Unfortunately, the series mascot Monokuma showed up to make the peaceful school trip to a deadly school trip. Hajime and the other students must find secrets about the island's mysterious nature and solve cases of fallen school mates when a murder occurs.\n\nOverall, if you played the first game, you pretty much know what's going to happen. If this your first time, it's going to be quite an emotional trip and adventure with fun and excitement in the mix. There will be a few chapters that are weird, but it tends to even out later in the game. But since this is a pretty decent light novel, the story is well done in this department.\n\nGameplay:\nFor the most part, this game is a standard point and click game with the usage of a controller or mouse (keyboard for some inputs). As the game goes to class trial mode, you'll play a series of mini-games to press on contradictions and lies of classmates' statements and find out who was the mastermind in the case. If you played the first game, most of the mini-games are reworked and some are added on. The Non-stop Debate even has a new feature of agreeing with a classmate statement. For me, additions of Rebuttal Showdown and Logic Dive were pretty good while reworks of Hangman Gambit and M.T.B. (now known as P.T.A.) are sub-par or poor constructed. The bigger culprit for that is the difficulty levels. They were changed to be harder than in the previous game. So Mean in the first game is pretty much Kind in this game.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is a decent update to the previous game. The first game was fairly too easy but they beef up the difficulty to make it challenging. There are a few niche updates that I forgot to mention but the game came a long way.\n\nGraphics:\nSince it's a light novel, it'll pretty much display itself like one. At first I wasn't too crazy about it since the characters are literally 2D paper cutouts, but then it was pretty interesting how the areas they visit literally build itself to our view. It's an even more powerful theme to this particular game setting, but a nice touch. Some parts of the game will feature a manga style look, which has really nice art to it. The animations for Monokuma segments are really interesting and dark too. There are some 3D elements to this game as well, but it's still quite weird to me.\n\nOverall, it's pretty much what you expect from a light novel look. Nothing outstanding, but something unique and rarely done well.\n\nSound:\nIf there's one thing that both the first game and this game did right is the music. Masafumi Tadaka (you probably know this person dealing with arrangements from Shining Soul series, killer7, No More Heroes, and even Smash Bros.) composes most of the music for this game series. There are returning tracks from the first game, but still have a lot of new tracks in the mix for this game. It fits well for most parts of the game. From calm and relaxing tropical music when the students are trying to enjoy themselves, to the intense rave-like music during class trials of finding the murderer. For the most part of this game, the music fits extremely well to the game and always gets you pumped or despairing at the right moments. Even to the point as you pass more chapters, some songs tend to get stronger along with the cast.\n\nOverall, if you like variety of music, this game will greatly accomplished it for you. Tadaka's work was a total surprise for me and he does not disappoint.\n\nOverall:\nDanganropna 2: Goodbye Despair is that rare game that somehow gets me in the right places and I would've never realized it unless my friends influenced me. If there's any alternative mystery games like Phoenix Wright, this is totally it right here. Even the first one is ideal as well. It's even more interesting to say that the game somehow fulfilled a certain kink I loved for a long time. Never expected that at all with this game. But I must say, it's great for its money and I recommend this game very much. But it's best to play it after finishing Danganropa: Trigger Happy Havoc. This game is still good without playing it, but it makes more sense if you played it before this one.

Only after doing all this can the class escape from the island.  This is what you, as Hinata Hajime, have found yourself dealing with after Hope's Peak Academy's environment got flushed down a toilet and replaced with an [b]inconspicuous door right in front of you[/b].\n\nFor those of you who have played the first game, it's pretty apparent, immediately, that disaster and [i]despair[/i] are right around the corner.  In the form of Monokuma, no less, this is proved correct within just a scant hour of playtime.  Begin at the beginning, but, this actually is important for the story.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nBut let's talk about the story first, shall we?  It's not really the best, in my opinion.  Characters that seem written around their trope and the Rule of Cool, who have unnatural reactions to the occurrences around them.  The one good trade-off that we get from the former title is that you aren't always slamming through their points with your evidence and counter-points, but can sometimes agree with the few intelligent things they say.\n\nMuch like the previous title, [b]Good-bye Despair[/b] gives us a killing game in the style of Battle Royale.  Students must kill another student in order to escape the island, and all without anyone being able to pin the blame on the culprit.  Therefore, there is a class trial, where the game's main action occurs.  This is all parallel to a larger mystery that, as the game progresses, ends up intersecting right into the cast's circumstances...just like the first.\n\nThe whole game is littered with a lot of references to the first game, to the point where I would say: if you haven't played the first Danganronpa, don't bother until you have to play this one.  These can be clever little nods in the presents you roll for from the Monokuma tree, to blatant admissions by the writers that they are, in fact, practically mirroring the last story.  Here's the biggest failing, actually.\n\nThe whole story comes across as being written for the audience, rather than a series of circumstances being displayed to the audience and given credibility.  There are even points where Hinata's inner monologue and other characters' dialogues will lampshade this fact.  It might be held a clever bit of tongue-in-cheek by other viewers, but I didn't particularly enjoy it, myself.  \n\nThe biggest problem, though, would have to be: the cases do not really make sense.  Even though the cases in the first were sometimes considered 'easy', this was probably because people were piecing them together based on the logical information provided to the player, since you're supposed to be investigating and coming to conclusions.  In this one, more often than not, motives, evidence, and circumstances will be entirely contrived to make the story fit the case, rather than fitting the story with the cases.\n\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\n\nAs mentioned before, the characters seem largely written around their tropes and Rule of Cool.  There are few of them to care about, and few of them to really surprise the player.  Much of the time, it seems their characterization is put out there for the writers to make a certain point, or to try to manipulate a response out of the player.  This doesn't really work, especially if you come into the game expecting more of the cleverness behind the first Danganronpa.\n\nI'll explain further: in the first Danganronpa, not only were the situations given credence by how characters reacted to them and the circumstances surrounding them, but the characters themselves were given credence by how they reacted to situations, themselves, and each other.  In the second game, they all come across as either being there as plot tools or ways to [b]make the player feel[/b].  It's cheap, it seems to work, but it's not as clever as the first.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nFor all the failings that the story and characters have, the sound choices were still right up there with the first game.  The new tracks fit the locales and the situations, while the old ones from the first game are used in much the same way one would expect.  The only major error is that they overuse one such track, to the point where you might not be sure if you're about to witness comedy or tragedy.  Maybe there's a deeper point there, maybe not.\n\nAs for the basic SFX surrounding gameplay?  Pretty much the same as the first: it's there, you probably won't remember much besides the shattering sound that accompanies blowing through a contradiction, but this is good.  \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nWhile Danganronpa can be best described as a visual novel with adventure game elements, with a little Ace Attorney mixed in, Danganronpa 2 seems to really want to push the [i]video game[/i] part of it pretty hard.  This, in and of itself, seems a really bad design decision, and in some cases it is: Hinata gains levels from walking from place to place, so there's no need for the jumping around options that they give you to eliminate that bloat.  Thankfully, though, during free time you can look at your map to see where your character-of-the-day is.  However, I mentioned that, [i]in and of itself, seems a really bad design decision[/i], but it's also a major clue - I can appreciate that much, at least - to the game's overarching mystery.\n\nThe class trials themselves have had a total revamp.  Nonstop Debates get hit the least with it, but you can also, as mentioned before, now agree with your peers when they come up with good points.  This really breaks down the problem of the last game, where characters' statements either only existed to guide Naegi's conclusions, or for Naegi to blow them away.\n\nThe Hangman's Gambit has been 'improved'.  You will hate it.  The letters fly across the screen, and you take damage when non-matching letters smack into each other.  You need to combine matching letters, and then add them to the hangman slots in order, otherwise you'll take damage, or dispose of them if they begin to get in the way.  There's too much waiting and luck involved in this though [spoiler]this might also be a clever break of the fourth wall.[/spoiler]\n\nLittle duelist sections have been added, where the characters will rebut your latest point.  You then have to slice through their statements to get to the meat, and reach a point where you can slash in with your counter-point.  It's basically just an evolved Nonstop Debate in a 1v1 setting, and could have been explained better in terms of its pacing.  There's only one time where it's detrimental to use a keyboard with this control scheme, so it isn't too bad.\n\nThe Logic Leap is another new mini-game: you run through a TRON-esque interface to follow the logical path to your conclusion.  It replaces many of the situations where you would have to choose from a multiple-choice drop-down, but it's full of waiting and dodging easy obstacles.  It was unnecessary to add.\n\nThe rhythm minigame still exists, but, instead of just blasting through the noise, you also have to break down barriers that look suspiciously like the locks from Ace Attorney, to get to the final statement.  You then piece it together using the four cardinal directions, and that's your final statement.\n\nThe Climax Inferences have been reworked as well, to the point where you need to hover over the empty panels to look at what they're supposed to contain, and then hover over the options to see what they're supposed to depict.  Once you match up a series of them from the set you receive, you get a new set - it just drags out the ending portion, and also makes it impossible to fail, though that is better than going through only to see you made a mistake on Act 4.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nSame as Danganronpa 1.

In short, it's a linear story-heavy visual novel with grotesque and adult theme and \"puzzle\" elements in the form of Phoenix Wright style trials. If that's your thing, then go play, or read about the first game. If it's not, then at the very least do the latter, because the series is quite unique in nearly every aspect and may convince you anyway.\n\nWhen it comes to Danganronpa 2 I can safely say it's a really good sequel. The story features new characters and setting, the gameplay has been improved, new features have been added, and the music and visuals are just as good and unique as last time. It's a great game that surely all fans of the previous one will appreciate.\n\nBUT... that said, it is difficult to avoid comparisons to the previous game, and as such my opinion will probably sound a bit negative. I hear many people consider the sequel to be better. Sadly, I don't agree. Story-wise, it's kind of a similar killing-game with a deeper mystery, just in a different setting. As much as I was engaged and surprised by numerous \"twists\", there were a lot of really silly, or just idioitc moments, especially by the end. Same goes for characters, which I don't consider as charismatic as the ones from the previous game. Most of them are just irritating and rarely there's anything redeeming about them. They feature one or two personality traits for the entire game (unless they die, that is) and that's it, which is sad, especially when a single joke is being run into the ground repeatedly for hours. Of course there are exceptions, but that's what they are. Personally, I didn't really care for the majority of characters, while the overall story didn't leave as much of an impression as the first game. But as I've said - that's in comparison, because as a whole it's still quite good and engaging, with a lot of nice twists.\n\nAs for the gameplay, one should appreciate how the developers tried to improve on the existing features and add some new ones. Some of these changes work, others not so much. I really enjoyed the fact that you can agree with a character's statement, instead of just pointing out holes and mistakes constantly. At the same time I hated the new Rebuttal Showdown mechanic, which is just a button masher. And being time-limited it makes it hard to focus on what the character is saying. I also didn't really see the point of Logic Drive. Although answering questions in such way is quite clever, it also tends to drag on unnecessarily later on.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game I think is the fact that many answers or statements you have to shoot at are very arbitrary and not always logical. With more than six Truth Bullets available during Non-Stop Debates picking the right combination often comes down to luck or trial and error.

If you didn't play Danganronpa 1, stop whatever you are doing and go play that instead as this is a direct sequel to it. If you have played Danganronpa 1 then you are merely wondering if you should buy the sequel. The short answer is yes.\n\nSome of things I liked about Danganronpa 2:\n+ One Class Trial which I really liked and really hit the despair. Although all of the Class Trials were enjoyable.\n+ An interesting climax and reveal to the game. Although it does get a little too Meta.\n+ The additional option of agree statements in the Class Trials was a good addition.\n+ The Rebuttal Showdowns were pretty cool as well. Although there was one showdown I had trouble with due to not realizing I can do more damage with a diagonal strike.\n+ How even some of the more \u201cSilly\u201d truth bullets end up playing a pivotal role in the trial's outcome.\n\nI only have a few complaints about Danganronpa 2. Notably the following:\n- I feel like Monokuma goes a bit too far with some of his motive delivery this time as some of motives interfere with Free Will more. But I guess that is part of his master plan this time around.\n- Some of the characters are way over the top (I'm looking at you Supreme Warlock Overlord Gundham with his Four Dark Devas [read: hamsters] of Destruction!), but I suppose that is to be expected from this series.\n- While the Logic Drive addition has an interesting series of questions, I am more meh on the entire mechanic. Also feel like there were too many of these and they were too long.\n- The \u201cEscape Room\u201d puzzle was annoying because the puzzle mechanics were not obvious, although the game would let you skip it.\n- The game is WAY more Fan Servicey than the previous one was.\n\nAnd the following fake complaints:\n- 5 hours out of the 33 it took to beat this game resulted in lost sleep. Thats like nearly 20%  :(\n- This game is not Sakuras' Revenge :D\n\nAll I can say is despite these few complaints I really enjoyed this game.

Failure to do so will result in quite a bit of confusion about the plot and wholly lessens the overall experience. It is also recommended (but not necessary) to read the light novel Dangan Ronpa Zero first.\n\nDanganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair (originally released as Super Dangan Ronpa 2: Farewell Despair Academy in Japan) is the exciting sequel to the original Dangan Ronpa game, which you can find on Steam under \u201cDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc\u201d. As a sequel, many elements have been carried over from the first game, both gameplay-wise and plot-wise. I\u2019ll be abbreviating Danganronpa 2 as SDR2 from this point on.\n\nThe game is a mixture of murder mystery (of which there are many), stereotypical anime traits (crazy hair, pink blood, fanservice), inappropriately timed sometimes black humor (which gives the game its unique atmosphere), \u201csocial linking\u201d a la Persona 3/4, and\u2026 a deep, deep fascination for hope - and despair.\n\nFirst, the murder mysteries. SDR2 consists of six chapters, with some chapters containing more murders than others. Each chapter has a \u201cDaily Life\u201d and a \u201cDeadly Life\u201d portion - \u201cDaily Life\u201d is pre-murder, \u201cDeadly Life\u201d post-murder discovery. Certain chapters are weaker than others, but on a whole, the murder mysteries have improved from the first game. Murder mysteries are solved in Class Trials, where characters present arguments - and you literally shoot contradictions with \u201cargument bullets\u201d, among other gameplay mechanics - in order to solve the mystery. \n\nPerhaps most importantly, the trials for the murders are a significant improvement from the first game - the amount of Captain Obvious has been reduced, more complex and fun mechanics have been introduced (a sword fight, a snowboard minigame, AGREEING rather than CONTRADICTING, people contradicting YOU), and each case is very well written out. If you\u2019ve played through the first game, prepare for a big step up in difficulty starting from the very first trial. This difficulty jump is appropriate and makes SDR2 much more satisfying.\n\nThe characters themselves are a diverse crew, but should feel somewhat similar to the first game\u2019s cast. SDR2 loves its parallels to DR, but be warned - any assumptions made based on parallels will probably come back to bite you. The level of insanity present in these characters has not gone down at all from the first game, and there are several characters (not named due to spoilers) who keep things very\u2026 interesting. The voice actors continue to perform admirably, so expect spending long hours on the dialogue as you listen rather than skip through the text.\n\nAn interesting fun fact is that Komaeda Nagito has the same voice actor and Ultimate talent as Naegi Makoto, the protagonist of the first game. Their names are quite similar as well\u2026\n\nOnce again, you have Free Time available during \u201cDaily Life\u201d, where you can effectively social link with the other characters. Ranking up is much easier than the first game, with each character limited to 6 pages of info, and practically every gift-giving nets you a rank up. You should be able to max four relationships in one playthrough. And as usual, it\u2019s a game of guessing if the character you like and ranked with is going to die or not! \n\nExpect hope and despair to be taken to the extreme - Spike Chunsoft isn\u2019t holding anything back when it comes to this. When you finish the game, hopefully you too will be able to say - \n\n\u201cFarewell, Despair Academy!\u201d", "timestamp_created": 1464368185, "timestamp_updated": 1464368271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23217441": {"recommendationid": "23217441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060097826", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461515680}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid 5/7, No you're wrong simulator 2016", "timestamp_created": 1464267506, "timestamp_updated": 1464267506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497802", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23210707": {"recommendationid": "23210707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052678602", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472818621}, "language": "english", "review": "One might wonder what the developers went through to think up all of the diverse and impossibly complicated murder scenarios...

Most story driven games don't take much time to complete, the longest I've played was about 12 hours, so I tought I would probably get about 12 hours of gameplay. But after 2 days of playing non-stop, I finished it. It took 40 hours to beat the main storyline. 40 HOURS. And there's even more stuff to do afterwards. This game is hands down a masterpiece.

My words can not convey the feelings I have for this despair.  \n\nAll the characters are all well written in personality, and also well designed in apperarance. The more you get to know them, the more depth they have, and that is one good aspect of this game, to befriend these ultimates! They all contain deep thought about there talents, also how they connect it to their lives.\nThe art and the style is enchanting! I love it, it feels perfect in my eyes. The shadding, colouring.. mezmerizing .. \n\nStory goes in a good pace, and was also mindblowing. It was great!!! One thing is predictable .. and that is which of them that survive till the end. But that is a minor thing compared to the whole game!   \n\nBut the best part was how the music took part in the dialogues! It was perfectly switching mood as an event take on diffrerent changes. From happy to sad, from serious to funny. Also all of the soundtracks are great! It feelt so nice to listen them in any situation,  especially in class trails. It really does add a lot of excitment with change of music track at the right places, its awesome to follow, as it play with ones emotions. The feeling is incredible! The action!\nThe class trail is damn interesting as you puzzle up the whole scene and face the truth. Although it can be difficult to solve, but its very well done! To see evidence, to find the culprit, it feels satisfying to find the outcome of the trail! \n(And then get sad when they die .. )\n\nThe japanese voiceacting is really good! \nThe text is well written! Never got tired of reading it.\n But one thing that is damn annoying  .. is that in the text, they use their given names ... but they actually say their family name in the voice-acting! Why does the english text need to change that? D: Oh well. \n\nI really recommend this game! The art, the music, the story, the characters.

If you haven't played it yet, I strongly suggest playing it before playing Dangan Ronpa 2, because this game holds large spoilers for Dangan Ronpa. And I mean big. Also, some of the things revealed in this game have a bigger effect if you've played the first one. \n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nCertainly it's strongest point. You play as Hajime Hinata, a cynical yet good hearted high schooler who is enrolling into Hope's Peak Academy, a school known for only accepting the most talented students across the world. The students are assigned titles as \"Ultimates\" (Super High School Levels in the Japanese version), examples being the Ultimate Mechanic or the Ultimate Swimmer. When Hajime enters the classroom, he immediately knows that something's sketchy. His classmates feel the same way. Suddenly a robotic rabbit plushie reveals herself as the student's teacher, and that they're on a field trip to Jabberwock Island. Cue most of the students freaking out. Just when the students start to enjoy themselves, our previous antagonist Monokuma appears, usurps the teacher's authority, and claims himself to be the headmaster and that from now on you'll have to live on the island forever unless you kill someone and get away with it. But if you're caught, you'll be messily executed. Let's just say things very quickly go south. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nIt's generally the same as the first game, except now there are more exploration segments. The gameplay can be compared to Ace Attorney, where the most of it comes from the court sessions. \n\nIt's split into two modes, Daily Life and Deadly Life. Daily life is exploration and Free Time Events (segments where you can get to know your classmates) while Deadly Life is investigation and trials. That pretty much sums it up.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\n\nIt's pretty alright. There are some tracks that are pretty damn catchy like the Rebuttal Showdown music. Overall, the music fits the game pretty well.\n\n[b]Voice Acting[/b]\n\nA LOT better than the first game's. Every character's voice fits them perfectly, and you don't need it to grow on you like the first game's voice acting does.\n\nPlease just buy this game, but make sure to play the first one first.\n\nP.S Fuck you Komaeda\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1464045243, "timestamp_updated": 1464045243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23162112": {"recommendationid": "23162112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054622708", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509060997}, "language": "english", "review": "Man, this game is just as amazing as the first Danganronpa.

My fear was severely misplaced. Even if you know the answers or the final outcome, the mysteries in this game are more than complex enough to be perplexed by them a second time around. What surprised me the most though, was the emotion this game had to offer. Dangan Ronpa 1 was fantastic in a lot of ways, but I feel like this one was more emotional overall. In the first game, there are 2 trials in particular that are execptionally emotional to me. In this game, there are 3. It may just be one more, but as this game's 2nd, 4th, and 5th trial all made me cry like a baby...well, I think that speaks for itself. In short, buy this game. Buy it right now, or wait for a sale. It doesn't matter. Just make sure you buy it. It provides more than enough hours of play just by going through the main story once. Beyond that, there's also extra game modes to be played (like island mode, which can sometimes take just as long as the actual main story to complete 100%), achievements to be aquired, in game items to get, etc. You'll get your money's worth no matter what you pay. It's an emotional rollercoaster with some incredibly tense moments and complex mysteries. I would reccommend playing Dangan Ronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc first, as multiple references are made to it in the story, but that's also not required if you really don't want to. The one problem I have with this game is that some of the characters can fade into the background if you don't spend your free time with them, and there's never enough free time in the main story. Then again, that's the whole reason they have island mode and let you replay chapters once you've beaten them.

IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO HAVE DANGANRONPA 1 SPOILED, PLEASE SKIP THIS REVIEW!]\n...\n...\n...\nOBLIGATORY\nSPOILER\nSPACE\n...\n...\n...\nI have very mixed reviews about Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. In all honesty, I think I would have preferred to just see this an anime. I loved the story but when it came down to the trials, the game honestly was incredibly boring. The story begins with you, as Hajime Hinata, preparing to enter Hope's Peak Academy. Suddenly, you find yourself drawn to a mysterious door. After entering the door, you find yourself in a classroom with 15 other students. A rabbit named Usami introduces herself and says that you've all been brought on a school field trip and that everyone is meant to get along. The classroom falls away and reveals a tropical paradise. Suspicion slowly fades and as everyone begins to enjoy themselves, Monokuma, the derranged half/half bear from Danganronpa 1 shows up and crashes the party. You're told that you need to kill someone and get away with it to get off of the island. Sound familiar?\n\nThe game gives the big reveal from Danganronpa 1 right away, that you're students from Hope's Peak Academy that have had your memories erased, the world destroyed, and you were brought to this island for an unknown purpose. The great twist in the story is finding out the true nature as to why you were brought to the island and this is where the game really shines. Unravelling that mystery is done really well. However, the main gameplay element of the game, the class trials, are the game's biggest weakness. The trials were unnecessarily extended out and minor details were given extreme importance just for the sake of placing in another minigame or extra feature. That brings me to a second issue I had with the trials. Since this game was originally for the PS Vita, the new features were more made for the Vita rather than the PC. The new slashing mini-game during the trials seems especially the case. The \"Improved Hangman's Gambit\" also seems to be the case. The best non-Vita specialized minigame were the rebuttals by various students, but that feature was also a problem since it caused a lot of unnecessary extension of the trials. You usually had to rebute someone's gut feeling who was rebuking your evidence-based theory.

Namun berbeda dengan DR1 yang memakai sekolah sebagai setting tempatnya, kali ini DR2 menjadikan sebuah kepulauan beriklim tropis sebagai lokasinya. Lebih gila, lebih konyol & lebih banyak fanservice ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0).\n\nMeskipun bertindak sebagai sekuel, namun kita tidak akan mendapatkan lanjutan kisah DR1 secara langsung di awal game, kita justru dihadapkan dengan cerita hampir sama dengan awal cerita DR1 dengan karakter yang berbeda. Membuatnya jadi makin penasaran untuk dimainkan.\n\n[h1]Cerita (10/10)[/h1]\n[b]Jangan mencari info tentang satupun karakter game ini di situs seperti wikia sebelum menamatkan ceritanya. Setiap karakter mempunyai spoiler berat bahkan pada biodata mereka.[/b]\n\nDR2 jadi game dengan cerita terbaik yang pernah saya mainkan. Tidak se-horror DR1 (mungkin karena terbiasa dengan death surprise di DR1) namun DR2 memberikan setidaknya 3 plot twist yang sangat gila. Menggambarkan sebuah despair yang yang harus dijalani, namun mampu memberikan ending yang luar biasa tentang kepercayaan kepada masa depan kita.\n\n[h1]Gameplay (8/10)[/h1]\nSerius, DR2 jauh lebih susah daripada DR1, bahkan pada level gentle (easy) sekalipun. Berikut ini pengembangan class trial dibandingkan dengan DR1 :\n\nPada nonstop debate, bila pada level gentle DR1 kita maksimal diberi 3 peluru (truth bullet) untuk 3-4 weak argument, maka pada DR2 kita diberi 3-5 peluru dan weak argument yang ada memposisikan kita untuk setuju (agree) atau menolak (refute).\n\nImproved hangman gambit, berbeda dengan DR1 yang cukup meminta kita untuk menembak huruf yang sesuai, kita sekarang diminta memasangkan 2 huruf yang sama, yang tengah berjalan horizontal dan vertikal. Bila 2 berbeda bertemu maka keduanya akan meledak & membuat damage untuk kita. Bila 2 huruf sama bertemu maka huruf akan bergabung dan berhenti bergerak, kita bisa menghilangkannya atau memasukkan huruf itu dalam kalimat jawaban. Bila huruf tidak sesuai dengan jawaban maka akan menjadi damage untuk kita. Ini adalah bagian tersulit di game ini bagi saya. T_T\n\nRebuttal Showdown, dimana kita berdebat 1 lawan 1 dengan seseorang. Kita diminta memotong semua kalimat yang dia katakan dan memotong weak argument dengan truth blade yang berasal dari truth bullet. Sama seperti nonstop debate, kita harus menyesuaikan weak argument dengan truth blade yang disediakan, ini berarti kita harus membaca kalimatnya terlebih dahulu sebelum memotongnya. What a pain!\n\nLogic dive, bermain ski sambil menggunakan logika berpikir kita, tidak terlalu susah.\n\nPanic talk action hampir sama seperti bullet time battle.\n\nClosing argument, berbeda dengan DR1, kita tidak langsung diberi semua potongan adegan, namun cuma muncul 4 potongan dan 4 potongan berikutnya muncul setelah 4 potongan pertama selesai, selain itu setiap salah menempelkan potongan berati damage untuk kita. OMG!\n\nJadi jangan malu kalo retry berkali2, class trial-nya memang susah di level gentle sekalipun.", "timestamp_created": 1462886087, "timestamp_updated": 1462886087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489030", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22891348": {"recommendationid": "22891348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221713064", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463901255}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6bcf\u4e00\u7ae0\u73a9\u4e0b\u53bb\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5c31\u662f\u5e0c\u671b\u4e03\u6d77\u5c0f\u5929\u4f7f\u522b\u6302\u3002\n\u6211\u6ca1\u7b49\u6c49\u5316\u51fa\u6765\u5c31\u5148\u5f00\u59cb\u73a9\u4e86\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6574\u4e2a\u5267\u60c5\u7406\u89e3\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5230\u4e86\u540e\u9762\u770b\u82f1\u8bed\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u5fc3\u7d2f\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u4e0d\u662f\u4e03\u6d77\u5c0f\u5929\u4f7f\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5c31\u61d2\u5f97\u770b\u5168\u5feb\u8fdb\u4e86\uff08\u4e00\u5e2e\u8bdd\u75e8\uff0c\u7ba1\u4f60\u4eec\u8bf4\u4ec0\u4e48 -_- \uff09", "timestamp_created": 1462862575, "timestamp_updated": 1462862685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22886794": {"recommendationid": "22886794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052562356", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 2438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463137573}, "language": "english", "review": "Ace!\n\nA little slower to start than the first game but has a much better ending then it.", "timestamp_created": 1462832195, "timestamp_updated": 1462832243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22884709": {"recommendationid": "22884709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011685874", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462817555}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the first game, hated the sequel.

The game starts some time after the events in D:THH. However, despite being a sequel, there's really not much difference or improvements in terms of gameplay in D2:GD. This might be good for some but personally I think this is a really lazy attempt at making a sequel. This doesn't mean the game's bad, though. It's just a bit too similar for me to actually call it a sequel. Like in the previous game, D2:GD main attraction is the visual novel aspect, the murder mystery and of course, the varied and colourful cast of characters. \n\nLike I said before, there's very little improvements in terms of gameplay. It still played the same as in D:THH. There are a few mini-games added in the class trial but I find them to be tedious to go through. The (Improved) Hangman's Gambit in particular is one of my least favourite mini-game, followed by Rebuttal Showdown and Logic Dive.\n\nAbout 75% of the game consist of clicking and reading through massive amount of text, a standard aspect of a visual novel game. If you're not into that kind of gameplay, please don't pick this game up. While you can't actually date any of the girls, it's highly recommended to spend some time with them and give them gifts to strengthen your bond with them. Not only they give out special ability to use in the Class Trial after fully bonding with them, you also get some back story and other hidden personality they don't normally show. Just don't get too attached, as you never know when they might die. \n\nThe murder mysteries, unfortunately, is on the same level like in D:THH. It's a bit too easy to deduce. Compared to the Ace Attorney series, the mysteries in D2:GD is clearly the inferior. Also like in D:THH, the Class Trial is also either too straightforward or too vague. Not having the ability to read the summary of your Truth Bullets without opening up the menu is annoying as hell.\n\nWhile the new characters are interesting in their own right, those who played D:THH will find most of these characters a bit too similar to the characters from D:THH. Despite this, player will still find a favourite character to get attach with (though mine died early on). Also a really, REALLY, annoying one too (f**king hate that guy).\n\nAnother thing before purchasing this game. This game will make you feel depressed at key moments. One is particularly heart wrenching.

In fact if I were asked to play a visual novel, I probably would have replied 'no' or 'what's that suppposed to be some kind of picture book?' Luckily a friend of mine gave me a brief overview of the story and I figured I'd give it a shot; this was before I had any idea what life changing ridiculousness I was in for. \nI purposely omitted reviewing the first Danganronpa after finishing it as I wanted to get a better sense of visual novels by continuing with the sequel; Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. Although It would make sense to start by reviewing the story, it is too easy to accidentally give away plot points, so I will keep my comments about the story to a minimum and instead just give some generic comments.\n\n**No spoilers**\n\nCharacters: \nIf you have played Danganronpa 1 its very easy to wonder how the 'unique' bordering on insane characters could be topped, but honestly the characters in Danganronpa 2 go leaps and bounds above the first game. The characters in the second game make the characters in first seem comparatively... ordinary. None of the characters come across as unoriginal or uninspired. In fact, I often wondered what kind of insane being would have come up with some of the characters. I'm tempted to reveal names, but it's worth finding out for yourself - I loved Chiaki and Hiyoko\nFortunately Monokuma returns and brings so much more humour to the game. He has definitely been improved upon and it was great to see a new character to complement Monokuma too! \nThe voice acting is incredible. The level of skill in the actors performances is insane. That includes every character (...Terteru).\n  \nGameplay:\nThis is the only part of the review where I actually have some criticism (although it is minimal). \nGameplay can be split up into 3 main categories: exploration, class trials, and extras. \n\nExploring the island was incentivised by the amazing variety in scenary. It must have taken some extremely creative thinking to shift the games themes and mechanics from a school to an island. Nevertheless the island setting had so much promise and it certainly delivered. Controlling the main protoganist operates very similar to the first game, however the camera perspective and controls change depending on your location. Whilst the first person perspective from Danganronpa 1 is maintained, the second game introduces a new 2D perspective which was quite nice to see in terms of freshening up the gameplay. The choice of setting the game on an island certainly allowed the creators to play with different ideas from holiday resorts to an industrial environment.\n\nThe class trials were developed from the first game. I'm not sure if the developers intended to merely improve upon the trials from the first game, or bring in new ideas entirely  - probably a mix of both. \nThe majority of the class trials remained largely the same with new mechanics being added to every task within a class trial. Hangman's Gambit changed almost entirely which is my main criticism for this game (but lets face it, this is a petty criticism. I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel for something bad to say). No matter how quickly you have worked out what the missing words are, you have to be lucky enough for the required letters to appear in pairs on the screen whilst simulateneously trying to prevent other letters from crashing into each other... Its less about logic and more about how fast you can move your mouse across the screen. \n\nTwo new components have been added to the class trials. The first is the Rebuttal Showdown which, as the name suggests, is a pretty rapid and intense 1 v 1 debate against another character. The music alone gets you fired up!\nThe second is Logic Drive which is a snowboarding minigame with questions about the particular murder case within it. I really liked it, although it may not be for everyone. I thought it was a nice change in gameplay. \n\nThere are numerous other extra elements of gameplay which cannot be found in the Danganronpa 1 such as an arcade game. But again, it would be better not to divulge into the details in a review. \n\nStory:\nThere's not a lot which can be said without revealing any sort of plot points implicitly, however what I can say is that not only is the story engaging throughout, but the ending is surprisingly satisfying (although there are a lot of questions left unanswered - or maybe I just have too many questions).  \nAs expected, the story is filled with many twists and turns which naturally led me to write the first two sentences of this review with ease. Even if you think you know the answer, you never really know the answer. I took out a pen and paper just to draw diagrams and take notes to help me solve class trials. Although I didn't need to do this, the story was so engaging that I wanted to make sure I understood everything that was happening... NO GAME has made me do this before. Some of the class trials really help you learn creative ways of murdering people in real life too... Yeah the games great. Real inspiration. \n\nMusic:\nAs a self-declared video game music junkie, an amazng soundtrack instantly makes me fall in love with a game... I fell in love agan! \nFirstly, I'm glad quite a number of music pieces in the first Danganronpa retrurned (or were modified slightly) for the sequel. The majority of the music in the class trials remained the same as the first game and a few other pieces (such as Monokuma's theme) remain unchanged. This was not a problem for me at all! It did not feel as though any piece of music was overused or underused. As for the new pieces, they were true masterpieces; they even had me dancing from time to time. I can't dance, but who cares. \n\nConclusion:\nI didn't write this review in the hope of convicing people to buy the game, ironically. If you loved Danganronpa 1 then its more likely than not that you have already bought this game. In which case I'm preaching to the choir. If for some reason you hated Danganronpa 1, then the chances are you wouldn't even contemplate buying the second. I'm writing this review because this game damn well deserves reviews to be written for it. This is one of those rare games which needs to be talked about so much more than it already is. I never would have touched Danganronpa had it not been for ONE friend who just happened to have watched a Youtube lets play covering it. Both games in the series have opened up my eyes to a whole new genre... My friend must be the...

An instant buy if on sale, and still completely worth it at full price.\n\nLong version below.\n\n-----<< Non-Spoiler Review >>-----\n\nFor those interested in buying, I'm going to try to keep this as SPOILER FREE as possible. \n\nFirst of all, this game can be played without any prior Danganronpa knowledge but it is HIGHLY recommended you play the first Danganronpa entry before purchasing/playing DR2.  \n\n\n--<< WHAT IS IT >>--\n\nThe gameplay and premise in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is the similar it it's predecessor, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc.  If this is the first Danganronpa entry that you're going to play, then Danganronpa plays like a regular visual novel, but with mini-games and collectibles.  If you don't know what a visual novel is well it's technically like a book.  \n\nWhat makes Dangonronpa 2: Goodbye Despair different than any other visual novel?  Well it's not about finding your favourite waifu and giving them presents (okay there is some of it, but it's not the main point!) but rather it is a darker toned, muder-mystery type visual novel.  Sort of like a weird, zany, mix of Phoenix Wright and Zero Escape.\n\n--<< PREMISE >>--\n\nAs I said above the premise is similar to the first game.  You play as a rather normal looking male highschooler hoping to attend one of the worlds most prestigious school, the inspiring and incredible Hope's Peak Academy.  But before you long, you realize you've actually been thrown into some sick, battle royale-esque, life or death game with other extremely talented and goofy students.\n\nThe only way to escape this terrifying game is to MURDER another student and get away with it.  After a certain amount of time after a bodies discovery, a class trial will be held.  At this point you and the other students must discover the 'Blackened' (in other words the killer) and vote him/her as the culprit.  If you're wrong, well then.. everyone get's executed and the Blackened will escape the game!  \n\nP.S - There is a lot of death in this game.  \n\n--<< GAMEPLAY >>--\n\nNow that you get a gist of the premise and what type of game it is, now let's go over the general gameplay.  \n\nFor the most part, the game is a regular visual novel.  There are lots of text and lots to read.  The game is usually broken into segments of:\n\nFree Time\nInvestigations\nClass Trials\n\nFree Time is when you're allowed to do, well, whatever you want.  You can travel around and speak with the other students and learn more about them and you know, give your waifus presents and good stuff like that.  \n\nInvestigations are moments in the story where you are given an amount of time to go around investigate and gather clues before the Class Trials begin.\n\nLast but not least, the Class Trials are where your wits will be put to the test.  A lot of the minigames require you to logically point out/agree with mistakes in your classmates testimonies, and this part of the game is rather intense.   There are a lot of mini-games and they're rather difficult to explain so I'm not going to, but they vary from intense jeopardy type games to slicing words across the screen with a blade and then countering to rythmn mini-games. \n\nThere are also up to 3 different difficulty settings if you just want to casually enjoy the game or want to challenge yourself (and the game is challenging).\n\nThere is a sort of world map like hub where you get to walk around and travel to where you want to go.  After entering you can move a first-person camera around to click and investigate on certain objects.  There are also some first person dungeon-like maps where you can physically walk around and look at stuff but these are a bit more rare.  \n\nIf we compare the game to Danganronpa 1, it improves on this point in almost every aspect (I'm looking at you Hangman's Gambit mini-game.. -shudders-).  \n\n--<< MUSIC >>--\n\nIt's good.  Certain themes are quite memorable. \n\nDUAL AUDIO ! (Yayy!  JP VOICES!)\n\n--<< CHARACTERS >>-- \n\nIf not for the f**king insane story and cases you're going to have to solve, pick it up for the incredible and lovable cast of characters.  \n\nDanganronpa is a type of game where, well, you're never going to be sure who's going to survive to the end.  But because of the Dating Sim-like Free Time segments, there are some characters that you're going to really grow attached to.  Which is a good thing in most games.  But in this game, where you're never sure who's going to get the axe next.. It's a pretty scary feeling.  \n\nIt's also what makes Danganronpa games so fun in general.  There's something about picking out your favourite characters at the very beginning, getting to know them, and praying to god that they make it through this ordeal with you. \n\nIt's nothing like watching the cast of characters dwindle down, only to see a handful remain, growing to trust them, only to tragically realize another body has been found.  \n\nIt's rather heartbreaking.  \n\nI also enjoyed these characters more than the ones in the first game, but that's probably preference.  By the end of the first game I was probably only attached to 2 of the suvivors, but by the end of DR2 I was heartbroken, and attached to everyone that made it through.\n\n--<< STORY >>-- \n\nDon't want to go into detail here.  There are a huge amount of references to the first game which make this game much better to play.  But you can definitely jump into DR2 without playing the first one.  \n\nBut to sum it up, the story is amazing.  \n\n\n--<< CONCLUSION >>--\n\nIf you're a fan of Phoenix Wright, Zero Escape, or Visual Novels and are looking for something new, buy DR1 THEN buy this game.   It's challenging, decently long from 20-30 hours depending on how you pace yourself, with an INCREDIBLE story that only builds upon everything that was great from DR1 and makes it even better in DR2.\n\nIt's completely worth the cash.  Every cent of it.  Easilly one of the best games I've played in the last few years and I cannot wait for Danganronpa V3 to come out on the PS4/VITA.", "timestamp_created": 1462409704, "timestamp_updated": 1479954528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635812", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22800436": {"recommendationid": "22800436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051338911", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465109485}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've bought the first one and liked it you're obviously going to buy this one as well, I don't even know why you're reading this. \n\n+Better minigames and trial gameplay\n+Better characters\n+More emotional plot\n+Less monokuma\n+No more searching for coins\n\n-A lot more predictable, both in plot and murders.\n-A lot worse mechanics for moving between places. \n-Feels rushed.

I also played through Island Mode as well. I have a lot I wanna say, but it'll take some time to gather my thoughts.\n\n==WARNING FULL GAME SPOILERS==\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDangan Ronpa 2 is a good game. I liked it a lot. I really got into the story, the characters among other things. Though I think I'll start off with some issues I had with the games.\n\nCase 3 - The murder weapon that was used to kill Saionji was never found or even searched for. Having played Ace Attorney before, I know that in the (not exactly) words of Phoenix Wright \"Evidence like that would never be overlooked\". Apparently the reason why this was the case (according to the DR Wiki) is because the developers had originally intended for Kuzuryu to be killed during Case 3 rather than Saionji, however they decided to repeal this decision because \"Peko's sacrifice would have been for nothing\"... Honestly, wouldn't her sacrifice being all for nothing have been the more despairing? It ended up causing an issue with Case 3 that bothered me a lot besides Mikan being the killer :/ A friend of mine were discussing Case 3, and he believed that Case 3 would have been better if it was just Ibuki getting killed. \n\nThe Island Mode... I wish there was more attention to detail in it. Their only excuse was \"it's an extra mode anyway\", comon now, you could have the extra mode have more... extra in it. At least the endings in Island Mode were very satisfying for me. Island Mode is a fun mode at first, but I can see it getting a bit boring after you gained everyone's hope fragments and are just trying to get everyone's ending. After getting everyone's ending in Island, I can say confidently that I felt very happy. \n\nMonomi mode is pretty interesting. The keyboard controls suck, and I'm only able to use my controller by using JoytoKey. \n\nEvery murder in this game was very tragic. Either because of the murdered or the murderer. Teruteru was trying to kill Nagito to protect (Faker) Byakuya, but ended up killing him instead. Peko was trying her best to protect Kuzuryu and ended up being sacrificed in the end and with her loved one nearly dying too. Mikan is the one person you would have ever expected to commit murder. However, some stupid despair disease made her do it... I'll speak on this later. Nekomaru and Gundham fought it out, a \"mutual killing\" for the sake of their friends. Nagito, as twisted as he was, was trying to get rid of all despair, and he was inadvertently helping AI Junko.\n\nSpeaking of which, finding out that every classmate in DR2 was an Ultimate Despair was really surprising... Can you really imagine Nekomaru being an ultimate despair? I know I sure can't.\n\nThis ending isn't \"as\" despairing as DR1 in a way, but thinking about DR1 makes it more despairing. It makes you realize that everyone who died in DR1, is actually dead. No hope of ever coming back. This wasn't a dream. Celes, Ogami, Chihiro, Ishimaru, Mondo, Yamada, and everyone else is just dead. At least DR2 is kind of a dream. At least your friends are comatose. However, you could also say that's worse than death. Also, according to the wiki, because Mikan and Nagito had died knowing that the world they were in was all just a game, they have a higher chance of waking up than everyone else. DR2's ending really left me in between hope and despair.\n\nPicking up where I left off about Case 3, I really felt cheated about that one. Despair Disease? Really? Why didn't AI Junko ever use that again huh? Had everyone killed off. Despair Disease just felt like a crappy plot point to get an unlikely character to be a murderer. (My favorite DR character from each game just so happened to be the murderer in CASE 3). However, thinking on it I can also see its purpose. To give you a taste of how everyone once was. Everyone in this class except Chiaki was an ultimate despair. Even the most unlikely like Mikan had an evil and despicable personality in their past. This is why they're using the Neo World Program to restore hope. So they could change.\n\nHowever, after some thinking on it, I realize that the despair disease itself wasn't bad, it was how it was executed. Using despair disease to \"force\" a motive on someone is just really bad. It was nice with Akane, Ibuki, and Nagito just having the despair disease. If the Case 3 murder were just left off with Ibuki being killed, it would have been an even more interesting case, but no, they needed an extra person to die to parallel to DR1 case 3. \n\nAs for characters, I don't feel like going into it. My favorites were Mikan, Chiaki, Nekomaru, and Gundham. I will admit that Nagito is very well written, but he's a golden turd, ya know. Kuzuryu was also pretty good, and knowing that Kuzuryu was originally intended to die in Case 3 makes me kinda wish, or well, want to see how things would have went if it went the way it was originally intended to be. With Saionji being a survivor instead of Kuzuryu. (Pick your Loli Shota). Saionji is an annoying foulmouthed brat but... she grew on me. I kinda like her. Frankly, I don't feel any guilt in it. \n\nOther than that, the story was fantastic. I had many feels. \"The Day Before the Future\" made me cry. Soundtrack in general is pretty good. Kill Command was a great track during case 5. \n\nBut yeah, good game.", "timestamp_created": 1462321073, "timestamp_updated": 1462321073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513216", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22785332": {"recommendationid": "22785332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061529255", "num_games_owned": 637, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 3344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461382621}, "language": "english", "review": "pupupupupu", "timestamp_created": 1462315775, "timestamp_updated": 1462315775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22785310": {"recommendationid": "22785310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066367214", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502591084}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this on the PSP, Vita and am now playing through on PC.

The fan-service has gone far beyond the innuendo and subtext of the first game. The characters are more silly and less realistic, with a few being totally out of place.\n\nThere are some good points. Monokuma is still adorably evil and the new bear is a nice addition. There is a new batch of minigames.

Its premise is the same as the first - a large group of quirky characters find themselves robbed of their memories and stranded in a closed environment, with the only possibility of escape coming as a reward should they manage to commit a murder and escape identification as the culprit by their peers in the subsequent class trial. When this happens, they are allowed to go free while everyone else is executed, while if they fail, they themselves will be executed while everyone else gets to keep on living.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that I absolutely adore nearly everything about this game. The story is composed of (as you'd expect) a series of murder mysteries that take place within a greater overarching narrative wherein the protagonists try to plumb the mysteries of why they're being confined and forced to murder each other, as well as the events that lead them to their current circumstances. The characters are a good mix of anime tropes and actual development, and for the most part come off as very sympathetic and believable in their motivations, given the context and genre. Unlike other VNs, there's no branching routes or choices to be made in the main game, for the most part, and the story is entirely linear. There's a few parts that I felt were [i]a bit[/i] too fanservicey (and I don't mean the ones where the resident whimpering dojikko keeps tripping herself into ever more compromising and risque positions) but overall, the writing is excellent, hitting all the emotional beats and following a logical progression even when it appears to be devolving into complete and utter nonsense. Unfortunately, DangitRonpaul 2 continues the tradition started by 1, in that the best girl dies far too early on, but thankfully so does the worst, so I guess I can't really complain in the long run.\n\nThe actual gameplay consists of two parts - exploration, which consists of a looping side-scrolling section you use to navigate the game's islands, static scenes that resemble pop-up books where you interact with things and people using your cursor, and first person sections that you use to explore certain specific environments. The other major part is the investigation and trial section, where all of the actual meat of the gameplay is - you examine locations and talk to people in order to gather clues, and then deploy these clues in a trial setting in order to determine the culprit. Sometimes this takes the form of straight-up questions, sometimes you're asked to pick a relevant piece of evidence for a particular problem from your entire big list, and sometimes you have to play an infuriating minigame in order to accomplish the same thing as the latter two options, but most often you'll be going around a circle listening to everyone make propositions about what happened, and either calling out inconsistencies by shooting their words with the damning piece of evidence or backing them up using the same process. At other times, your peers will call you out themselves, prompting a verbal duel where you use the analog stick to slice apart their arguments in preparation for a final devastating rejoinder. I played on mean difficulty for both logic and action for all but the final chapter (where I set the action difficulty down a notch to kind) and I found the trials fair and for the most part fun. The order of events makes sense, and there's only a few instances which required significant leaps of logic in order to figure out the proper way to proceed, but there's enough twists and surprises in the mysteries to keep you guessing and doubting yourself even when you're pretty sure you've solved it.\n\nYou can't actually fail in either the evidence collection or the trials, of course - trying to leave a scene before you've got all the pertinent clues results in your character refusing to do so, and running out of influence (which is like HP) during a trial only reduces the reward you get at the end, and so should be entirely appropriate for products of the modern Western education system. My biggest complaint against the gameplay would be two minigames that seem entirely out of step with the theme of the game and completely unfun, and whose removal would have only served to make the game much better. The hangman's gambit game is just a very slow and often frustrating way of spelling out an obvious thing, and the snowboarding minigame is out-of-place and tacked-on, where its only relation to the events it's representing is that you sometimes answer multiple-choice questions. I honestly would have preferred just getting the multiple-choice questions alone without the bullshit snowboarding.\n\nIn terms of presentation - which is to say art, music and voice acting, I have nothing but good things to say. I played with Japanese voices, and you can tell that they really shelled out for an A-list cast. My only complaint in that regard is that when you get KanaHana to voice your character I only hear KanaHana and not the character. The art, meanwhile, is characteristically great, and even the lo-fi lo-res pop-up book look of the game's various environments has a distinct charm to it. Some of the CGs are a little spotty in parts, great in others, but are somewhat rare overall, and, most importantly, the character sprites you'll be looking at for most of the game look great.\n\nOne aspect which I felt could definitely be improved was in the localization - some of the translations felt more than a little awkward, and the script is riddled with minor but noticeable grammatical errors. Not enough to ruin the experience by any stretch of the imagination, but nonetheless enough to bug you if you're the same sort of friendless pedant as me.\n\nBeyond that, I'd say that the game is absolutely exceptional. Not only that, but it comes with a good amount of goodies, including a whole alternate route where the killing never started, which plays a bit more like a conventional school life VN, and a bonus LN by Narita Ryougo of Baccano and Durarara fame. If you were a fan of the first game, I would absolutely recommend you check this out. If you like VNs, anime, murder mysteries or good stories, I highly suggest you check out the first installment if you think it'd interest you even the slightest little bit.

Characters, at least to me, are more relatable than the first with less crazy attributes. The class trials have different game modes and the old ones have been polished.  Murder schemes are highly detailed with a lot of surprises as the debate goes along. There's now a Tomadachi like gameplay aspect with feeding it and the more you walk from place to place it levels it up. Now the story, another mechanical animal, a bunny take you and others on a \"school trip\". The concept of ultimates are the same but you are the one who can't remember their ultimate. The ultimates consist of athelete, breeder, luckster (again), mechanic, photographer, traditional dancer, swordswoman, team manager, chef, mafia leader (weird but ok i guess?), gamer, princess, nurse, and heir (I guess I could call it that). Don't question where the others from the first game are but I will say just to clairify it's after the first.\n\nSecond section for people who are missing out on the first game.\n\nStory:\n\n     Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is a detective game with a very interesting plot involving 15 high school students on an island known as Jabberwock Island with no memory of how they got there. The main game revolves around a stuffed bear named \"Monokuma\" taking over Monomi's school trip then starting a death game in which 15 high school students have to escape an island through murdering other students. Once a murder occurs the remaining students need to figure out the murderer and how they commited it or the innocent will all be \"punished\" (excecuted). The \"Blackened\" A.K.A the murderer will then be executed. You need to interact with items and other students to find clues to \"who dunnit\" as Monokuma frases it. \n\nMain gameplay:\n\nOnce all clues have been found you are taken to a \"class trial\" where Non-stop debates, Hamgman's Gambits, Logic Dives, PTAs, and Final arguments take place, in the nonstop debates you go through multiple characters talking back and forth and you need to use the facts that are chosen to poke a hole in someones testimony, or agree with a person on what they said. Hangman's Gambit is a game in which letters fly across the screen and  you need to spell a word or collection of words based on a question. Think of it as \"Hangman\" but with clues to the word and more chances to miss (depending on the amount of influence you have). Then your Final argument is where you place comic panels in a collection of pages refering to the events and order of events that took place. One on one debates require tactical slicing through a person's statements then you look for the correct weak point and contradiction. Also the PTA where you play a rhythm game then select the correct order of phrases poking a whole in their argument. Those are the main Class Trial game modes but there are more that are revealed. I recommend you play on \"mean\" difficulty or you will lose some gameplay and dialogue. These class trials on mean mode for me at least lasted about 2-3 hours each and provide great entertainment.\n\nSide gameplay:\n\nThe mode described as \"Free Time\" develops relationships with certain characters and once you interact with one enough you get a perk for  class trials. During class trials characters reveal many hidden sides to each of them and will develop them each time they're forced to execute their friend. There's a Tomadachi like gameplay aspect where when walking it will slowly level up this virtual pet. You can also gift this pet to bring up its \"hope meter\" the higher the meter, well you'll see what happens. Side events that are mandatory (I call them side because of it not being the promised gameplay) will catch you off-guard and others will help you to figure out what's oing on. Just a nice distraction from the trials.\n\nCritisism:\n1.Certain gameplay aspects can get annoying such as bullet lag in Non-Stop Debates and impossible to react Hangman's Gambits.\n\nPositives:\n1. Characters provide unique and interesting dialouge.\n2. Class trials are very exhilerating and have unique mechanics.\n3. The story progression is very nicely paced and many unsolved problems keep you wondering.\n4. Class trials have great gradual difficulty increase (for the most part.)\n5. Motives are very interesting and you normally end up interacting with them and provide more gameplay in completely different ways.\n6. Class Trials develop characters showing you who they really are.\n7.Class trials are perfectly crafted with the motives, weapon findings, and convincing others to who's the killer.\n8. Many unique points with side problems are a good distraction from all of the class trials.\n9. Transitioning is HIGHLY improved from the last game with side-scrolling sections.\n\nPersonal note:\n\nDanganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is the best game I have played this year combining a game genre I have never tampered with, along with familiar elements. You will surely grow to love the unique characters. the main gameplay is akin to many different genres keeping it fresh. After this spoilers for the rest of \"personal notes\" section. At one point in the game you're placed as [spoiler] Nagito [/spoiler] and you go in to the [spoiler] Final Dead Room [/spoiler]. This section reminds me with great memories of playing [spoiler] point and click adventure games [/spoiler].\n\nRating:\n\nMy last note: Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is a great improvement to the previous game and deserves a 10/10 for not being perfect with some flaws such as the previously mentioned annoying gameplay aspects and impossible reaction timing events.", "timestamp_created": 1462087312, "timestamp_updated": 1466488317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22737271": {"recommendationid": "22737271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198444503", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463173540}, "language": "english", "review": "Waifus?\nCheck.\nHusbandos?\nCheck.\nDeath?\nCheck.\nMystery and plot twists on plot twists?\nCheck.\nDespair or Hope? \nYou check which one and tell me. \n*Can't wait for part 3, this game was amazing*", "timestamp_created": 1462084592, "timestamp_updated": 1462084592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666734", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22737106": {"recommendationid": "22737106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091076616", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 1735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500133931}, "language": "russian", "review": "2 \u0440\u043e\u043d\u043f\u0430 \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u043c-\u0442\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 1, \u0430 \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u043c-\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442. \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044b \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0432 2, 3 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0435, \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u043e\u0431\u0432\u0438\u043d\u044f\u0435\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445-\u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445-\u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 ,\u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0438.... \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446, \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0434\u043e\u0445\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c =3= \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0447\u0435, \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0432 1 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438.\n\n\n\u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0432, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438 -

I beat the game on the hardest difficulty within 26-30 hours, with some bonus time sprinkled in.\n+ Character development, music, and art are still fantastic. They also put a lot more effort into this title, with cutscenes and environments having a bit more \"oomph\" to them.\n+ The story is very interesting despite being seemingly \"obvious\" from the beginning. A lot of twists and turns that, just like the last game, have you on the edge of your seat. It also resolves a LOT of the issues the first game left unfinished, and without a cliffhanger!\n\nCons:\n- PTA is... confusing. Not only does the timing feel off, they changed the system to where you have to hold it and let go according to the beat, which I admittedly must have missed completely in the explanation. What's funny about this is there is no system to correct this misunderstanding: you can freely spam the buttons without consequence, so that's what I ended up doing. A punishment system (especially on the hardest difficulty) to correct this mistake would have helped teach the mechanic.\n- The usage of a certain element as one of the motives felt like a cop-out. Some of the motives in this game in particular were pretty weak compared to the first one. \n- Even on hard mode, the experience was pretty easy to overcome, despite some ridiculous minigame sections. \n\nOverall:\nDanganronpa 2 is a solid follow-up to the first game.

The characters develop and change as the story progresses just like you would expect in an anime.  The game's story continued to keep me guessing and i was actually surprised by several of the plot twists.

To summarize for those who have never played these kinds of games before: You will play what seems like a dating sim for a good potion of the game. you get to know these students, develop a rapport, and generally A student will be murdered and you have to investigate a crime scene. collect enough evidence and a trial starts. This is where the game picks up. You'll go through rapid discussions about the case, and find contradictions that you shoot with 'truth bullets'. It's exciting, and a lot of it is left generally intact from the first game.  Now, for the sake of fairness. There are new ideas here I absolutely love. The game has this new feature where, during trials, students will contradict you, and you have to go toe to toe with them, literally cutting through their statements with (sigh) \"truth swords\" until you guide them to the statement you can contradict. It's a refreshing take on the whole idea and adds a dynamic that makes characters more present and gives that 'debate' feel to the whole experience. Not only that, but there are moments where you can [i]consent[/i] with another student. Agreeing with their statement in an easy to understand mechanic. The sequel even added to the challenge of the game by always having six bullets available to use regardless of difficulty (something I wanted to see more of in the first game). These are great additions that add more complexity to the entire game. \n              Unfortunately, every other gameplay element in the debates has been made worse. Spike acknowledges these problem areas during the tutorials and promises you they've fixed them. I assure, all they've done is taken weak, but ignore-able issues and made them intolerable. I'll explain. \n[B]Hangman's Gambit[/b]\n              Hangman's Gambit in the first game was a way of filling in a word (usually a singular, partially completed word) by shooting letters flying at the player. It was.... an admirable attempt, but nothing special. Now, the Hangman's Gambit has you floundering as letters attempt to crash into each other at a snails pace, letting you guess a larger, easier to mess up, completely blank phrase. The letters all fly at different speeds, which often leads to them colliding before they [i]even reach the screen.[/i] you then shoot these letters to combine them for some reason, and [i]then/[i] add them to the phrase. If you're terrible at this, you'll run into a game over without even guessing wrong. If you're good at this, you'll spend way too much time waiting for letters to populate the screen. Neither scenario is appealing.  \n\n[b] Closing Argument[/b]\n             Here, you piece together the entire crime manga style. Filling in missing segments of the story with images you have in your collection. in the first game, It was... admittedly awkward. Often times so many images looked similar, and had no descriptors, so it was hard to piece together what you were trying to do unless you were extremely careful. In this game, the problem is addressed, only to replaced by an entirely different issue. While they take the time to describe what each of the images represent, the phrases are extremely vague. and they only give you five at a time. forcing you to piece together the scene based on what little selection they gave you. I found myself struggling to appease the game's logic in whatever order this was asking for, something I almost never had to do in the first game. And if the player is  struggling to find the answer in a game that revolves around a clear and sensible logic, you are not accomplishing what you set out to do.  Imagine if Monkey Island or Sam and Max had a health bar that drained every time you tried to rub two unrelated objects together. That's an accurate summation of what this mode has become.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n                   I'm going to say a phrase here that defines a great deal of games, so bear with me: [b]Stupidity = Plot Convenience[/b]. What I mean by this is that characters will go out of their way to do something ridiculous or nonsensical for the sake of adding drama, or making a story work.. A good mystery has all the pieces presented to you and still it is a challenge on how to piece it all together. If you leave out critical pieces of evidence for the sake of adding dramatic tension, it weakens the mystery. There's a lot of trials in both games where a character says .\"I found this thing that wasn't important.\" halfway through the trial that, in fact, is utterly vital. It doesn't help that character motivations are all the more ludicrious this time around. I'm honestly convinced they have no idea what hope and despair is, because they throw it around like a child discovering a curse word. Possibly the most inexcusable thing is how unlikable several characters are. The first game had plenty of them (oh my god, byakuya) but some of these people are somehow worse. What is aggravating most of all is that if you remove a great deal of the padding, There's not a great deal of story to be had. \n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI think what angers me the most about this game is how the game is aware of how terrible some of its writing and gameplay is. It often makes jokes like. \"haha, aren't amnesia plots stupid?\" and then just keeps using it! If you point out a trope and just continue unashamedly, it's just a way of saying. \"I could have done better.\" So why didn't you?\n\nIf a game doesn't care enough to write a better story in a story based game, you could honestly go with better. I really wanted to like this. If you can stomach a weak story, go for it. If not, this game isn't really worth the aggravation.", "timestamp_created": 1461791796, "timestamp_updated": 1461791813, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.331479", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22668388": {"recommendationid": "22668388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271116378", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504484433}, "language": "italian", "review": "I've just finished this game, and all i can say about is that this i truly the fucking best i've ever played.\nWork of art, everything was perfect.\n10/10 best game ever.", "timestamp_created": 1461789501, "timestamp_updated": 1461789501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22668159": {"recommendationid": "22668159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258550247", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475852653}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story-telling and improve class-trial.\n//In the end, my waifu died. lol", "timestamp_created": 1461788580, "timestamp_updated": 1461788580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22665910": {"recommendationid": "22665910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139756861", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474200980}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely brilliant.\nIf you are into these kind of games then you will feel empty when you finished the game.\nThe telltale element, perfect.\nYou will lose track of time while playing this game.\nThe reason that happend to me was because of the story they were telling. \n\nDo not read anything about this game on the internet(Very spoiler sensitive game).

Aclarado esto vayamos a los puntos\n\nPRIMERO\n\nDise\u00f1o de personajes: dejando de lado que visualmente al menos a mi gusto son preciosos, la manera de crear a los personajes en Danganronpa siempre ha sido... curiosa. Me aclarar\u00e9 lo que hace la saga Danganronpa es ''jugar'' con los topicos, en el primero exagerandolos, dando asi lugar a un otaku muy otaku, un motero muy macarra y una modelo muy guarra. En Danganronpa 2 al contrario la cosa no va de exagerarlos, si no mas bi\u00e9n de... como decirlo... negarlos. Lo que quiero decir es que en este los personajes parecen hasta esforzarse para no parecerse a lo que se espera de ellos aunque lo hagan de manera mas o menos sutil, estan personajes como Gundham, Akane o Fuyuhiko en los que es muy poco sutil y otros como Chiaki en los que es mas sutil, un ejemplo de esta negaci\u00f3n de topicos es por ejemplo la gimnasta, el topico anime para las gimnastas es que sean peque\u00f1as y por norma general una persona elegante y refinada mientras que en danganronpa la gimnasta es una bestia, en el sentido metaf\u00f3rico de la palabra, claro.\n\nSEGUNDO\n\nSecuelas... : Danganronpa 2 es un gran ejemplo de como hacer una secuela, Danganronpa supone que el jugador ha jugado, o al menos visto el anime, la primera y por eso se r\u00ede en tu cara las primeras horas de juego... no lo tomare por spoiler porque son realmente las primeras horas del juego, empiezas entras en clase y hay un grupo de personas cada una mas rara que la anterior esperando en medio de clase, hablas con ellas y nadie sabe como hab\u00e9is llegado aqui y de golpe empieza esa cinem\u00e1tica que tu ya conoces del anterior juego (o anime), tu esperas a Monokuma pero en vez de eso aparece un conejo blanco vestido de Magical Girl que al agitar su varita hace que la clase se vaya a la mierda y estas de golpe en una isla paradis\u00edaca y te dice que vayas por ahi a llevarte bien con todos... \u00bfEsto no iba de matarnos?, y tu vas por ahi esperando a ver cuando palma alguien y el prota tambi\u00e9n se queja todo el rato y esta esperando que ocurra algo malo pero nada... te dedicas a llevarte bien con la gente... hasta que el prota se relaja un poco llega Monokuma y todo se va a la mierda y entonces te encuentras a ti mismo preguntandote que co\u00f1o hace aqui Monokuma (vease final del primer Danganronpa) y todos esos secretos que se revelaban al final del uno te los suelta en la cara por que es una gilipollez esconderselos al jugador si este ya los sabe del primero... A lo que quiero llegar con todo esto es que el juego sabe lo que espera el jugador y juega con tus expectativas.\n\nA lo que quiero decir con todo esto es que Danganronpa 2 sorprende.\n\nY ya esta eso era todo lo que quer\u00eda (que no lo que ten\u00eda puesto que Danganronpa 2 tiene para hablar largo y tendido) hablar de Danganronpa 2, espero que os haya sido \u00fatil.", "timestamp_created": 1461691445, "timestamp_updated": 1479947735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22645006": {"recommendationid": "22645006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200646529", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 5591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471757176}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6beb\u65e0\u7591\u95ee\u662f\u4e00\u90e8\u795e\u4f5c\uff0cpsp\u548cpsv\u4e0a\u6ca1\u73a9\u8fc7pc\u4e0a\u7ed9\u8865\u4e86\n10/10 \u6211\u7ed9\u6ee1\u5206\n1.\u6bd4\u8d77steam\u4e0a\u76841\u4ee3\u5f39\u4e38\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e8c\u4ee3\u7684\u5f39\u4e38\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u754c\u9762\u6362\u4e86\uff0c\n\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\n2.\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u786c\u5e01\u89e3\u9501cg\uff08\u5e26\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\uff0cmovie\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\n3.\u5267\u60c5\u611f\u89c9\u957f\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u9519\u89c9\n4.\u5b66\u7ea7\u5ba1\u5224\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u65b0\u73a9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5012\u662f\u8033\u76ee\u4e00\u65b0\uff0c\u65e7\u7684\u73a9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u4e0e\u524d\u4f5c\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\n5.\u4e2a\u4eba\u611f\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u5267\u60c5\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u70b9\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\n6.\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u89c9\u5f97\u6709\u4e9b\u3002\u3002\u3002\u591a\u4f59\uff0c\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22", "timestamp_created": 1461674235, "timestamp_updated": 1461674897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646762", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22644911": {"recommendationid": "22644911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194631775", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478902849}, "language": "english", "review": "My absolute favorite game played this back last year on the vita now i can play it steam aswell highly reccomend to all vn or mystery game fans (but it would be preferable if you bought number 1 first )\n\n\nand a side note to those who have played the first game but not this on yet if you want to see the events that take place after danganronpa 1 i suggest getting the vita game Danganronpa another episode ultra despair girls which may or may not be released on steam soon enough\n\nThis game sucks\nhttps://33.media.tumblr.com/f98c130d9b7280a590e2addff3af5791/tumblr_mtcsco8bZg1sy6ocjo1_500.gif", "timestamp_created": 1461673770, "timestamp_updated": 1461673822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504814", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22644232": {"recommendationid": "22644232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077030059", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487078471}, "language": "english", "review": "love...love...", "timestamp_created": 1461670038, "timestamp_updated": 1461670038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22643939": {"recommendationid": "22643939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045949344", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477528106}, "language": "english", "review": "lol This game is a mystery type visual novel most of the time with faster paced thought provoking mini games to keep things interesting.

I'm not a guy who usually likes to read a whole lot. Books are hard for me to pay attention to, as is reading in general. But these two games have made me push through that for a story that has left me constantly on the edge of my seat.\n\nDanganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, (I still hate how they alternated that title from \"Farewell Despair Academy\", but what can you do...), has taken what made Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, and somehow amplified it even more. During the final class trial, I felt myself constantly leaned forward, paying attention to every detail I could. Even after having originally read summaries of the games, (at the time it was released only on PSP/Vita and I didn't want to pirate it), I still felt absolutely overwhelmed (in a good sense!) about how well this game manages to pull story off.\n\nI honestly cannot begin to think of anything bad on this game other than it's odd sense of perversion as compared to the first one... I mean, I'm not [i]entirely complaining[/i] about it, but I felt like there was a lot more perverted humour in 2 as compared to 1. I mean, for god's sake, you get the girls' panties when you max your free time interaction with them! Though I only know this from Chiaki's perspective. Chiaki best girl.\n\nAdmittedly, though, the final chapter's... 'asthetic', shall we put it, put me off and put a heavier strain than usual on my eyes. Other than that, I have absolutely zero complaints about the game(s).\n\nPlease, for the love of god, and for the sake of Hope, please, play the Danganronpa series. I can see why it got so popular a while back now.\n\n*QUICK EDIT:\nI DO actually have to complain about the difficulty settings.\nEven when playing under the easiest settings, during things like nonstop debates you find yourself loaded with 3-5+ truth bullets. This was not at all the case in Danganronpa: THH. Even under the standard difficulty, you often only got 1 bullet, maybe 3 on some of the debates.\n\nBut that's what game guides are for, right?", "timestamp_created": 1461315334, "timestamp_updated": 1461315483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22563385": {"recommendationid": "22563385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028764096", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461311414}, "language": "english", "review": "I will recommend this game to anyone who loves Visual Novels in general. This along with Zero Escape are the pinnacle of Visual Novels for me. This series, along with Zero Escape, does one thing that few VNs do; it keeps me interested until the end.\n\nThe problem with VNs for me is that the pacing is horrible. Since the pacing is so bad, I get bored really fast. I know a lot of VNs are about the fan service payoff. But I get bored before that point is even reached. So what does Danganronpa and Zero Escape have that those games lack? Intrigue.\n\nBoth Danganronpa and Zero Escape have the same issues as a standard VN. Slow pace, exposition dumps (especially in the final two hours of gameplay), and all that good stuff. But what these two games do is keep me interested throughout because of the fact that they're mysteries and pretty decent puzzle games. The slow pace can be fixed because I'm interested in knowing about how these people got in such bizarre situations. Because of that, I don't notice how slow things move, or the exposition, plus most of the characters are super interesting.\n\nA slight aside, I prefer this series over something like Phoenix Wright (the inspiration for Danganronpa more or less) because it's mystery encompasses the entire game. This makes the game feel complete. As if everything up to that point was leading to something larger than the sum of its parts. A lot of Phoenix Wright cases feel contained, which makes sense for the game, but I just enjoy larger mysteries.\n\nAll and all, excellent game.

O ambiente investigativo se mant\u00e9m o mesmo, onde voc\u00ea precisa bancar o detetive ap\u00f3s acontecer um assassinato e cabe a voc\u00ea encontrar todas as pistas e imaginar um cen\u00e1rio que fa\u00e7a sentido e aponte para o verdadeiro culpado. Seus colegas dentro do jogo tamb\u00e9m poder\u00e3o te ajudar a clarear sua mente quando estiver em d\u00favida por conta das discuss\u00f5es que ele promovem, e at\u00e9 mesmo as auto-reflex\u00f5es do protagonista.\n\nO clima durante as sess\u00f5es de julgamento d\u00e1 uma tonalidade mais s\u00e9ria e principalmente din\u00e2mica gra\u00e7as a trilha sonora, que ao menos no meu caso, combina t\u00e3o bem que me faz entrar no clima de \"preciso descobrir a verdade, custe o que custar!\" Com v\u00e1rios tipos diferentes de mini-game e com novos saindo quentinhos do forno, o julgamento torna-se incrivelmente divertido e mantendo a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que voc\u00ea \u00e9 fundamental para revelar a verdade. Ou seja, divertir-se enquanto fica s\u00e9rio pra ganhar, wee.\n\nN\u00e3o houve mudan\u00e7as dr\u00e1sticas na trilha sonora, adicionaram algumas m\u00fasicas e manteram mais um bocado das antigas. Apesar de me dar uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que falta algo na m\u00fasica em alguns momentos porque se voc\u00ea j\u00e1 jogou o 1 vai sentir que as m\u00fasicas est\u00e3o ficando demasiadamente repetidas, algumas s\u00e3o caracter\u00edsticas da franquia. Mas ainda fico um pouco incomodado.\n\nOs personagens s\u00e3o ok. Alguns realmente d\u00e3o aquele ar de protagonismo e que realmente s\u00e3o Ultimate (express\u00e3o utilizada para falar de seus super talentos) por qual eles s\u00e3o conhecidos, mas outros pareceram faltar com capricho e n\u00e3o me trazem ar algum, que n\u00e3o foi algo que me preocupei no primeiro jogo da s\u00e9rie. Constantemente eu fico pensando no decorrer do jogo se eu vou me acostumar com todos eles, mas com certeza j\u00e1 tenho um certo favoritismo pela Chiaki, deve ser s\u00f3 quest\u00e3o de tempo mesmo!\n\nNa minha opini\u00e3o, todos os f\u00e3s de jogos de anime deveriam dar uma chance para Danganronpa pois quando eu o joguei pela primeira vez achei uma modalidade de jogo totalmente inovadora e que n\u00e3o falhou em me prender. Para aqueles que j\u00e1 jogaram o primeiro jogo e n\u00e3o sabem se \u00e9 uma boa ideia comprar o dois, s\u00f3 tenham em mente que as sess\u00f5es de julgamento s\u00f3 melhoraram nessa segunda franquia e, o que talvez voc\u00ea n\u00e3o possa gostar s\u00e3o os personagens. O clima investigativo e de esperan\u00e7a s\u00f3 melhoraram (o que percebi muito bem s\u00f3 no primeiro cap\u00edtulo) e... plot twists com um dos personagens logo no come\u00e7o, o climax j\u00e1 come\u00e7a t\u00e3o cedo!

Class trail minigames are better, in my opinion, and the addition of agreements/consents to the nonstop-debate game adds a whole other dynamic- pursuing what others say, instead of shutting them down. Of course, this all has to be done in linear fashion, there's still only one way to do any given trial. \nAs for the main story, it's pretty different from DR1, but not in a bad way at all- the 'player' character (In this case, Hajime Hinata) is more relatable, in my opinion, and the cast is as colourful and diverse as ever. Even the characters I wasn't too keen on grew on me over time. The location is drastically different, and so are your methods of travel, but it's mostly improvement in my eyes.\n\nA solid sequel.

I had to know what happened next!\n\nPositives:\n\n-  The writing.  Oh God, the writing is totally spot on.  Full of strangely translated Japanese-isms, chock full of memorable characters, and truly intricate mysteries, what else do you really need?\n-  The art style is insane.  Anime/Manga stylings crossbred with 80s retrowave neon, topped off with a heady froth of island beauty.  Never has such an idyllic setting been host to such nefarious deeds.\n-  Voice Acting.  Not all of the dialogue is spoken, but the stuff that is is brilliant.  Even the random punctuating exclamations are pretty funny in their own right.\n-  Nekomaru.  Big muscle dude wearing his coach's whistle on a big ass chain around his neck, willing to give anyone deep tissue massages?  Pinch me.\n-  The adult-oriented nature of it all.  Going from Phoenix Wright to this was like jumping in the deep end of a freezing swimming pool.  Here's to hoping there's more Nekomaru oriented fanservice.  }:D\n\nNegatives:\n\n-  If you minimize the game for any length of time, it freezes up.\n-  No autosave, so you have to remember to make periodic save stops... lest a minimized freeze-up eats up 2 hours of gameplay.  (Speaking from personal experience, in both games.)\n-  The next Danganronpa game isn't due out in the US for quite some time.

It is much better than the first one (not saying that was bad, not by a long shot) in every way. The characters are amazing, the story is a great expansion of what we learned in the first game, and the mysteries are fun to solve. The gameplay itself is almost the same as the first game, but with 2 more minigames. The first minigame is called logic dive, and you go on a mind snowboard (yes it's weird) and go down the right logic paths.

Other than that, 100% recommendable for people who enjoy Visual Novels.\n\nHere's to hoping they bring Danganronpa 3 to Steam as well.", "timestamp_created": 1461091599, "timestamp_updated": 1461121001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505581", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22520480": {"recommendationid": "22520480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079665112", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469412367}, "language": "english", "review": "Why are you looking at the reviews if you already played the first game? ...........................................................................\nWhat are you waiting for?

The second game is much much better than the first, storywise. I've already read the contents of this game online but have always wanted to play it. If you haven't played danganronpa 1, do your best to avoid all spoilers if you plan to get into the series!\n\nThe game feels very inspired by Phoenix Wright. Lots of comedic moments, and a handful of despair inducing ones. The gratuitous amount of \"peptol bismol\" blood, language, and setting give it a somewhat more mature feeling intended for an older young-adult audience.\n\nYou've got a murder happening, an investigation, and then a class trial. In the class trial, characters will discuss ideas like the murder weapon, setting, how it was done, etc. When a contradiction occurs, you fire evidence in the form of \"truth bullets\" and break them down in order to progress/unravel the story. One prominent feature added is the ability to consent, or agree with someone. Instead of firing truth bullets to break a contradiction, you can actually support someone's idea.\n\nIt's all very linear, keep that in mind. But it's set up very well that the entire trial feels tense and revelations feel rewarding. Game difficulty isn't terribly hard. There are three difficulties in game but they don't really impact the gameplay. Just like in Phoenix Wright, if you run out of \"health\", you start over from a checkpoint and resume the trial.\n\nPros:\nVisually great\nGood story\nCharacter cast is significantly better IMO, more relatable than DR1\nOST is prettttttty good.\nOption of either English or Japanese audio\n\nCons?:\n\n1. Some characters have like a pink-magenta outline that wasn't cropped out correctly. It's especially noticeable when you zoom in on them during class trials. Not a big deal as it does not affect gameplay, but it looks odd.\n\n2. Game may lag during cutscenes. Even though it's a visual novel, a high end computer may experience stuttering during cutscenes due to v-sync and antialiasing, both of which are adjustable before the game is booted up.  Again, not a big deal since it can be fixed with relatively no hassle.\n\nPS: Chiaki best girl\nPPS: Acquired Truth Bullet: Embarassing Pose", "timestamp_created": 1461089361, "timestamp_updated": 1461091617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22519732": {"recommendationid": "22519732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040093463", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 4714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500256554}, "language": "english", "review": "At the moment I just cleared the first trial, so I might slip-up and accidentally reveal some self-fulfilling spoilers but I'll try my best not to.\n\nDR2 is a direct sequel to DR1 and while I highly recommend DR1 in its own right, the opening to DR2 spoils some bits of the end of DR1, and some of the more subtle character moments are going to be lost on you if have never played or seen anything of DR1; and I suspect playing this first is going to ruin part of the mystery of the first game, as DR2 is more self-aware of its crazier twists than DR1 was right out of the gate.\n\nHangman's Gambit.

The plot and story is alot more twisted than the first which I love alot, and the players of this killing game are just as memorable, almost better than the first group. I really do love this game, however, the controls in this one when using keyboard is ultimately confusing, mapping is all wrong and the release was plauged with screen tearing, frame rate issues.\n\nThe first game was flawless and the control scheme was perfect, everything was perfect that made the game flow well. For example in this version, during the Trials, selecting the final blow, it explains that WASD is chosen to make the correct words, however on inspection, it was mapped to other keys, ZXCV. I would have to change the mapping in settings and another few annoyances as well. Also during the game, even though I chose to have \"keyboard and mouse\" buttons to show up on tutorials, it would show the control buttons instead, which was very confusing.\n\nThe next main thing was the exploration of the Hotel grounds and walking from place to place. which was very akward to do as well. When walking left and right during the island exploration, in addition to pressing the buttons, I had to wiggle the mouse to move as well, or I would just use Q or E to skip to the next spot (which made it easier). When navigating the hotel grounds it was the same way, because in the first game the navigation was in 3d, in ways it was simlar, but I had to wiggle the mouse to even move. Dashing worked, but I still had to wiggle the mouse.\n\nOther from that, the story is too good to turn down just like the first one, so I have to recommend this 100%, even though there are a few minor/major issue depending on the issue to someone else, this game is perfect in all ways. I recommend using a controller with this game, ultimately because it feels better to play, and it is not the Vita port, it lacks the touch screen.\n\n8.5/10\n\nPros:\n\n-- Briliant storytelling.\n-- Great soundtrack, something that you want to listen to again and again.\n-- Fun trial based combat, you have to think and gather information, piece it all together in a rushed situation.\n-- UI is great, improvment to the first PC port.\n-- Characters are awesome, even harder to read than the first game.\n\nCons:\n\n-- Alot of black bars in \"window mode\", a sense of poor screen optimization.\n-- Contol scheme for keyboard is wrong, even when explained in the tutorials.\n-- Navigation in some scenes were subpar, hard to move without wiggling mouse.\n-- Screen tearing (Had to tweak v-sync in settings) - very minor\n-- Audio queues are sometimes slow, making it hard to perform some of the mini-games during trial.", "timestamp_created": 1461083149, "timestamp_updated": 1461083149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22518184": {"recommendationid": "22518184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036533996", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508167969}, "language": "english", "review": "A visual novel with minigames, murder, and the \"feels\", you'll have a harder time picking out the murderers this time around.

Be careful if you want to go into this game completely blind.>\nINTRO:\nDanganronpa 2:Goodbye Despair is the first game but majorly improved and polished. I'm sure that much is obvious since it's a sequel. The game is about some highschool students attending this amazing school called Hope's Peak Academy. Only the best of the best can attend it and those who do go are called \"Ultimates\". 2 is about these Ultimates going on a trip to a lovely island called Jabberwock Island. But... then some bad stuff happens with some talking teddy bears.\n\nThe game features a great soundtrack and the visuals are quite nice too. It's practically a visual novel but with a lot of action in the way of \"Class Trials\". If you're a big anime fan then this game is also for you. It features jokes and cliches from manga/anime.\n\nMUSIC: The soundtrack is really nice. It can make you feel tense, happy, excited, pumped and a bunch of other positive/negative emotions. I really enjoy the fact the music can instill the right emotions at the right times. Though... some of the tracks are memorable some just get left in the dust. The tracks are usually displayed at the top right with the name.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nThe characters are all unique so you can't confuse them with each holding an ultimate talent and filling in some type of trope. Not all of them are likeable in my opinion but I didn't mind going through there conversations and jokes. There's a lot of humour in this game and no matter your sense of humour, you'll probably get a chuckle out of it at some point. Oh yeah, there's a mechanic called \"Free Time\". When the story isn't advancing you can spend time with the people on the island. This stregthens your bonds and results in some funny/pleasant/weird/deep conversations. You can also gift them a present to make the bond even stronger. You gain hope shards from doing this and then you can use those to buy skills. You gain a small little thing added to the person you interacted with's report card. Each person can have there report card filled in 6 times. After this interacting with them doesn't do much. If you're a completionist you can try to max everyone's report card. Thought this will take beating the game and doing Island mode OR doing multiple playthroughs of the regular game.\n\nCRAP I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO CATEGORIZE:\nDanganronpa 2 revolves around hope and despair. You can feel these two emotions through out with other emotions mixed in too. I have yet to get bored of a mechanic BUT I can see some which may annoy/get boring. You can level up with a cap of 99. You gain xp by walking around, examining and talking to people. Walking around can be insanely slow so there's a sprint button but while sprinting you take less steps and therefore get less exp. There's a weird pet mechanic which is like a Tomogatchi and as you walk it grows. You can give it presents and it will gain hope or you can leave it and it'll gain despair. If it reaches max despair it dies. It has a little pop-up in the bottom left when you should really check-up on your pet. Island mode is unlocked after beating the game and is a little sim which allows you to date all the characters. It'll take at least.. 4 playthroughs to get every characters ending. Though I haven't beaten the game I have read about how Island mode exists and I'm guessing it's 2's version of School mode. It's probably improved. Not sure.\n\n\ntl;dr:\nBuy this game, it's great. :^)", "timestamp_created": 1461074198, "timestamp_updated": 1461074232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair sequel to Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is not your typical visual novel where you will find romance and everything goes smoothly. Characters will die whether you hate them or love them. It has the touch of mystery, horror, point and click and detective work all in the mix of this visual novel not to mention the story is very interesting with and filled with unexpected twists around.\n\n[h1]The Story[/h1]\nThe story is definitely one of the most interesting mystery and crazy story I have read. It has many plot twists and it is very confusing in a sense that it manages to conceal the truth until the very end of every case. I always end up suspecting the wrong character as the murderer, which surprises me and the cases are very detailed . [Especially for the final case]\n\nThe story takes place after the events of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. You will be placed into the shoes of Hajime Hinata. Who appears to be in front of Hope\u2019s Peak Academy a government funded school for the privileged elite of society. A door then suddenly appears in front Hajime Hinata which leads to a classrooms where he meets his classmates that has also ended up in the same situation as him of not knowing how they ended up in the class room. After some verbal exchanges in between them, their teacher named Usami revealed to them that they are on a school trip on Jabberwock Island a paradise-like island. Usami then tells them they are on a school trip and they are to befriend each other to gain hope fragments and make their hope grow. What could go wrong here? Right?:) Of course not!! What are you thinking? Upupupupu Monokuma suddenly appears and takes control of the island, announcing that the students must participate in his murderous game if they wish to escape. Leaving them in despair, being placed in a game where they are being pressured subconsciously to kill their friend or not to kill in order to escape. But if they do not kill they may become the next target with all these pressure building up around them it is bound that someone will give in to it and it starts to turn ugly for them.\n\n[b]Characters are very memorable,[/b] each of them are unique and have some special traits about them. Personally my favorite character in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is Nanami Chiaki \u4e03\u6d77 \u5343\u79cb The Ultimate Gamer, she has that warm and cute side to her and is always there for Hajime Hinata [You in this case]. She is also highly knowledgeable about all genres of video games. She has a tendency to collect her thoughts before she starts speaking, so when she meets someone for the first time, the conversation is rather slow.\nThough she\u2019s very passionate about video games, if Nanami Chiaki gets too comfortable she falls asleep, when she is standing up or midway through a conversation or even in a tense situation where killings are occurring.\n\n[h1]Audio and Visual Elements[/h1]\n[b]Visual Elements [/b]\u2013 Many things to note here is that the backgrounds, CGs and character sprites used in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair are very consistent with each other in turn made the whole visual novel as whole looks smoother. This is really a huge thing for me overall I absolutely adore the artstyle used in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. I have played many visual novels where the character sprites are not consistent with the backgrounds at all and then in turn they do not blend in nicely causing them to not look nice or\u201csmooth\u201d at all. The sprites used are pretty much being used all the time in game except for the CGs.\n\n[b]Audio Elements [/b]- Music is a very important factor to consider in a visual novel because music has a great ability to set the mood and make things flow from then on. Though Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair reused many of the first game\u2019s music but added a few new additions. Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair definitely has this executed perfectly. Each time the \u201cphase\u201d of the story chances, the BGM would change with it to set the mood and tension around the characters. Lets take for example in \u201clogic dive\u201d it uses this song called \u201cDrive Drive\u201dit is a new game mode that has been added into, I absolutely love the BGM as it is so fast paced and fits in with all the action that is going on.\n\n[h1]To sum up[/h1]\nWill I recommend this? Simple answer is yes. I would definitely recommend this awesome visual novel if you are the type of person who looks for gameplay in a visual novel as this definitely has loads of gameplay to offer and for people who loves detective work with dark mysteries waiting to be uncovered and solved go for it. Honestly I am not a fan of having gameplay in my visual novel I am more of the type of person that prefers to just click on my mouse all day long, but Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair has so much to offer, as it manages to rope me into with its rich story and great music with good gameplay. Though there are some things to point out on \u201changman\u2019s gambit\u201d in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair compared to  Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc hangman gambit in Danganronpa 2 has quite a difficulty spike as it requires more attention to get the letters right and has a higher chance of failing.

Taking itself just the right amount of seriously, it combines the two concepts into one majestic game that is just as likely to confuse you with its quirks as it is to confuse you with its complex logic problems. Once the inevitable murder of one of your classmates happens, the game splits into two parts: the murder investigation, and the class trial. During the investigation, you're left to explore the island in 2D adventure game style, finding evidence and speaking with witnesses. After an arbitrary amount of time passes that the game dictates, the class trial starts. Found in the form of you deducing the murderer behind your classmates death, the puzzles are outrageously unique. Contrary to the first Danganronpa, murders are less predictable. The events are complex, and much more detailed than in the first game, and while they are off the wall and require metaphorical backflips to deduce, the answers are always logical. \n\nOn the other hand, the trial part of the game is more annoying than logical. Playing out like Phoenix Wright, you present your evidence that you collected after the murder happened, and present your theories. Unfortunately, much like Phoenix Wright, you don't actually get punished for guessing incorrectly. Selecting the wrong answer will cause the game to immediately point out that it's incorrect, and if you get too many incorrect, you have to start the entire trial over again. In addition, your many other classmates in the trial don't actually solve anything. Their only reason for existence is to challenge your deductions, and to make you play worthless minigames that don't actually add anything to the story, but are rather put in place to ensure that the player is truly [i]understanding[/i] the storyline. Unfortunately many of these minigames require exact input of the answer that the game wants you to input. You could have a thorough understanding of the murder and events, and yet fail due to phrasing or the exact word isn't what the game was looking for. Multiple trials take place during the game.\n\nIn addition to the murders, gameplay also involves a simple social simulator. You can become friends with the other students, giving them their preferred gifts and them giving you information about themselves in return. It's all rather shallow, but nothing that detracts from the overall story.\n\nThe storyline is fantastic. It all comes together at the end in the most magnificent way possible, and compared to the complete predictability of the first game, is entirely unpredictable until the very end. The characters are all interesting, the dialogue is genius in the most absurd way possible, the voice acting is top notch, the puzzles are superb, the mystery is complex, the soundtrack is decent, and the graphics are unique. Much like a storybook, your environments seem to be made of paper, and \"pop up\" into existence, and the beautiful island can be fully explored without all the bloodstains after you complete the main storyline and unlock \"Island Mode\", an alternate reality where the murders never take place and you spend your days levelling up your students and performing activities. Not the deepest of game modes, but it's a nice addition for those concerned with longevity.\n\nThe only true downside are the minigames. Longer and more annoying than in Danganronpa 1, but just as finicky and arbitrary, these only serve to frustrate. However, the storyline more than makes up for it. If you like complex puzzles, unpredictable yet intelligent storylines, absurd humor, or you simply want to play something unique, unlike any game you've played before, then give Danganronpa 2 a try.

That won't affect the criticism in the end, but you should know that because of FTC guidelines, as well as the whole morals thing you know? [/i]\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WexUi8csBho\n \n[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I]  Anyone who wants a mystery or an interesting story. Hell, for everyone.  [/i]\n\n[u] Summary: [/u]\nThe Danganronpa series is the Phoenix Wright series on steroids. And it's one of the best experiences that I've had in the past 10 years. Danganronpa 2 received the highest score of games I've formally reviewed on the Youtube channel: and that's for good reason: it's fantastic from all sides of the spectrum. A good murder mystery needs to have a couple of basic elements to be successful, and Danganronpa 2 knocks each of them out of the park. An interesting set of characters with great backstories that make you connect with them almost immediately: which makes the pain of possibly losing/being betrayed by them that much better. The game does misdirection better then any other murder mystery out there, in particular with those who played the first game. This game knows how to get into your head, and knows how to play off what you may be thinking to twist it around on you. The game hooks you and doesn't let you go, and any minor problems I had with the game were knocked out by its sheer strengths of writing and drama. \n\nIf you're looking for traditional gameplay, Danganronpa isn't that, but it's able to keep you interested with drama. If you haven't played the first, I'd recommend playing that first. It's great. Then play Danganronpa 2. Not only would you be glad that you did, but you'll remember the experience for a long, long time.\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Intrigue, Intrigue, Intrigue. This is a murder mystery, it lives off the mystery and shines throughout. You'll want to complete this all in one go, just because you'll be hooked. But you can't because....\n[*] A fantastic set of characters that you'll connect to. There's a good variety here, and you'll want to complete each of their arcs to get a true understanding of their complex nature. \n[*] Writing is great. Messing with your head and expectations is what the game does best, and it does it in an interesting and compelling way.\n[*] Misdirection. If you think you know what to expect....you're probably in for some surprises.\n[*] Length. 24-30 hour campaign that doesn't slow down. And that's only for the main story. There's a bang for buck here, even if it's a Visual Novel.\n[*] Does a great job of continuing from the first game and connecting the universe to it. It also understands how to do a sequel in the murder mystery genre.\n[*] Little refinements on existing mini games was appreciated, helped to add a little more challenge.\n[*] Difficulty settings were appropriate for the different levels so that wider audience could be reached. \n[*] Like the end-game content so that you can go back and complete all the character paths. \n[*] Have I mentioned the writing is amazing?\n[*] Fantastic set of music to complement the action, but in particular, music that keeps the same base in several cases, but alters it for the trial/action in question. Very good job of complementing the emotion of the game.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] A problem with Alt tabbing, where changing context leaves you unable to get back into the game. Annoying.\n[*] Some wrong control descriptions at one point. \n[*] Um......There's not much else that's wrong with it. All the other \u201cproblems\u201d get fixed along the way in terms of plot, so you got to be in it for the long haul.\n[*] That Danganronpa 3 won't be out in America in 2016. Because I'm a crack addict, and I need my fix.\n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1461027210, "timestamp_updated": 1461027210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score":

by the end of the last chapter you are wanting more.  Instead of the school life you are instead brought on a tropical island with some new faces to go along with it, you think everything is at peace with Monimi but then later Monokuma shows up to spoil the fun and the killing game begins.  Like the first game you are giving time to hang out with the other students on the island and give them gifts to know more about them and this is something I am glad that this game improved on and that is the gift giving.  In the first game you had to give certain gifts to know more about each and ever charcter in the game and that made you try and test your luck to find it then you had to use a guide to find that certain gift and of course keep checking to see if you had that gift and that sucked, but in this game if you can't find that one certain gift in the game if you have any water or sun flower seeds on you they will accpect it and that is a good impovment.  The class trails are also improved as well and when it's the final debt all they give you is a set of 5 images and once you get 3 or 4 correct you move on to the next set, I hated this at first but I started to like it cause now I don't have to get all confused witth everything.  All in all Danganronpa 2 Goodbye Despair is a great sequal and a improvment to the first game and I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the first one and likes visual novels.

One such minor twist is being able to navigate through the environments freely at your leisure or during story-critical moments so it offers an extra dimension most other visual novels don't offer.\n\nHowever, the meat of this game comes from its story and the cases that derive from it. If there is another series I had to compare this game to, it'd probably be Phoenix Wright due to the similar style of gameplay offered. You read statements and you point out contradictions with \"Truth Bullets\" given to you at the start of each argument where you take aim and take apart any person's statement during the argument. Sometimes, instead of refuting arguments, you can even agree with them which further increases the complexity of arguments and is a nice addition from the simplistic \"find the contradiction\" of the first game (which I ended up playing on an emulator). There are minigames that further supplement these trials, but they range from being very good such as Rebuttal Showdown and Logic Dive to gimmicky like Hangman's Gambit or Panic Talk Action (both of which were featured in the first game, but as different variations of them).\n\nThe character cast is amazing, which of course, is a matter of preference, but I never found myself truly hating the characters, even the annoying ones because the game offers a lot of characterization to them that creates a unique charm for each one of them. You go from having trouble trying to memorize 16 different names and faces to knowing each character and personality by heart as you progress through the game (due to the fact that the number of survivors will dwindle as is the nature of the game, but this is merely conjecture). Of note, the second core feature of the main game are the Free Time Events that allow you to strengthen your bonds with any character of your choosing by giving them presents that appeal to them. \n\nOf course, one must play the first game in order to play this to make any logical sense of the story, it's kind of a must. However, the huge step in quality as a game improves immensely over the first game both in its scope and in its narrative that it simply can't be ignored if you have a piqued interest for this series. \n\nAs a final note, I will never see Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and especially Tetris the same way again.", "timestamp_created": 1515580742, "timestamp_updated": 1515658724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39227638": {"recommendationid": "39227638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015229802", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1306, "last_played": 1515520812}, "language": "italian", "review": "Ci sono dei riferimenti a Jojo. Quanti ho convinto a comprare il gioco dopo questa frase?\n\nIniziamo con un avviso: Danganronpa 2 \u00e8 una netta evoluzione del primo capitolo, sia in positivo che in negativo. Se non avete gradito il design dei personaggi e la loro caratterizzazione, i twist narrativi o le fasi puzzle, state lontani da DR2. \nLa struttura generale di questo sequel \u00e8 pressoch\u00e8 identica al predecessore: un gruppo di 16 studenti si trova bloccato a loro malgrado su un isola tropicale con un orso bicolore a dargli sempre nuovi motivi per uccidersi a vicenda. Avvenuto il fattaccio si investiga sull'omicidio e si fa un processo per stabilire il colpevole. Il tutto sorretto da un cast, ancora una volta, estremamente curato nella caratterizzazione, una grande cura e qualit\u00e0 dei dialoghi ed un trama contorta e ricca di colpi di scena.\nGrande pregio di DR2 \u00e8 quello di avere un gruppo di protagonisti non solo migliore rispetto al primo, ma in generale uno dei pi\u00f9 intriganti e fuori di testa del genere. Potrete amarli o odiarli fin dai primi momenti, ma ognuno avr\u00e0 comunque qualche caratteristica o visione del mondo che vi rimarr\u00e0 impressa (in particolare uno \u00e8 indubbio che difficilmente vi sar\u00e0 possibile dimenticarlo). Ovviamente per comprendere al 100% il background dei vostri beniamini dovrete fare amicizia con loro nello stesso modo del primo capitolo: scegliere di passare del tempo con loro e fargli dei doni a loro graditi cos\u00ec che si aprano di pi\u00f9 verso di voi. Una volta completato il \"social link\" verrete ricompensati con vari tipi di skill utili nelle fasi puzzle. Sebbene pi\u00f9 permissivo rispetto al passato, questo sistema costringe sempre ad una attenta scelta dei propri preferiti, visto che la loro improvvisa morte interromperebbe la progressione del social link e quindi risulterebbe in una grossa perdita di tempo per il giocatore. Anche questa disperazione tuttavia fa parte del gioco, dico bene? upupupupup\nIl setting si sposa benissimo con lo stile psycho pop della serie e non diminuisce affatto il senso di angoscia che si provava girando per i corridoi della scuola del primo capitolo, anzi, per certi versi \u00e8 persino aumentato in alcuni frangenti della storia.\nVera nota dolente sono i problemi di alcuni minigiochi che, come al solito, pi\u00f9 si prosegue nella storia e pi\u00f9 essi si complicano, oltre ovviamente ad avere una difficolt\u00e0 base che stabilite all'inizio dell'avventura. L'hangsman gambit soffre particolarmente di ci\u00f2, arrivando ad avere blocchi di lettere che esplodono letteralmente ai bordi dello schermo perci\u00f2 impossibili da intercettare. Inoltre negli ultimi due capitoli dell'avventura lo schermo viene interamente invaso da lettere rendendo improbabile perdere meno di un quarto di vita. \nIl confronto finale col colpevole (Panic talk action) ha un problema con l'hitbox delle note, cosa grave considerando che \u00e8 sostanzialmente un rhythm game. Ci\u00f2 non \u00e8 serio a tal punto da compromettere il completamento del minigioco ed inoltre \u00e8 facilmente compensabile usando il focus gauge che permette di non sbagliare mai una nota, tuttavia rimane poco funzionale e fondamentalmente meno coinvolgente.\nIl rebuttal showdown e il logic dive sono probabilmente i pi\u00f9 riusciti, con il primo che \u00e8 una sfida tra due personaggi in cui si usano le prove per letteralmente tagliare le frasi avversarie e il secondo che rappresenta invece un ragionamento del protagonista vissuto come una corsa ad ostacoli.\nRimane comunque da far notare come i misteri dietro gli omicidi e i processi siano nettamente pi\u00f9 divertenti da indagare e risolvere di proprio conto. Ovviamente va messo in conto quanto questo voglia significare casi ancora pi\u00f9 assurdi, con picchi di improbabilit\u00e0 che coloro che non sono disposti a sospendere momentaneamente la loro incredulit\u00e0 faticheranno ad accettare. Francamente ritengo che questo sia parte del fascino della serie e trovo che sia anche un compromesso facilmente accettabile vista la trama cos\u00ec ben scritta e il fenomenale cast.\nAncora una volta le musiche sono azzeccate e ricche di personalit\u00e0. Tra remix dal primo capitolo e nuove tracce \u00e8 molto facile lasciarsi rapire dalla soundtrack in mezzo a tonalit\u00e0 tropicali e assoli di chitarra.\nLa longevit\u00e0 rimane molto alta: avventura completabile in circa 36 ore alla fine della quale si sbloccheranno un paio di modalit\u00e0 bonus. \nIn sintesi: vi \u00e8 piaciuto Trigger happy havoc?

How much have I missed hanging around a bunch of murderous wunderkinder, solving crimes and giving random gifts to people I've barely even talked to in exchange for extremelly personal info and creepy backstories. No, but honestly, when this game first came out it felt like reconnecting with a beloved crazy, morbid emo cousin. Awesome in one word.\nNot only the title doesn't bring shame do it's successor's name, it's actually superior to it in many ways, not just the obvious ones like visuals (technology evolves afterall). Despite not being objectively vigger (at least not in a major way), switching the setting to a bunch of islands instead of a building (albeit huge one) reduced this claustrophobic, uncomfortable, distracting and unnecessary to the game's core aesthetic feeling I've been having to the minimum necessary to still enjoy the game's lore. If you thought first Danganronpa was a huge plottwists clusterfudge, fasten your seatbelts, cause this one's gonna be a wild ride till the very end. I'm not gonna spoil anything, of course.\nThe executions are more imaginative and personal than Trigger Happy Havoc's ones, at least most of them. The characters seem more extreme, but also better thought out, more fleshed out and detailed. Despite their unrealistic weirdness they actually seem more relatable, as their emotions are more conflicted and complicated, which gives them additional depth. Not to mention an absolutely badass protagonist trio. Look, I love Naegi, Byakuya and Kirigiri almost as much as I love my cat, but I really think Hajime, while still being a good person, is way more relatable than extremely kind, preacher-like Naegi. His flaws, inner struggles and growing insecurities made him the good old everyman we've all learnt to enjoy as a protagonist. Chiaki's accessibility (while still keeping the 'antisocial detective' persona), an amount of naiivness and kindness are what make her a bit more likeable than aloof, lvl over 9000 mystyrious Kirigiri. And don't even get me started on how she acted in chapter 5. Don't even get me started like this.\nI also think that oh so controversial\u2122 Komaeda makes a better foil/ally to the protagonist. He isn't a cold asshole just for the sake of success and survival (altough it also isn't the case with Togami; that's a huge mental shortcut, the dude has more or less tragic things behind him that shaped him to be so cruel, flatted-out and goal-oriented). This guy is, contrary to the popular belief, as honest as reasonably possivle, emotes quite a lot, actually desires to form bonds with others. His antagonistic behaviours are fuelled by past trauma, self-hatred, disease and ideals. He truly believes in everything he does and says. Aren't those things we, most likely non-elite members of society, can easilly connect to?\nMultiple gameplay improvements have also been made. The impossible Closing Argument, that always seemed a bit unfair and arbitrary, now was simplified. As a player I didn't feel like I'm being deprived of challenge-I finally felt like the challenge had fair terms and rules. The pictures you can use to complete the comic have been split into groups and you're notified of your mistakes immediately, instead of shaking in your boots and waiting till the time comes. Small, vague hints  are the biggest help and remove all questionability if you remember the story perfectly.\nThe (improved) Hangman's Gambit has also, as the name suggests, improved. Now it poses aan actual challenge both as a puzzle and a dexterity-requiring minigame, that is fun on its own. The leveling system and e-pet (frequently called 'the tamagochi thing') prevented me from just transporting me wherever I needed to be transported, but made me walk around the gameworld and actually discover interesting objects and bonus events. Also, an e-pet is a fun distraction when murders and creepy backstories become a bit overwhelming.\nTo sum things up: the game kept it's prequels spirit and all that made me love the first Danganronpa, while expanding plot-wise and lore-wise and significantly improving gameplay, to make it challenging, but intuitional and enjoyable. I highly recommend it, even if you haven't played Trigger Happy Havoc, but enjoy a good mystery, smooth gameplay, rich plot and unforgettable characters. And some gore.

Aunque es obviamente reminiscente del primer juego, presenta un salto de calidad en pr\u00e1cticamente todos los aspectos. La historia es sublime, act\u00faa como continuaci\u00f3n de D1, pero mejora much\u00edsimo el desarrollo y progreso. Los giros de gui\u00f3n, en especial, son fenomenales.\n\nLa jugabilidad es buena, pero no es por lo que el juego brilla. Las mec\u00e1nicas de los juicios est\u00e1n muy bien pensadas, pero el resto del juego utiliza un sistema de point & click bastante cl\u00e1sico. No molesta, pero tampoco es nada especial.\n\nLo que verdaderamente hace brillar a este juego son dos cosas: los personajes y los elementos de misterio.\n\nLos personajes. Qu\u00e9 decir de los personajes. SD2 nos presenta uno de los mejores elencos que he tenido el placer de ver en un videojuego. Todos son carism\u00e1ticos y, aunque en un principio pueda parecer que no tienen profundidad, OS ASEGURO QUE S\u00cd LA TIENEN. Y MUCHA. En concreto, el tr\u00edo protagonista (Hinata, Chiaki, Komaeda) es exageradamente interesante y tan profundo como entretenido. No os vais a hartar de conocerlos mejor y de ver como van evolucionando a la par que la historia. Respecto al resto de personajes, los otros 15 (13 alumnos, Monokuma, y Monomi), aunque no llegan al mismo nivel de perfecci\u00f3n, no se quedan para nada atr\u00e1s. Menci\u00f3n especial (aunque esto es algo muy subjetivo) para Sonia, Kuzuryuu y Gundam.\n\nPor otra parte, el misterio es rid\u00edculamente bueno. El ambiente conseguido es espectacular. El misterio de la trama principal es incre\u00edble, pero es el de los asesinatos el que hace de este juego la absoluta maravilla que es. Cada muerte es inesperada, sorprendente y, sobre todo, intrigante. Conseguir ir despejando las inc\u00f3gnitas sobre los casos gracias a lo que hemos investigado previamente es MUY satisfactorio. Realmente te crees un detective real. Como en el apartado de personajes, menci\u00f3n especial para el quinto y, sobre todo, el cuarto juicio.\n\nTambi\u00e9n me gustar\u00eda se\u00f1alar la perfecci\u00f3n con la que se manejan los temas tratados y la filosof\u00eda que envuelve al juego. A pesar de ser un juego de misterio, tiene tiempo para hablar de la importancia de la vida, de la amistad, del cari\u00f1o, del odio, del amor, de la confianza, entre much\u00edsimas otras cosas. Eso le suma, si cabe, todav\u00eda m\u00e1s puntos.\n\nSi est\u00e1is dudando si comprarlo, yo os lo dejo claro: JUGADLO, DE VERDAD. Es una de las mejores experiencias que he tenido en este medio.

En caso de no ser un fan de la saga, pero te interesar\u00eda introducirte en esta, te recomiendo jugar el primer juego o en todo caso ver el anime de Danganronpa: The Animation (porque hay ciertas mec\u00e1nicas que llegan a chocar si juegas primero al 2 y despu\u00e9s al 1).

Not much more to say I guess? It's a game where you play a guy with an ahoge and solve murder mysteries. It's also a visual novel. That's the game, really.\n\nWalking around is a little more awkward, in Danganronpa 1 you just walk around in a first person perspective and when you enter rooms you go into a 'room mode' and you can click on stuff. Danganronpa 2 does much the same thing but instead of a first person view, you get a mildly awkward looking sidescroller basically. Each of the islands you can visit in the game has basically a big circular road on it which you can loop around by running left or right forever. It's a little awkward and a little boring since you're just holding a button and waiting instead of, you know, actually going somewhere. The hallways of Hope's Peak from the first game was more engaging since you're always turning corners or looking for a staircase or whatever.\n\nThere's also a tamagotchi (yeah, you remember those stupid things?) that ties into the whole 'you can walk forever' thing. Because it has a step counter. However, if you walk too long without, uh, cleaning up after your tamagotchi it dies. So you have to micromanage the stupid thing, and the worst part is there's a bunch of different ones you can grow, so if you're going for 100% it's gonna take a lot of holding down left or right to get that particular achievement.\n\nThe gameplay's harder and different in a few ways to the first game. One of the minigames which in the first game is you clicking on letters to form words is now you clicking on bubbles that float across the screen. Bubbles that collide form together and 'stick' to the screen until popped or used, but if they're not the same letter then they will explode and damage you. It's a little sucky since it basically made an 'okay' minigame into something annoying. Also, the difficulty sort of scaled upwards in the first game - in this one it doesn't even care, one of the first 'words' you need to figure out is actually three words made up of like 13 letters.\n\nThere's more annoying stuff in this game too like, when you're in the middle of a class trial sometimes you'll be given new information or a new truth bullet or both or whatever, and this sometimes happens multiple times. It just kind of sucks.\n\nThose are the bad things, I suppose. The rest of it's good, the characters this time are all debatably better than in the first - in that they all have wittier dialogue and basically all of the writing reads like anime comedy sketches. So if you like that, well, here you go.\n\nNot much else to say, I guess? It's fun? It's good? Good story? Good characters? Good cases? Good gameplay? I mean I still like the first one better but this is definitely a worthy sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1516179873, "timestamp_updated": 1516179873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39406912": {"recommendationid": "39406912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323461977", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 222, "last_played": 1516112540}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7edd\u671b\u4e0e\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u6218\u6597", "timestamp_created": 1516170335, "timestamp_updated": 1516170335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

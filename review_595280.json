No faction allegiance.\n- Caring about my life, I inform the king of my class and contract. It's a popular policy to kill any confirmed neutral players in the hopes of catching a killer.\n- Guarded my contract for a bit, before becoming the third member of the Unseen, the \"evil\" faction. Now I guard them at night.\n- Mastermind felt great about getting a Sorceror killed, despite the fact that Sorcerors are the one neutral killer class that can't kill evil characters. Our 45 seconds of nightly privacy is not long enough for this discussion.\n- After a few nights of guarding our assassin, and watching the Blue Dragon accuse each other, the King dies, and so does my original contract.\n- I keep up the facade, claiming I need a new contract.  My Mastermind \"accepts\" ;)\n- BUT then my Mastermind accidentally clicks to nominate himself for King, (Another bad MM move) and is found out as evil pretty quickly. Fortunately, nobody follows up about who I chose as my contract.\n- There are six players left: me, our assassin, and 4 of the Blue Dragon. I step forward to become King after our former Mastermind is executed. One of the enemies knows our assassin visited someone who died last night. I have to execute him to blend in. I *thought* I could pardon him using a king ability, but I guess it wasn't available my first day.\n- The game is still going which means there's still an evil character about. (It's me)\n- The four opponents remaining accuse each other, thinking a mastermind wouldn't become King, because their recruitment ability is too valuable. They think the MM is still out there, and can't know he was the previous king.\n- Our assassin poisoned one of the four BD before he died, and the poison takes effect the next night. Only 3 remain. I have to kill 2, but the only way to do that is voting on execution.\n- One execution goes smoothly. More confusion among my \"subjects\".\n- Not used to being King, I make another mistake and use an ability to make an accusation count as 2 votes, locking me out of my ability to immediately execute or pardon someone on the stand. I start a trial for one of the remaining.\n- He presents convincing logs.\n- The other BD and I lock in our votes. If he pardons, there's no execution, and they'll no doubt turn on me soon.\n- The other BD rescinds their vote and chats \"This is all too confusing!\" choosing to trust his King.\n- He chose wrong.\n- By my will alone, I, the Evil King, execute his last ally and extinguish all hope for the Blue Dragon.\n- The Unseen win.\n\n10/10. Would bumble my way through murder and incompetent leadership to become a tyrant again.\n\nOther highlights:\n- One time I got raised from the dead late in the game to to do some secret guarding and murder at night. I took a shot in the dark and killed the remaining evil player the same night he killed the other two survivors. Everyone died and it was beautiful!\n- One time there was a toxic player (not a common problem I've seen. I think the devs take reports seriously) and I openly asked the evil faction to kill him. They did the same night. And then the night before they won, they recruited me and let me share in their victory! Thanks, guys!\n\n\nSeriously though, this game has a bit of a steep learning curve as you learn not only each class's abilities, but also the \"etiquette\" of the chat and logs. I had some embarassing early sessions, but it's completely worth it for the dynamic stories like the ones above, and players have generally been good sports. Mostly, the worst the worst I've heard is \"that was a bad [class] play\", which, yeah, usually was.\n\nIf I can suggest an improvement, give a little more visual feedback when YOU are getting accused during the day.

Most of the classic roles are here are here with a new twist.  Everyone has a night role for investigation or support.  The main difference here is that everyone but the King, most neutrals and the Prince (AKA jailer)  can be converted to evil during the night.  the factions are the Blue Dragon, Neutrals, the Cult and the Unseen, each bring a different (or they try to) playstyle.\n\n[h1] Pros\t[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]\"Time of Death labels\"\n    [*]Extensive Codex\n    [*]Interesting Neutral Killers\n    [*]Death Knight Mechanics\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Pros\tExpanded[/h1]\nTime of Death labels-Such a simple bit of UI really helps keeping track of events.\n\nAlways something to do-  No matter what role you have, you will have something to do at night.  That beats the heck out of the Medium and survivor in ToS.\n\nDay abilities-  While not fully balanced yet, they do add some spice into the chats.\n\nNeutral Killer- The Possessor has the most unique ability to \"jump bodies\"  that adds tension to the whole game.  However if enough people start using a \"Whisper \"Blankety Blank\" until I'm posessed\" Meta that could change. \n\nDeath Knights-Instead of reviving someone, you get to make them a Death Knight.  An undead avenger that watches over the Blue Dragons and attacks 1 player and kills them if they are evil.  This stops people from having \"Confirmed good roles\" that utterly kill evil factions.\n\n[h1] Cons List\t[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Tiny Community.\n    [*]No other modes.\n    [*]Underpowered \"Good\" Roles.\n    [*]Toxic Community.\n    [*]Games are binary wins or losses.\n    [*]Codex missing key features\n    [*]No stats or achievements\n[/list]\n\n[h1]  Cons Expanded\t[/h1]\nNeuts out!-  Are you a neutral role?  Well if the king find you 9/10 times you are executed for existing.  The only reason to not kill them is the very outside chance there is a fool.  When a fool is executed Days 1-3, you can't even vote anyone up for 2 days!  \nIt doesn't help that any revealed Neutrals are forced to work with the BDs if they want to survive.\n\nSalty losers-  You can carry the Blue Dragons to victory and then lose because you are converted one night before the games ends.  This makes it easy to be angry at the loss of gold and prestige at your efforts.\n\nThe King role-  This role can be 1/3 different factions.  Good, Evil or Neutral.  However all of them play the exact same!  Same abilities and same results.  If you don't find someone by Day 5 everyone cries \"EXE THE EVIL KING!\".  There have been multiple reworks, but none of them solve this problem.  Worse yet, New kings that get elected lose all ability to investigation abilities.\n\nThe \"Diversity\" Update.  So, you put back in another powerless role, the Noble, then you add an update so that you \"Don't play the same role twice.\"  I've tested this and in over 4 hours of gameplay it put me in the exact same role 4 times! To recap why they tried to fix this, I had played over 40 hours and NEVER had 3 specific roles even once!  The Roles structure is BS!\n\nBasic information hidden-  I scoured the Codex and all roles and it was only after HOURS of play that I learned that there can be only 2 of each role.  This is mentioned only ONCE in the online Wiki.  The dev expects us all to use their \"Discord\" for help.  NO THANK YOU!\n\nTrash Unprovable Roles-  In ToS you have only a few real roles that have no way to confirm themselves.  In here you have 5+.  The Court Wizard, The Hunter (90% of the time), the Physician, the Princess and the Knight.  Yes, as the knight, you could put out a death note saying Knightman wuz here!  Big problem is that details on a death are hidden, DNs are mostly ignored.  Worse yet if the evil factions believe the note, you get converted.\n\nThe \"Occupy roles\"-  In town of salem you'd call this Roleblocking.  Unlike in ToS there are two, and each time there are noobs that will try to play them as \"investigative roles\".  This leads to them exposing other BD roles and the prince more than any evil roles.  I'm pretty sure this stems from frustration at having a menial passive role.  The Drunk can either Occupy them, or Happy hour people.  Removing ALL immunities and 100% stopping their target in their tracks.  The problem is, this doesn't kill them without either a hunter, or a Knight working with them.\n\n\"Killing roles-  The prince is the most powerful role in the game bar none.  The problem is that when he dies Night 1 or 2 evils win.  Period.  No matter what other roles are in the game, I have NEVER seen evils lose when prince dies N1 and only Disconnected (or incredibly unprepared) players make can overturn this rule of thumb.  However this can also be said for the Neutral Killer.  If the NK dies early the evil faction is badly outnumbered.  Without multiple deaths per night, they are hunted down and killed in quick order.\n\nNo seasons, stats or achievements- Yes, we all hate unreasonable grinding.  However, stats would stop people from leaving, a problem that even giving more gold for wins hasn't solved.  Reports literally do nothing, they are unprovable and often jut a bunch of trolls trying to spread malice.  Worse yet, any achievements WOULD give new players an idea of what a class can and should do.\n\n[h1] Summary\t[/h1]\n\nIt's better than ToS the Coven, but that's about it.  You will get bored until it updates, and you will be forced into playing the same roles over and over.  Even when it does update, the bugs, crashes and ignorant trolls will never disappear from this game.  The only reason to get this game would be either to do social experiments (just use a chat room, those are free) or to learn what NOT to do when creating a mafia style game.  I wish I could like it, but the number of times one player can make a difference are buried by mountains of disappointments, and frustrating hordes of idiots chanting \"EZ game\".", "timestamp_created": 1516139495, "timestamp_updated": 1516306219, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39388811": {"recommendationid": "39388811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044093497", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1997, "last_played": 1516321516}, "language": "english", "review": "best game i have played in a long time", "timestamp_created": 1516106967, "timestamp_updated": 1516106967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39385339": {"recommendationid": "39385339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128999878", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2534, "last_played": 1516398618}, "language": "english", "review": "Game keeps crashing mid-game.\nSounds and shit goes on, except that screen freezes and u can't click shit.\nGreat game Ten out of Ten would report again.

The game itself seems to be balanced well enough and is still being carefully maintained by the devs - at least by all appearances, as I've witnessed re-introduction of playable classes and tweaking of numbers even in the short time I have owned the game.\n\nThe only real trouble this game is plagued with is the human condition. There are some people that believe themselves to be godlike geniuses and they will chew you out without hesitation when they predict something and no one else sees it. There are some people that will get salty beyond the point of hilarity, past the threshold of just being a (donkey) and I can't say I'd miss them if they just quit playing altogether.\n\nYou will find games with intelligent and/or respectful and/or cheerful players. Sometimes you only get a little of one, rarely you'll get a good measure of all. You will find some that respect new players and give them room for mistakes, and you will find some that will blame you just for trying to enter the community. The latter are poisonous and need to adjust their attitudes or leave.\n\nSo buy the game if you've got the stomach and/or thick skin for dealing with sore losers and self-appointed geniuses. You will encounter them, no doubt. The game itself, lying beneath, is worth it. It's fun. But if you can't deal with jerks, you may find your experience soiled every other game. There are always people cussing each other out. There are always idiots. Thankfully, I can get past it. I don't blame you if you can't.\n\nSounds negative, I know, I know... I mean, it's hard to paint toxic players in a good light, true. Many negative reviews are based heavily on experiences with the community. But I'm here to tell you: the game itself is fun (after you conquer the admittedly steep learning curve) and would admittedly improve with a friendlier player base, but it's still fun. It's satisfying to catch others in their lies - tremendously more satisfying to carry yourself on a bed of lies all the way to victory. I have enjoyed playing both sides of the game, enjoyed playing the neutral roles (even though they are often mistrusted by default). I have been blamed and whined at and I think I've probably been threatened with reports (or been reported, who knows) by players that think the definition of \"throwing a game\" is \"not winning.\" But you know what? Those players can stuff it. They won't steal the joyous thrill I get from trying to figure everyone out every match.\n\nIt's fun, win or lose. And I get frustrated with a lot of those difficult singleplayer romps out there (Dark Souls and the like).

Litterally the best and closest thing you'll get to an authentic detective game. Before I go into pros and cons, let me say that this game is better version of Town of Salem with a far more amusing and intellectual community. This is not some copy of Town of Salem, just a superior game within the small genre. On that note lets start with the cons.\n\nCons:\nOverplayed Class- This is honestly my most hated one! Although I love every class usually it eat at me that I'm Court Wizard and Psychic in succession after one another. So further improvement on the Algorithm is needed.\n\nGraphics- The graphics are honestly meh, but you get used to it after your 3rd match or so. \n\nNo Ranked- Bummer for me as I love making my games a bit more competitive. If they could give me ranked, I would spend even more hours on the game. This obviously doesn't matter to most. \n\nPros:\nLoads of Classes- There are so many clases yielding to some diverse games. This is why the con annoys me so much. But my goodness I could play for hours if I never get a class repeat. All of them have their strengths. Some would say about 4 of them are dumb, but 4 out of 25+ are still some good odds.\n\nFun Community- From the RP'ers to the meme'ers all of them make this game a joy to play. You once in a blue mind find a game thrower, but every game has its share of toxic people. That being said, for a game that is litterally about talking, you don't get any true animosity in spite of funny/wrong accusations or poor deductions.\n\nCustomizations- The game could certainly use more character avatars and weapons, but they have a plethora already. You could swipe your card to unlock themn all, but its honestly no need. You get money quickly, and it gives you more of a reason to play.\n\nConversions- This honestly may be the reason why systematically I like Throne of Lies over Town of Salem is because you just never know who got converted. So everyone is suspect until certain variables are met.\n\nConclusion:\nI'll stop here as I could go on longer, but theres no need. You really need to play this for yourself to understand why its so good. If you're like me and are completely knew to this type of game, go play Town of Salem to see if you like the genre. If you conclude that you like the genre then PLEASE buy this game, its so much better with true deductions instead of random accusation kills in Town of Salem.", "timestamp_created": 1515800274, "timestamp_updated": 1515800274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39284884": {"recommendationid": "39284884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130592481", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1600, "last_played": 1516445430}, "language": "english", "review": "In the current state of it, I can not recommend it.

There are also a number of \"neutral\" roles that can win withe either side (they're neutral). Also, nobody knows who is what at the start of the game. It's you and your teams job to find out who is what using your abilities and information from other players.\n\nIf you wan't to do well, you will need a keen eye and recognise who could be lying and who might be converted to the bad guys. If you're a bad guy, you'll need to know who to kill, convert or annoy with your abilities. If you're a neutral, you'll need to learn how to not die (for the most part).\n\nThere are a number of roles in the game, and most (all?) of them have \"night abilities\". For example, the sheriff can go to one players house each night and see if they are part of the enemy faction. The knight can guard a player and kill anyone who attacks them. Some classes, have day abilities. The assasin, can poison a player during the day. The Butler can poison the king, the alchemist can make himself night immune for one night.\n\nThe game is fun with infinite replay value as no two games are the same. You could have a hundred hours and the closest you could get to that would be \"similar things happened at one or two points\", but nothing more.\n\nIf you have played games like Town of Salem, this is a definite upgrade in terms of graphics and gameplay, with the only drawback being there is no way to up your chances of getting a certain role.\n\nSpeaking of ToS, most of the roles are similar, but do have differences. The hunter is a vig/vet combo, the princess is like the investigator but seens class types, and not the class (support/social Vs. Physician/Alchemist/Psy etc), the sheriff is (basically) the sheriff. Evil can recruit people and can even kill twice in one night. The king is similar to the mayor, however he can execute regardless of the votes. there is a neutral healing class called the alchemist that can attack twice, make themselves immune and heal. There is a reaper (NK), when they kill a player, they appear as alive the next day however cannot talk.\n\nAgain, most of the classes follow the same theme as ToS, but mostly have different mechanics.\n\nThis game will take *at least* a good few hours at least to pick up, and thousands to master.", "timestamp_created": 1515054651, "timestamp_updated": 1515054651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39037975": {"recommendationid": "39037975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045902808", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 684, "last_played": 1516447450}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically a better version of town of salem.", "timestamp_created": 1515045742, "timestamp_updated": 1515045742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39023796": {"recommendationid": "39023796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079804974", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 843, "last_played": 1515886647}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been well around in terms of video games, and I can safely say, that this game is the most fun of them.

Each role has at least 2 (up to 5 or 6) special abilities, which leads to a very confusing 3 to 6 hours of gameplay until you start memorizing each class and how they all fit together. Even now, at 25 hours of game time, I'm still learning new things. The in-game GUI is very easy to navigate and alot of the drudgery of other such games is handled automatically (preformatted nightly logs, etc.).\n\nSummary: If you like social deduction games, then you'll love Throne.

Does that mean that I hate it and that secretly I am a masochist? Could be- but the honest answer would be no- I do not hate this game.\n\nOnto the actual review- the reason why I keep on returning to this game is because it's complex, it's beautiful, and it exposes all of humanity's good and bad traits. From truly careful and masterful ploys to earn your trust, to the most bitter and angry of words- Throne of Lies has it all. You're gonna all say \"This is true for all social deduction games- what makes this one different?\" Well, frankly, it's the sheer amount of classes, abilities, factions. This is the only game that I know of, that allows conversions (forcing people to join your faction), which can easily make a winning faction loose in a single night.\n\nOn another note that still relates to why I love this game is the developers and moderators- seldom have I seen devs so dedicated to listening (or reading as it were) to player feedback, and being extremely fast to respond to people's issues. If you report a player for a misdemeanor of some effect, you can rest assured that the mods will DEFINITELY take action.\n\nNow, onto the not so pleasant things- the community can be incredibly toxic- to the point where you rage-quit and uninstall the game, only to re-install it again the next day.\nAnother issue is the fact that due to constant player demands, you will discover that a lot of classes suffer from endless changes, to the point of being removed (priest, soulcatcher and noble come to mind), which means that if you stay away from the game for two weeks, you might end up in a scenario where you do not know what's happening around you, because all of your abilities are changed to the core. \nA final gripe that does not personally affect me, but non-the-less IS important, is that the game is NOT friendly to new players. There are too many mechanics to learn, too many classes and factions to figure our, and no real way to seperate new players from the experienced ones. While there is supposed to be a way to prevent new players from recieving certain roles (like King, Prince, or participation in Cult games), this often seems to not be the case, as I've seen on multiple occasions first-time players get King (which can be part of 3 different factions, thus make the way to achieve victory very different), which not only guarantees loss for them, but also all players that are part of their faction.\n\n\nTL,DR: The game is awesome- graphics are entertaining, the sheer amount of classes will ensure that you'll always have something new to see or learn, and it's one of the most complicated social deduction games (I love that) that I've ever played. The developers truly love their playerbase, and they will always listen to your issues. With that being said, be sure to come prepared with your thickest skin and absolute disregard for people's opinions, otherwise this game will eat you and spit you out severely damaged. Also, if you're overall new to the \"social deduction games\" genre, be sure to watch a few videos, read up the basics on the Wiki a bit before starting up your first game- no one is gonna hold your hand while you learn the ropes.\n\nGood luck and I hope to meet you in the throne room that is full of liars!\n\nP.S.: English is NOT my native language- feel free to mock me for any grammar mistakes that you encounter!", "timestamp_created": 1514837714, "timestamp_updated": 1514837714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38946492": {"recommendationid": "38946492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128753629", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1159, "last_played": 1516384025}, "language": "english", "review": "TFW when \"it must've been the wind\" isn't a good claim when killing someone.

I have had this game less than a week but I have played ~20 hours\n - I might have like a thousand hours in Town of Salem, so I just like this type of game\n\n\nPros:\n + in a game where other players directly impact your experience, the community takes this game seriously and works very hard. \n  ( +/- unlike in town of salem, this means that most people don't play \"characters\" and instead focus on serious dialogues)\n + you can play it while doing something else (like, i read something during the downtime) or you can focus on it\n + the game is very balanced so you don't have to worry about a certain faction always winning\n + you can play an active role even when dead (by gaining gold for predicting who will be executed or killed at night)\n + each new game is challenging and different from the one before\n + completely new roles from Town of Salem, so everything is fresh and interesting\n\nCons:\n - the community can have a toxic view of the norm of a game. logs play too important of a role\n - sometimes you can get the same class multiple times and that can get annoying\n - there's a bit of a steep learning curve at first, with so many new roles.\n  ( + people are helpful and you are always learning new things)\n - visuals could use a lot of improvement. it feels like i'm playing 2003 runescape.\n  ( + they're more interesting than town of salem and are easy to get used to. plus, there are nice animations)\n - the lobbies can be filled with people you've played games with before. community is not very large.\n - music can get a little stale after a while\n\nI could easily play this game for hundreds of hours. It challenges you as much as you want it to. If you want to buy it, then I will be there to play it with you. \nIs it worth playing when you could play Town of Salem for free?

There are so many classes to learn their skills and the \"rules\" about identifying what the objective is each game and what classes are going to show up.

Vous avez 3 grands groupes, les Blue Dragons (BD) en bleu et \u00ab gentils \u00bb, les Unseen ou le Cult, violet ou rouge pour des \u00ab m\u00e9chants \u00bb et des personnages neutres qui ont leur propre condition de victoire (Exemple : Le fool doit se faire pendre pour gagner). Le tout sous la f\u00e9rule d\u2019un roi qui peut \u00eatre gentil, neutre, ou m\u00e9chant, ce qui est tr\u00e8s malin puisqu\u2019on ne peut donc pas lui faire confiance.\n\nAllez, on lance !\nTr\u00e8s grande peur tout d\u2019abord puisque le menu n\u2019\u00e9tait franchement ni beau, ni intuitif. Je ne croyais m\u00eame pas qu\u2019il y avait de tuto mais il y en a bien un en fin de liste. Pas super lisible en l\u2019\u00e9tat. En fait je vais le r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, le jeu EST MOCHE. Je sais, on n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 pour \u00e7a, mais il est juste vomitif. C\u2019est une 3D infecte qui je l\u2019esp\u00e8re sera retravaill\u00e9 et c\u2019est mon espoir profond.  (Ah non, il est sorti comme \u00e7a)\nJe ne vois pas l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de faire dans ce cas pr\u00e9cis un jeu 3D. D\u2019autres jeux comme \u00ab Town of Salem \u00bb ont fait un choix beaucoup plus intelligent en mettant des graphismes qui se voulaient fun. L\u00e0, on dirait du s\u00e9rieux des ann\u00e9es 90.

Car oui, ce magnifique jeu \u00e0 cette composante compl\u00e8tement al\u00e9atoire d\u2019un premier meurtre la premi\u00e8re nuit, comme \u00e7a. Salut.\nOn est 16. Le prince peut ex\u00e9cuter quelqu\u2019un (sur quelle base ?), il y a potentiellement un assassin m\u00e9chant et un assassin neutre. L\u2019assassin m\u00e9chant connait ses alli\u00e9s, donc 1 chance sur 13 ? Le neutre peut faire ce qu\u2019il veut, 1 chance sur 15 Allez, en gros on a quand m\u00eame un pourcentage non n\u00e9gligeable de crever comme \u00e7a, directement. De votre c\u00f4t\u00e9 et d\u00e9pendant de votre r\u00f4le, vous aurez 1 chance sur 14/15 de faire quelque chose d\u2019int\u00e9ressant pour votre camp, de fa\u00e7on plus ou moins al\u00e9atoire. C\u2019est\u2026 inint\u00e9ressant ?\nL\u00e0 o\u00f9 on tombe dans la d\u00e9duction potentielle et la strat\u00e9gie c\u2019est en devinant en fonction des actions des morts des informations sur les vivants. Sachant qu\u2019en gros les seuls infos viables viennent des BD quand ils meurent (aucune raison de mentir) et des gens sur le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (et encore)\u2026 On doit se baser sur \u00e7a pour r\u00e9duire le champ d\u2019action et trouver nos ennemis. A moins de se faire accuser sur le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral parce qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas parl\u00e9. Ou de se faire tuer la 2nd nuit pour les m\u00eames raisons que la premi\u00e8re.\nLe temps entre les actions semble long mais il est assez court devant la masse d\u2019information \u00e0 traiter quand on commence. La communaut\u00e9 n\u2019aide pas beaucoup. Mais ils ne vous louperont pas si par malheur vous faites la moindre erreur. Et oui, je suis un idiot, stupide et autre gentilles choses.

Logs are the only language accepted in this game and new players will have an absolutely miserable first half dozen games until they figure out the shorthand required for log taking and they will still be unable to play evil classes without having had a chance to see pretty much all of the good classes so they can fake logs. The community guides are all wrong, either pertaining to outdated versions or suggesting \"easy\" lies that are so obvious to the playerbase that claiming them truthfully will get you killed half the time. And that doesn't even count the enormous numbers of edge cases you have to memorize to make decisions. \n\nGet past that, and you can see I got my money's worth, incredibly addictive for a while but a flash in the pan like PUBG and for similar reasons. You can play 20 games and you'll maybe see 2 good ones that are down to the wire where something actually interesting happens. 10 of those you play classes that are a simpler flow-chart than Ken, who literally have no plays other than \"grief someone randomly\" until late game and then their flow-chart is just the same action over and over and whose only contribution to the detective game is dying and hoping when their logs spill out of their corpse that \"Couldn't grief this random guy due to blockage\" is the last evidence the sleuths need to crack the case. And about 16-18 of those, the good mob or the evil mob will throw the game on a boneheaded play or through miserable random chance.

Only then, a dozen or two plays later, you realize you're faffing about blindly half the time and going through the motions the other half and failing at every action and getting sniped out of nowhere in the third half... you burn out just as fast as you started, from 0 to 100 and back to 0 again.

The obvious thing is to compare this game to Town of Salem and in my experience this game is far better.  In Town of Salem you get AFKers and leavers that leave the game to the chance the sheriff will find the killing factions.  In Throne of Lies, its completely different.  Each role feels to make contributions to their faction.  The presence of neutral roles creates additional people for both Blue Dragon and killing faction to be on the lookout for.  The cult and unseen factions leading to two different styles of games.  The King having the chance to be working against you or just not truly caring about you since their goal is to survive.  My favorite (and somewhat frustrating) part of the game is how the evil faction can convert members of Blue Dragon to their faction, which can cause panic when you think they're all dead, but the game isn't over. My one complaint is it can get toxic if you suck at your role.  I've been on the bad end where I was Prince, arguably the most critical role and messed up, then got greeted by tons of report this guy because he was bad at being prince.  Other than that, there are very few things to complain about. It's been a blast to play and I would even recommend buying this game even if it isn't on sale - it's that fun and addicting.\n\nI would also love to give a shoutout to the development team that has worked so hard on this game.  Their Discord server is active with the devs consistently getting involved with the community they have made.  They also listen to their users and have consistently added new features to add new content as well as balancing anything that needs balancing (see: priest and noble fixes that made games too easy for BD).

Throne of Lies is actually a Lie, they should really rename it to Throne of Luck IMO. If ur an Assassin hitting on a Wisped Princess N1 or got debbed by a Drunk, or a Sheriff checking on you right away, prepare to get executed on the table, but it's the randomness that makes it fun and refreshing so I wouldn't say it's a bad thing. btw Prince dying night 1 every game is real.\n\n2. The game is pretty unbalanced, at low level play, the game is more fun because there are more randomness and twists in it, you get to see the good guys executing their own people on the table, but at high level play it becomes a lot more mechanical, king get claims from ppl and check conflicting claims (very tiring if you're not used to the game), whisper train everywhere, bd asks and share info, out every Neut found to get the NK,  The Blue Dragon win most of the time because:\n\nA.) There are too many conversion immune targets,  sometimes you get hit conv immune targets like 3 nights in a row, Prince is conv immune, Fools are immune, Scorned are immune, Guarded mercs are immune, CW barriered targets are immune, NK are immune, they really should make more classes convertable instead of giving Cult an extra charge of Erradicate, it really sucks hitting on immune targets every night or so.\n\nB.) Inq are ridiculously OP in cult games, because of the fact that every Cult member is magic while most of BD cast isn't. Mid-to-late game the Inq can just go YOLO one shot every Cult member that is a sus, they really should make some cult members non-magic.\n\nC.) The Evil side only have one member that can attack, for the Unseen it's the Assassin, for Cult it's the CL, and they're all not occupy immune. When found or suspected, a gaey Drunk/Prince can occupy an Assassin or CL over and over (not killing, up to 3 nights) while the other members of the BD hunt for the MM or other Cult members, it becomes really frustrating and not fun if ur on the Evil side, theres basically nothing you can do against it, You can go make some coffee and return 5 minutes later only to see ur still in Jail with the Prince laughing at yout face.\n\nThere's a reason why there are so few people playing this game: At low level play the game is quite fun IMO, because of the game throws and luls, but at high level play it becomes more frustrating with the unbalanced Classes, most of the time it's just a matter of luck, the bad guys relies too much on the Neutral Killer and Evil King(which spawns too rarely)  to create chaos or early lucky (Prince) kills. If the NK died early, and there's no Fool/Scorned/YOLO Alchs, the game becomes really hard for Evil, as there's only one member that can attack (and is not occ immune), the Unseen will be figured out eventually.\n\nAlso most of the time you get only get to play boring classes like Phys or Court Wizard which sucks, the spawn chance for more interesting classes like the Fool or Scorned is too low, they really should make at least one Fool or Scorned spawn every game.\n\nI'd rate this game a 8/10 at low level play for the random execution and game throws, and 5/10 at high level play (where there are more serious and experienced players). It's still worth getting tho ATM because the majority of the players are still very bad at the game, and I also think it's because most experienced players have already abandoned the game when they figured out what it really is. \n\nIf you like to roll dice like me, get it, otherwise you're better off spending your time on something else.", "timestamp_created": 1514309296, "timestamp_updated": 1515240335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38703840": {"recommendationid": "38703840", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975150865", "num_games_owned": 557, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514830729}, "language": "english", "review": "From the Patch Notes:\n\"You will now have a decreased chance of getting the same class you played in your last game.\"\n\nSince last patch I was court wizard in 9 of 10 games.

Most reviewers seem to be of the opinion that Throne of Lies is a through and through upgrade on that title; my opinion is that it's a bit more complex than that.\n\nLet's start with the aspects where Throne of Lies is an improvement over Town of Salem:\n\n* The interface is much, much more usable. Information is easier to access; everything is more intuitive\n\n\n* All roles are more fleshed out. In Town of Salem, many roles are given impossibly difficult objectives, and no tools with which to complete them, having to basically rely on providence. Some roles are just plain boring to play. In Throne of Lies, it's a rare day when your character doesn't have at least one interesting play at his or her disposal. Most roles have more options than their equivalent role in Town of Salem\n\n\nBut now we get to the stuff Throne of Lies does worse than Town of Salem:\n\n* Game balance. The number of characters in each of the two main factions fluctuates wildly from game to game, especially since the king can be aligned to any of them.\n\n\n* There's a lot less deductive reasoning. Every rule in Throne of Lies has so many exceptions, and the initial setup has so much variance built into it, that it's almost impossible to deduce anything. Roles that had been \"confirmed\" can be converted the following night. You never know who killed whom. \n\nIn Town of Salem, I had so many of these \"Eureka\" moments, where I initially scratched my head at something that seemed plain impossible, only to then have that epiphany about its only possible meaning, and go all L like over the opposition. In Throne of Lies, that never seems to happen. The only mode of play in Throne of Lies is closer to what in Town of Salem would have been the \"All Any\" mode.\n\n\n* There's a certain sense of futility to it, thanks to questionable design choices. The main \"evil\" faction is capped at 3 members, and they can convert \"good\" members. Successfully executing enemies very often merely means that they get to convert more from your faction. When all is said and done, you rarely feel like your actions had any sort of impact on the match's outcome.\n\n\nNow about the stuff both games are on even ground with each other:\n\n*Both are butt-ugly to look at. :D\nYeah, it's a minor complaint, but I have to say it anyway.\n\nSo you might be asking, he's still recommending Throne of Lies despite everything that he just said? Yes, because even though it won't blow your mind, I do feel it's still a worthwhile experience for the asking price. And the developers are still making frequent changes to the game, so who knows.

If you've played One Night Ultimate Werewolf and Town of Salem, this game will play similiarly. The game itself has a learning curve as you try to get yourself acquainted with all the different classes available, but thankfully there is an easy to access panel in game that can tell you what a class can/can't do. New players looking to get into playing ToL will be pleased to know there is a scripted tutorial available that teaches them about the interface and the basics on how to play the game.\n\nEach game of ToL feels dynamic as the roles are randomized at the start of each session, alongside numbers of Blue Dragons, Neutrals, the type of evil faction and neutral killer present. The two evil factions, the Unseen and the Cult, have different playstyles but share the same goal of wiping out the Blue Dragon. It should be of note that some roles do not appear until conditions have been met; a Paladin only appears during Cult games and likewise a Sheriff only appears during Unseen games. The conversion ability that evil faction leaders possess also add an additional layer of complexity to a game as previously confirmed BD members can be instantly turned to the dark side, so it is vital that you carefully choose where to place your trust. A notepad and log is available for players to use to keep track of information they have gathered, and can be used to further their factions end game goal.\n\nThere is also room for creativity and roleplaying as you are allowed to choose your name at the beginning of a session as well as customize your character with different armors and weapons that give you a different execution emote. There are microtransactions to purchase gold, but they are not mandatory or game breaking as they provide you a faster way to get cosmetics that do not impact gameplay. The devs are also very active in terms of updates, player moderation and interaction. All in all in it's current state, it is a wonderful deception game that I can recommend, and a great buy for it's current price.\n", "timestamp_created": 1513582881, "timestamp_updated": 1513582881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38394213": {"recommendationid": "38394213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071307072", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 797, "last_played": 1516342935}, "language": "english", "review": "YEAh its pretty good thanks god", "timestamp_created": 1513580025, "timestamp_updated": 1513580025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38393553": {"recommendationid": "38393553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042000516", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 16914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1676, "last_played": 1516444255}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an interesting twist on the classic party games of Werewolf and/or Mafia.

This depth comes from the 40~ roles (the number changes every few updates) that you can be randomly assigned in a round. While this many roles, and their unique abilities, can pose a learning floor that is higher than Mafia or Werewolf, it's worth learning if you enjoy such slueth and bluff games! I personally watched several streamers play the game for about a week before I purchased it, and this helped my learn the game before jumping in.\n\nMy first play session was 28 hours long, and I've heard some people average around 12 hours for their first time as well; so be warned, it's addictive.

In addition, major patches are released now and then to further improve the game by either bringing a new class to the game, tweaking existing ones, or polishing the game mechanics.\n\nThis is a must-have for anyone who fancies a game of deceit.\nNow remember - Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.", "timestamp_created": 1513514682, "timestamp_updated": 1513514682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38372024": {"recommendationid": "38372024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077545656", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 158, "last_played": 1515588295}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, having to deceit others into believing you're on their side or having to DEDUCE[D] what are the other's roles and reaching conclusions can be really fun!", "timestamp_created": 1513503487, "timestamp_updated": 1513503487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38371651": {"recommendationid": "38371651", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962174812", "num_games_owned": 656, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3196, "last_played": 1516402693}, "language": "english", "review": "Anyone who enjoys the good old \"tabletop\" mafia game will love this.\n\nEveryone has a role, some more busy than others, and some with their own agendas.\n\nIf a vicious bug crops up the dev team usually will have it fixed the same day, and often within the hour.\n\nThe one and biggest con is that everything happens a bit too fast and can get very chaotic if you have one of the busy roles.", "timestamp_created": 1513502392, "timestamp_updated": 1513502392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38370991": {"recommendationid": "38370991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173250889", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 357, "last_played": 1516319963}, "language": "english", "review": "Great for laughing at salty people", "timestamp_created": 1513500173, "timestamp_updated": 1513500173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38370837": {"recommendationid": "38370837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065827264", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514730940}, "language": "english", "review": "Really awesome game, cool community managers and Devs as well what more can i say except to buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1513499620, "timestamp_updated": 1513499620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38370409": {"recommendationid": "38370409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092490454", "num_games_owned": 594, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 6209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5163, "last_played": 1516217096}, "language": "english", "review": "Like Town of Salem, but better.", "timestamp_created": 1513497955, "timestamp_updated": 1513497955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769313", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38369835": {"recommendationid": "38369835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097824697", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2890, "last_played": 1516432486}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game 3 weeks ago.

The main reason you may see it more in our game is because there are rooms of [b]16[/b] people together instead of ~5 (for the chat that you can see). We are sure it doesn't help that one of our primary competitors is not active in moderating their community, so we're definitely enforcing that it may be okay there, but [i]not[/i] here.\n\nWe have manycountless mechanisms to fight trolls: Reporting definitely does the trick (and if you leave, up to 14 others will likely report them - so np if you leave if it's too toxic. We'll know if you left due to being flamed). Reporting does work -- just sort by negative reviews and see all the revenge reviews from being banned for toxicity and racism :P\n\nWe're also wrapping up our Discord integration (for in-game moderation) for mods/devs to take action even-faster: So [b]technically, there ARE mid-game reports:[/b] Just toss us an imgur or something on Discord. We recommend an app called \"Greenshot\" (print screen lets you choose the crop >> upload directly to imgur >> puts link in clipboard). \n\nHowever, we do need their username at the end, but we can eye out for reports and keep our fingers ready for the banhammer button. Now that we'll have epic Discord-to-in-game moderation, we'll be adding [i]some[/i] way soon to deliver mid-game reports directly to Discord. We're looking into the imgur API. We may need some time for this one, though.\n\nSpeaking of Discord, we have ~11k people inside. While the game has been out for 3 months, [b]our Discord has been around for 2 years[/b]. We rarely need to ban, or even warn. These are the most legit people you'll ever see in any game, toxic-free. [b]We highly encourage players to group in the #matchmaking channel[/b] to experience ZERO toxicity. You'd have to try it to believe us.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/tol\n\n[b]EDIT:[/b] PS -- We are planning to split the community later with newplayers and vets, where only official Guides can play with the newbies (to get some tips from the vets, guaranteed non toxic) and where new players won't call each other idiots since...well... everyone will be new if in that mode :) Find more plans like this, news, etc in our Discord or Forum, announcing our intentions a few weeks back.

A bit of a learning curve but there's a beginners guide found on the main menu, on the wiki and theres a discord channel filled with tons of helpful lovely people.\nThere's not a whole lot of skill needed... sometimes its all luck. Sometimes it's going to take your sheer brain power and manipulation to win a game. Whatever it may be, games are quick and fast and each match feels new. \n\nThe graphics - I mean personally, I like the cartoony retro classic graphic look. On the brighter side, it looks better than Town of Salem :P.\n\nCommunity - There's gonna be some people who get a bit mad and a bit toxic. A couple cuss words get thrown around but in the end, it's a game that's based on communication and working together. People are bound to get a little antsy if they're wrongly accused or a huge mistake gets made that throws the game. Happens all the time in all sorts of games. The community is not toxic at all. There's people who are mature and immature. But in the end, everyone I met so far just wants to play the game and enjoy the game without any sort of unnecessary toxicity. \n\nCONCLUSION - Get the game if you're into the Trouble in Terrorist town vibe, or you just like the murder mystery genre.

Every single game feels fresh and exciting and I feel like my mind gets a mini-workout each game, regardless of what faction or class I am playing (except when I play Court Wizard; fuck that class).\n\nI\u2019d like to touch on a couple of things that I haven\u2019t seen mentioned much in reviews. ToL has quite a steep learning curve for such a \u201ccutesy\u201d, casual game, and there will be games where you will get flamed for not knowing mechanics and how the different classes interact with each other. Keep your head up, read up each class on the wiki, and watch some youtube/twitch videos. \n\nThe other issue I\u2019d like potential buyers to be aware of is that you may get into games where you get flamed for not doing something \u201cpopular\u201d (but you\u2019re not breaking any of the game rules). For example, the extremely powerful class known as the Prince generally doesn\u2019t reveal himself, for safety reasons, however, I was in a game where the Prince outed himself immediately, asked his faction\u2019s teammates to keep him healed/guarded, and to feed him information each day. I felt bad that he was flamed for doing something \u201cdifferent\u201d \u2013 as long as what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t go against your faction\u2019s goals and the game rules, I\u2019m all for weird and unconventional strategies in this game.\n\nJust be aware of this, and this is my heads up to you that I have almost 80 hours invested so far, and most games have been enjoyable and flame-free. There will be some \u201cblah\u201d games with some very childish people, but as far as online communities go, it\u2019s solid and generally mature.\n\nI think if you\u2019re at all interested in deduction and/or social games, don\u2019t care at all about the graphic style, and are willing to invest some time into learning the mechanics, you\u2019ll discover a true gem of a game, with endless possibilities, combinations, and a variety of personalities in your respective teammates (and enemies). In some games, you\u2019ll want to punch kittens due to the ridiculousness of it all, and in other games, you\u2019ll legit get out of your chair, point your finger at your computer monitor, and roar, \u201cGET DEDUCED\u201d.", "timestamp_created": 1512792664, "timestamp_updated": 1512792664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832651", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38151594": {"recommendationid": "38151594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050164013", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512737079}, "language": "english", "review": "For the low price of $10 you can get the following: No customer support, Disconnect issues, Reconnect Issues, Buggy patch cycles (Sometimes unplayable for hours), Bugged Abilities, none elo based match making (Newbs play with veterans, so even if you get good at the game you still will get new players that have no clue on your team), and No working In game friends list (So you won't ever have friends to play with in this \"Social\" game).\n\nIf this game was free to play it would be worth the hassle, but as it stands stay away.\n\nNot worth your money or time game is plagued with balance issues and plays like an early alpha game.

I cannot recommend this game enough.\n\nNow I mentioned it took the best elements of mafia games to bring together, what else does it bring? Well it brings new character screens and animations. Each character has their own night scene depending on their role, there are a couple death scenes so dead (town) court members don't just show up dead in front of their house the next day. It gives better immersion in my opinion. Town of Salem and Epic Mafia was meant to run in a browser but this game runs on a game engine. That means the possibility of more custom day and night scenes, custom execution scenes and a customization options that not only make you look better but have an effect on your animations. Town of Salem only had your death animation, this has the executioner's animation instead which changes based on your weapon. Its amazing.\n\nDon't take my word for it, I highly recommend you try it out. If you don't like it then you could always refund it but its dirt cheap anyway and updates are coming in quick and fast.

Some frustrating, some funny: https://youtu.be/y8G43mXUXqk\nAs for balance, we're at the dreamly 50% balance with only a 5% offset, which is something even AAA games have trouble achieving. We hope we have already shown that we will continue to balance (we went from 60% to 50% in only a month of balance suggestions from the community), with the same offset considerations. We'll keep trying to lower this offset, even more.\n\nIf the bugs are killing you, come back in a couple weeks and perhaps your feeling may be different. It doesn't take us long to fix stuff. Hope you try us again.\n\nPS -- you may want to post your feedback on Discord in the proper hub.

If people are shitty to each other - at least for me - it isn't fun (and can cause worse reactions). If people play along and just have fun and act decent, it can be a good time. I know this game has gotten quite a bit of attention on twitch, so I can see where the crowd is coming from. \n\nSo, if you are fine with people shitting on you if you mess up and being called an idiot and having a lot of salt thrown your way if you mess up - then this game can work for you\n\nIf you want to treat other like human beings and treated back as such or can't deal with that kind of destructive criticism pulled your way, steer clear. Also, if you deal with depression or anxiety the community will just worsen it with their behavior. I know this as I deal with some anxiety and have resulted in some anxiety attacks from this community (resulting in me unable to sleep until 3 am). So do what is best for yourself.\n\nI know the developers have made a fun game they work so hard on, it is just sad that it seems the wrong crowd has joined in and soiled the game.

Well, in TOS the days were too short in my opinion. There wasn't enough to time to properly discuss what you've found and there are toxic people even on that game.\nI'm not saying TOL doesn't have toxic people on there game, every game does, but the DEVs do their best to connect with their people and fix problems quickly. In TOS i've seen them ignore the demands more often than not.\nFor example, in TOL very few people liked the royal blood which replaced check allies on King. What the Devs did? They reverted it back to check allies.\nEveryone complained about the new noble. What did the Devs do? They removed noble. They tried to make him useful but people would spam Hearasy.\nI don't see TOS devs trying their best to please the people.\n\nAlso, those bad reviews are usually revenge reviews or people who just got banned for cheating. Don't cheat, play the actual game and then you won't get banned.\nThis game has problematic areas like every other game but it's amazing, the community is great despite those toxic weeds that pop up everytime.\n\nThe community is very helpful and fun, and I really enjoyed playing PTR and LIVE with them!\nAlso, I'm glad they do PTR to allow us to test the new build before it comes out and they can fix the problems we spot.\n\nIn TOS it can get repetitive and boring quickly, as it's always Mafia, and some sort of NK. \nBut in TOL it's either Unseen or Cult, and you have to keep guessing which it'll be. I've played games where we never knew what type of game it was until we FINALLY killed one of the Unseen/Cult.\nPlus, every role can be converted except only a few.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy this game. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it sure is mine! It makes you work hard to figure out who the killers are.

As stated below in the comments the game that actually prompted me to say enough is enough and leave this review is the game I talk about below in the review it self.\n\nWith regards to your sarcastic comment about not adding features from ToS, the only feature I suggest would be nice is the scrolls that ToS have or something similar, this is actually something you've already commented on in your discussions forum so it's obviously something that is desired by other people, your response is \"someone has to play the good guys\" well yeah, they do, some of the good classes are fun to play, some classes that are boring to others are fun to others and the way ToS handles it is you just get a increased chance to be your chosen role, not guaranteed chance. \n\n[h1] Review [/h1]\n\nSeemed fun at first but after awhile it starts to get a bit stale, comparing it to TOS like most others at least; in that most people have classes that they prefer and almost all of them feel like they play some form of important role within the town, this is where ToL falls short, there are just too many classes in it that feel useless, boring or just similar to other ones.\n\nDidn't pay a lot for it but when it's competitor is a free game then you expect something a lot better and most games just leave me with a bad taste in my mouth, for example the last one I played was 15 minutes of kids spamming chat, nobody actually listening or getting information accross so I sat silent until near the end of the game where the \"Prince\" aka Jailor jails me for a second time, dies and has left in his will that I did not talk (even though I did, both times) so I am \"EVIL\". I get hung, as the Princess, an investigation type of class. Yawn. \n\n\n- A lot of classes seem stale and useless\n- Never feels like there is much variety to the clases just \"Oh this..again\"\n- Player base is pretty much as idiotic as Town of Salem\n- Looks dated, TOS is free and has a lot more going for it in terms of looks / art / cosmetics (Slight nit picking here as graphics etc don't generally bother me but again comparing paid to free)\n- No scrolls to get a higher chance at a prefered class, probably due to the player base size\n\nSteam still doesn't allow a neutral review so it's going to have to be negative, I do enjoy the game but enough to recommend my friends / others to buy it?

Throne of Lies (ToL) is a variation of the popular Mafia social game whereby you will either be on the side of the Blue Dragon (Good), Cult/Unseen (Evil) or the forsaken Neutrals. ToL is also often compared or described as Town of Salem (ToS) in 3D, which I can agree to a certain extent as they have the same core gameplay but currently ToS has much more content in terms of roles and meta.\n\nThe gameplay for ToL is extremely addictive, provided that you are willing to commit mistakes and learn more about the game as the games could be tainted with toxicity due to salty/stupid players at times (I admit I do get salty too). Winning the game is very satisfying as you tend to be emotionally invested into the game as you could be wrongly framed, caught out being as an evil but turning it around etc etc.\n\nHowever, a word of warning for beginners who are new to the Mafia game genre, you could try out ToS on the web browser for free before jumping into ToL. This allows you to understand the overall mechanic of Mafia games and provide a smoother transition into ToL as the players in this game could be quite unforgiving towards newbies.\n\nAs of 18/11/2017 and being a player for a month, I would recommend this game because the developers are consistently updating the game and tweaking the \"unfun\" classes like Court Wizard/Noble from the feedback of the players. This shows that the dev team are listening to the players and making positive changes to the game in order to better the gaming experience for the players. $10 for possibly hundreds of hours in gameplay is very much a steal, even more if you are looking to make a purchase during sales.\n\nEDIT: I voted this game for the \"The World Is Grim Enough Let's Just All Get Along\" Steam Award", "timestamp_created": 1510937093, "timestamp_updated": 1511509325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36571979": {"recommendationid": "36571979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073393739", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513138012}, "language": "english", "review": "My background for social deduction games of this sort comes from Resistance/Avalon board games, although I've played a bit of One Night Werewolf and Coup as well.

It's very frequently updated with patches ( too frequently, if you can imagine that ), so it keeps constantly changing - it really brings out the sentiment that devs are intent on improving it.\n\nThere is a great variety of classes you can end up getting, with various powers and win conditions, most of which are quite fun, with a couple of boring ones. Most of the game is about being either good at lying, or at catching other people in a lie. Communicating and deducing information quickly as well, of course. Being a fast typist helps too.  \n\nSome gripes I have with the game:\n\n- The game is a bit nonintuitive at first in terms of how night abilities interact, and what interactions return which messages. It will take a while to learn those, and even when you do, they are constantly being changed with patches. \n- As with every game of this sort I imagine, you cannot really play them together with your friends if you intend on sharing information before the game is finished, since that would be cheating. It's also kinda impossible to catch this type of cheating, so that's why I feel you can't take this game too seriously. \n- Some players will disconnect from the game, leave on purpose, out their teammates because they didn't want to be converted, all of which can ruin it for the other 15. I am not sure how serious the team behind the game is about punishing this behavior yet - they say they are on discord, but I would love to see some public announcements on how people are being punished.\n\n----\n\nCurrently there is only one mode of play, unranked, but at least the waiting queues are short since there seem to be a lot of players at all times.\n\n9/10, easily worth $10, even at this stage with all its warts, and I imagine it will only be getting better since devs seem to be very active.", "timestamp_created": 1510927876, "timestamp_updated": 1511677779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36562795": {"recommendationid": "36562795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194739090", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1515914920}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely worth the money for it , the game features surpasses Town Of Salem by miles.

At first glance it just looks like a copy of Town of Salem but it is so so so much better in my opinion. And I say that as someone with probably 30+ hours in ToS. First off, there's so many more roles in the game, but not enough so that it gets exhausting. It's like the perfect amount so that it keeps the game very fresh without being a slog to learn everything. Additionally, the game has a very streamlined built in class list that tells you every single thing about the class, so you don't need to worry about not knowing what class do.\nSo the way the game plays is as follows: The \"Good\" faction is the Blue Dragon, and they're in every game. Then it randomly chooses a \"Bad\" faction, either the Unseen or the Cult. The Unseen is like the traditional mafia, The Cult is a bit weirder. Every game has a Prince, a King, , 2 of either The Cult or The Unseen, 2-4 Neutral classes and 8-10 random Blue Dragon classes. The king can be Good, Evil, or Neutral which makes for very interesting games.\nThe game plays pretty much the exact same as ToS. A 90 second day for discussion and voting for treason followed by a 30-45 second night (can't remember which). However, this gameplay is where ToL is ahead of ToS by leagues. First off, there is not a single dull class in ToL. For example, in ToS, if you get Survivor or Retributionist, it's pretty boring because you can't really help your team win directly through what you do. Obviously with the survivor all you have to do is live, which is really boring. Nobody wants to do nothing except for survive. It's fun to learn secrets about people and be involved in the game, and the survivor actively stops you from that. Additionally, the Retributionist can be extremely valuable to the town, but the only thing they can do is revive someone. It can be one of the most valuable skills in the game, but the player doesn't feel like they did much. ToL gets rid of those issues entirely.\nFirst off, every single class has at least 2 abilities, some have up to 4. The abilities are split into Day and Night abilities. Day abilities can obviously be used during the day and they have an immediate impact. For example, look at Political Pressure on The Aristocrat. It forces a player to vote another player up for treason and remove their ability to vote again. You can use this to completely screw over another player by making them look super suspicious. It's a very fun and unique ability. On the other hand, Night abilities are used during the night and almost always have their effects done at the end of the night. For example, look at the Psychic's Link Minds. At night she has the ability to link her mind with 2 other players, allowing the to talk privately during the night. This is an example of an ability that doesn't occur at the end of the night. This is another very cool and useful ability.\nEvery class is able to directly influence other players in the game and learn about them or kill them, which makes for much more fun games. Many of the abilities are so unique and cool that it adds much more flavor to the game than ToS. For example, look at the Illusionist, the Unseen version of the Psychic. She has an ability where she can delete the chat history of a player. That is such a fantastic idea for an ability like holy shit! It has the potential to completely ruin a player's day it such a cool way. The game is sprinkled with awesome abilities like this.\nThe Unseen and the Cult are able to stay relevant throughout the entire game. Both of them have leaders which are able to convert Blue Dragon people to their faction, with each BD class having its own unique Unseen class. You could play the game for so long and still never experience all the classes because of how the conversions work.

In the morning all the dead bodies are found in a random location of the castle, giving it a real murder-mystery vibe. On top of that there are tons of cosmetic items which you can buy with money EARNED THROUGH THE GAME to increase your immersion at no real expense. \n\nFor me the best thing about ToL is the community. As it is a social deduction game by far the most important enjoyment factor is the players around you - how your team mates act, how toxic they are. The Mods and Devs work tirelessly to get rid of any trolls or toxic players (which are normally few and far between) which can be evidenced by the vast amount of salty reviews from trolls who have been banned :D.

I don't think it's a very good description, but it's the best I've got.\n\nThe game is very fun, especially for the low price, and it has (at time of writing) quick queues for matches and a good community. Each match is pretty much always fun, and it only gets better once you get familiar with the rules and mechanics. Graphics are unimportant for this type of game, and I appreciate being able to run it on pretty much any computer that isn't more than a decade old.\n\nOnly issue that I can think of is that every patch so far has changed the rules a bit. Always read the patch notes. Developers are clearly trying to find the right balance for a few mechanics, and that's a good thing, but in a game with such emphasis on knowing the mechanics, a sudden change in mechanics can be very disorienting.\n\nThe only suggestions I have are that I would like to see enduring statistics for individuals. I don't want anything public, necessarily, but I'd like to know how many times I've won while playing the Prince, etc. \n\nAnd maybe consider putting the King in slot 1 on roster by default. Sometimes feels like whoever's #1 in a game is thrown under the bus by their prominent placement. Since there's always a King, I'd think the King would go in that most prominent position by default. Of course, #16 is also marked out, but not as much as #1 is, I think.\n\nAlso, the Physician having to choose between healing and exhuming puts him at a great disadvantage, so much so that it's rare to see anyone use Exhume to great effect. I think if Exhume were a daytime ability (I know graverobbing is not a broad-daylight activity, but bear with me) it would make Physician preferable to the Alchemist for some people, and would also keep the Physicians from being too bored in the daytime (where they presently have no abilities and generally no reason to engage the other players).\n\nOther than that, I have no suggestions.

Tabletop games like Avalon and Battlestar Galactica are what introduced me to this genre and Throne of Lies really takes what they have to offer and ups the ante with various roles and ways to interact.\n\nWhile the idea of the game is not anything new, its execution is delightful. The various roles take time to thoroughly learn and the social aspect of the game ensures that gameplay doesn't get dull quickly. The game is constantly updated (at least now, few weeks from the launch) and balance changes seem a delightfully important duty for the developers.\n\nI have to give negative comments on the technical functionality. The UI is ugly, sometimes the game hangs when connecting to a game and joining the game as a group of friends is wonky at times. Especially for roles that have things to do on the first day and night the wonky connection can prove very annoying.\n\nThis aside, Throne of Lies has quite unique attraction to it. The simple presentation is immediately forgotten after the game starts and all player focus is aimed at the action itself. The technical problems will hopefully the ironed out and balance perfected.

During the update I was playing priest it was particularly important not to put a mark on your back. Then, a psychic links me with the king. The king has a tendency to die d4 in about half of the games, so I didn't want myself on his logs. So I didn't claim. My argument ingame at the time was \"king can be evil too.. lol\" or something along those lines.\n\nThe next day the psychic puts me on the stand for this, rather then waiting for any of the ACTUAL investigative classes to check me. Furthermore, they don't wait for the prince to jail me (so I could have a chance to talk to him without the others knowing). They execute me for treason on the spot. I only had 30 seconds to sum up this argument, so I said something along the lines of \"One of these days you'll learn king can be not bd\". Not the greatest way to put my argument, but I was under time pressure you know?\n\nAll in all, not too upset about that much. It's a social game, and I really didn't think they were going to execute me D2. But low and behold the moderators issue me a warning for throwing the game. Firstly, we WON that game. Secondly, overbearing much?\n\nThe official moderator says \"Not claiming when on stand is going against BDs objectives\". If you are prince or priest you just want to be quiet all game (I know because I tried whispering people on priest and I got a warning for gamethrowing there as well) and not raise attention. And I really didn't want to be on the kings notes before he proves himself. But even if I was *wrong*, there's no \"social deception\" if what you're allowed to SAY (outside of slurs and swears and outing friends) is restricted.\n\n----\n\nHowever, with all that said the moderators are necessary for this game. I think they are working on balancing their moderation acts and are at least taking people advice with regards to the state of the game. After originally leaving a negative review, I will review with a tentative yes, it's worth it, however avoid band-waggoning anyone who does anything off the cuff.

The developer of Throne of Lies flagged my review which said that this game was Town of Salem with more abilities, even though he previously said the exact same thing. These devs cannot handle critcism, even when it is 100% valid.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI had originally reviewed this game with a fairly simple, not very in-depth negative review. The developer of the game felt the need to respond in an extremely passive aggressive manner AND flagged my review for breaking community guidelines, which of course, it did not. After I saw that spectacle I looked around at the other negative reviews and saw that the dev had of course replied to every single negative review, either debunking the negative review or replying in a passive aggressive manner as he had done to mine. I happened to see one response from the dev regarding the differences between his game and the similar Town of Salem. \n\nHere is the photo of the dev stating the differences between the two games: https://i.imgur.com/2iEkQ1q.png \n\nSince in my previous review that had gotten flagged for breaking community guidelines had mentioned that this game was basically Town of Salem but with more abilities, I couldnt help but notice that most of his differences were ability based. What follows is a step by step breakdown of what the DEVELOPER states as the differences between his game and Town of Salem.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKing/royal ascension system: This is a pretty good difference that is NOT in Town of Salem\n\nThe next 3 points are all based on abilites: It's true this game has more abilities and I stated that in my review\n\nIn-Game Wiki: Town of Salem is a browser game, it isnt very difficult nor offputting to open a new tab and type \"Town of Salem wiki\"\n\nWeapons are tied to abilities AND 99% similar to concept art: Yes, please let me use my microtransaction weapons to let people know what ability I used. Also, congratulations your models are similar to what you wanted them to be I guess, what a feature.\n\nReconnection and invite code system: Reconnecting is honestly a great feature that I applaud you putting into this game, however Town of Salem does not need an invite code system because you just click your friend to invite them. When trying to invite your friend in this game, sometimes they wont recieve it so you have to copy and paste an extremely long code for them to put into their game to join you. Why not just use the steamworks system to invite friends. This is not a good difference it is extremely tedious.\n\n3D graphics AND uncompressed music: It's true that this game is 3D, but nothing within the 3D world is interactable. It's more like looking at a 3D image, which is no better than town of salem, you are still only interacting with UI elements. Town of Salem has music, but if you are really going to say that having a different genre of music is a big difference be my guest.\n\nThe only differences that aren't bogus and that the DEVELOPER of the game stated are the ascension system and the abilities. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "timestamp_created": 1509668257, "timestamp_updated": 1510468902, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409313", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1511591138, "developer_response": "0.3 hours played.

And each class is differend from another. Each one has a diffrend goals (that mean in some cases you dont really need to survive in order to win the game). For example if you are good guy you have to find evil ones and have them executed during the day. Sounds easy? Problem is that you have no idea who is good guy and who is \"baddie\". So you have to use chat in order to find who is ally and who is possibly enemy. Some classes are investigarors.. like sherrif who can tell who is good and who is bad.

There's the Blue Dragon faction (the \"\"good guys\"\") who don't know the alignment of anyone else, the Unseen and Occult (the \"\"bad guys\"\") who know who's on their side, and the neutral people who are out for themselves. It becomes a game of trust building and deceit. Do you have what it takes to make people trust you? even if you're a repear waiting to stick your sickle into their back? \n\nIn my favorite recent game, I ended up as the reaper; a stand alone class who reaps people's souls. You're all alone in this role and if the court votes to throw you out, there's little you can do about it. So what does one do? Deflect, decept, and deny. Build up relationships and then toss em away when they are no longer useful. That's the mind of a reaper. \n\nBut the game is incredibly, incredibly complex. The dead can and do talk with the priest class meaning anyone you backstab can come back to haunt you. Observers can spy on your every move while nobles send maids to spy on your secret converstations. The prince can jail anyone but the king and demand they account for their actions all while not knowing if the king they serve under is good, evil, or neutral. In total, there are kings, nobles, dutcheses, aristocrats, priests, seers, psychic's, prince's, seers, drunks, alcoholics, reapers, cult leaders, masterminds, assassins, hunters, alchemists, fools, and many more. \n\nWho will lie their way to the throne?

Please for the love of Cthulu, if you are Noble, DON'T use a crier on the first night, it tips off everyone in the game that there is a Noble, and you are unable to utilise one of my favourite abilities in the game, which allows you to send a maid to one player and listen in on all the whispers they send/receive. And yes, some classes are on the more OP side of the balance equilibrium, but I find this a lot fun due to causing the evil factions/classes having to try and work out which player is that class and making them their number one priority.\n\nThere is very little toxicity from the social side of things, and usually if there is toxicity during the game it is because of a specific player's agenda due to the class they are playing and is not at all personal, 90% of the toxicity I have encountered in-game has been met by an apology from the player instigating it either after they have died, or in the end-game lobby.\n\nTL;DR - buy this game.

It's an online verison in which each player gets a unique class with their own abilites to help provide information in lieu of being able to use the social cues in a face to face game. Be warned though that this is a very different type of game, it involves a lot of deduction and logic.  This isn't a fast paced game and the engine and graphics are very bare.\n\nIf you've played Town of Salem, this game is far superior in my opinion.  The classes are far deeper and more interesting with all of them have multiple abilites. For example, the Priest class is a Medium and Retributonist in one, with the added ability to survive a single attack and heal someone once per game.  This makes the class far more interesting than either class is in Town of Salem.  \n\nThe classes are more balanced and varied, to the extent where the good faction doesn't need a strict role list to avoid imbalanced games.  Because classes have a wider ranger of abilites it isn't really as important which specific classes are present, since another class can often take over.  For example, the Knight Class can act as a Bodyguard, but they can also choose to attack someone at night, similar to a Vigilante. \n\nThere is no way to spy on the evil factions at night, so they can actually cooperate. The evil roles have ways to misdirect and fool people that are far more useful.  For example, the Herbalist role (similar to doctor, but evil) can make someone think they were attacked and healed. Conversion mechanics make it impossible to simply self-confirm day 1 and then have everyone know you're good the rest of the game. \n\nThe neutral roles are far more well thought out.  The neutral killers are actually strong and can often win, and the neutral beigns are more active.  For the example the Alchemist is like the survivor, only they can heal and have 2 kills per game, letting them influence the game instead of just vesting every night and waiting to see if you die.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, but it's definitely a step up from Town of Salem in terms of design. About the only negative is it might be a bit *too* complex and *too* deep for some people's tastes.", "timestamp_created": 1508735079, "timestamp_updated": 1508735079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702113", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35937547": {"recommendationid": "35937547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046771564", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "last_played": 1516005707}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool Mafia/Town of Salem-esque game.

And if \"bad\" guy is decent liar this is nearly impossible to determine if he is \"bad\", because he pretends to be another \"good\" class that almost cannot to be distinguished from the \"bad\" one. Plus, \"good\" guys can be turned to \"bad\" guys in one night, which makes determination even harder. As a result almost all executions by accusation are very random and often have no reasons at all.\n\nThirdly, there are key statements made by players that give you about 90% probability that those players do not lie. Because those statements are pretty easy to check and would ruin those game if they would lie.\n\nSo this game needs a serious rework to become less random and less dependent of statements in chat.

The game's all multiplayer and all about trust and calculated risk.  Even if you aren't an elite multiplayer gamer, as long as you can type and either see through BS or spin BS of your own, you can have fun with this game.  Player base is large enough that games are quickly found and it's also aggressively policing abusive players.  I got this game a week ago but have been really addicted and never had an angry or bad experience so far.\n\nFor the game itself -- Generally you have 16 players, 2 starting as an evil faction that always knows who they are and want to kill or take over the good guys, 8-10 on a good faction that start out clueless, with the remainder being neutral with different goals.  \n\nThere's 2 phases of the game, during the night a lot of action happens -- people get killed, people change factions, people spy on each other.  During the day everyone can talk about what happened, and if they choose they can put anyone else up for an execution vote... if enough join in, there is a trial where the person explains themself and finally everyone votes again whether to kill them or not.  \n\nThere's different good roles that can you can start with, and each of the 2 evil factions have variations of the good classes.  For neutrals, they have 6 roles with powers that depend on their objectives.\n\nSome roles have killing powers, some can investigate and determine what type someone else is, there are communication classes that can talk to dead players or send anonymous/secret messages, and defensive classes that block many different things.\n\nSo the good side doesn't know who's who, but they want to gather lots of info with abilities and figure out how to share it... without revealing to the evil side whether they are good instead of neutral.  If the good side can figure out the evils, then they can easily vote them off.  The game is endless bluffing, literally everyone wants to be seen as allied with the good side, so you dealing in lies and liars from start to finish!", "timestamp_created": 1508024702, "timestamp_updated": 1508024757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499495", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35730177": {"recommendationid": "35730177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049995659", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510352447}, "language": "english", "review": "The first thing I thought when playing this game, was it's similarity to the popuar game Town of Salem. However, if you dislike Town of Salem, don't let that turn you away from this game. There are a lot of key problems Town of Salem had that are absent from this game. The player base in general is better, no random lynching and no people throwing games for no reason.\n\nThe classes and factions are also much better balanced, and classes themselves are more fun to play. Instead of having only a few classes that you hope for, you can have fun playing just about every class. There are a couple of classes I personally feel don't have much impact, but the game is constantly improving, so.\n\nThe best thing about this game, is that the most important factor is most definitely the players skill. This is a game of deception and logic, and those skills are highly valuable in this game. If you are a good player, you can easily win any game if you're careful. It takes a while to get the hang of a few things, but once you do, you will have some of the most satisfying wins and comebacks.\n\nI honestly just can't wait for there to be a larger playerbase. At any given time, there's around 300-600 people playing. This imeans there's probably 2000 active players. This is enough for you to not have any trouble finding a match quickly, but if there were more then they could start implementing a ranking system. Normally people who play games like this are competitive, so I think it would be a nice addition.\n\nBUY THIS GAME NOW! PLAY IT! SUPPORT THE AMAZING PEOPLE WHO MADE IT! ENJOY IT! QUIT YOUR JOB!

It's a lot of fun to play and really addictive. When you first start out, plan on losing a bunch until you learn how things work.

I love how you always get a different role each game, and you aren't always on the same faction, and no one knows what they will be until the game starts. This keeps things fresh and interesting. Plus, since players can be converted to another faction mid-game, sometimes your strategy will completely pivot (and sometimes you can be pulled off the losing side on to the winning one.) \n\nThe game does have a few bugs to be worked out, and my game does crash from time to time, but for a $10 game still in beta it's worth every penny. \n\nBesides the occasional crash, the only downside to this game is having to play with really dumb people from time to time. There are a lot of different skill levels among the players, and really dumb and clueless people can be super frustrating (unless you are the one trying to take advantage of the dumb people, and then it's cool.) \n\nThis is my favorite game of the year, and it's definitely worth picking up for $10 or less.

Also i played like 30 games and only one game was Cult game, so I think like there was a half of the game that was not really accessible to me.

Creates some really fun situations.\n- Stability: the game has yet to crash, disconnect or otherwise break in 15 hours.

I had never played a social deduction game before and never thought I would. I've since been enjoiying it so much that I thought to give it my very first Steam review. At first I just stood around and watched and usually got picked off early for seeming suspicious because I had no idea what was going on (This happens but you will learn). \nTeamwork is key in this game, each role has abilities which provide information on a small piece of the puzzle and when combined with the information from other roles the teams can then begin to deduce who the odd or suspicious players are and silently kill them off at night or vote for their execution during day court.\nthe 4 class types (Offensive, Killer, Support, Investigative) must work together providing each other with their findings so that they can each carry out their roles succesfully eg. If an Investigative class discovers an enemy they must convey this info to a killer class to take action.\nThe catch comes in that you dont know the roles or classes of the other players and that you cant always trust the information you recieve, various abilities are able to skew the info and other players are rather partial to telling lies as the title of the game would suggest. Its your job to find ways to verify the info and convey it to the correct players in a way that they can trust you.\nThis is a very distilled description and there are many more dynamics in game which make for some tense situations. As rewarding as it is to weed out the Reaper and see them hung in court it is equally as dampening to your soul to see the teammates that you trusted so much turn out to be the bad guys. No other game that I have played can do that which makes me give it high ratings.

The game itself is fun if you've ever played any kind of social deduction game like Mafia or Werewolf, but contains a (initially dizzying) array of roles that you can become. A lot of fun stuff messes around with the core mechanics of the game, like letting you make it look like someone said something they didn't, talking to dead players at night to find out what information they know, and so on.\n\nThe devs are constantly updating and patching (sometimes multiple times a day) and are very active on the Discord server, so it's a great time to get into this game.", "timestamp_created": 1507553603, "timestamp_updated": 1507553603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35594934": {"recommendationid": "35594934", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994951172", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510989224}, "language": "english", "review": "I should be sleeping...instead i'm lying about lying....\n\n10/10 lies.", "timestamp_created": 1507551743, "timestamp_updated": 1507551743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35594909": {"recommendationid": "35594909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079205455", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510365047}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, I'm going to be looking at this from the perspective of someone coming to it from Town of Salem.\n\nThis game is amazing!!! Take everything good about Town of Salem, make it INCREDIBLY balanced, add a measly $10 to the price and you've got yourself a great, addictive game. In my last game as sheriff, we had 3 consecutive evil kings. Playing as sheriff I somehow managed to find 3 unseen (one was from my scout, which tells you if the person they're watching changes faction). I told the court to execute one of them and if they were innocent to execute me. They were an Assassin, so together with my hired mercenary and the Blue Dragons (BD), a.k.a. the good guys, I managed to execute all of the Unseen and the BD won the game against the odds. \n\nSome people say the evil factions always win but my first three games had the good factions win, it's up to luck and skill really. In terms of DLC and microtransactions,\n\n\n\n\nWhich is a welcome change from Town of Salem. The only in-game items are cosmetics (the weapons actually change how you execute someone in a trial, since it picks someone to execute a guilty character), which you buy from the in-game currency that you get just from winning games. You get 75 gold from a win and start with 500, which I think is reasonable considering the price of items ranging from 75-2000 gold. You can also make bets on who will die during the following day and night when you are dead, which is a welcome change from, well, not doing anything. \n\nThe graphics have a nice cartoony feel to them, and are not hard on your computer. The art for the class portraits is very nice and immersive, which brings me to my next point, the in-game class info screen. This is a great feature, which describes in detail every class and its abilities. More on those later. Some other features that I really felt lacking in Town of Salem are seperate private notes for your eyes only, the ability to write way more on your will/journal, and finally, the amazing feature of not losing your writing if you press enter too early. \n\nPlayers from Town of Salem will know exactly what I mean. The game is reading off the list of people that died last night, and you're typing a great long message about how Deodat Lawson is clearly the Godfather, because he was immune to the vigilante but had claimed medium. Then you see the role of the last player who died and press enter. But your whole message disappears! This leads to having to copy it in case of this happening, which means losing whatever else you had copied beforehand. Well this is no longer an issue. Throne of Lies simply highlights your message if you can't send it.\n\nNow, onto the roles (or classes as they are called) themselves. Every class is so much more interesting than in Town of Salem, with most having both day and night abilities, some even having more than one of each. At a minimum expect a class to have at least two or three abilities, with some like the King having about six iirc. None of the classes I have played as so far I have found boring in the slightest, with the least interesting being the Psychic, who is essentially a jailor without the ability to kill, but with two daytime abilities as well. Bare in mind I said the least interesting, whereas jailor is probably my favourite role in Town of Salem.\n\nFinally, I'll talk about the playerbase. It's [i] amazing[/i]. Town of Salem is infamous for it's absolutely toxic playerbase, with a select few players who are actually nice to people and don't spam the chat/get triggered over a mistake/leave instantly. Well in Throne of Lies those select few are the norm. My first game everyone was helping me with basic controls and tips, and the discord (which I highly recommend) had lots of people giving me advice. One thing that is very helpful is to go to the wiki ( tol.wikia.com ) and have a look at the strategy section for the role you're playing. It's helped me out every game.\n\nAlso the music is good.\n\nTo sum up, I'd recommend this game not only to players of Town of Salem sick of the unbalanced roles, toxic community and microtransactions, but to any gamer in general. It's a great game that really captures the essence of the (slowly) growing Mafia-esque genre, and it's a joy to play. I'll probably be addicted soon enough.\n\nP.S.

There is so much to learn in this game, yet there is not a huge learning curve in the game. There are currently 41 classes in the game as I am writing this review all with their own unique night and day abilities. There is an easily accessible page of all of the classes and what they can do in and out of game. This is very useful if you are just getting into the game so you have limited questions. I prefer this game to Town of Salem as it required mroe thinking and more skill to get anywhere.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics in this game are amazing. The game is coded in 3D, and the game just looks astonishing. During the day, all of the player models sit around the table. If they send a message in chat, their player model moves. If a player is voted to be executed for treason, an execution is shown to every player. There are some really awesome executions you can purchase in the shop (my personal favorite is Vortex of Corax, but it is 2K gold). You can also purchase skins for your avatar in the shop for various prices. More executions and skins are being worked on, but the ones in game look extremely nice. Also, most classes have their own night room, and the majority of these look extremely cool. My personal favorites are the Court Wizard, Psychic, and Butler rooms. The rooms are a very nice touch to this games - especially the Prince's cell. You actually change rooms to a jail cell if you're jailed by the Prince. That is great. You're not forced to look at a static image each night!\n\nCommunity:\nThe community in this game is very active and, for the most part, decent. The Discord is extremely active and is a key part of the game. I highly suggest you get involved with the community. If you have any questions, just ask it in the general chat and you should get a response. Don't be shy, most of us don't bite! Oh, by the way, please do not draw penises on the death notes. We had death notes disabled for a while because of abundance of penises on the death notes. There is a report button now, though. I will admit, though, after release, the people in the game have been a bit more cancerous. That may just be because I'm not an easy person to get along with, though. But please, for the love of everyone, play the game well. If you're put on the stand, claim something. Don't just say that you're \"good\" or \"i'm bd\". That's not a sufficient defense most of the time. We do have a ton of YouTubers who play the game, and a recent surge in popularity was due to Lirik streaming the game (thanks Lirik!).\n\nDevelopers:\nThis game's developers are miles better than Town of Salem's. This game gets frequent updates. This game is buggier than Town of Salem, but if you find a bug, just post screenshots and your output logs in the bug channel on the Discord and the bug should be fixed soon. You can also give suggestions in the feedback channel and they may be heard. The last patch, 1.0.3, was actually made up of mostly user suggested stuff.

There are a lot of fun ways to interact, every class has a place, some are stronger than others of course, but there is where your ability to identify your enemies and allies comes in. The bad guys will pf course have the benefit of knowing who they are, but being in small numbers. Neutrals are all unique, some need to team up with others, some are on an individual mission of destruction, some seek revenge, some just want to survive.\n\nThere will be some hillarious RP moments, one time we had Jesus and Satan, with Jesus being the king (and a pretty nasty one, if you were disobient everyone would accuse you out of fear of being accused themselves).

Sure I played ToS for around 50 or so hours starting a couple years ago when it first came out, but I found it to be rather dull after a couple of games and haven't played it in months. ToL was mentioned to me in ToS actually last time I played and I googled it cause I was interested. They had a shit ton of roles that seemed pretty cool and they all had like 3 abilities and along with the medieval theme I thought \"this game looks really interesting\". I ended up buying it off the ToL website during it's beta period and was kinda upset with the small amount of players it had during the beta and the difficulty of getting a game. I loved the gameplay itself though, even from an action game perspective this game really is engaging most of the time. I've played through a bunch of changes to the characters, which overall have been really well done and I don't disagree with any of them, I've personally talked to one of the devs when I had a question, which he was really helpful with and also replied in a timely manner, and I've been excited when playing almost every class given the propensity they all have to change games. The conversion effect in this game is wonderful, you can hardly ever anticipate how a game is going to happen, and it allows for longer games than just killing 4 people and it ending. Overall neutrals are most definitely my favorite type to play, scorned especially, and as a action game player with a very small attention span for games I can tell you this game is worth as much money as I payed for it and more. It has managed to keep my attention for hours on end, and some of the plays I've made have been absolutely ridiculous and left me exhilarated. I 100% recommend you buy this game and try it out, with the game coming out of beta there are more than enough players to find a game in usually less than 5 minutes, and it's definitely a game I'll be staying with and continuing to play.

One for myself and another for a friend's bday.\n\nThis is definitely an upgrade from the days of Mafia on Warcraft 3 custom games.  Typically games like these are ruined by the group atmosphere and trolls who seek to spoil the fun.  So far I've only encountered 1 troll and after he was reported was never seen again.  It seems the dev team takes reports seriously.  Something that has always gravitated me towards indie studios.\n\nGameplay is amazing, immersive and fun.  With a full 16-person game there's lots of opportunity to employ various strategies, and to change them over the course of the game as your class's goals shift.  Especially as neutral classes, the ability to work with others towards mutually beneficial ends that satisfy two goals so there can be multiple winners is a great caveat of Throne of Lies.\n\nI'm reviewing this game with maybe 20-30 matches under my belt, just shy of 30 hours played.  At the time of writing, I have just won 5 games in a row.  First win of the series was as a Butler turned Servant as my predictions for trialing and executing the unseen were dead accurate.  With the trust of existing BlueDragon members, I used that to my advantage and ended up occupying most of them as my unseen allies picked them off 1 by 1 in the night while I called them to trial 1 by 1 during the day.  The very last game of the series was as an Alchemist, turned Neutral King in the lategame.  Protected by a Merc, I satisfied win conditions for both of us by not choosing sides too early, waiting until the herd was thinned, then siding with Unseen near the end to pick off remaining BlueDragon members.  The merc exhausted his Guard ability on me from Nights 3 through 6, just long enough to be able to choose a side to help win, where I rallied the Evil Majority, was converted to Neutral King and brought remaining BlueDragons to trial to close out the game.\n\nFor those of you looking for a mentally stimulating game you can play alone or with friends, definitely check out Throne of Lies!\n\nData:\nPlayer population is about 400 active players on discord at the time of me writing this.  I've never had any trouble finding games.  Queue time is < 5 minutes round the clock.  Also a really active official discord server that you can find the info for ingame to connect with players and the game devs themselves to submit bugs and feedback.\n\nCons:\n- Time between phases Night/Day and even Dead player reveals is too long in my opinion.  It feels like we're always hanging on to a scene a bit too long when someone is executed or when found dead in the morning.\n\nFeedback:\n- Dead chat history should reveal to all players upon game completion so players who survived can see what people who died were saying while the game went on.  Sometimes dead players will call out a really nice play or root for their favorite player still alive.  People will appreciate this if it's implemented :)\n- Skin system is still quite tiny.

This results in many neutral roles being very strong. While this seems balanced, it puts far more emphisis on avoiding the chaos of night actions rather that information and lying.\n\nThe game is called Throne of Lies...but I find that it should be called Court of Chaos as winning is more luck based then convincing others.\n\nConversion of town(blue dragon) to mafia (unseen or cult) is incredibly swingy as removing a crucial role.\n\nLynching a jester (fool) results in losing the fool lynch day, but also the next 2 days. This completely takes the power away from town and focuses it on night actions and kills.\n\nThe game is far more chaotic then a game of lies should be.\n\nIf you like powerful chaotic mafia, this game is tailor made for you.

Easily the best thing about digital mediums for mafia is the ability to track stats. \n\nAchevements? Could easily have achievements based purely on winning as a faction or class to not compromise gameplay.\n\nThe amount of neutral classes that spawn add tons of chaos. \n\nIt matters a ton about what faction the nightkill is from, and most of the evil factions have little to no way of checking. Again, chaos over information.\n\nThe low amount of information gained by evil is too low. Generally mafia works best with a informed coordinated minority versus a uncoordinated, uninformed majority. Instead we have a uninformed minority evil faction that blind converts people hoping to gain a little info along the way. In fact, the prince (always BD) and the king (can be anything, but hard to share said info unless town(BD).\n\nConsistency of abilities and their balance changes every patch. The court wizard went from useless to one of the best roles for example.\n\nThe game is a great building block but it needs a lot of touch up work.

So here is some advice\n\nBlue Dragon: Be attentive to the game, focus and watch for holes in some stories as all stories have at least one hole in it. Find an ally and group up to take out the Neutrals, the Unseen, and the Cult. Watch your back and dont get trigger happy with executes as some are just pure random, Never execute a prince claim nor don't Cold Steel a Prince claim, always guard the Prince who should never become King unless it is absolutely nesseciary.\n\nUnseen: Work together and try and keep hidden from the Blue Dragon and Neutrals, Always pay attention to what you claim and how, there is only so much that can be used before your detected, Ive found sometimes its best to out an Unseen member that has a lot of heat and is already being suspected of being Unseen if it means you can remain hidden but that ONLY works for the mastermind as he is the most important role, dont get command happy either, you are a team so work together.\n\nNeutrals: If your a Fool you need to be executed by the court, if your Scorned you need one of your targets executed by the court, if your alchemist you need to survive to the end of the game, if your Possessor you need to choose when to jump bodies when needed, and if you are Reaper you need to choose who to chill and who to reap, as some are immune but that can be by passed. If your Mercenary then you need to keep your contracter alive at all cost to win\n\nCult: Your job is similiar to the Unseen, convert, lie, kill and deceive the Blue Dragon and Neutrals, I've not managed to play as a Cult member yet so I cant really give any good tips on it\n\nAll in all for the roles, once you get the game spend some time learning them, use your brain and think of a plan but remember, No plan survives contact with the enemy\n\nIt's a game that is fun and as its still being worked on it can change as time goes on, ultimally you decide who will win this by your actions and words in the game, are you a Deceitful person or are you Truthful? are you a Roleplayer or are you a strickler for rules and game. its your choice but i find a combo is needed, always becareful of who you trust, as sometimes even a \"proven\" ally isnt always your friend or even your ally.\n\nDecide which Faction wins and loses, Will it be the Blue Dragons? the Neutrals? the Cult? or the Unseen? join the community as well as its game and find out which faction you like the most and who will emerge the victory.", "timestamp_created": 1507308209, "timestamp_updated": 1507308209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529289", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35520560": {"recommendationid": "35520560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035952122", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 72, "last_played": 1515759100}, "language": "english", "review": "This has been one week since the release for Throne of Lies,\n\nOnce you start the first round, you won't experience ever the same when deductions, the suspense, the conspiracies, daring murders and accusations become more common. Wait common? No, my friend...It's deeper than you can measure with. \n\nYou arrive on Castle Adiart back either as member of Blue Dragon, Unseen or you are not afflicted with either side...sword for hire, court jester got tired of being belittled by the king, potion maker? What about the rumors of unnatural murderers across the realm...are you one of them?\n\nYou and fourteen other guests have arrived on throne room with the king in his presence until suddenly the castle doors have been sealed away, confused and perhaps afraid what's going on...your survival on the castle begins.\n\nThrone of Lies is medieval fantasy-themed tabletop social deduction game as your goal is to eliminate the opposing faction or playing as neutral you have goal of your own, at day phase you discuss by the round table who is the trusted and traitor as well unsuspected players get affected by day abilities on this phase. During the night phase you decide to make actions such as the investigations, supporting your allies, discussing in secret or murdering the suspect, did you know your fellow healer class is actually now member of Unseen? How did that happen? The 'evil' factions are capable of converting 'good' faction classes, The Blue Dragon. Keep in mind that even few Blue Dragon classes have convert immunity and sometimes, you can earn that immunity when you get resurrected. Do you get roleblocked--I mean occupied too many times as you never get to kill someone? Don't worry! You become immune to occupations after three times in row whether you are killer or not, fewer classes have immunity to occupation as passives at start. During the dead phase, sometimes a Priest will able to talk with the dead as the graveyard is filling with ghosts that belong from the players are dead. You can also bet your gold who dies tonight during day phase and who get executed on trial during night phase. There are a lot of examples what can happen during these days and nights, who need plot twists of the game when this happens unexpecting right at front of your monitor\n\nThrone of Lies offer you gameplay that no match is the old first match you have played before, same players with new names and equipment such as armor and weapons and randomly selected ambience soundtrack give you impression you are still standing by the throne room alive whilst unknown collaborators are plotting with someone's demise, it's in your imagination.\n\nSince one week of the release I have enjoyed the brilliant victories and utter defeats, execellent soundtrack and gameplay play a role to this game, but so do my social deduction and manipulation that can change the tide of the game. The animations of your character hold foundation as you make gestures and open your mouth as you speak as well to react during the execution scenes, each weapon performs different execution styles. You have at night your own class-related bedrooms such as inside the church altar, the dungeon cell, alchemy room, your plate armor display on your room as Knight, magical runes and magical orbs as Psychic and Court Wizard and even throne made of bone and skeleton heads as Reaper and many more!\n\nThis is just the beginning.

You start out as a person (of course) in a faction. Blue Dragons, Unseen, Cult, or Natural. Each faction/class has a goal to complete, once you complete it you will succeed in the game. You can do this by killing other people by your abilities or cast them up for treason, sometimes in specific classes, you have to do something else. You will not know the roles people have or the kinds of roles in the game, this makes it so that you can claim as many roles as you want (as long as it's not contradictory) in the game. Death animations are available and instead of being in one place the entire time you switch places at night depending on your faction and/or role. Graphics on this game is better than most (such as Town of Salem) and has an interesting atmosphere to it making it very realistic in terms of its genre. The best thing about this game is the community, there is a discord channel with very helpful people if you are ever stuck and awesome devs who actually try to make a good game and in the meanwhile are helping and taking suggestions from their fans. Admitting that this only came out a few days ago makes it seem like the game can aspire more with enough dedication and courage.

There's a \"Good\" faction (The Blue Dragons) and a \"Bad\" faction (The Unseen) (As well as a Cult faction but you won't run into them when starting) and the goals your trying to accomplish depend on your factions role. The Blue Dragons are trying to out all the Unseen and vice versa for the Unseen members. The twist is the Unseen know who members of their faction are at all times while the Blue Dragons are forced to figure it out through conversation and investigation. There's also a handful of Neutral roles thrown in to spice it up (some are trying to kill everyone else, some are trying to solely survive for example) There's also the King role, which starts Neutral but can be \"Converted\" onto the Unseen's side (Or the Cult's).\n\nI did say \"Converted\" and that's another key feature of Throne of Lies, The Unseen start with a Mastermind and an Assassian, and the Mastermind can convert almost any role into an \"evil\" version of it, but there's always a limit of 3 members in the Unseen at any time. I use Town of Salem as a natural comparison for this style of game since it was the first Werewolves/Mafia game I got heavily interested in, but ToS requires a much smaller level of deductive reasoning required as it's really easy to whip up a mob mentality. In Throne of Lies, the role list of the game is completely hidden, and the only roles that are always there are King, Prince, (and for games with Unseen) Mastermind, and Assassain. Not knowing what could possibly exist means that there's more room for doubt when it comes to potential for claiming, and you have to be almost certain you know the person you're going to send to trial is guilty or not.\n\nAlthough I haven't \"Played\" much of Throne of Lies at the time of writing this (That joke at the top wasn't just a joke.) I still see the potential this game has to offer for people who enjoy investigative deception style games like this or ToS, and if you've played ToS before you'd feel right at home with it. And although the community for it is small right now (It DID just launch) it's a very committed one who are willing to help new players along at learning the game. Because if you haven't played something like this before, there is a bit of a learning curve, and I have no idea how the Cult roles will play differently to the Unseen when I get a chance to play games with those enabled. My one concern is just the community size is small and it can take a while for games to start (I had a 10 minute queue time for my third game), so it isn't a sort of \"Pick up and play\" Like how ToS would be. But that's something that can be fixed with time and more players (The game supports a Minimum of 8 Players and a Max of 16, which is just the right amount for this type of game). I look forward to jumping back in to more sessions of this with my friends and the loyal group of players this game has already accrued, and I think if you enjoy a good session of Mafia/Werewolves this is your style of game.", "timestamp_created": 1507212300, "timestamp_updated": 1507212300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544954", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35495468": {"recommendationid": "35495468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165215103", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510452740}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game the day after it came out and I\u2019ve not been unsatisfied with it once.

If you have 9 dollars to spare, [b]YOU SHOULD BUY THRONE OF LIES[/b] and stop wasting your time with town of salem. Here is why.\n\n1.[b]Role Complexity[/b]- Every single role has 3-4 different abilities as opposed to town of salem where each role has 1 ability. Why does this matter? Every single player has the capability to win the game on their own with deception and skill. Town of Salem can be so frustrating where you feel powerless as a spy in a game with no whispers, or as lookout with no results. Even the neutral roles contains so many abilities. These extra abilities add much more thinking to the game. You aren't just a survivor who vests 4 times in this game. The alchemist(survivor equivalent of throne of lies) who also just has to survive till the end of the game, has 2 kill potions, 3 vests, and infinite healing capability. You have to really think who should I heal and keep alive? Should I kill the bastard who is accusing me of being unseen? Should I vest(stone-skin potion) since I'm being accused tonight. The point is you have to actually think when you use your ablitites, it isn't just monotonous, clicking one button every night. With this much power, any player can win with skill, you just have to play smart and you will be rewarded. In town of salem, survivors do literally the same thing every game. put 4 vests and pray town won't execute you and mafia won't kill you, lol. The alchemist is just 1 example of an improved role from town of salem. The entire game can be considered an improvement from town of salem which fixes every problem that game had.\n\n2.[b]Shorter Timers[/b]- God bless these devs for implementing shorter timers. In town of Salem, the timers are unbearably long once you learn the game. There is no need for so much time to do 1 generic ability at night or 5 entire minutes to execute a confirmed baddie. When the game drags out and nothing happens, the game feels stale fast, town of salem has had this problem for a while, If you are coming from town of salem, you will really love the shorter timers in throne of lies. The game feels fast-paced.\n\n3. [b]The King[/b] - The King is just another element added to the game that increases the complexity of the game. He can be good, neutral or evil. You really can't tell right away, but he holds a lot of voting and executing power, as well as the ability to guard himself and other players and can even investigate others. There is 1 king in every single game.\nThe evil guys, the neutral players, and the good guys don't know the king's faction. Every single players has to deduce the king's faction through his actions/attitude in the game. The king is a very powerful player who can tip the game to either side if he survives till the end. Killing or keeping him alive makes or breaks the game for your faction. What does this mean? Not only do you have to kill everyone in the opposing faction and do your best to complete your role's objective, you have to keep tabs on the king!\n\n4. [b]No Metagaming[/b] - The most frustrating thing for me in town of salem was being asked to post my role's objective in jail to the jailor. That isn't how the game is intended to be played. I'm not expected to post my role's objective to you. You are expected to find my role with clues and anaylsis, not by worthless metagaming lul. Another example is spychecking spies, adding names in will for disguisor, random voting when blackmailed, the list just goes on and on. Town of Salem is riddled with meta gaming which ruins the game immensely.\nIn Throne of lies, I have not seen any cases of metagaming which ruin the game for me. The game is really well designed and makes it extremely difficult to do so. You will really appreciate that this game is won more so with analysis than ridiculous cheating.\n\n5. [b]Community[/b] - Another huge point for Town of Salem players. Town of Salem is a FREE game. That means any child on the internet can make an account and plague your games. Especially since Town of Salem is a team-reliant game where half the town roles only have 1 ability and they must communicate to get anything done. This make the game UNBEARABLY frustrating and can honestly convert level-headed players to toxic players in no time at all.\nThrone of Lies has a 9 dollar paywall to enter the game. 9 dollars is not much all, but it will block those damned little kids out. The current Throne of Lies community consists of olders players who have played town of salem and epicmafia long ago, or are just trying something new. The players are welcoming and patient. Everyone is learning! Toxicity is limited in this game simply because the game is designed so much better. Better players will win their games single-handedly, they aren't reliant on the team since every player's role has so much power.\n\n6. [b]Devs and Updates[/b] - I've only played for a couple weeks and I've already noticed so many constant large game-changing updates and buxfixes. It is very apparent that the devs are passioniate about making the game the best they can. They put the game at just 9 dollars to give you constant updates and constant accessability. I've also noticed there is no stupidly pointless dlc. All the skins and weapons can be bought with in-game currency which is SO much easier to gain than in Town of Salem. In Town of salem, you have to pay an absurd amount for executions, skins, pets, etc. They are milking players for all they got. Especially when their game has remained static it amazes me that they can still do this. The throne of lies developers could have doubled the price of the game, they could have added pointless dlc, they could have turned this entire game into a cash grab, but they didnt.\n\nWhy did I make this review?

Like everyone else in here, or at least 80%, I've come from ToS. Since ToS has been the only other social deduction game I've ever played, it's going to be my basis for this review.\n\n\nBefore that, here's a disclaimer. \n[i] I am not, if even looks like it, trying to talk badly of ToS [/i]\n\n\nOkay, first off, the [b]GRAPHiCS[/b]:\n>We all can't deny the fact that having 3d characters, right? Well this game doesn't make you stare at a boring screen while you wait for the day to end! (sorry ToS, 3d+screen rotation is far more interesting to look at.)\n\nNext is [b]GAME MECHANICS[/b]:\n>So what differentiates this from ToS is that there is a King; what's fun about this class is that everyone else won't know which you are allied to--people most often assume you are a good/neutral king til close to the end of the match. There are also the skills/abilities that you can use--2 depending on the class and unique on both day an night. Then there's \"conversion\" which is an essential ability for the bad roles to win. \n\nand [b]EXTRAS[/b]:\n>I'll have you know that executions are damn AMAZING. You can customise your character to perform different executions; ranging from normal slashing to raising the guilty into oblivion. I mean, who doesn't want their own exe animation? \n\nLastly, the [b]COMMUNITY[/b]:\n>This is mainly addressing the people in the discord server. I love how the devs are constantly interacting with us while they are making the game better; they are also really approachable--devs, mods, guides, and players alike.(although I didn't converse a lot save for matchmakings and reporting a few bugs)\n\n\n\n[b]----------[/b]\nI was lucky enough to have been able to be part of the beta testers, even though it was only around three weeks or less. During the time I was beta testing til now that it's been released, I'm glad to see that the game improved a lot and still is improving. \n\nI can't say that I'm good at it yet, but this game is definitely a [b]10/10[/b] for me. \n\n\nKudos to the devs and its community~!\n\n[spoiler]What are you waiting for? Go and get it; you won't regret it.[/spoiler]\n\n\n-----\nEdit: I don't understand why most of the good reviews have way too many dislikes; the reviews capture greatly if not exactly what the game offers.

I give it my hearty reccomendatiom.\n\nThe mechanics are designed to allow every class to have many uses and abilities, discussion times are longer allowing much more interplay and scumreading than ToS allows, and most importantly the devs have actually managed to make a game in where conversion is not completely asinine.\n\nThink the Vampires were a bad idea? You're right.\n\nBut here the conversion is woven heavily into the mechanics of the game, it feels natural and actually makes sense. Only one class (The Prince) allows you to truly be confirmed Blue Dragon, all the others can be converted at any time. You can't trust anyone, and that's great.\n\nNot only that, but the abilities that aren't just mutliple ToS roles combined into one are genius. Discover them for youself, you'll be pleasently surprised.\n\nAnd most importantly, the community is completely non-cancer. I'm being honest, the complexity of the game is it's greatest asset, allowing for complex strategy, and it drives off bad players.\n\nPros:\n-Complex roless allow interplay and strategy to rule.\n-Many umnentioned gameplay improvements from other Mafia games allow for a good experience.\n-Keeps aspects from ToS allowing people to get into it. The overall concept is intuitive and easy.\n\nCons:\n-May be too complex for some players\n-The game is still rather new, so you may struggle to get a game depending on your timezone.\n\n*Credits to forum user Sketch for giving me my alpha/beta key.

The game is (similar to The Resistance) very focused on it's mechanics: It has a lot of special abilities flying around and a lot of possibilities to get hard facts (or at least very solid hints) as opposed to almost pure guesswork (as in say Werewolf). This is mainly due to two core mechanics:\n1. If you die you role (and faction) gets revealed to everyone.\n2. You have a journal in which you can take notes. If you die, the journal will be revealed to everyone.\nIf you are one of the investigator classes of the Blue Dragons (the \"good\" faction) for example, your best bet is to write as much information down as you could gather. When you get killed your allies will get all your notes + 100% confirmation that you are not lying (due to the role reveal).\nThe gameplay mechanics itself are pretty solid. There are a lot of interesting abilities and the over 40 roles seem to be balanced quite nicely as well. Unfortunately the plurality of roles and abilities also means that the learning curve is ridiculously steep.\nThe biggest downside to this game however is it's terrible UI. There is only one hotkey in the whole game (for opening the help screen). Windows (like the journal) cannot even be closed with the esc key.\n\nMore Details + Gameplay: https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=MgdMxs2JcQE", "timestamp_created": 1506714690, "timestamp_updated": 1506714690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459916", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35309780": {"recommendationid": "35309780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169513063", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 26426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 576, "last_played": 1516246542}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun and enjoyable game and I would definitly reccommend it to anyone who is interested in the deception jonra.\n\nThere is always something exciting around the corner.

The devs will most likely respond to any bug reports or important questions. The art style is really good, with eahc of the class icons looking like smoothe jammy goodness. \n\nThe game play is nice too, although there is currently only 1 game mode, that game mode is perfected.

Abilities were removed which didn\u2019t work, new classes were added, classes were made more fun. These Devs are already more competent than BlankMediaGames (Town of Salem\u2019s developers)\nOne little thing I feel like I need to point out is that every player gets their own room at night. While this may seem like a little thing, it really improves on my immersion, especially compared to Town of Salem\u2019s night which just makes the screen darker. When you are part of the cult or Unseen, you all meet together around a table, which really helps me feel like I am plotting against the Blue Dragons (The town).\n\nClasses\nThe abilities are a hell of a lot more fun than Town of Salem. One comparison is the Sheriff. Town of Salem allows the player to see if someone is mafia, werewolf or a serial killer. Throne of lie\u2019s version allows you to check if they are Unseen (Throne of Lie\u2019s version of mafia) and allows you to put a scout on the player, telling you if they are converted. If you yourself get converted, you get new abilities. The sheriff, for example, becomes the Marshal who can listen into the Prince (Throne of Lie\u2019s Jailor) at night, giving you potential info, see who the Prince jails, and read other player\u2019s wills at night, turning the sheriff into an information powerhouse. Another example is the Alchemist, who is the Survivor of Throne of Lies, having the only objective to survive. In Town of Salem all the Survivor can do is protect themselves at night 4 times. In Throne of Lies the Alchemist can heal players almost like a doctor would, and kill players themselves, allowing you to choose if you want to act as a protector or killer.\n\nUnseen - Converting\nSo, besides 100x better classes, you have the convert feature. I absolutely HATE being Mafia in Town of Salem. They are just \u201cUse this ability or not\u201d, that\u2019s it. But in Throne of Lies you start off with the Mastermind and Assassin (Godfather and Mafioso). The Mastermind can convert players into the Unseen, giving them new, more evil abilities, like how Vampires work in Town of Salem. This creates a constant distrust between players, which can be taken advantage of by the Unseen.\n\nThe King\nThe king is a player whose role is confirmed to the rest of the court. His faction however, is not. He gets double votes, a final say on executions, an investigative ability and a protective ability. Most of the Blue Dragon (The town) can use negative abilities on him, so the only way for them to kill him is by voting him up, while none of the Unseen will want to kill a potential extra ally until they are certain.\n\nThe Bad\nThe game isn\u2019t perfect. The graphics, especially the people, look bad, the UI is bad and the animations are bad. The game also severely lacks a lot of sounds like message sounds.\n\nOverall I would recommend if you enjoy Town of Salem or Mafia. The major thing which was lacking when this was in beta was the lack of players (which should hopefully be fixed now).", "timestamp_created": 1506703984, "timestamp_updated": 1506703984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529606", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35304567": {"recommendationid": "35304567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141340461", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 356, "last_played": 1515952962}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing.\n\nYes it's like mafia.

I've been monitoring the developer's progress on this for about half a year and here is my conclusion. This is clearly a drunken-rage-induced product based on misleading assumptions and vastly incorrect conclusions about a competitor game, which resulted in both this and snarky dialogue aimed at said competitor game littered with false equivalency and plain, observable incorrectness.\n\nAs for the gameplay, there was some semblance of effort put into this, but you can see that it's not all quite there. For example, the lobbying and chat functionalities are littered with uncaught bugs (what was the point of the one year early access again?).

The development team is obviously fresh but they've put together a decent and cohesive experience. I can only hope the success they've experienced will be funneled into further development. They doubtlessly have a road-map but I feel a single feature should take precedent over all but game breaking bugs. That is to say:  \n  \nThis game is in desperate need of a simple in-game VOIP mic, whereby only a single player can talk at a time for certain moments of gameplay. The biggest mechanical problem with this game lacks before its tabletop counterparts is the humanity of the bluff that makes the mafia/werewolf genre fun. That is to say, the part where you try to figure out if someone is lying! Right now this consists of cut/pasting from the log book while other players determine if this stacks up to what happened throughout the game.

Truly a rollercoaster of emotions with every game I took part in. \n\nOne thing that is awesome with this masterpiece of a betrayal simulator is that you can choose any name you want when entering a game! (Not really though, a lot of words are not accepted) Well, it doesn't really matter since everybody calls themselves by their player numbers, making it even harder to understand some of the nonsense people can say at times, such as \"14 BD Check - NS\" (some of these can even have multiple meanings, such as \"NK\" that can be used both for \"Neutral King\" and \"Neutral Killer\").\n\nBut it's all worth it in the end, because right after you finally start to understand how this game and the roles work by reading the entire manual, playing the tutorial, and then reading countless of outdated meme-filled guides, you will finally be able to enter your very first game, and discover that more often that you might be led to believe, you're most likely going to be dead on the first night, and spend the rest of the game hoping for something to happen, or just quit and look for another game where it'll happen again.\n\nAs for when you're finally going to play without dying from the get-go, you'll quickly find out how awesome (or boring) this game can really be.

The game's asking price of $10 is admittedly high for the casual player, but as of writing this review, I have played 28 hours in 3 days, and feel that it was worth every cent.

I have clocked in many hours since buying the game and I have never regretted this purchase. Here's some of the reasons why.\n\n-Simple to go in, but complex enough to keep playing.\nSure, it is hard for a person to go in, but when you grasped the basics, this game becomes really fun to play. You will never know what will happen, or the person who holds the information. Once people get used to information, as this is a multiplayer game, each match you go into is a differrent experience.\n\n-Great Community! \nWhen I went in, the game was really smooth, even for new players it was really friendly. Sure there are patches along the way but generally everyone is really accomodating towards each other. The people in the Discord also help out a lot!\n\n-Developers that Interact.\nThese developers are something I would really like in other games, as they are ones that are very active and communicate a lot with us players. Most of our suggestions, they do reply and indicate that they are listening, even when they are busy with their work. They have also released their own plans for the game, even if it was \"just a little bit of their plans\", this shows that they have been listening to us. They let us know of what they plan for the game, this I very much appreciate.\n\n-Moderators that do WORK\nThere is a report system to keep the community system clean, and that this report system is very effective. The moderators themselves do manage each report personally and decide on the severity of the situation. However, this is not the reason why I like it. The reason that I like this for is because they do punish for salt/revenge reports. This is something I believe many other multiplayer games should have, These moderators keep the game clean and therefore keep the community nice.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this. It may be a little difficult to get into, I would suggest going to watch videos or streamers before entering into the world of Throne of Lies", "timestamp_created": 1516674190, "timestamp_updated": 1516674190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39541493": {"recommendationid": "39541493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198419614457", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1180, "last_played": 1516738690}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that doesn't need graphical performance, but doesn't go higher than 30 FPS.

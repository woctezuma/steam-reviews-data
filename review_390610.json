Don't wait, put them on. How are they?\"\n\nYou change into the shoes and walk around a bit. \"They fit. They feel great,\" you report. You're not lying.

But the penalty for dying is low; you're simply knocked back to the previous circle.\nAlso, stages have a few \"save points\". These are circles where you cannot die and thus cannot get knocked back further.\n\n+ Varied gameplay\nThe game stays (mostly) fresh with several kinds of enemies and mechanics.\n\n+ Great narrative and characters\nI really liked Dinthel.\n\n+ Circle Affinity: an additional, endless mode where you go as many circles deep as you can on one life.\nThe game provides a few different stages with goals for how deep to get.\n\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n- The menu UI is unclear. The first time I played, I started playing the Circle Affinity mode instead of the original game.\n\n- A little bit too long and repetitive.\nDespite the good variance, the game does still drag, especially in the last worlds. If you edited out  maybe 15%, the overall game would have been better.\n\n- No voice acting! \n\n- Ending is a bit abstract.

Every level starts you on the outside of a circle where you must enter a \"door\" so you can get on the inside layer of the circle before jumping to the next circle, repeating these steps ad finitum until you reach the core. The first step is getting used to the controls (really simple you can only go left or right and jump) and then getting used to never losing your character out of your sight while you are drowned in a barrage of layers. Every level the game keeps introducing new challenges in your way, the circles start moving, new type of enemies and a few diabolical surprises. Trust me you will die a lot, especially if like me you started with the idea of perfecting all the levels (I have now long abandoned such foolish dream)\nThe game demands all of your attention at all times. Each time you make a mistake, you are set back a circle without much of a pause, so if you fail to remain calm you may start chaining mistakes and get sent way way back. You better clean those tears cause there is only one way to the end, it's persevering.\nOnce you manage to reach the third world, oh boy, the game not only will require all of your dexterity and concentration, it will find your determination still lacking and will now demand you grow a third eye if you wish to be worthy of his challenge !\nStill sweating, once you surpass the third world, maybe you'll go back to the first few levels to get some achievements and you'll wonder how could you ever have thought theses introductory levels to be hard in the past !\n\nIt's one the hardest game i've played in my life, one of the few that made me give up numerous times.

Super Hexagon's rotation controls were fine because the game was simple and once you got the hang of them you could reach any level of mastery if you pushed yourself far enough. This game is different because you don't just have to focus on the confusing controls, but also the enemies that are pressuring you to act AND in later levels the wedges also start moving around making it very difficult to focus on everything at the same time. I'm not even halfway through the game and it's becoming increasingly frustrating, it's not a game you can play casually (after the second world). It takes dedication just to complete a level, and hours on top of that to finish it in time to get all the achievements.\n\nThe achievements all feel contrived, they're all formulaic and mundane (finish world X in Y time and repeat for all worlds) not rewarding or intuitive at all.\n\nThe game does have it's good points, the controls are fluid, and the sound effects and music are especially suited to a game like this. Everything feels, looks, and sounds snappy, but that's all undermined by the fake difficulty. I can't even imagine how nightmarish the end-game levels are. It would be okay if they ramped up the difficulty slowly but instead they introduce a new mechanic and then combine them with previous mechanics which makes the game too hard too fast.

In Circa Infinity you venture through layers of circles each offering incremental challenges.  Simply run, jump, and dodge your way through each new challenge as you quickly progress deeper and deeper.  This is very much an arcade style game focusing mostly on high-scores and survival.  As the difficulty ramps up it becomes quite a thrilling experience forcing you to make split second decisions.  Speaking honestly Circa Infinity isn't setting out to reinvent the wheel but it is does manage to spin a new yarn.  Alright, gibberish idioms aside I'll try to make sense of this game.\n\nThe gameplay sits at the very core of this experience.  You sometimes play as a man, women, or both running around these large circles.  Starting outside the circles you have to get in through a gate at which point you then proceed to run around the inside.  Inside is a floating ball that will take you to the outside of the next circle pushing the last circle out to towards the corners of your screen.  Its makes a lot more sense once you see it but for now just imagine Alice falling down the rabbit hole.  Of course this wouldn't be much of a game without obstacles in your path, at which point monsters come into the picture.\n\nThere are a number of beasts trying to block you from completing your objective.  Actually many of them aren't trying to hard as they just sit around crying or hover without moving.  It will be up to you to jump or roll as necessary to progress.  Eventually you'll encounter more menacing threats such as creatures that chase you around or block our path entirely.  Although colliding with a monster only bumps you back one zone this game is so fast-paced that it is easy chain one mistake after another and end up a handful of zones back.  However, once you feel comfortable with a level and can be fun to go back to either improve your time or try to pass the stage with less deaths.\n\nThe minimalist visuals make it much easier to keep track of everything happening on screen at any one time.  You'll only have three or so colors on screen making it easy to distinguish where everything is at any given moment.  This is all super important because it can be very disorienting to keep track of what is your left and right when running around on a round plane.  Thankfully the music is very soothing and will help calm your nerves in what can be quite an intense game.  The sound-effects also fit very nicely and really have a pleasant pop to them.\n\nHow much you'll like this game will really depend on the type of gamer you are.  If you want a challenge and you enjoy pushing yourself to perfection then I believe this will be right up your alley.  Even if thats not really your thing there is a lot to admire about this unique concept and its clever art design.  However, this is a really tough game and after about a hour and half I was feeling like I was ready to move on.  I enjoyed the time I spent playing Circa Infinity but I was starting to hit that ceiling of difficulty where the challenge was becoming less fun and more of a chore.

I am the type of person to refuse to play a game if it is slightly unresponsive or if the controls are not well suited for the game, this game is very responsive and the controls work perfectly for it.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very good and fits the mood of the game. The bosses are also very well designed (that I've seen so far, this game was so good I felt the need to review it just to help it out right away), as are the enemies, both mechanic wise and how their design reflects their mechanics in the game.

It will constantly introduce increasingly difficult enemies that you have to avoid as you progress, as well as throw sections with different types of enemies. Conquering each section will feel deeply satisfying once you figure it out.\nThe bosses are rather creative in how you defeat them, and are even more challenging than the rest of the game.\nThere's also a fun arcade mode where you try to survive an endless gauntlet of enemies, which will give you something to do once you finish the main game.\nThe game is not without flaws, however. The controls certainly have a learning curve to them, and will make playing more difficult than it already is if you don't get used to it.

Usual platforms are straight, or at most some kind of slope. Here it's concentric circles and it's insane.\n\nYou enter a new circle from the bottom. You go to the right. You enter the next circle from the top. You go to the right... No. Your character is going left. Right and left are actually counter-clockwise and clockwise, which creates confusion over and over again when the brain is still used to consider that the button to the right should always move the character in that direction. Also, jump is actually some sort of slide when the character is not yet in the inner circle... Reacting the right way on short notice is really difficult. Difficult but fun, with the cool music and visuals. The first two worlds are a treat.\n\nHowever, the next worlds lost me. Two characters are controlled at the same time, and it's just too hard to follow (suddenly much more a puzzle than a platformer) while not flowing as well as when it was only one character. It's like constantly being tethered to something fragile and annoying.\n\nBut before it came to that point, I really had a good time, and found the level design excellent (there are both series of levels, and an infinite mode). The game teaches you what each enemy does before spicing things up or mixing with other enemies, and it makes sure that you understood by placing them in a smart way several times and making you go back one circle upon death.

A minimalist, puzzle platformer is the last game I would expect to enjoy this immensely amongst a sea of indie titles. I consider the genre to be the equivalent of the FPS of the indie scene: a sort of formulaic attempt to tread ground into the industry, but CI is perhaps the most exhilarating take on a tired template in every aspect of its design. It will consistently challenge your thinking while simultaneously presenting you every tool necessary to complete and appreciate the pieces which meld this wonderful game.\n\nAt its core, CI is commonly described as a circular platformer. In a step far to the left, the game involves no vast worlds, but simply a monochrome series of circles laden with enemies. It begins simply: have your character enter each circle, avoid every monster, and jump inwards to the next circle until you complete the level. Each level is comprised of around 10 circles or so, with every few levels introducing a new mechanic. It remains fairly simplistic through the first of five worlds, bringing in new enemies and covering most of what you'll need to complete the remainder. \n\nCirca Infinity respects your intelligence. If you fail and touch an enemy, the only punishment you receive is that you must return to the previous circle. Rather than simply start the current challenge over, you must re-surmount the former, meaning that consistent missteps can place you back at the start of the level. There are checkpoints in each level every few circles, however, so even as it gets crazier, there are plenty of chains of challenges which are short and allow you to focus on them, as they become quite complex. New worlds bring in major mechanics additions, with the brilliant tutorialisation that never leaves the player confused. I won't go into them, as divulging every mechanic feels akin to spoiling a major plot. Part of CI's joy is discovering how each new world builds off of the rules that you know, and they remain clear, concise, and straightforward. That said, Circa Infinity will force you to think in manners that toss everything you know about games on its head. \n\nSpeaking of plot, the game is entirely devoid of dialogue or narration, and every piece of the story is told through imagery. This is a bold step from the game's early builds, wherein the breakpoints between levels were filled with text explaining the adventure you undertake. I feel the game works far better without it, retaining its minimalist feel and remaining atmospheric in a way that words would only detract from. \n\nAnd nothing lends itself more to the game's atmosphere than the music. God, the music. Easily one of the best game soundtracks I have ever heard, with even the tracks playing between levels reaching unexpected levels of intricacy and power. In a game that feels a lot about going from level to level and jumping between speeding through and thinking out the next series of moves, in only this instance would I recommend taking a break to sit and breathe, as your characters do, and take a listen between stages. The break music from the first world, a track I would normally skip, surprised me as becoming one of my favorite songs in the entire game when I took the time to sit instead of plowing ahead. The music is more than enough of a reward for finishing some of these heinous treks. \n\nIf that package weren't enough, Kenny Sun recently added the game mode: Circle Affinity, which adds a randomized, endless, high-score style romp reminiscent of Super Hexagon. It's not nearly as difficult, but is always fun, and one of the few \u201cget as far as you can\u201d game modes I enjoy. Especially in an age where the sort of play-til-you-drop gameplay has fallen out of favor, CA adds a nice alternative to the pre-designed levels and usual speedrunning romps. Mr. Sun is quite generous in providing for free a game mode which could have easily stood alone for a few bucks. The additions to the soundtrack never hurt either, with some remixes and a few new favorites; I anxiously await its additional release.\n\nOf course, no game is perfect. Circa Infinity is a touch short (which is of course, remedied by CA), and finishing the game felt a tad bittersweet. \nGetting used to knowing which direction you're going in can take some time and will throw you off occasionally, long past the point that you think you've familiarized yourself with it.\nThe color schemes in CA, though there are many to unlock, all seem to have a blending aspect in CA, in where getting past the 25th circle makes it impossible to see where the entry point for the current circle is. Perhaps this was intentional, but it's annoying when you sometimes can't even see your own character in a mode which is designed to be action and timing oriented (remember that CA is a separate mode from the main game).\n\nHowever, all of these gripes are minor. It's a steal at $10, especially, and I'd go ahead and say to buy the soundtrack along with it (available in FLAC 48Khz/24bit for us audioheads, no less!). Due to the lack of coverage the game received, I was hesitant to buy it after discovering it, but bought it, had no regrets, and wished I could give Kenny Sun more of my money. The game deserves it. A perfectly designed experience, fantastic art style and soundtrack, and plenty of reasons to keep playing may very well make Circa Infinity a new favorite for you, as it was for me.",

Also the music is phenomenal.\n\nCirca infinity is a certainly a hard game, but not in any conventional manner. Outside of the bosses (which you can trial and error until you get a pattern you find easier), it doesn't really require reflexes per se, or sustained timing. Hitboxes are extremely forgiving, and you can often wait between close enemies for whatever you have to do next. Enemies move predictably, and you have breathing room to plan out your next few moves, which you then execute over several quick seconds in a sigh of relief before repeating the process. It usually alternates segments like these with miniature maze-like puzzle sections you can do at whatever pace you want. Trying to play most levels like in the trailer would be extremely difficult if not impossibly the first time through. \n\nThe game is hard because it makes you manage and respond to multiple streams of information presented on different parts of the screen. It finds new and creative ways to completely screw up your sense of direction, distance, and everything else. You'll run right into a stationary enemy you meant to run away from, or didn't see at all because you were looking at what your other character was doing. No, the game did not trick you somehow. You're just an idiot because you've never done anything like this before.\n\nCan you pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time? How about the reverse? Change the speed of one without changing the other? Reverse directions without missing a beat? Switch between these in varying sequences? Could you learn to do all that gradually? Then you can play this. Those are the types of skills the game uses and it likes to switch things up suddenly. It's disorientingly different and every new level feels like a brick wall until you figure out the timing and order of what it wants. Then, suddenly, it seems very easy and repeatable.\n\nOk, an example. There's an enemy that runs continously around the circle at exactly the speed you do - enter the circle, hold down the movement key, and you're safe. They stop moving when you're in the air, so you have to be careful not to crash into the next one when you land. Then they intoduce a flying enemy that only moves when you're in the air, also at your speed. They put the in the same section of a level, so you have to jump through the air, but not too far. Then they make these enemies move in opposite directions, so you have to run in one direction, then jump in the other then switch back on landing. Then they reverse both of their directions. And then both of these completely disappear in place of enemies that move regardless of what the player is doing because there are newer and crazier gimmicks that keep getting combined in unexpected ways.\n\nYou'll move in pace with slower enemies while dodging others. You'll control two characters on opposite sides. You'll have one enter the circle before the other, so you have to avoid enemies on the inside and outside (in different places) at the same time. You'll have enemies that only appear when one character is closer. You'll run through orbs that change your characters' colors. You'll deal with enemies that can't hurt you depending on which color you are and gates that can be only opened by the right character of the right color.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of a rhythm game (or a bullet hell?) the way you're trying to process and time different patterns at the same time, and the satisfaction is similar.

Games like this take advantage of a potential in video games that is all-too-rarely utilized, and this alone makes it worth the download. While the last couple acts might have benefited from more development time to flesh out their original ideas, and the final boss is a bit of a letdown (WAY too easy!), the game more than makes up for it in the shear creativity of its design concepts (also note: the game's other 4 bosses are fantastic!).\n\nThis game borrows play elements from the supurb Ikaruga, and like that game it wears its Eastern influences on its sleeve. But whereas Ikaruga settled for a final boss battle with the Taijitu, the Chinese symbol that depicts the fundamantal polarity of all things in the universe, developer Kenny Sun uses this illustrated metaphor as the backdrop for his entire game. One could look at Circa Infinity as a form of mental gymnastics on the very principles of yang vs. yin, as the game forces you to process an increasing litany of opposing gameplay elements simultaneously (left vs. right, move vs. stop, jump vs. crouch, and of course, Ikaruga's color-matching black vs. white mechanics). At its core, this game is a run-and-dodge platformer in the style of the original Donkey Kong (substitute ambulating devils in the place of rolling barrels); these elements bring a fresh take to this tried-and-true genre. It all can become extremely challenging, at times even seeming to be borderline unfair. It is only when you replay earlier levels and find out how eminently do-able they are do you recognize how sound and skill-based the gameplay truly is.\n\nIn an interesting twist, Sun fuses his Eastern philosophical inspirations with Western religious iconography depicting Hell. To do this, he borrows heavily from the first act of the Divine Comedy (Dante's Inferno), complete with a tearful Satan at the center of a not-quite infinite fractal of mesmorizing concentric circles. The exit-less purgatory, with each door leading into the same room, tonally evokes Jean-Paul Sartre's famous play. The biblically unattired male and female protagonists, always just beyond an arm's reach yet doomed to chase one another for eternity, might well be Adam and Eve. In keeping with the theme of root contrast, the gender difference is depicted by the presence (or absence) of a vertically-oriented pair of cleverly placed (or omitted) pixels where the second Chakra might be. \n\nIn utilizing spiritual symbolism from both hemispheres in a single artistic expression, one gets the sense that Kenny Sun is making a positive statement on globalism. Perhaps he is suggesting that the Devil may have a place on the Dharma Wheel alongside the metaphysically innocent. Or perhaps not! All that really matters is whether or not the game is fun, and whether you feel happy with the money and time you have invested in it when it's over. For $9.99 and 10 hours or so of gameplay (more than double if you add in the remarkably fun speedruns and challenges), I'd say it's both worth it and worthwhile. I look forward to future games from this very promising indie developer, and I hope this game garners enough support to keep him at it.\n\nOne final note: Adam and Eve are simultaneously controlled by the same commands, and in the game's third act, they also interact with the game environment and enemies in the same way. Which character becomes the subject of your default control focus vs. who you let lag behind may say something implicit about your attitude towards gender roles and how you identify with gender yourself. (It would be awesome if the game statistically tracked which character you tend to enter the circles first with!)", "timestamp_created": 1446869814, "timestamp_updated": 1446955093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480866", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18751846": {"recommendationid": "18751846", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990036156", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 208, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452657762}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well made twitch/speedrun platformer with the unique element of being circular and going into circles within circles to progress through the levels.

Trapped in a circular world you have to run in circles to get your character(s) to the end of each (sub)level. Easy enough eh? No, not really. There are tons of monsters in each stage trying to prevent you from getting to the end. Even tho you only need 3 buttons to play this game, it seems to get rather difficult later on. To be honest I am only at Part II of V?! (not sure bout that!). I already screamed at the screen several times but always combined with a good laugh. Aint that frustrating, as you can't really die. The game just sets you back to the last subcircle if you fail to complete a circle without getting hit or w/e. I really dig the artstyle/gameplay mechanic & not to forget the amazing soundtrack. I sure see myself coming back to the world of circles again and again, just to get past them all without dying (haha, as if!)\n\nControls are smooth, just as expected with a controller. Can't say anything bout keyboard controls tho.\n\nAll in all I really enjoy this game so far. Glad I gave it a go, even without playing the demo+the trailer just confused the hell out of me.

Circa Infinity is not one of these platformers.\n\nIn Circa Infinity you control character(s) that are stuck in a circular world. Your objective is to reach the center ring of each level. Unlike other platformers you must use the circular world to your advantage in order to figure out how to progress to the next ring. You will encounter enemies that you will try to avoid. If you hit an enemy you will be sent back to the previous ring and will have to complete that ring again.\n\nI would probably classify Circa Infinity as more of a puzzle platformer than just a platformer. In the later levels you really need to plan out what you are going to do or you will fail. These levels require that you approach them in a certain way or you won't be able to complete them. \n\nI would classify the first three worlds of the game as moderately difficult with the last two worlds being hard. Currently I am still completing levels in the last world. The challenge in Circa Infinity comes from how many things you need to keep track of at any time. In the later levels you will be keeping tracking of two characters as well as many enemies which you have to remember to avoid. At times this can be overwhelming which leads to the difficulty. \n\nI have had a lot of fun with Circa Infinity but I know that the game will not be for everyone. I could see the game making people with motion sickness dizzy. Also if you have trouble keeping track of a bunch of things at the same time you may have some trouble with the game.\n\nOverall Circa Infinity is a very good puzzle platformer that succeeds in doing something new with the genre.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Circa Infinity.

The black and white that becomes more colorful the more you play, the circles that keep on rolling, everything makes you feel like you are on acid. While they do look good, there is nothing too spectacular to them.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nThe game is pretty straight-forward: you must jump to enter a circle, and jump again to enter another floating circle. Then you repeat, and repeat, and repeat until you get to the final one and you beat the level. While this might sound repetitive, the more you advance into the game, the more varied the levels get: new enemies, different patterns and the constant fear of getting hit make this a gripping game that will keep you hooked for quiet some time.\n\n[h1]CHALLENGE[/h1]\nAs mentioned, the game is pretty challenging, and the further you get into the game, the more it gets harder, and harder, to the point of being borderline frustrating. However, there are some safe areas in the level that are basically checkpoints in which enemies can't reach you, so you hardly ever need to restart a level from the first circle.\n\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\nThat soundtrack... Damn, if it is good. Even though it lacks in sound effects, the music is fantastic and exciting, giving a different rythm to each level and losing yourself in the acid trip that you are taking.\n\n[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]\nMultiple achievements and challenges are the only thing that will make you want to complete this game. Otherwise, once you finished a level you will not want to come back to it, especially if it was though as nails.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy platformers and games that closely resemble a drug-induced dream, this game is for you.

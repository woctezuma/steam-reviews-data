I have barely played an hour, and already I feel like this deserves my warmest recommendation. I am *not* really into FPS games, normally - especially not competetive multiplayer ones like CS:GO, the BF-titles etc. Perhaps that is exactly why this game spoke to me. It plays more like Hotline Miami than any CoD-game, and the sparse gallery of gameplay-elements are very inventive and fits perfectly into the tone and pace.\n\nThis is a game of practicing the same sequence of dodges and shots, until you get it right - much like in fast-paced platform games. It is the kind of game that encourages you to rush through, practice your routines, and - when you eventually get it right - awards you with a nice sense of acomplishemtn. Some of the elements are outright brilliant. ...such as the bombs, that are tossed at you like agressive clay pigeons, and have to be shot down before they touch the ground - those add a great deal of momentum to your play.\n\nBe aware that the game is not for everyone. I suspect that more traditional FPS-fans would dislike it, due to some glaring genre-convension-defying issues. While I loved every second of Lovely Planet, it also felt like it was trying to be different, just for the sake of being different. I do not agree with the decition not to have a crosshair. I felt that the scoreboards and speed-run-aspect were unneccecary, and I would have gladly changed them for a bit more visual polish. The game achieves a lot with its simple art style, but at times it comes across as a bit too lazy.. Seeing as nothing has textures, distances become harder to judge, and this hurts the game in places where it also chooses to use a lot of round shapes of varying sizes, and where it chooses to shrink things instead of having a death-animation ...which is literally in every other scene.\n\nThat being said, the level design is pretty great, the game is clean and self-exlainatory, and the pacing of things is splendid - so I can certainly learn to live with its faults.

hard as fuck. Like harder than than the tinman's dick. And you will fail at every level at least 20 times before you get it right. And you'll scream and you'll cuss at it and you'll hate it. But once you finally nail that apple out in the distant fog you never thought you could nail and you get to that textureless, magenta pole at the end and you see your abysmal time compared to the superhumans who ranked in the top 13 or so in the leaderboards, it'll all be worth it. If you can beat this game, you are a god among men. It's strange, the menu is terrible, the graphics get sickening to look at, but it will turn you into something of a machine. Or rather, it will synchronize with some machine part of you that you did not know was there. See, It gives you no crosshair. You get an intuitive sense of where you're going to shoot and you get an intuitive sense of where the bullets will eventually land. Not unheard of in other FPS games, but you can almost predict every frame before it happens. You will develop such an integration with the mechanics of this game that you can sense with one slightly off tap of the spacebar if you've just ruined your shot at beating the level. You can feel the purple blocks which track you encroaching. You can feel if you've got no time to shoot them before they inevitably whack you, and send you right back. You get a twinge of nausea when you heard the apple drop. Don't buy this game if you're looking for a casual shooter. It has a cozy appearance but I believe in some way it has physically altered my brain. I see it in my head when as I try to sleep. Instead of those strange short dreams of slipping right before you go to sleep -- you know the ones you get where you're just about to doze off but you picture yourself slipping and feel that pang of adrenaline and your eyes open and you lay awake with your eyes open, half asleep, half heart pounding? -- instead of those, I see purple blocks slowly encroaching, with just too little time to quickly aim and shoot.

A Review by [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/29892929]The Casually Addicted Gamer[/url]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nLovely Planet is made with low-poly models, which enables high frame rates and fluent gameplay on older computers. The goal is to run against a pole at the other side of the level. On your way, you got to shoot red enemies which will start firing at you once they see you, avoid red balls and mind the gap when jumping onto other platforms. The difficulty with shooting is that at some point you will be challenged by falling objects, which need to be shot before reaching the ground, and by enemies standing behing every corner or between some hostages, which must not be shot, all at the same time,\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nW/A/S/D keys are used by default to walk, and the Space key for jumping, both at a blazingly fast speed. R is being used to restart a level. Lovely Planet does not show any crosshair, but this is totally fine as aiming is not a priority in this game. The Menu seems to be only partly in English, but once a level is loaded, you can quickly switch through the available levels using the Tab key.\n\n[h1]Atmosphere and Appearance[/h1]\nBy being decorated everywhere with hearts and providing music focused on improving concentration, this game appears cute and happy enough to be frustration-free.\nAs each level provides Highscore lists, you can compare yourself to others by the time you needed to complete the level. You'll just have to ignore the ridiculous entries by people claiming to have completed a level in 0.01 seconds or even in -9999 seconds.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nLovely planet is one of the cutest shooters in Steam and runs on every potato computer. For a fair price of $5.99. It can be played casually but definitely got the potential to make you play it for much longer than planned.\n[b]Remember:[/b]There's no such thing as a multiplayer mode.", "timestamp_created": 1502498252, "timestamp_updated": 1502498468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597420", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34165991": {"recommendationid": "34165991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075367566", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502448758}, "language": "english", "review": "minimalist style game + great soundtrack", "timestamp_created": 1502449146, "timestamp_updated": 1502449146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34120215": {"recommendationid": "34120215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002060237", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502534851}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr herrausfordernder FPS in sehr bunter Welt mit lustiger Musik...", "timestamp_created": 1502266272, "timestamp_updated": 1502266272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34115408": {"recommendationid": "34115408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090787861", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503429439}, "language": "english", "review": "so simple but yet so fun", "timestamp_created": 1502240728, "timestamp_updated": 1502240728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515009", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34094557": {"recommendationid": "34094557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086559127", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512344963}, "language": "english", "review": "If you don't like this game, you probably kill puppies as your pastime.\n\nJUST SAYIN'", "timestamp_created": 1502162101, "timestamp_updated": 1502162101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34073128": {"recommendationid": "34073128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066180356", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511757077}, "language": "english", "review": "I doubt you've played anything like this before.

While, like most games, this game starts out pretty easy, you'll eventually be jumping from platform to platform while shooting down baddies at the same time. Some levels may take you many tries, but I found it impossible to get mad at a game like this with super tight controls for a 3D platformer, a responsive, \"fires as fast as you can pull the trigger\" semi-automatic... gun... thing... simplistic but nice looking levels, and fast-paced action, all with a super upbeat and energizing soundtrack as the cherry on top.\nEven if it's just 5 worlds, it's a blast to playthrough, and it's even more fun going back to levels you've completed to beat your previous times and find secrets.

In genere \u00e8 il contrario, anche con giochi molto moderni ed AAA, ma qui non c'\u00e8 solo la semplicit\u00e0 della grafica, c'\u00e8 anche la quasi totale assenza di animazioni ed eye-candy, senza parlare di una certa legnosit\u00e0 del controllo del nostro personaggio, sia durante lo spostamento, che durante il fuoco che durante i salti. Il tutto mostra l'anima super indie di questo gioco, ma anche uno scarso impegno da parte dello sviluppatore.\n\nIl gioco in s\u00e9 \u00e8 uno sparatutto a livelli, 10 (se non sbaglio) per ogni mondo, in cui lo scopo \u00e8 quello di arrivare alla fine senza morire. Mi sembra che si debbano anche uccidere tutti i nemici altrimenti il livello successivo non si sblocca, ma ci ho giocato talmente poco che non ricordo.\nIl tutto \u00e8 portato all'estremo molto velocemente, ed infatti questo gioco \u00e8 stato fatto principalmente per chi vuole un gioco \u201cda classifica\u201d. Pensate ad un Super Meat Boy in 3D, dove la precisione e la velocit\u00e0 di completamento di ogni livello vi dar\u00e0 un punteggio pi\u00f9 alto, ed alla fine vi sar\u00e0 mostrata una classifica dove vedere la vostra posizione. Questa funzione utilizza Steam, quindi avrete la possibilit\u00e0 di filtrare per amici, globale o vicino a voi, ma significa anche che chiunque pu\u00f2 barare e nessuno gli toglier\u00e0 mai il punteggio dalla classifica.\n\nAppena ho notato che il gioco andava verso questa direzione ho deciso di andare a leggere alcune recensioni negative, per sapere se mi stavo sbagliando, ma ho trovato una situazione ancora peggiore. In effetti non solo il gioco diventa molto difficile, ma difficile in un modo stupido e che io non condivido, e cio\u00e8 talmente complesso che dovrete imparare i livelli a memoria solo per non morire, mentre fino al mondo 3 vi serviva di impararli solo se volevate fare punteggi alti.\nC'\u00e8 una cosa in particolare che tutti hanno odiato, e cio\u00e8 la \u201cmela che cade\u201d: a partire gi\u00e0 dal primo mondo, ad un certo punto del livello ci sar\u00e0 questa specie di mela che cadr\u00e0 verso di voi e dovrete colpirla (il vostro attacco \u00e8 una lenta freccia che rende il tutto ancora pi\u00f9 difficile) prima che tocchi il suolo, pena la morte immediata (il vostro personaggio ha solo una vita e nessuna energia, morirete al primo colpo).

You're timed and accuracy counts. I don't know the correct terms but its comparable to a rythm runner but as a first-person shooter. Or something. Its fun! Fairly minimalist, the game runs smooth and gets the most important thing right; input. There's nothing clunky about the controls, no input lag, no jerks, nothing. Just smooth and satisfying gameplay. While simple in concept the enemies/targets do get progressively harder to time and more difficult to hit. There's a heavy emphasis on speedrunning and perfection which I was personally never going to go after but may be the main appeal for many. I figured I could find enough fun in just plain beating the levels without perfection or record times. But I'm about halfway through World 4 (of 5) and I've hit the limits of my patience. The last level I beat took easily 50, if not 100, attempts. Which doesn't seem like a lot when you consider a level length is usually under 15 seconds. But the reverse of that means your 50 deaths are piling up every 5 seconds. It wears you down. It is satisfying to finally conquer a level though! The game is fair and when you get it right its because you darn well got it right. Luck isn't involved and I think that's important in a fair game of this ilk. Still, I got maybe a few more tries left in me but I just don't have that so-called \"quick twitch shooter\" capability in me to make it a feasible prospect to finish with my few shreds of remaining sanity intact. While I won't be likely to complete the game I certainly had fun getting to where I have. And, though against my normal personal review requirements, feel I got enough of what I wanted from the game to form an opinion worth sharing. \n\nI got it in a bundle which was perfect. Its worth the price:time to check out bundled for sure. And to the speedrunning and quick twitch first-person shooter inclined player? It just may be classic stuff worth much more. I had some fun even without the perfect runs, speedrunning, or admittedly even finishing it.

Basically some guy set me 25 games and in return I sent him the cards you get from the games. Out of the 25 games he sent me, this is the only one I didn't uninstall. The game is simple, yet entertaining. A unique parkour game has you jumping on platforms and quickly shooting things from a distance to maintain your character alive. There are some levels that require you to shoot at enemies shooting at you, other levels have you shooting the platforms you are jumping from, trying to shoot the hazards without hitting the platform itself and falling, and my favorite kind of levels have you shooting at shells being shot out of a mortar before they hit the ground and expload, sometimes 3 or 4 on the screen at once requiring quick thinking.\n\nPros\n-Quick, easy to get in and out of\n-Challanging enough but not extremely difficult\n-If a level is too hard for you, there is an option to move to the next one and come back later\n-If the game is too easy, you can skip to the later levels right from the start, (There is no linear flow of levels)\n-Nice graphics are very easy on the eyes\n-Some cleverly hidden secrets that are fun too look for\n-Responsive controls, the game plays like any fps game, but you have a bow and arrow instead of a gun, and looking around feels more graceful\n\nCons\n-No music (But that's not too big of a deal)\n-No limit to how many times you can shoot. This is a con because it makes the game too easy at some times. It would have been nice if there was a difficulty that limited the shots per level, but its not that big of a deal.

It never feels unfair, though some parts may feel like they are beyond your skill level. However with enough practice you can always get past them, and the early levels that seemed too hard at first are a breeze after completing later worlds.\nThere's lots of replayability, there are many secrets to be found in each world if you look hard enough. Also, you can 3-star every level by beating it within a time limit and with 100% accuracy.\nThe bright atmosphere and bubbly music make it genuinely pleasant to play, even when you get frustrated.\nOverall Lovely Planet is just way too fun to pass up. Try the demo and see if you like the reflex-based gameplay style, just keep in mind that it gets 1000x harder than those first few levels.

Getting used to the keyboard/mouse controls having some FPS background in consoles but none in PC was difficult but managable.  This says a lot about the difficulty and how brilliant it is.\n\nThis game has no forced tutorial but theres really only 4 things you have to know: move, aim, jump, shoot.\n\nUp until a level in area 2 (Village), you start to realize that the game becomes trial and error.  The game allows you to look ahead into the level to plan out a strategy but specifically area 4 makes this feature useless because of bullets suddenly appearing out of the fog.  So while you can plan out a strategy for the enemies ahead, you can't forsee the sudden bullets.\n\nThe controls, graphics, music, sound effects are all standard.  Nothing special, but the game is consistent in maintaing its cute theme.\n\nI don't want to give the game a thumbs up or a thumbs down.  The reason being is because there's only a few select I would recommend this game to.  If you like FPS games and difficult games, you may find this game enjoyable.  If not you probably won't like this game because it doesn't have much to offer other than the game itself and online leaderboards.  And so once you reach your skill cap and have not completed the game yet, it begins getting frustrating.\n\nAchievement hunters:  I 100% this game in 18h (including idle time) and used a guide.

Kudos to the music guy Calum Bowen.\n\nThe game itself... isn't all that great.\n\nThe graphics need some more baking, even for a budget Katamari Damacy / Nobi Nobi tribute.\nThere are some lazy-looking particle effects and there are great differences in the level of graphic detail during gameplay (the tiny purple stars and Japanese phrases vs. the huge featureless terrain), which gives the game a heterogeneous look (in a bad way).\n\nThere are hours of content, but the level design is haphazard and at times unintuitive. I would have rather had a shorter game with levels that had more care put into them.\n\nAlso, for those looking for a competitive game, I hope hacked leaderboards don't stop you from enjoying a game (at the time of writing, this game has them). Being about shooting while moving, it's also sorely missing a crosshair, which should have at least been included as an option.\n\nIf you choose to play it, here's two pieces of advice:\n1. Turn the SFX off. The SFX consist of lazy, tacky sounds that don't do the music any justice. You lose the tell for the apples being tossed, but it's still worth the awesome (uninterrupted) music.\n2. If you find the shooting enemies annoying, know that you can kill them by hitting any of their bullets (bug or feature?).\n\nOverall, I still think it's a decent game, just not for $6.

If you have a group of friends who love to be competitive, you could have a semi-multiplayer experience, with that one guy getting like 2 seconds ahead of everyone else's times and nobody knowing how.\n\nThe idea of the game is to shoot the red box people, which the game refers to as 'baddies'. Once all of them have been defeated, you need to walk into a purple pole to submit your time. The major point of this game for me is how although there is a set out route for general play, there are many shortcuts that you can find. Some are massive whereas some may only shave 0.5 seconds. It's a gold mine for competitive players who want to best their friends. The only rules in this game are that you start at [i]x[/i] and you need to reach [i]y[/i] having defeated the baddies.\n\nFor not even \u00a35, this game is worth it. It took me approximately 10 hours or so to 100% the game, but with leaderboards, if you're serious enough to try topping them you could spend much more time than me on it. I don't know how people who class themselves as 'casual' fps players would handle this game, as World 4 and 5 get pretty intense and can also get quite frustrating.\n\nThe game has a 3 Star rating system. The three stars are Blue, Green and Yellow/Gold which are obtained through:\nBlue - Shooting all the baddies and completing the level.\nGreen - Clearing the level quickly.\nYellow/Gold - And achieving 100% accuracy.\n\nAlthough you can achieve all 3 stars in one run, you [b]don't[/b] need to in order to 100% the level. You can run through it with bad accuracy in order to get a good time for green, then run it again much slower to achieve the yellow/gold star for accuracy.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, when you get a time on the leaderboard and you didn't get all the stars, next to your name you will have a square. However if you get all the stars, your square will be a star shape instead, showing everyone who sees you on the leaderboard as having achieved 100% accuracy along with your good time.\n\nEven if you were casually picking up this game, it's a good way to improve at many things you would need to improve at other FPS.\n\nIf I had one [b]complaint[/b], it's about how if you walk too close to an edge, instead of walking off it, you walk down it, causing yourself to screw up a jump and potentially end a nice time.", "timestamp_created": 1468937155, "timestamp_updated": 1468937155, "voted_up": true,

Indeed, as a homage to the Japanese director\u2019s work it is reverential to the point of plagiarism, complete with his trademark pastel colours, a nefariously catchy soundtrack and a font lifted straight from Noby Noby Boy. As it turns out, this initial ruse is just the first of the many traps and pranks that developer Quicktequila has gleefully threaded throughout Lovely Planet, constituting a debut effort that loves nothing more than to make a complete fool of the player time and time again. Be it a slyly hidden enemy or that moment when, mid jump, a fatal patch of goo conveniently slips right under your feet moments before you touch the ground, one thing\u2019s for sure: Lovely Planet doesn\u2019t let you get comfy.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the game\u2019s particularly complicated. On the contrary, Lovely Planet is about as rudimentary a first person shooter as you\u2019re likely to find in 2014, its blocky geometry and utter dismissal of narrative ambitions rounding off what is essentially a back to basics re-evaluation of the genre. Restricting the player\u2019s abilities to running, jumping and shooting, the game thrusts the mechanical core of first-person shooters to the centre of the agenda, cutting straight to the pavlovian delight of squeezing a digital trigger and amplifying it through increasingly frantic and difficult challenges. Unlike most modern video games which introduce perks, upgrades and additional abilities as the game unfolds, Lovely Planet equips the player with all the tools they\u2019ll need at the get go, consecrating the player\u2019s raw skill as the sole means and measure of their progress. As such, there\u2019s no back doors when it comes to the more challenging levels \u2013 it\u2019s a case of get good or give up. This axiom holds true not just across the game\u2019s hundred or so stages but also at the level of individual enemy encounters. Players scarcely have more than a few milliseconds in which to eliminate targets and in later sections of the game, each of these small victories is swiftly interrupted by another incoming missile or deviously placed obstacle. Such hostility affords very little room for improvisation, fostering a highly prescriptive style of play in which just one correct approach to each level seems possible: some levels might as well include a driving line of the likes seen in Forza or Gran Turismo given the dearth of wiggle room available. Thus, Lovely Planet often plays like a puzzle game, the player fumbling towards each level\u2019s \u201csolution\u201d \u2013 jump there, shoot that enemy first, then dodge that bullet, etc \u2013 through trial and error.\n\nIt is in this sense that this cutesy, ostensibly kid-friendly shooter is actually a close relative of Dark Souls, both games offering experiences characterised by copious rehearsal and meticulous execution, not to mention crippling difficulty. But where the layers of complexity in Dark Souls afford the player a certain amount of agency \u2013 be it through the choice of weapons, experience point allocation or class selection \u2013 Lovely Planet is significantly more restrictive. In some ways this works to the game\u2019s advantage: with just one variable to consider, it\u2019s always clear to the player that their own physical ability is the only barrier to success, making for a more accessible experience than navigating the many esoteric and ambiguous systems which notoriously turn newcomers off Dark Souls. By the same token, however, Lovely Planet is also a less mentally stimulating affair. From Software\u2019s game teaches the virtues of patience and critical play, prompting players to continually question and re-evaluate their approach in response to the situation at hand, cautiously attending to a multitude of competing factors. They become unstuck not through brute force repetition but by examining every angle of the problem until something clicks, reaching a bespoke solution all their own. In Lovely Planet however, there is little mystery about how a level should be beaten, with enemies often approaching you head on or placed helpfully within your immediate line of sight. Thus, the player\u2019s only option then is to run through the level over and over, until finally they perform each step of the developer\u2019s dance with absolute precision. As with real life choreography, the end product is often breathtaking, and with enough practice the player can find themselves pirouetting through levels, dispatching foes with delicate touch of a virtuoso. But such flawless runs are possible only after long sessions of arduous repetition, and at the point when the player\u2019s interaction with the game has become entirely automated. Simply put: where Dark Souls is a mindful experience, Lovely Planet is often a mindless one.\n\nAs difficult and repetitious as Lovely Planet gets however, rarely is it frustrating. It\u2019s hard to hold a grudge against a game so whimsical,\nespecially when it delivers even the most nefarious of its tricks with such stone-faced innocence. Indeed, it\u2019s the wealth of charm exuded throughout Lovely Planet in tandem with its highly simplified mechanics that solidify it as a thoroughly accessible introduction to the \u201cmasocore\u201d genre, capturing the cathartic rush of accomplishment that draws players to such punishing games while avoiding the usual dark imagery and reams of potentially overwhelming minutiae. Indeed, it\u2019s dichotomies like this that define Lovely Planet \u2013 the balance of frustration and satisfaction, the interplay of skill and memory, the cuddly visuals disguising hardcore difficulty \u2013 and hence amount to an inevitably polarising experience. While the ecstatic hit of finishing a particularly tricky level is certainly satisfying, whether such fleeting contentment is worth all the preceding effort will vary from player to player, as will the entertainment value of a experience which relies so much upon repetition. Still, players will undergo a very palpable sense of growth, able to pull of feats of skill seemingly impossible when just starting out. Whether or not this transformation carries any meaning outside of the game itself is debatable, but more important is the feeling it evokes, coating Lovely Planet with a sugary sweet sprinkling of gratification that some will find hard to resist.", "timestamp_created": 1468749168, "timestamp_updated": 1468749168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24368821": {"recommendationid": "24368821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151071147", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468747830}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f18\u70b9\uff1a\n1.\u6e38\u620f\u7b80\u5355\n2.\u753b\u9762\u7b80\u5355\n3.\u602a\u7269\u7b80\u5355\n\n\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1a\n\u6b67\u89c6\u624b\u6b8b\u515a\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1468747934, "timestamp_updated": 1468747934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24368194": {"recommendationid": "24368194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198223306500", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474634141}, "language": "english", "review": "11/9 BEST COD IN HYSTORY!!!", "timestamp_created": 1468744626, "timestamp_updated": 1468744626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24366724": {"recommendationid": "24366724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139218493", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510882310}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es la onda este juego!

with \"difficult and frustrating on so many levels\" you get Lovely Planet. Lovely Planet is a non-traditional take on a first-person shooter. It takes place in bright and colourful environments with a fantastic soundtrack. This game feels so good. The jumping, the shooting, just plays so smooth. This game is a million times better with a controller. This is an EXTREMELY hard game and I ended up breaking an Xbox Controller, but in the end, I grabbed another controller and came back for more. It might just be me but I ended up spending 40 MINUTES!!! on one level. This game is just so addictive. I mean, when I first went to play this game, I thought I had some serious issues, but I played it anyway (being the daring guy I am) and....well.....2 and a half hours in and I ended up taking my laptop IN THE CAR with me when I was going on a short car trip. I played this game. I punched everything. I hid myself in my bedroom for 3 days. I didn't wanna speak to anyone.

The levels are colorful and low poly as well as the enemies and obstacles. I think the game's huge downfall is the awkward aiming and lack of even a crosshair that could be helpful when obtaining rewards for completing a level perfectly. Also, on a few levels I didn't understand why I constantly was losing as dying or failing a level restarts the level immediately without delay or explaination. Regardless, I found myself replaying levels over and over to attempt to get a perfect score while getting terribly frusterated doing it. The game's music is very upbeat and enjoyable to listen to, perhaps to cheer you up after dying for the gazillionth time to some stray purple cube flying at you. Overall, I had a lovely time playing [i]Lovely Planet[/i] but I really feel a crosshair would improve the game immensely. I've noticed quite a few people put a sticky note on their monitor to fix this as well. I'd rather the sticky note be included in the game though others have said they enjoy the extra challenge.

If I got a baseball bat shot up my ass with a naval cannon ten times a day for the rest of my life and even to my corpse long after I am dead, that would be preferable to ever playing this again. The only reason I have any time in it is because I played a few levels while my 11yr old niece was over and we were crying laughing at how god damn dumb this is.\n\nI am proud to have 99% downvotes on this review because anyone who likes this will forever live in the absence of the knowledge of what the touch of a woman feels like.\n\nEDIT: I am adding game details at the request of another user lol so be mad at him not me. Be mad at steam for obviously having no quality control anymore. The paper cutout style graphics are neat there is nothing wrong with them other than such little thought seemingly went into the design of this game that it seems like the graphics were done in about a days time. However the art style would be okay but it is not because this game is more gay than a gay pride parade float designed to look like two guys making out on top of a rainbow. The weapon is a crap crossbow that you shoot love into the enemies, not death. I am all for people being happy. Go get married be gay be happy, but this game is the equivalent of two guys coming to my house and showing me what they do in their spare time. Keep it private and I am fine with it. This is a super fast shooter where the point is to clear each stage and be the top on the leader boards worldwide. If I had actually accidentally gotten onto the top ten display for any of the levels I would pay to have my name removed. The enemies suck, the weapons suck, the levels suck, all because it looks like a game for the gayest of the gay, or for a two year old. There really is nothing more here to say as far as the game goes, just a really dumb waste of time game that couldn't be fun even in hell.\n\nLook closely at most games and you will see that just because a game has mostly positive user reviews does not mean that it is actually a good game. This is true for a lot of games now that have mostly good user reviews. This isn't even funny-bad, it is just homeless guy laying in his own p-ss in the gutter sad. And gay. Big time.\n\n9/10.

The atmosphere and graphics and BY GEORGE THE MUSIC is all oh so beautiful!... However... as pleasant as it was in the beginning, it became incredibly difficult FAST in the later half, so much so that I would say it was unfair (The Swamp was complete horses***).  It's possible that I was just not good, but I found aiming to be very difficult, timing to be unforgiving, and experiencing rage inducing moments that I honestly have never experienced in a game before (Check out episode 8, it was the worst...).  My patience was seriously wearing thin since I wanted and had to move on to new material, but if I did not feel so rushed it is possible I could have a much better time with this game, so therefore, I will sit in the middle with this game.  If you really, and I emphasize REALLY, want a challenge and get a kick out of cute visuals and incredible music, then for its price I would definitely pick this up!...

A guy who takes a  interest in a funny Japanese looking game called lovely planet. Apparently the game is not at all as it seems. \n\nIt starts out with some light run and gun shooting over some fluffy music and animation. But at world 2 (close to world 3) the game starts to show it's True colors. The game is hard, very hard and not in the good way. I'm no stranger to frustrating games but this One Just seems unfair.  The point of hard games is to overcome the difficulty and feel like you have achieved something. But lovely planet becomes annoying. My main reasons for this are the bombs and the lack of crosshairs. \n\nTrying not to go into to much detail, bombs are flying fruit that end the level if you don't shoot them before they touch the ground. A lot of the time the game will throw bombs at you out of nowhere and flustered you aim and shoot them. Although alot of the time you will miss. Not due to your lack of skill but because you had no idea where to aim\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is the game kills you in one hit and the difficulty because frustrating due to the lack of crosshair and One hit kill mechanics.\nTl:dr if you are into hard games maybe give it a try but if you are looking for something light don't try this game", "timestamp_created": 1462293431, "timestamp_updated": 1462293824, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478407", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22769122": {"recommendationid": "22769122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164519755", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497624660}, "language": "english", "review": "never play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1462228087, "timestamp_updated": 1462228087, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.414244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22768312": {"recommendationid": "22768312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065302159", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462290784}, "language": "english", "review": "Still better shooter than cod", "timestamp_created": 1462223799, "timestamp_updated": 1462223799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475423", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22767430": {"recommendationid": "22767430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271639445", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463177581}, "language": "english", "review": "Tom Clancy's lovely planet is a very tactical and realistic fps, is only recommended for true fps fans and requires alot of strategy and patience.

It changes in 10% everytime.\nIt doesn't have a sound slide bar. So you can't change the sound volume. Which is stupid.\nYou can play with the xbox controller.\n\n[h1]About the game.[/h1]\n\nYou have to jump across the current level and shooting the \"baddies\". You have to kill all of the baddies in order the complete the level.  If you miss one, you are forced to redo the level again. The water balloons are an instant death when it lands on the ground.  Even if you are not close to it or near. You will still die instantly. If you hit the black cube, you will have to restart the level again. I don't think this game is worth purchasing the full price. Unless you like \"classic\" casual games.  \n\nYou don't have access to the options when ingame.\nThe graphics are terrible.\nThere is a small ingame tutorial.\nThere is a leaderboards but who cares about those.\nMusic is cartoony and WAY TOO HAPPY FOR MY EARS.\nThere is no lifebar. however you do die in 1 hit.\nIf you have hit an enemy then your weapon will glow.\nYou have the option to look ahead. So that you know what is coming your way.\nThere are secrets.\nThere are many worlds and levels. i think each world has 20 levels.\n\n[h1]Other things.[/h1]\n\nThere are chinese language sometimes in the game. Which is not needed.\nThis is a game for kids. That is for sure.\nIt's stupid that they let you show the leaderboards everytime you play a level. Even if you have died and you are restarting the level again. This is really annoying after awhile.\nThe game is also somewhat Time challenged based....\nHow can the game be lovely if you are killing things.\nThe difficulty wll be increased at level 2 already. \n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 3/10", "timestamp_created": 1457644497, "timestamp_updated": 1492855872, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21752286": {"recommendationid": "21752286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061469711", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513923440}, "language": "english", "review": "It's beautiful.", "timestamp_created": 1457636133, "timestamp_updated": 1457636133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480226", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21740676": {"recommendationid": "21740676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034931431", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490333285}, "language": "english", "review": "Very quick, very cute.

Hoewel het technisch goed is uitgevoerd en de besturing vlot verloopt kan ik het spel niet aanraden. Over het algemeen heb ik het (puur persoonlijke smaak) al niet voor de aziatische spelletjes, maar dit spel is wel extreem kinderachtig. De fele kleuren en overvloed aan hartjes doen me vermoeden dat dit spel vooral gericht is op de markt van meisjes tussen de 5-10 jaar. Grafisch en qua spelinhoud is duidelijk te zien dat dit spel op een zeer kosteneffici\u00ebnte manier is gemaakt (Lees: weinig budget). De muziek is irriterend, met om de paar seconden een nog vervelendere stem die er \"I'm gonna love you\" tussen gooit. Daarnaast is het niet echt duidelijk wat het einddoel van het spel is.\nConclusie is dat dit spel zeker geen aanrader is; tenzij je een aziatisch kindje (tussen de 5 en de 10 jaar) bent met een zwak

comfortable, then this could well be the game for you.\n\nPros: It's playable, runs well, could even be fun if you really like 3D platformers and never heard about Nintendo.  There's even a couple of graphics options that allow the game to scale.  It's got a unique theme and artistic direction.\n\nCons: Nintendo covers this genre way better.   There's not much to the game.  The theme and artistic direction aren't really aimed at PC gamers, it really is something for little schoolgirls or people overdosing on Prozac (call the poisons helpline for medical advice and stop playing computer games with lovehearts all through them). \n\nIt's worth noting it's a tough decision to drop a thumbs down on this one - the developers did achieve what they set out to do, the technical execution was solid enough.

It is a very simple goal and it's a very simple game.\n\nBut lovely planet is not without its depth and complexity, the game starts off very simple and quickly ramps up the difficulty, with the later levels (at least in my case) requiring you to learn patterns and make multiple attempts. With my current playtime I've finished 4/5 of the worlds avaliable, with the last world looking like it will take a long time to finish.\n\nThe movement is also very simple, but feels very clean and responsive overall. You can rampage through the levels spraying purple pellets across the map, but you won't be able to get the highest rating of three stars. Which reqiures both a quick time and a perfect accuracy rating, overall doing a level with three starts feels very crisp and skillful to pull off, especially on some of the harder and longer levels.\n\nI would strongly reccomend this game to fans of similarily hard platforming games like Super Meat Boy or Dustforce, you are forced to get better quickly in Lovely Planet as you are with these games.\n\nAnother thing I didn't see in other reviews is that the game has a good competetive and speedrunning scene if you are the kind of person drawn to that, chasing the perfect indivual level time is also very fun, I found myself going back to the earlier levels which I now find trivial simply to do them better than I did before.

It doesn't establish nearly as much structure in terms of how the level will be played. It suggests a simple path for you but gives you quite a lot of freedom to play the game how you'd like to.

in dem es eig. darum geht, schnell durch die Level zu kommen. F\u00fcr mich bestand aber erstmal die Aufgabe \u00fcberhaupt mal durch die Level zu kommen. \nLasst euch nicht von der netten und kindlichen Grafik einlullen, das Spiel hats faustdick hinter den Ohren.\nEs gibt 5 Welten und in jeder Welt haben sich die Entwickler was noch fieseres und hinterh\u00e4ltigeres einfallen lassen. So muss man sich beeilen um herabfallende \u00c4pfel abzuschie\u00dfen und wird zeitgleich von nem Gegner beschossen, dessen Sch\u00fcsse einen verfolgen und man die Sch\u00fcsse dabei auch \"abschie\u00dfen\" muss. Ich kann nur sagen, dass Lovely Planet zwar die liebe und nette Atmossph\u00e4re r\u00fcberbringt, aber einen gleichzeit  mit einem 20 Tonnen Panzer \u00fcberf\u00e4hrt :D\n\nFazit:\nEin lustiges Spiel mit einer knappen Spielzeit (vielleicht 4-5 Stunden maximal) um die Level zu schaffen. Die Bestzeiten sind entweder gehackt oder von einem typischen Super-Japaner aufgestellt worden, sodass man die einfach net schlagen kann. Aber trotzdem kann ich Lovely Planet echt empfehlen, wenn Einem sowas liegt.\n\n\n\nIch habe den Anfang auch mal blind angespielt, schaut rein, wenn ihr wollt :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHMKZGsFJGE\nAlternativ kannst du auch, wenn dir das Review gefallen hat,auch meiner Kuratorgruppe auf Steam folgen, um auch meine Reviews zu anderen Spielen zu bekommen: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Drakeschool", "timestamp_created": 1445167136, "timestamp_updated": 1477494765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18514825": {"recommendationid": "18514825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201410169", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504961554}, "language": "english", "review": "I really think this game has been names incorrectly, the name of the game is Lovely Planet.\nBut I think the game should've been called muscle memory, because that's really what the game is about.\nThis game is the most fun experience i've had in gaming for a while now.\nDo expect to put some time into playing this game since you will need a lot of time to remember all the levels.\nThere is one thing I would've liked to see in the game; community maps.\nI know this won't be as easy to implement as it is in some source games but I would llike to see what the community can come up with.", "timestamp_created": 1445043560, "timestamp_updated": 1445043560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18451184": {"recommendationid": "18451184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079384845", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444715819}, "language": "english", "review": "this game made me not do my physics homework", "timestamp_created": 1444710481, "timestamp_updated": 1444710862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474062", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18450551": {"recommendationid": "18450551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062712916", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506491758}, "language": "english", "review": "If this game was any less cutesy and happy looking/sounding/feeling you'd probably kill yourself minutes into play.

You'd have to be an absolute fool to neglect this purchase.\n\nLong version: My roommate suggested me this game after learning that I was looking for games to speedrun. I purchased it, fired it up, and not a moment later, fell in love with it. That kind of love you feel that just warms your whole body. My initial reaction was, \"Wow, this soundtrack is incredible! And these graphics! It's so simple, yet so capturing and quirky!\"\n\nI started on 1-1. The first level in the first world. As the music changed from the Menu music to City, I got swept away in a feeling of bliss I hadn't felt in years. The controls were simple, the enemies were clear, and the objective straightforeward. Use the keyboard to move and jump, use the mouse to look and shoot. Reduce the enemy count to 0, and walk into the purple pillar. So simple! Why aren't more games like this? \n\nAs you reach the goal, a new window shows up, displaying information such as how quickly you completed that level, how quickly other people completed the level (a leaderboard), as well as how quickly the fastest person completed that level. Just like that, you already have a new way to enjoy the game, as if the gameplay itself weren't enough. Now you can not only compete against your own times, but other people too? Game on.\n\nAs you try to get top 15 times on the leaderboards, you start to try new things. Push the routes you used to take, or plan entirely new ones, hoping that they're faster. As you inevitably burn through all the levels in City, you move on to world 2, named Village. With each new world, new levels, obstacles, and enemies stand between you and those sweet sweet top 15 times. Can you hack it?\n\nThis game is designed in a way that the player doesn't feel coddled, but at the same time, it's not impossible to win. It's designed to be challenging, but not unwinable. New enemies are revealed in open, contained areas that let you see how they function, before throwing them just around a corner in the last levels of that world. \n\n227 in game hours ago, I had the biggest, stupidest grin on my face. The joy of this game hasn't left me, even 227 hours later. If you're looking for a fun casual game, then you've found one. If you're looking for an speedrunning game that puts your skill to the test, then you've found one. Buy. This. Game. It's worth every penny.\n\nNote to potential speedrunners: This game contains little RNG. The only RNG it DOES contain, bears no effect on how the game is run, or how it affects you or enemies. The only RNG occurs when an enemy dies, or your bullet registers as a hit, your gun will be showered in stars, providing a visual cue so the player can continue without having to watch the shots connect. I can find no pattern to where the stars appear. This is the RNG. That's it.

Lovely Certainly describes this game.\nThis is literally my favorite game I've [b]ever[/b] played. It\u2019s amazing from its quick paced FPS shooting to its not obvious in your face, but certainly there story line. This game is trippy cute and simply beautiful. Yes as most people will argue that it\u2019s just the \"basics of unity\" but it\u2019s the simplicity that makes it what it is. Its runs perfectly with no frame drop and can run on the most potato of PC's and still play it with great performance. For me, this is one of those games that I can always come back to when bored and replay one of the many levels that it offers for time and time again fun. While not as many people take this game as serious as I probably do with what 50 hours now and growing I can't stop playing this game. Many people will also argue that it gets \"way too hard\" but that\u2019s part of the magic. I bet anyone who actually tries to play this game from start to finish can certainly say they've more than improved on aiming skills reflexes and hand eye coordination. To me this game is yes \"changeling\" and sometimes \"rage inducing\" but it always is just that more rewarding for when do finally hit that apple you could never hit, get 100% A or beat that time limit, it\u2019s amazing and rewarding for what it is. Another key stand point for this game is the amazing sound track. I think this game is literally meant for cheering up people with its bright colors and more than happy sound track. For the composer of it, I certainly dropped 3 bucks your way because you honestly deserve it for how much genius went into the track. This game isn't your stereotypical FPS of now a day and has its pace set to the \"get up and fucking move\" setting which makes it stand out from every other modern day FPS. It\u2019s great for speed runners and hell casual play too.

However do not let the cuteness fool you, this game is brutally hard.\n\nThe graphics remind me of the Nintendo 64 games with crude 3D shapes mixed with occasional simple 2D textures to give character. I know this is a bit far-fetched, but I find it cute in Lovely Planet.\nThe gameplay is swift and responsive, the only weird part being sliding off some ledges that look like it would be possible to land on them. Framerate is perfect and the game runs well. However the FOV cannot be changed.\n\nThe idea is to get across a short level while jumping on platforms and shooting baddies. Simple enough, so there are leaderboards to compete, and stars given according to accuracy and speed. At first I kept trying to go faster and faster without understanding why my impressive runs didn't get rewarded by the game, until I learned that the third star was only given for 100% accuracy. I like a good challenge, so I worked on finishing all levels 100% with three stars.\n\nAt the start the levels were pretty straight-forward and it was fun. But then... then the apple fell too far from the tree. Literally, because falling apples is the one game mechanic that ruined the game for me. Any single apple hitting the ground triggers a game over. The early ones are thrown at the player, which is fine. However after a bit the apples are shot in the sky from a different place in the level, and just fall right where they are, whether the player is around or not.\n\nLet me explain better how this is infuriating. You are in a part of the level, merrily shooting and platforming your way. And then, suddenly, you cross an invisible line and hear the dreaded sound of an apple been released. And now, the only thing that you can do is rush forward in the level to reach the part where the apple is located, and start shooting from afar (because the bullets take time to travel), without a target nor a crosshair, where you predict that the apple is going to fall . And then you realize that three apples were triggered, and you need to pre-shoot three different locations with pinpoint pre-accuracy and timing. So, basically, you have no choice but to quickly shoot in several directions and hope for the best, and do it again and again until you are a robot that has complete muscle memory of the right way to deal with this nonsense. And let's not talk about the moment where you have to jump on a jump-pad, and while in the air, shoot where an apple is going to land BEHIND you, then quickly turn back forward and shoot where an apple is falling in FRONT of you. I managed to do it. I did all of this. I had three stars in these levels, so 100% accuracy. But instead of being happy at my achievement, I was thinking \"why? why so much time wasted being a robot and not having any fun?\". Then I started the 4th world, and noticed that the levels were engulfed in fog. Superman 64 level of fog and fun. With the nerve-wrecking treat that I also had to pre-shoot apples that I couldn't even see, and it was made even more obvious that completing the levels would be a tedious chore of memorizing every single move and shot. \n\nNo, thanks, I like a good challenge, but this is just a waste of time, and the cute graphics are hidden in fog anyway, so why bother.

This game starts off easy but gets really difficult. Your projectiles are slow so you have to lead moving targets, and you fail the level if you let some targets hit the ground or get hit by an enemy projectile. The gameplay is very trial-and-error. You have to figure out a sequence of shots and moves and execute them close to perfectly, or you'll fail. To give you an idea: often you have to jump into a teleporter after which you are greeted by three projectiles flying at you from different directions, so you have to shoot them to not get hit, but at the same time jump on a disappearing platform and reach around the corner just in time to hit two tomatoes before they hit the ground. Very difficult. For enthousiasts, there are achievements for being fast and for 100% accuracy in each level.\nIf you like difficult/trial-and-error games with instant restart (such as Super Meat Boy), get this game.

In the game you traverse through different colourful levels, trying to kill alll enemies, not miss any shots and beat your time. It may sound easy but believe me when I say [b]it's not...[/b] there will be many obstacles alog the way.\n\n[h1]The love and the hate[/h1]\nIf you rage easily in games dont get this, okay? Most of the time you will be repeating the same stage time after time again because you made stupid mistakes. The other portion of the time you will be smashing your keyboard and screaming words that you didnt even know you could say. But: Im not saying thats a bad thing because its not. It adds to playtime and it make winning a level feel very rewarding.\n\nThe two most amazing aspects of this game for me are the artstyle and soundtrack. It really makes me chuckle when I realise Iv been screaming at a bunch of colourful polygons and a happy japenese tune. They both remind me alot of Japan and I think thats what they were going for considering the random japenese writing everywhere. The artstyle consists of minimilistic colourful blobs that make it easy to tell enemies and ground apart with their colours that stand out. The music in itself makes the game. The music is a nice upbeat happy track which makes you forget about all your troubles and just stand and listen. It is so happy I wonder how it could be played over the top of such an evil game! In fact I am listening to it while reading this review and it makes me not want to list a bad point about the game!\n\nThe gameplay in this game is the usual. Considering that it is mainly concentrated on platforming and twitch shooting which I hate it still felt smooth and I felt as if my shots were hitting when they should. The gun felt nice although you couldnt change what gun you had which I thought would of been cool although it probably would of messed up the leaderboards for speedrunners. So I think this game could use a bit more variety to make it a bit more intresting and unique.\n\nSomething this game is missing is a story which although twitch shooters dont normally have a story I think that super meat boy pulled of a pretty nice story so this could probably do it to! I felt as if that made the world I ran through feel empty and without meaning. Also I think a story would of made me want to progress a bit further into the game whereas right now Iv given up because Iv been stuck for an hour. Also It might add to the replayability.\n\n[h1]The verdict[/h1]\nLovely planet is a rage inducing twitch shooter with platforming aspects. Its soundtrack and world makes up for the lack of story.

convince others to give it a try. To start, Lovely Planet is a game about shooting angry red guys. In order to get all 3 stars for a level, you must kill every enemy, beat the level fast enough, and not miss a single shot. With the low shot speed of your bullets, this last one can be a pain, but all of the game's enemies are stationary (except for apples, which can hardly be considered enemies) and you'll get used to the gun. \n\nThe game has great visuals and music, especially if you enjoyed the katamari series. Even after hearing the same song for a few hours, you shouldn't get sick of it unless you really hate jpop. \n\nFor me, the game really shines in its wonderful level design and difficulty curve. The first world is quite easy and will introduce you to the mechanics without being too punishing. As the game progresses, however, you'll find that every new level is just slightly outside of your skill level - not easy but never impossible. As someone who never plays first person shooters, I never felt that a level was too difficult to complete with all 3 stars. As far as the level design, there were multiple occasions where I saw what the level wanted me to do and got giddy with excitement, completely in love with the elegance of the design. \n\nI can't recommend this game enough.

Lovely Planet is a Quake-esque first person platformer and bullet hell shooter. People are comparing this game to Super Meat Boy, but I disagree completely. Not only that, but I think this game is shite. Here are my points:\n\nSuper Meat Boy is about precision, and tight controls. Meat Boy himself is basically a walking hitbox- he's a tiny cube that dies if he touches any enemy or any environmental obstacle, and while that insta-death aspect is true in this game, really nothing else is even close to similar to Meat Boy.\n\nUnline Meat Boy, LP is in first-person, which is a challenge for bullet hell-style insta-death games, because traditionally the idea of a bullet hell is that you can see what's going to hit you and be able to dodge it based on your hitbox, whether it be that glwing dot on the back of your spaceship or Meat Boy's tiny, but rigidly defined body. In an FPS, however, you lose that precision. When a bullet is flying toward you, you have no clue how far you need to dodge to actually have it not hit you, which makes a lot of deaths in this game a result of shitty design rather than lack of skill. First-person view also restricts your vision- in a 2D shooter or platformer, you have all the information right in front of you, but in an FPS, you have to be constantly swiveling around, trying to see everything around you, and that restriction of your vision can be frustrating.\n\nThe same goes for the platforming- very few FPS games ever do precision platforming because it's just so shitty to pull off: in a game where you can't see your own legs and can't see your own hitbox, jumping into obstacles and getting a death can often be the result of hazy game design rather than being bad at the game, and people don't like that. People want to die because they're shitty players, not because not enough thought went into the design of the game.\n\nYet again, the shooting suffers from similar falling-off points: lack of clarity being the main one. I find it hard to even call this game \"precision\" when it doesn't even have a crosshair, and if, say, the weapon you're holding came out of your character's midsection Quake-style, then that would have been a little bit better, but no- it actually shoots at an angle to the left, making it incredibly unprecise.\n\nSoundtrack's good enough, though- I get that what they were going for was kind of an ironic, disingenuously quirky theme to contrast with the hard gameplay, but it really just didn't do it for me.\n\nAs you can see, I haven't even played very much of this game yet- I'll admit, I've tried the first level of the second world maybe 200 times and no matter what I do, I die seemingly at complete random when I'm not close to even touching any obstacle. I'm sure it's something that the game just hasn't explained to me, and for fucks sake I don't need a completely hamfisted tutorial to understand it, but holy shit. I literally just die every time I move in any direction in the first level of the second world, and I can't get past it. And I'm not terrible at FPSes, either- the game is just so unclear that it's not fun for me at all.\n\n(sigh)... if everything I just said made you leap to your feet and think, \"finally! a game just for me!\", then for fucks sake buy it, it's only six dollars. But I think it's a prime example of when a shitty game gets acclaim just because of the unique visuals and concept, instead of quality gameplay, and for a game that really does lean incredibly heavily on its gameplay, that's a very bad sign.", "timestamp_created": 1434661175, "timestamp_updated": 1434661814, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16499177": {"recommendationid": "16499177", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996909517", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473317987}, "language": "english", "review": "The only FPS I've ever cared about playing, Lovely Planet is essentially an FPS Dustforce, but one that integrates the speedrunning experience much more.

On the surface, this game begins as a fun, cute platforming FPS in which you have to reach the finish pole while also eliminating every enemy in the level, these enemies being red blobs of various shapes. Some of these enemies shoot bullets which you can parry by shooting with your own gun. Wanting to get all the achievements, I had to get 3 stars on every level, one for finishing, one for finishing quickly, and one for 100% accuracy. This was an enjoyable challenge because it kept things tense in the first few worlds as I had to aim my shots carefully and be hasty. \n\nThe last 2 worlds, Swamp and Mountains, were a whole different story however. Homing bullets were introduced, ones that you must shoot or death is basically guaranteed. Levels became misty, and homing bullets started flying out of nowhere. Bombs that are launched and must be shot before they hit the ground or you are killed instantly involve having to gauge where the bomb will be at a certain time and shooting at that spot, which is more fun than it sounds. With all these elements combined, eventually, the game turned into one of the hardest FPS/platforming experiences I've had, at least in order to get 3 stars in every level. Due to a requirement of 100% accuracy, every shot had to count, and no excess shots were allowed. After hours of memorising and practice, I would have to progress through the level, flicking and swiping to the next target, doing 90 and 180 turns constantly in order to shoot the various obstacles in my way. Despite all this difficulty, when you finally reach that finish pole with 100% accuracy, it makes you feel like some action movie star or an aim-botter of some kind :P. While torturing and rage-inducing, the rewarding experience of succeeding in this way is unmatched, and the main reason why I recommend this game, and what makes it so enjoyable.\n\nThere are also a number of secrets in the game, which are fun to look for and find, especially the fabled \"Planet Shrine\" secret which is an elusive one and may require some research to be discovered.\n\nOverall, much better than it seems on the surface, and should be played and 3 starred until the end for maximum enjoyment.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1432278894, "timestamp_updated": 1466921739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15935626": {"recommendationid": "15935626", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985969658", "num_games_owned": 720, "num_reviews": 438, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432262487}, "language": "english", "review": "Wanted to like this game, and started to, but then when I finally realized the idea behind the game and and mechanics reinforced by the design I ultimately have to say no. I'll start by saying I love the idea of the opposite setting to the gameplay; hard precision fps in a cartoon world. The characters are cute, the music is nice. I have no problem you only use a bow and shoot the game people, and the levels are pretty similar. At first I loved the game, as I found it tough but mostly fair. Most parts just took a little practice. Around world 3 and especially 4, the game really started to go in the wrong direction. I have been playing FPS games all my life and have gotten very good and have played tons of different types of ones, so I can comment pretty confidently on this. \n\nMy first problem is the aiming. There are no crosshairs, which I would be fine with, but the shooting and aiming is off. Instead of your shots going in front of you where they should, they go off to the side and are unpredictable. You have to turn your body to shoot in front of you. They should either have included crosshairs showing where off to the side you shoot, or just had you shoot in front of you without crosshairs. I died so many times from something coming at me in the center of my screen or something I wanted to shoot, only the have the bullets go to the side, or below, or anywhere but where they should have gone. In a shooter requiring precision and timing, this is a no-no. \n\nThere were problems with enemies. First off, there are homing shots. Now normally with a homing shot if you dodge it is misses you, and with a bullet or something it would keep going and hit into something. In this game thats not true somehow. If you dodge a homing shot, you instant die. Which means if you miss the tiny little moving thing (with the poor aiming) coming at you, you auto die and restart the level. My dodges should count, but the same makes a mistake here. Next up are the apples in the air you have to shoot. I have no problem with shooting things out of the air, but the game starts to overuse it. Instead of it at certain parts and in certain levels, the game starts having them throughout the level, and EVERY single level. They usually also use 2 at a time, and pair that with homing missiles. It just becomes annoying. This changes the gameplay. Instead of me having to make precision shots and sometimes shoot things out of the air, but also have little breaks and go at my own pace at times in between things and make levels more fair, you basically just have to keep moving forward at all times and you need to follow the developers set pace. This makes me not feel like I'm moving through the level, but I am only a roller coaster the developers made, and my only input is turning and shooting. It also makes it so even if you dodge and shoot things, if you don't keep pace or see where the apple is, you die and start over. Where before you got to enjoy yourself with the challenge, and time was for the leaderboards and tryhards, now it becomes the only thing that matters. \n\nThe game finally comes to a head in the 4th world, where (dumbest design decision I could think of) the entire world is surrounded in fog, and you can't see ahead of you. This turns every level into you jumping not knowing what is next and where you are going. You see a ball at the last second or the homing missiles right when they are on you, taking away aiming and making it reflexes or luck. The other problem is this forces this game into the worst offense. Instead of it being skill, it becomes repetition. Because you can't see where you are going next, and every next part has a new homing missing you have to hit first try and you die, or 2 apples falling that you can't see but have to keep running forward and start shooting hopefully to hit, you have to find out from error. Every level becomes the same. You start one part, fail, repeat, figure that part out, jump into the next area without seeing whats next, keep running because you hear falling object, get there too late, start over, keep redoing all of that till you sprayed enough to kill the object, get to next part, die because you can't see whats next, die, repeat ALL of it over again, and keep doing that till you finally beat that 1 level. It becomes less based on your skill or ability to think on the fly, but slowly figuring out where each little thing is, and spending 100 tries on one level before you finally beat it. That's not good game design. I can make a boss with 150 hitpoints and you do 1 damage a hit, and you have 1 hit death and you have to start all over. People will spend hours repeating the fight till they beat him, and only a few will, but just because something requires 100 times doesn't make it well made, some people just like it because the few that want to waste their lives to try and beat it feel good about themselves after they finally do. Some of us have better things in life to do. If the game design in these later levels was well made, it would just take skill, and those of us with good aiming and everything would be able to beat it quickly and relatively easily. But spending dozens and hundreds of retries memorizing patterns and every single little thing to finally beat 1 level, isn't worth it or a sign of skilled design. And since there are no checkpoints or amount of life, and 1 hit means you have to redo everything, even if you beat a really hard part or a few in a row, and a new part you havent seen yet punishes you for doing it for the first time, you lose all of your progress, which is annoying. Also since a lot of parts require spraying and some luck, you may not be able to beat the part you did before again for a bit. Multiple parts I had to shoot an apple in the fog I couldn't see before it fell, so I had to start shooting based on memory of where it was from my last playthrough, and I wouldn't know I had been missing it until it was too late, now thats poor game design. And mix all the problems of homing, poor aiming, tons of timed apples, and the grinding memorizing gameplay, and fog, and you made me realize this isn't a game about skill or fun, its about repetition and tiny little progress after tons of repeated efforts. I'd rather find something that rewards talent more than time spent. If only the game stuck with the ideas of the first 2-3 worlds.  5.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1432264224, "timestamp_updated": 1432264224, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15903190": {"recommendationid": "15903190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062848663", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454333128}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would play it is really fun but some levels are really hard!\n", "timestamp_created": 1432056546, "timestamp_updated": 1432056546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15899855": {"recommendationid": "15899855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083567733", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440592571}, "language": "english", "review": "CoD + Quake + KAWAII = This game = So cute and awesome!\nI wanna see a multiplayer though.", "timestamp_created": 1432041826, "timestamp_updated": 1432641023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15865890": {"recommendationid": "15865890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065651420", "num_games_owned": 538, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459404016}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u9762\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u6f02\u4eae\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u8fd8\u7b97\u53ef\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u4e0d\u5f3a\u3002\n\u5173\u5361\u6bd4\u8f83\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u73a9\u4e00\u4f1a\u611f\u89c9\u5c31\u817b\u4e86\u3002\n\u4e00\u5173\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u6392\u884c\u699c\uff0c\u5f88\u96be\u8ba9\u4eba\u6709\u91cd\u73a9\u7684\u6b32\u671b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1431841310, "timestamp_updated": 1431841310, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15861863": {"recommendationid": "15861863", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964547616", "num_games_owned": 1238, "num_reviews": 225, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431818573}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeux rapide, color\u00e9, fun, nerveux et qui propose beaucoup de challenge.

I don't seem to be blinded by the kawaii-vision and I've never played Katamari Damacy.  It's rather dull and shallow.  It's not really a fun world to be in, and you have to \"make\" your own fun, so to speak.  In the 90 minutes or so I played I got to level 4-10 and... oh boy.\n\nThis is \"challenging\" for the wrong reasons.  I'm a veteran FPS player and not having a crosshair just feels like a lazy handicap rather than a \"feature\".  Projectiles having a travel time are fine and all (even though I see them as inappropriate for a twitch/speedrun game like this), but not -that- slow, PLUS the zero crosshair.  This is the basis for my other complaint, which are the apple bombs.  You have to lead your projectiles on a moving, gravity-based sort of artillery round, and if it ever hits the ground you just die.  Immediately.\n\nThat in itself is fine and all, whatever, but when it gets to the point that you have 4 homing bullets zooming at you while your vision is greatly reduced (in the later levels) while you're jumping on platforms that you have to shoot only once to remove the hostile... ketchup blob thing but not twice or it will disintegrate, only trying to rush through all of that to shoot the two apple bombs that are already on their way down because they fired outside your vision range... it doesn't feel like a fair challenge.  It's just dumb.  I feel like they should be an occasional danger rather than nearly as common as the standard fodder enemy.\n\nThe music is passable, not bad but not my preference at all.  The sound effects are awful.  I had to turn them off because the various things that emitted high pitched screeching (akin to the \"mosquito\" noise) actually started to really bother me because you hear it so damn much.  Not like I was missing out on the single sound effect it made when you either died or shot something, or the single sound effect for firing your gun.  I did find out the hard way, though, that that gimped me from hearing the apple bombs fire so I knew when to hurry up, or even hinting that they were there in the first place.  In some levels I had no idea why I was dying until I blasted through things only to see the apple bombs for half a second before dying.\n\nGot this in a humble bundle, and I sure am glad.

Os primeiros n\u00edveis s\u00e3o bons, divertidos e durante algum tempo gostei muito do jogo e pensei que no final faria a an\u00e1lise mais positiva que pudesse!! .. mas estava enganado. O jogo vai ficando mais e mais complicado, at\u00e9 que chega a um mundo (o jogo divide-se por mundos, o mundo 1 \u00e9 f\u00e1cil, o 2 \u00e9 m\u00e9dio e o 3 \u00e9 hardcore) , onde precisas de ser um super hardcore speedrunner fps pro master pra passar aquela porra. Fica horr\u00edvel e muito frustrante. Existe uma mec\u00e2nica no jogo, em que umas \"ma\u00e7\u00e3s saltam do ch\u00e3o\", e tens de as atingir o mais r\u00e1pido poss\u00edvel.

It's an FPS on the surface and into the core, which is not a bad thing, it's a very good thing actually. With pastel like colors, angry squares shooting at you and a lovely upbeat soundtrack composed by Calum Bowen, Lovely Planet is a great game with everything on point.\n\nWhat do you do in Lovely Planet? Well you shoot purple bullets towards other purple bullets, shapes with eyes that just stand in place and shapes with eyes that shoot homing bullets at you. And many more things you can shoot at (or be shot from). \nMost of the skill of the game comes from taking the right paths, taking them quickly while managing to avoid and shoot  \"baddies\". You can also \"ace\" (or 100%) levels by completing them under a certain time limit while not missing a shot. The game gets to a point where my brain can't handle all the things happening on screen, which makes a great practice game with a sense of triumph at the end of every level.\n\nIt also has a leaderboard, my favorite thing!

If you like games like Super Meatboy, this is like the First Person Shooter version.\n\nPersonally I only played the first few levels before I got frustrated and moved on, but for those first few levels, it was worth it :D\n\nTHE GOOD:\n-Amazingly upbeat music! It gets you jacked and makes you want to beat it!\n-Cool graphic style. It reminded me of the Katamari games :)\n\nTHE BAD:\n-Difficulty scales way too quickly! You'll be moving from one level to the next, fighting more and harder enemies, then suddenly the game introduces a bomb.

to anyone who is a fan of the age old Katamari Damacy series, as any fan of the Katamari Damacy series can see that Lovely Planet takes a huge artistic inspiration from those games. \n\nLovely Planet is essentially a merciless speedrunner with Japanese undertones (although it should be noted that the Developer QuickTequila is located and based in New Delhi as stated in their twitter) and a cute art style, and a nice upbeat kind of music score (created by Calum Bowen whose soundcloud and bandcamp you should check out if you enjoy the game's music). The game boils down to shooting anything that is red and/or has an angry face while navagating through a labyrinth like map that can range from easy to hard all while being timed as you compete against a leaderboard of other players who have beat the game in a certain amount of time. What makes the game difficult, enjoyable, and challenging is that the gun does not have cross hairs and that the movement of your character is enhanced (in the sense that you move fast, you jump far, and you just have an overall snappy and springy movement). The time aspect makes the game addicting as you constantly try to compete with others (the closest I've gotten is roughly 5.45 seconds to complete a map where the #10 rank for that map was 5.25 and goes down to almost 2.20 seconds for rank #1).\n\nThis has been repeated quite a few times in the reviews I've read below, but I would like to repeat them once more as they are a very accurate description of the game. Lovely Planet takes the speedrunning aspects of Supermeatboy, the springy mechanics of the Super Sam series, and the aesthetics of Katmary Damacy to create an enjoyable game for the price that is offered of $5.99. I myself bought the game in a recent humblebundle for roughly $5 with other games, but would recommend it to anyone who finds themself debating if $5.99 (or the regional equivalent) is worth the investment. If you are someone who enjoys speed running and some nostalgia from old Japanese-esque aesthetic PS2 games then Lovely Planet is worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1421248194, "timestamp_updated": 1421248194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13978840": {"recommendationid": "13978840", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963174989", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422332752}, "language": "english", "review": "It's probably the best game ever.

Es divertido, genial, fresco y tan simple que lo divertido que sorprende. No es gr\u00e1ficamente atractivo a jugadores nuevos; es un 1-hit kill, y la dificultad aumenta RID\u00cdCULAMENTE conforme vas avanzando. lo que si llega a tocar un poco las pelotas, vendr\u00eda siendo las malditam manzanas que salen volando (por ahi del nivel 8 o 9 del primer mundo aparecen unas manzanas que salen catapultadas, y si no las destruyes antes de que toquen el suelo, BAM pierdes), en s\u00ed son sencillas, pero se pone complicado cuando son mas de 3 manzanas al mismo tiempo, teniendo que esquivar disparos de enemigos por cada \u00e1ngulo posible.\n\nAl ser un juego r\u00e1pido, no se recomienda jugarlo si est\u00e1s acostumbrado a sentarte en una esquina, disparando a cualquiera que pase por la puerta. Otra cosa que hace al juego mas intenso, entretenido y emocionante, es la falta de una mira, as\u00ed que debes tantear donde disparas, y si eres como yo que quieres tener una puntuaci\u00f3n limpia (10 disparos hechos y 10 acertados), tendr\u00e1s que disparar, birncar, esquivar y apuntar al mismo tiempo.\n\nEl soundtrack es pegajoso, simple, pero a\u00fan asi, genial. Una obra de arte asombrosa. Si me quedase dinero, sin duda comprar\u00eda el OST (pero mejor lo descargo xD).\n\nAunque parece un juego con modelos hechos por un cr\u00edo de 3 a\u00f1os, la simplicidad de los modelos llama la atenci\u00f3n, hace al juego mas ameno y te distrae de juegos estilo COD, o BF. Es un juego colorido, divertido en el cual se necesita mucha destreza por lo anteriormente mencionados. Este juego sin duda requiere que tengas paciencia (te lo aseguro. morir\u00e1s m\u00e1s de 1 vez en niveles despu\u00e9s del 6 o 7 del primer mundo), precisi\u00f3n (al no tener mira, necesitar\u00e1s habilidad para acertar ese disparo) y habilidad (correr, apuntar, disparar y esquivar no lo puede hacer cualquiera)\n\n10/10, este juego me cautivo y me oblig\u00f3 a hacer una de las rese\u00f1as m\u00e1s largas que he hecho en mi vida xD. tan solo 30 minutos de juego y ya est\u00e1 en mis favoritos.

It looks adorable, it feels adorable, it is adorable. \n\nThen you start playing it.\n\nThis game is a first person shooter that is essentially a very cute target practice sim. You need to haul it as fast as you can through various obstacles to the ending pole, shooting any and every red enemy that you see, while avoiding shooting at the blue ones. You run pretty fast, you jump very high, and you have infinite ammo in your block shooting gun. No enemies take more than one hit to kill, and only one type will shoot back at you; shooting the bullets they shoot kills them as well as stops the bullet. You have three objectives to get stars at the end of the game; beat the level (duh), beat a minimum time they give you, and have 100% accuracy on all of your shots. Sounds decently straightforward, right? That's because it is, in theory.\n\nThe first world is decently easy. However, even in this world expectations are quite high; a lot of the levels I beat the minimum time by few milliseconds, just because it's so fast paced. This might just be me being bad at the game and not being fast enough, because a lot of the world records are half the average speed. However, as angry and frustrated at both yourself and the game you get, you're never genuinely mad, because of how cute and fun the world around you is. Beat a 10 second minimum level in 9.997 seconds? That sucks, but holy sh*t this soundtrack!\n\nThe second world adds a new mechanic into the game; you need to shoot apples (tomatoes? large red bean bags?) before they hit the ground. Now, this would be very easy if your bullets had normal bullet physics; however, they move at a consist speed, about the same speed you run. So, if you need to shoot one of these things from a good distance as it's falling down, you need to aim your bullet down just above the ground so it'll collide into it. This is not as easy as it sounds, and I've had amazing runs destroyed because the apple hit the ground a few frames before the bullet hit.

Lovely Planet also requires speed and precision navigating the levels with the added difficulty that you have to aim and shoot at stuff, and trust me, many of those shots aren't easy. Seriously game, you expect me to get shot of a jump pad and bring down 3 falling giga-apples before they touch the ground?\nYou've probably noticed the game's artstyle by now.

Combined with the aggressively cheery (and quite good) J-pop soundtrack, it helps mitigate that the game is (at points) ridiculously difficult--I know I would probably have lost my patience with a game of this style that insisted on being grim and gritty. But, beyond that, this kind of game just flows better with minimal environments. By stripping away most potential distractions, the path and objectives (shoot all the red things, don't shoot the blue things, get to the lavender thing) become very clear.\n\nThis is important, because Lovely Planet is a game that encourages you to move very quickly: if you stop moving, you will probably die. This can lead to a pretty rocky start, but as you get the hang of the game, you get better and better at whizzing through levels, bouncing around with your impossible levels of FPS air control and felling enemies with single shots. As such, the game's biggest strength is that its level design facilitates this kind of gameplay. The levels are quite hard, but they are constructed so that finding the right path through them is fun rather than a grind. \n\nOne criticism I have seen leveled at the game is that the gameplay can get somewhat monotonous, but I think this is more due to the visual design than the individual levels. The environments don't change very much between worlds, which, although preserving the nicely minimal atmosphere, gets dull. Also, some of the later enemies' abilities aren't very well explained, and given that everything instantly kills, it can be kind of hard to tell what an enemy is doing the first few times it gets you. However, this doesn't weigh too much on the game compared to the one big problem:\n\nA lot of the challenge comes from tests of accurate shooting, rather than tricky platforming jumps or constant reflex tests. This is quite a sensible approach, but it would be significantly more fun if the gun had a crosshair. As it is, it doesn't, and given that the second and third worlds are largely based around skeet-shooting of a sort (enemies that kill you if they hit the ground) and enemies with homing projectiles that you have to shoot out of the air, respectively, this adds an unnecessarily irritating learning curve to aiming. \n\nStill, none of this overrules the fact that the first time I started to write this review, I thought, \"Wait, why am I writing about Lovely Planet when I could be playing Lovely Planet?\" and stopped. Once you get the hang of aiming and jumping, it's got addictive gameplay and a nice difficulty curve, set against a pleasant and cheery background. If you're strange like me and find ultrahard trial-and-error gameplay relaxing in a way, this comes recommended; otherwise, proceed with caution.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1420500655, "timestamp_updated": 1420500655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13856054": {"recommendationid": "13856054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142127844", "num_games_owned": 582, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483148323}, "language": "english", "review": "it sure is a lovely planet", "timestamp_created": 1420500179, "timestamp_updated": 1420500179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13853950": {"recommendationid": "13853950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112020041", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438182216}, "language": "english", "review": "it's  Call of duty, when you have taken drugs", "timestamp_created": 1420491135, "timestamp_updated": 1420491135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13851301": {"recommendationid": "13851301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057067919", "num_games_owned": 833, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432066052}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un fps bastante entretenido, todo es super kawaii y es muy rejugable (Protip: compralo cuando este de oferta aqui o en HumbleBundle)", "timestamp_created": 1420479875, "timestamp_updated": 1420479875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13851186": {"recommendationid": "13851186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080134986", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422921931}, "language": "english", "review": "Live, shoot, die & Repeat.

This game is stinkin' hard! Each level is like an obstacle course, where you have to quickly maneuver through it while dodging and shooting at high speeds.

It is very rewarding to complete a level after you spend 10-30 minutes dying over and over again. A level lasts only about 10-20 seconds with a perfect run through, but you have to memorize where every enemy and bullet is and where to shoot (unless you have amazing reflexes). Personally, I enjoy this type of game and the challenge it provides. It's fun to strategize how you will platform and shoot your way through a level as there are many different ways to complete each one.

And that's only after a grand total of maybe 70 minutes of playing it. Don't let the cute aesthetic with its simple pastel colored shapes and cutesy cheerful anime music deceive you, this thing right here is about as hardcore FPS as it gets. Why? First person precision jumping levels while wielding a gun without a crosshair, that's why. You have to hit every single enemy or you can't win the level. You have to dodge every projectile because everything is a one-hit-kill. You have to shoot out apples from the sky after they're being launched from a catapult before they touch the ground, otherwise you lose the level. And for some enemies you actually have to shoot their projectiles themselves since they home in on you, before you can engage the enemies themselves. The game is hard, and I do mean hard because everything is on the clock, events constantly trigger while you're just moving forward and if you're not 100% concentrated on the game you can forget getting anywhere here. \n\nThe game does give you some help though, at the start of any level you can preview the upcoming challenges to prepare yourself for what's to come, which is a nice feature, especially when the game at the end of a level tells you you missed an enemy and you have no goddamn clue where he was hiding. \n\nFor all the praise I can give it for being an undiluted FPS experience that truly tests your skills as a player, there are a couple of criticisms I want to lodge at it. First and foremost, it seems like a very short game overall. They claim that there are a hundred levels in the game but after 70 minutes, my arthritic old ass that's not used to twitch shooters anymore managed to get through 75% of the levels. And that's with excessive trial and error since most levels can be beaten in a couple of seconds. So I simply have to assume that by the end of it, a more skilled player will beat the game in under say 2 hours. It doesn't cost much so I guess the price is justified, but in the end, the whole experience is just running through levels as fast as possible while taking out all the enemies and never getting hit. There's literally no story here, just obstacle course after obstacle course and it's clearly geared towards speedrunners because the game keeps time of your performance and then insults you by showing you all the assholes who managed to beat the game 5 times faster than you did. I can appreciate the game for what it is and the execution is basically perfect, but to me this isn't a game that I'll be remembering all that much because there's really no substance there. I'm the kind of gamer that likes a game to tell me a story, not just present me with some mechanics, well thought out they though may be. \n\nThey're not asking for much cash here so I guess even though I'm not overly pleased with the game, I'll give it a recommendation for people who really want a challenging, unforgiving shooter that just might catch you off guard because of the unconventional aesthetic.

Controller has no mapping, and while it has cute icons in the environment to go with it, I wouldn't at all recommend using it because of the difficulty. Graphics options are minimal (AA, Vsync, Adjustable Frame Cap incl. Unlimited). Supports multi-monitor and all common aspect ratios if not everything. No FOV Adjustment (default is okay enough for average PC user), No Crosshair even optionally. No performance issues.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is amazing, but not for the feint of heart, or for those with even average dexterity. Beyond the middle of the 3rd world, out of a total of 5, the game becomes extremely difficult, and that's even with an on-screen crosshair (built into my Asus Display), which the game completely lacks by default. Up through the 3rd world I was able to complete the 2 bonus stars for time and 100% accuracy, but beyond that point more and more levels become an immense challenge just to finish at all. In other games, if you aren't good you can beat things, but you just wont get all the points or whatever. In this, if you aren't exceptionally good, you literally will not beat the game.\n\nMore enemies, mechanics, and obstacles are added as you progress, and while most aren't portal levels of brilliant, they do a good job of mixing up how you think about different situations. Though because of the difficulty near the end, it makes it a challenge to experiment with various timings, as it puts you in situations with very little time to react and execute, though retrying from the beginning of each level is nearly instantaneous.\n\nThe controls are extremely responsive (they really need to be for the end-game), and there's more variety than you'd initially expect. Though again, you need to be good enough to even see all of it. However, once you unlock a new world, ALL of the levels are open to you instantly. You're not completely stuck if you find a level right in the middle that gives you trouble, you can come back to it later, or never at all as you only need a certain amount of stars to progress.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n\nThe visuals are very minimal, but extremely charming in combination with the music. The game is frustrating, but the amazing music by Calum Bowen forces a smile onto your face for most of the experience. The soundtrack was free around the release of the game, and I've listened to it a considerable amount. The only thing I'd wish for, is more variety in the environments. There's definitely some there, but ones with drastically different color palettes or even nighttime levels would be a treat.\n\n[h1]TLDR - Summary[/h1]\n\nI completely and totally recommend it for fans of shooters both old and new.

It reminds me of Super Meat Boy in the sense that it encourages replaying until you ace a level, and is not as frustrating as it may seem due to the great soundtrack that continues to play through deaths, quick restarts, and the real sense of accomplishment one will get once they beat a level that has been the bane of their play. I have not finished it yet, and have only finished 2 out of 5 worlds, but I am sure I will come back again and again when I need something relaxing, yet challenging to play. Which is a good point to bring up. Lovely Planet is a very relaxing game. The cutesy pastel aesthetic is one that really sets it apart from other FPS style games and combined the soundtrack backing it, makes for an almost meditative experience. Sure, there will be some moments where you feel frustrated, but every death of mine (and there are many) has felt like it is my fault. Not the game's. All in all, I can't believe this is only 5 dollars. It is a wonderful experience. One that I feel many will enjoy.

It's a cutesy but challenging game which will test your reflexes and memorization of patterns. Deceptively simple in the beginning, it adds more and more content as you progress, and what was simply a \"bounce forward through the level shooting static enemies\" experience becomes: Immediate 180 turn, forward and left past moving blob of death, bunny hop gap, shoot blob blocking landing then instantly shoot dude right in front of you, then jump onto bounce pad, then shoot a falling apple in midair, then quickly jump across three dissapearing platforms, hop over spikes, dodge shots and kill two more guys around corners, then shoot an apple with unhittable targets behind it, and finish. Then they intoduce homing projectiles and flying enemies and stuff, and the content gets really frantic. The level design retains the same aesthetics, but with small changes on each particular level, and more stage hazards as you progress. There's also a couple possible paths on most levels, and there are secrets hidden throughout the game as well. There's not a ton of motivation to find them in my opinion, but if you're an explorer then you can poke around for the achievements. The game is arcadey, and scores you based on your performance. Getting three stars for a par time and perfect accuracy for your bullet ballet feels great, although don't expect to do that past the 2nd or 3rd world. It's a good example of a videogame that comes out of left field to provide a neat experience I didn't know I was missing.

Even more insane is the fact that... yeah, I *can* deal with this. Somehow. (At least, up through world 4 as of writing)\n\nThis may be because, secretly, this game is identical to precision platformers in every way other than the basic gameplay style. Steep but smooth difficulty curve? Check. Short, but challenging and tightly-designed levels that never drag on too long? Check. Scoring system that focuses on optimization and speed? Check. Instant restarts? Check. Heavy trial-and-error based gameplay? Check. Lives counter? Haha, not in the slightest. \n\nIt really *is* right in the same vein as precision platformers. Yet it's not the least bit frustrating. At all. I have not found myself raging at the game even once in nearly 10 hours of play (as of writing). There are a few minor instances of somewhat questionable level design (mostly in the form of apples that you have to blindly shoot in world 4, but there are only a few of those) that annoyed me, but every obstacle is overcomeable with enough practice and there's never too long of an iteration time to get back to where you messed up. The more challenging/precise a level tends to be, the shorter, too, so you don't have sudden difficulty spikes in the form of longer, mind-numbingly fast-paced levels that come out of nowhere. Everything feels smooth and natural. You approach a new level with a feeling of \"how the hell am I ever going to do this\" and then you beat it and have the same experience with the next level. Going back and replaying the easier levels after completing the harder levels only makes them better, too; you can completely annihlate them and feel like a champion for doing so. \n\nAlso, did I mention how gorgeous the game is all around? Absolutely wonderful art style, fantastic soundtrack, very polished controls. It's presented wonderfully, and the cutesy wrapping hides one hell of a hardcore experience. For $6 this is a steal, I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about it and it's certainly in contention for game of the year for me.\n\nI also wouldn't be surprised to find that I am better at FPS games than 90% of the people who've been playing triple-A titles for the past 5 years, because I doubt any of them give as intense of a training course as this game.\n\nNow for world 5 to kick my posterior mercilessly... help...\n\nEDIT: Post world-5 update.\nSo... the game gets incredibly quirky... and even more amazing... some of these levels are among my all-time favorites in any game I've ever played, haha, and the difficulty never lets up, only getting crazier. And yet... no frustration. At all. Nearly 18 hours to perfect every level and I did not get the slightest bit mad at the game. It's just... perfect, I don't know what else to say.\n\nEDIT: I'm editing this for the steam awards thing, but, I have to say. This game is just marvellous, even two years later. I think about this game frequently, I've played it more than most any other game in my steam library, and it's the only game I've ever seriously attempted speedrunning.

The options menu is a bit irritating to navigate because they chose to stylize it as a list to scroll up and down so you won't be able to see everything at once like most options menus on pc and the menu itself does not have full mouse control so all you can do with the mouse is to rotate your view a little bit to look at the background in a different angle and left clicking to select levels and such. As for the gameplay, it's pretty basic with one gun that has unlimited ammunition and fires as fast as you click while running through levels shooting baddies and apples from point A to point B and in order to complete a level, you need to clear out all baddies before you reach the exit, otherwise you need to restart the level. When completing a level, the game will record the time it took you to finish the level along with global leaderboards and a 3 star scoring system which does not even tell me what I'm scored on, and yes, this game is all about getting the fastest time possible. Lovely Planet is pretty much every speedrunner's dream so if you enjoy speedrunning through games, then I will recomend Lovely Planet to those who do, but if you are not much of a speedrunner, it might be a different story.

The music is a bit on the cutesy side but never too much.\n\nHowever, I think it's way too buggy, especially if you accidentally jump to a wrong place and need to restart the whole level with no way to jump your way out or walk around.

There are a few reasons why I say this:\n\n1. Despite its lovely facade, the game is HARD. Small mistakes are punished instantly, resulting in the player restarting the level.\n\n2. To add to the difficulty even more, the crosshair is nonexistant. You're only able to shoot \"from the hip\". Further, the gun doesn't shoot instant projectiles like many shooters. The gun shoots slow moving cubes, so you must accurately predict moving targets' paths.\n\n3. Often, especially later in the game, there are several mission-critical targets flying around at once, and you need the presence of mind to accurately and rapidly shoot each one.\n\nLong story short, the game is hard. Don't bother with it if you're not already reasonably good at the FPS genre.\n\nFor people who are generally competent at FPS games, this game has a lot to offer. Each level gives three stars based on your performance. The first star is just a gimme for completing the level. The second is a time star, meaning you can't just take the time to slowly aim all your shots if you want to perfect the level. The final star is for accuracy and is only awarded when you don't miss a single shot during the level. Perfecting a particularly hard level is a very rewarding experience. \n\nIf you love FPS and love a good rewarding challenge, this game is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1414103283, "timestamp_updated": 1414103416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12576342": {"recommendationid": "12576342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065704170", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428537681}, "language": "english", "review": "Evokes the same feeling I got when playing Super Meat Boy[spoiler], except with less anger[/spoiler].

(And suffering in school work as a result, but that's another story.) There are a lot of great games that I've played that were released just this year. It's hard to pick exactly one.\n\nBut if there was a sub-category for \"Best FPS I've played that was released in 2014\", it would be this one, hands-down. Why? Well...\n\nLovely Planet. It's as its namesake suggests. An incredibly cutesy, Japanese world with Japanese-styled characters. Everything pretty much looks like it came from some weird utopian anime with lovely planets and lovely worlds. But beneath that cute and cheery appearance lies a game that has far more depth than you would have thought it had.\n\nFor starters, despite its Japanese themes and Japanese-styled soundtrack, it was actually coded by a guy based in India. Vidhvat Madan - remember the name. I certainly would be. In terms of [url=http://vidhvat.com/][b]his games[/b][/url], Lovely Planet is the most polished one that he's come up with yet. And the soundtrack...not by a Japanese, but by UK-based Calum Bowen. Incredibly catchy, and still miles better than the turd that passes for radio pop nowadays.\n\nYou're armed with a gun that shoots purple cubes of [strike]DEATH[/strike] love, and you use it to [strike]kill[/strike] love all the red [strike]enemies[/strike] friends that you see around the map. They need your love. But don't shoot the gray ones, they already have enough, and any more than that will cause them to die from too much love. There are also a few types of fiendish traps strewn across the levels - for starters, apple bombs that trigger once you reach a certain point, you have to shoot them before they touch the ground, or else you go BOOM*! Other traps include a proximity trap which, when set off, renders a certain area unsafe after a few seconds - going into that area, uh, vapourises* you.\n\nThe first few levels start off easy, but after a while, you're involved in increasingly trickier scenarios. Take this one level for instance. I walk past an apple bomb, jump off onto a jump pad, and before I land on the jump pad the apple bomb I just walked past triggers and is launched into the air, along with ANOTHER apple bomb further along the way. You somehow have to turn around, shoot that bomb that you passed, then quickly turn back around and shoot the next bomb. All while you're probably in the air or trying to land on that jump pad. That was possibly the first level I really struggled with.\n\nLovely Planet's an incredibly punishing game. You have no crosshair (it feels really weird, mind you) and you have to judge your shots right. Most of the level solutions are learnt by rote - fail, fail and fail again, all while discovering how to pass some parts of the stage each time, and then perfecting the method for that one exhilaratingly perfect run. Good challenges, too - there's a speed challenge for beating a certain time, and an accuracy challenge where none of your shots go to waste. \nThe game also takes cues from games like Super Meat Boy - respawns are near-instantaneous so you don't have to wait too long to try again. Because you'll be trying again and again a lot of times.\n\nI've been notoriously bad at FPS games, so I don't forsee myself being able to complete this one, unfortunately. But even if I didn't, I'd be damned if I claimed I didn't have fun with it.\n\n\nOh, and before I end off: I like reading PC Gamer Reviews because their writers have a masterful command of English. For the most part, I agree with them. However, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say I disagree with [url=http://www.pcgamer.com/lovely-planet-review/][b]this particular one[/b][/url]. The presentation, contrary to what they say, is NOT MEDIOCRE. In fact, it's perfectly appropriate for this game. Not every FPS must look like CoD or Crysis. \n\nI will concede though that they at least gave one of the better scores. Other critics don't appear to like it as much, and that's a real shame, because this is such a...wait for it...[i]lovely[/i] gem. Okay, okay, I'm sorry, I'll stop now.\n\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\nIf you're into FPS games, you'll probably enjoy this, it might be worth full price to you then. If you're into FPS games with a large modicum of seriousness...put that all aside and get this. Don't be serious for a change.\nIf you're not either of the two, it's been bundled at least once so try trading for a key.\n\n[h1]Other games from the same dev[/h1]\nThis feels mechanically different than the first game, but is still quite fun.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/436000/\n\n[h1][b]9.0/10[/b][/h1]\n\n*[i]For dramatic effect only.

First the game is made of every j-pop fantasy the nineties could muster. Its like Keita Takashi's design seinsibility with Jumping Flash's music in a world so symbolic it can only be parody. That said it's not a vertigo introducing exploration platformer like Jumping Flash was, rather is a simplified run and gun FPS with mild platforming elements and a lot of twitch gameplay. Not as demanding as Hotline Miami, but the premise shoot, dodge, jump, react is simple enough you get straight into flow. Being in flow is a good thing. Flow is like when the Harlem Globetrotters made a 3 point shot from inside your cranuim as you eat  a hot dog. The game disurpts Japanese mascot culture with a neo-psychedlic style reminiscent of Harajku fruits.

Nowhere near as fun as quake live's race gamemode. It's kind of different from that, but with less depth, with the former being about movement+precision aiming (rocket jumps etc.) and this game being ONLY about precision aiming. The movement in this game is not very good. Walking down a slope will just make you instantly slide down it, way faster than you floating down from jumping.\n\nI don't know why a game entirely about precision aiming has no crosshair. Just because the projectiles inherit momentum doesn't make a crosshair useless. All removing the crosshair does is add guesswork to the game, which is stupid when most levels have very small frame windows in which to shoot homing projectiles. The stupidity multiplies whenever said projectiles are waiting for you in front of a teleporter exit. \n\nThat being said I think most people could find enjoyment out of the first 3 worlds since their less cheesy and actually give you some freedom of how you complete the levels. The swamp (4th world) levels are filled with guess-working tiny windows of opportunity, and guessing where the falling apples(?) are going to be when your screen is entirely fog and you have no depth perception. Mountain (5th world) has even more homing missile spam in-front of you as you leave a teleporter.

This is how I can most accurately sum up Lovely Planet. Fast reflexes, intricately designed bite-sized stages that will sometimes take forever to figure out, and a real sense of \"just one more try\" are the three strong points that Lovely Planet relies on, and for the most part it handles them very well.  \n\nEach stage of the game lasts about 20-30 seconds (if that, in most cases) and is an obstacle course you must find your way through without ever falling off of the level or being hit by various obstacles or enemy \"bullets.\"  Lovely Planet doesn't rely on tracers or hitscan to determine if you or enemies were hit. Bullets exist in the world and travel at varying speeds and this is something you'll need to be highly aware of and learn to adapt to if you're more used to modern FPS offerings. In fact, leading your and your enemies' shots is highly important the further you progress into the game. Old school Quake and Unreal players will probably feel right at home almost instantly. \n\nLovely Planet takes a pretty harsh difficulty jump once you hit world 3 and it only keeps getting harder from there. Some may really reach a point where they've hit their skill limit with how accuracy based so many of the challenges are near the end of the game.

This game brings you difficult challenges and tests your reaction time and ability to race against time. If you wanna be the very best and test your skills in this FPS, then this is a game for you.\n\nPros:\n-The price of 4,39\u20ac makes this game totally worth it.\n\n-The art style is cute and beautiful.\n\n-The music is very cute/lovely and makes you happy.\n\n-The game is very challenging and might make you rage.\n\n-You feel satisfied after you have finished one of these almost impossible levels.\n\nCons:\n-The settings isn't very advanced and the settings layout is kinda annoying. But then again, i don't think the settings needs to be very advanced, but some more settings would've been nice. I still think almost every computer here could run this game though.\n\n-There are no guidance or tutorials. You have to figure everything out yourself. You can preview the map before you start though.\n\n\nThis game is difficult and might make you punch your screen, but if you fall for the cuteness in this game, i think you'll be fine.

Lovely Planet leans more on the challenge and precision of a 100% speedrun attempt side of things. If you\u2019re going through the game just to play it, it can still be as frustrating as trying for the perfect run.\n\nLovely Planet is nice enough to give you unlimited ammo and infinite lives. Let\u2019s say you want to go for a perfect 3-star run. First off, you need to get it done fast. While you\u2019re getting it done fast, you\u2019ll also need to work on your shooting. While you have all of the ammo in the world at your disposal, you are dinged for poor aim. You\u2019ll need to work on the motto of a sniper with the \u201cone shot, one kill\u201d thought process. You may want to work on your platforming skills as well since there is a lot of jumping in Lovely Planet too.\n\nIf you\u2019re just looking to do a simple romp though the game, you\u2019re still up for a challenge. The game starts to place bad guys around corners or put a few of them with itchy trigger fingers all looking and waiting for you to come out of a door. The jumps can be a little difficult as well since the jumping is almost so precise that it feels a little too strong. It takes some getting used to because most games have been focusing on realism and all of a sudden Lovely Planet says, \u201cjumping should be more fun!\u201d\n\nScore: Meh...\n\nWhile the \u201cMeh\u2026\u201d rating may feel a little harsh, it just accurately reflects what this game makes me feel. I realize that it will be around the $6 mark, but even still I can\u2019t say it\u2019s personally worth it. If you\u2019re looking for something to speedrun and set world records against the Steam community or just want to have a tutorial in FPS mechanics, then you may find some enjoyment here. If not, I would say not to bother. It\u2019s got the depth of an Angry Birds game with better gun mechanics than some modern FPS and that\u2019s about it. I\u2019m not sure if this feeling is what they were aiming for, but if it was they nailed it on the head. At the same time it\u2019s just not for me.

The controls are butter smooth and shooting isn't all that bad, though the lack of crosshair really hurts the game overall.\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOMLaSZy_6A", "timestamp_created": 1409043988, "timestamp_updated": 1409043988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11867688": {"recommendationid": "11867688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011749653", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480446212}, "language": "english", "review": "Take super meat boy, make it a shooter and sprinkle with kawaii", "timestamp_created": 1409017993, "timestamp_updated": 1409017993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11867681": {"recommendationid": "11867681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097410050", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510086013}, "language": "english", "review": "I saw this game and was really hyped to play it, but after purchasing the game and downloading it, I haven't been able to run the game.

The game starts off easy, and dying is quite forgiving. Every level has a maximum yield of three stars; One for beating the level, another for beating it within a time limit, and one for having 100% accuracy.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will most likely find yourself redoing levels over and over and over because you missed a shot, or you weren't quick enough causing you to not get all three stars. There are basic mechanics in the beginning, and as the game progresses, there are much more complex ones. It really tries to teach you how to play the game during the whole game without too much obvious tips.\n\nNow for the bad of the game.\n\nSadly, the game doesn't feel as if it is made with all the effort the developer could have put into it. The first thing you will find is that the game doesnt have settings to change mouse sensitivity, or even a way to rebind keys. There is also no cross hair for your gun, which can be frustrating considering you are striving for that 100% accuracy. There isn't much else to do after the game is done, making this game pretty straightforward to complete. \n\nIf you are looking for a game to just try and complete without any worry of how many lives you have, or if you just want to try and challenge yourself by completing every level, this is a good game for you. It has a ton of secrets in it, and the achievements work just fine. If you don't like games that can be frustrating, or games that have no storyline whatsoever, then I would recommend looking for another game.

I love the soundtrack, its the real motivator in this game for me.\n\nThe controls are fairly basic, although when you enter the game you have extremely slow sensitivity, this can be fixed by going into the options and scrolling down the list of options, Speaking of which I like their unique user interface although it can be a little weird at first I like how you have to tilt your head to understand it better :].\n\nOverall I think this game is definitely worth buying, its worth every cent, and I'm not sugar coating one bit (\u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "timestamp_created": 1407798189, "timestamp_updated": 1407798189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11647662": {"recommendationid": "11647662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089867935", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445118158}, "language": "english", "review": "This, the quirkiest and indiest of shooters, is a wonderful emotional roller coaster that picks you up as soon as it puts you down. A Super Meat Boy-like twitch FPS with the artstyle of Katamari Damacy, it is a happy, deppressing, and angry game with hours of gameplay. The baddies explode into hearts when you kill them, the flowers on the grass are just little hearts, and dying causes you to respawn in a fluffy burst of blue stars. The music and the pastel color scheme are also among the many things about this game that are on the same tier of happy as the cutest of cat videos. \n\nThen you get to world 2. Hell freezes over and you begin to lose your way. Fragments of your soul disappear each time you die and restart a level. You kill the same baddies countless times. Time ceases flowing as you enter a purgatorial state of mind, begging for everything to just end. You die before the end goal and stall in introspection. You begin questioning your entire life, everything you have done that let you to this game, to wish for success at every attempt and have your hopes crushed in an endless cycle.\n\nBut as you come back out of your mind, you see that the game is still there on the monitor before you. You hear that music is still playing, hearts are still fluttering, and a curious, pastel-banded planet still floats in the background. You press on through the weaboo-imagined landscape, happy as ever, as if no mind trip ever happened. Repeat this cycle until you either quit the game or amputate your middle finger from perpetually holding down the 'W' key.\n\nBest emotional roller coaster 2014.", "timestamp_created": 1407734869, "timestamp_updated": 1407734869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11645265": {"recommendationid": "11645265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027874850", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407182998}, "language": "german", "review": "I really enjoy playing it, its a fresh mix!", "timestamp_created": 1407715740, "timestamp_updated": 1407715740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11644206": {"recommendationid": "11644206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001114039", "num_games_owned": 765, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474877367}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will eat your soul", "timestamp_created": 1407708998, "timestamp_updated": 1407708998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11633344": {"recommendationid": "11633344", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983662248", "num_games_owned": 814, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407700112}, "language": "english", "review": "To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it sometimes made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery page.\n\nGameplay: Lovely Planet is a game that can most easily be described as, \"You got Super Meat Boy in my FPS!\" The level design largely reflects on Super Meat Boy's level design ethos in that levels are pretty short, typically lasting around 15-20 seconds, but are packed with plenty of obstacles to make things challenging. These obstacles range from friendlies that you can't shoot or else you'll end the level, apple launchers in which you have to shoot the apples before they hit the ground, baddies that can shoot homing shots which you have to shoot out of the air (don't worry, it's a lot easier than it sounds), as well as plenty of other obstacles. Worlds one through three are quite a bit of fun; in fact, there was really only one level that I didn't like out of these first 62 levels.\n\nThen comes World 4. I'm just gonna be blunt; World 4 is stage memorization central. Why? First and foremost on the bad design checklist is thick fog. Seriously, designers, limiting the player's vision is not a good way to create challenge; it's just a quick path to frustrating the player. There's also plenty of points in this world where you pretty much have to take shots in the dark to be able to complete the level (See Level 4-20 which the designers had to be high to think was a good idea). Whenever you consider that a condition for completion of the game is 100% accuracy on all stages, this really becomes one hell of a frustrating experience. Second on the bad idea checklist for world 4 are shots that literally come out of nowhere. No, that's not just the fog fooling you; these shots literally come out of thin air (obscured by the fog, of course), and you can't see them when you look forward at the stage before attempting it. The only saving grace for the average player is that these stages are among the shortest in the game, but for the completionists, this can be the worst world, as some of the par times are [i]ridiculously[/i] strict. Worlds one through three took me 30 minutes, 50 minutes, and 60 minutes to complete respectively. World four took over three hours and even then I didn't 100% the world.  As for world five... world four has put me off too heavily for me to want to play the game anymore right now. Maybe in a couple of months.\n\nMaybe world five will be the big comeback from world four. I sure hope so. Again, worlds one through three were excellent, save for that one stage. It's just too bad about world four. 7/10.\n\nStory: Not really any here, so I'm not gonna bother going into detail about it.\n\nGraphics: The game sure does look great; at least, until world four where everything becomes terrible and fog. Man, though; world four really is an absolute blight on this game in nearly every respect (even in music, but I'll get to that later). But anyways, at least for the worlds that are actually good, the game really does look great. It's certainly a game that'll look great ten, maybe even twenty years down the line. You can't say that for a lot of games. As for the technical aspects, the game says that it runs at a solid 60FPS, and I can verify that it does indeed run at a solid 60FPS. No lag spots whatsoever. Also, thanks to the simplistic nature of the graphics, you can run this on pretty modest hardware. So yeah, the graphics side of the game was definitely not a disappointment. 5/5.\n\nSound: Only the OST to talk about here, and - *sigh* - yes, the world four song is the weakest of the bunch. Apart from that, the OST is excellent. Calum Bowen sure did a great job with this one. The tracks are sort of like if you mixed Ape Escape's OST with any Katamari OST. Very catchy, very quirky, and just very good. As for the sound design, it uses Engine of Whimsy +10. Good stuff. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/0/5/5; 8.5/10. Man, if it weren't for world four, gameplay would get a 9/10. Everything just went so far downhill in that world. Oh well; I'll be editing this review later on when I play world five, so maybe it'll give it a shot in the arm to bring it up to 8 or something. As for now, my advice is to play worlds one through three and then stop.", "timestamp_created": 1407701724, "timestamp_updated": 1407701724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11631909": {"recommendationid": "11631909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043720429", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436370423}, "language": "polish", "review": "For me Game of the Year", "timestamp_created": 1407694809, "timestamp_updated": 1407694809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11631068": {"recommendationid": "11631068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009967116", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411133130}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u304c\u5730\u5473\u306b\u9ad8\u3044\u7684\u5f53\u3066\u30b2\u30fc\u3002\n\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17\u3068\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306f\u307e\u308b\u3067\u584a\u9b42\u3002BGM\u3082\u4f3c\u3066\u308b\u3002\n\u66f4\u306b\u8b0e\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4ed8\u3002\n\u4eca\u5e74\u767a\u58f2\u3057\u305fFPS\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u306f\u4e00\u756a\u597d\u304d\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1407690767, "timestamp_updated": 1407690767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11628629": {"recommendationid": "11628629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036440660", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454490351}, "language": "english", "review": "The glorious lovechild of Quake and Katamari.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1407678073, "timestamp_updated": 1407678073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11628483": {"recommendationid": "11628483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017167209", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424000597}, "language": "english", "review": "This is -- beyond a reasonable doubt -- a hidden treasure among video games.  I haven't been this engaged and had this much fun with a video game in a long time.  It's very challenging while not being relentless.

The goal of each level is to shoot all the enemies (and certain objects) that are strategically placed throughout the course all in one go.  There are no checkpoints.  If you die, you start the level over.  Completing the level with proficient time and gun accuracy awards you with an extra star.  The game's difficulty increases at a moderate pace and each level offers a unique challenge.  New game mechanics are thrown in at certain points along with new enemies.  You may get stuck on a level now and then but you don't feel hopeless.  You learn from each failure and feel like you are improving as a player.  The gameplay is complimented by the visuals which manage to be quirky and charming all while being extremely simple.  The music fits right along with the art style with an upbeat tempo that puts you in a good mood.\n\nMost AAA titles these days have not given me the amount of enjoyment I've gotten from this game.

Well, shooting immobile things has never been such a challenge. Wanna play the game casually? That's fine! Wanna take it a step further and go mach speed to earn world records? Go for it! I feel llike the game has an insane amount of replayability due to the fact that despite the levels being quote-on-quote linear, you can basically take your own route to complete them. The only requirements are that you kill every single baddie and not necessarily in a specific order, so you're free to develop strategies to complete any level as fast as possible. Even if the game looks very primitive and simple, it's challenging and rewarding. I've spent around 3 hours and reset around 500 times to get the world record on 1-5 and that's a rather simple level. It gets much, much tougher (I'm looking at you, apples.) and levels get longer, so if you're going for that WR, you'll have to get some extra patience, because you're going to see the words \"Look ahead\" and \"Start\" many, many times.

I've already put 5 hours into this game and barely gotten halfway through it. What's the best way to describe it? An FPS Puzzle/speedrun game? This is a game about shooting weird square enemies and other crazy looking stuff in the face with precision and speed, all the while incorporating platforming and twitch reflexes. And you do this listening to one of the greatest videogame soundtracks I've heard in years, it's very reminiscent of Katamari Damacy. In fact, the aesthetic of this game has already been compared to Katamari Damacy many times, and I totally agree with it.\nIt's weird, it's quirky, it's challenging as hell and it will punish you for the slightest mistake if you're going for all the stars in a certain level, but you'll also just keep coming back. This is 'just one more try' in it's purest form. The game appears to have about 100 levels and has a pretty balanced learning curve; if you're a perfectionist, getting all the stars in this game is gonna take quite some time.\nI have to say when I saw video of someone playing this it didn't blow me away. This is DEFINITELY the type of game you have to play for yourself to see what's so great about it. It's bliss. When you finally get the perfect run, it's like entering a zen state.

There's a pretty clear path through each stage yet it seems each (if not all) have easily missed shortcuts and other tricks that shave seconds off each run. Its frantic, restart-as-soon-as-you-miss mechanics works so well in reinforcing the drive to improve your time.

Of course, these mechanics compound in the later stages becoming downright sadistic at points. \n\nI'm disappointed by the lack of leaderboards as the world record just doesn't give nearly enough motivation to improve.

It's an addictive FPS where the objective is to shoot every baddie in the level and complete it as fast as possible all while bunny hopping across the treacherous terrain like a maniac. The levels typically can be completed in about 20 seconds and this is where the game taps into the same nerve for efficiency as Super Meat Boy, where you'll complete a level and say \"I didn't do that well enough\" and do it again. You'll be rated on both time of completion and accuracy and the game continuously brings in bombastic, insane mechanics such as apples that launch into the air and cause an instant fail if they aren't shot before reaching the ground. It's brutal in difficulty as everything is a one hit kill, but entirely fair.\n\nCounteracting the absolute insanity of flying apples and projectiles is the aesthetic. It seems indie devs are starting to move onto turning the low poly graphics of the 90s into a visual style much in the same way as 16 and 8 bit graphics have been. The closest game I can compare this to visually is the Katamari series. Everything has a quirky, colourful aesthetic to it with delightful bouncy music by Bo En. This is a world made out of origami floating inside a PS1 while you're on LSD and it's absolutely amazing. Best of all, it will run on pretty much anything.\n\nThis game is extremely cheap and if you're a fan of FPS games and want something different, you'd be a fool for not picking this up.", "timestamp_created": 1406931659, "timestamp_updated": 1406931659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11511752": {"recommendationid": "11511752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072349096", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408644024}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything I every wanted.", "timestamp_created": 1406926675, "timestamp_updated": 1406926675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11510626": {"recommendationid": "11510626", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992004028", "num_games_owned": 2152, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432896194}, "language": "german", "review": "So sieht das Ergebnis einer wilden Liebesnacht zwischen Super Meat Boy, Katamari Damacy, den Gl\u00fccksb\u00e4rchis und einem typischen Egoshooter aus. :D\n\nhttp://www.ladebalken.net/artikel/im-test-lovely-planet-steam/", "timestamp_created": 1406921160, "timestamp_updated": 1406921160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11509989": {"recommendationid": "11509989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008216668", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469560048}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing artwork, amazing music, amazing gameplay.\n\nSimply wonderful", "timestamp_created": 1406918007, "timestamp_updated": 1406918007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11509498": {"recommendationid": "11509498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025047503", "num_games_owned": 542, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504282805}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una ida de casta\u00f1a en toda regla;

Those two words sum it up. Oh? You want to know why?\n\n[url]http://youtu.be/2cizOpJycc8[/url]\n\nFine! So Lovely Planet; just what is this bizarre looking, and named game? In simple terms, it\u2019s a time trial first-person-shooter, with amazing music. \n\nMany might get all giddy over the colours, and yes, the game is certainly colourful. Employing soft pastel-like colours up the hooha. \nPersonally I think it\u2019s the music that makes this game. It\u2019s beautiful, fun, energetic; and it makes you want to go faster, play more and just had a very good time.\nThe music is simply amazingly, I just can\u2019t get enough of it. As I play, I want more, I need to get more, so I need to play more, get deeper into the game and keep on going.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat faced paced, while remaining delightful, and this is exemplified by the fact that the game runs really well. It\u2019s fast paced, smooth, and will wreak havoc on you if you twitch with a sensitive mouse.\n\nThe developers claim it\u2019s designed for 60fps, and they\u2019re certainly telling the truth. The mechanics, and gameplay need to be smooth and respond to reactions well.\n\nIn the game you just have to save the lovely planet from some nasty buggers. Who all happen to be pink. How dare such a colour invade and disrupt the harmony of this lovely world!\nEliminate them; all. With your trust semi-automatic block thrower, as you run and ballet jump over obstacles and deadly pink goo.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much else to say, I simply enjoy this game. I suck at it, horribly so. Yet I enjoy it.\nThe colours, music, and gameplay mechanics blend together really well and leads to an enormously enjoyable experience.\n\nJust play it, buy it and play it.

Everywhere we look for entertainment or relaxation reminds us of the discord and disorder seen more and more through images of violence and confrontation. Where do you turn when you want to get away from the realities of the world we're being reminded of every day?\n\nOf course everyone enjoys the challenge and hyperactive action of first person shooters but as some of us grow older we tire of their melodramatic, heavy handed, and needlessly intense nature. Could it be possible to have that same action in a more refined, artistic, and abstract style? [i]Lovely Planet[/i] is exactly the kind of shooter to bring us this sort of peace so needed in an entertainment industry fueled by glorified aggression.\n\nLike a series of condensed blasts of [i]Unreal Tournament[/i]'s frantic chaos rolled up into a [i]Katamari Damacy[/i] world of simple origami aesthetics and uplifting pop-folk melody, this is definitely a game for the open minded.\n\n[i]Lovely Planet[/i] has a very esoteric and eastern feel to it with it's outgoing style and upbeat pop melodies composed by multi-talented musician Calum Bowen, giving me nuances of saturday mornings as a youth watching Japanese children's programming on old VHS my Grandparents would tape and mail. While this is obviously a very personal feeling of nostalgia, there's a different form of it each player will end up discovering in their own way and tied somehow to their own past. If that reminiscent feeling isn't there for the player initially, it will be a new memory engraved into their mind in the same way our favorite things as a child stick with us.\n\nDespite the heavy Japanese overtones from the bits of stylized text and the simplicity of it's cute and attractive design, the game was actually created by Delhi based QUICKTEQUILA and the bridging between cultures by this up-and-coming developer gives the surreal nature of it's atmosphere a touch of authenticity.\n\nBeginning your journey into this [i]Lovely Planet[/i] is almost overwhelming, assaulted with bright and stupefyingly cheerful audiovisuals. You're presented to an abstract world of random and seemingly unrelated trinkets and collage of colorful shapes,  sitting somewhere between the mysterious indie charm of [i]Proteus[/i] and the otherworldly grandiose of [i]Katamari Damacy[/i].\n\nAlthough the attractive and charming visuals may ease you into a false sense of ease and comfort, the game is no pushover. It features a very progressive learning curve that keeps you on your toes and constantly alert. The stages require finesse as you dance around a well choreographed ballet of bullets.\n\nThe first world titled simply 'City' gets you into the motions with some short and mostly linear pathways sprinkled with some adorable visual design through bright colors, odd decorations, and an onslaught of peculiar words and phrases in Japanese strewn about. Beating this first handful of levels is a lightning quick affair where each attempt will be over before you even realize it, leaving you craving the next hit of fast paced shooting and jumping action.\n\nThis pace quickly changes as you enter the second world and on as the levels begin to twist and turn into more complex patterns. Different enemies and obstacles appear forcing you to think quicker before every jump or turn of a corner, and new increasingly peculiar tasks become prevalent from protecting your distressed looking blue companions to shooting down cartoonish apples before they plummet to the ground. The obstacle-course like stages just get harder and harder, you'll begin retrying more and more, and you'll slowly become consumed in the competitive spirit of the World Records shown at the end of each stage.\n\n[i]Lovely Planet[/i] will cause you to wear out your restart key as you mash it mercilessly to conquer that one seemingly simple stage and in good time. You'll eventually beat these difficult and meticulously planned later levels and instantly get a feeling of satisfaction, which quickly turns into the crush of defeat as you're shown a world record only to realize you are still seconds from being the best.\n\n[b][i]Lovely Planet[/i] is a game with roots in culture, art, and the essence of what 'fun' used to stand for. It proves that art games don't need to all have the same boring or pretentious gameplay, and can be just as engaging and fun as anything else out there.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1406264862, "timestamp_updated": 1406332957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 408, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.888842", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11395661": {"recommendationid": "11395661", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996399162", "num_games_owned": 635, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406170107}, "language": "english", "review": "In some parallel universe where FPS games arose out of cute pastel platformers with geometric shapes and dodgable projectiles (instead of shooting monsters and zombies with chain guns while collecting key cards), this would be that genre's Super Mario Brothers.

I'm sitting in my living room playing \u201cLovely Planet\u201d for review purposes and junk. It's pretty adorable; that's my first impression. I'm running around a world that could easily be confused with \u201cKatamari Damacy,\u201d shooting little red squares and pins, rushing to reach the pink and purple flagpole that signifies the end of each short burst of a level. With every victory I'm shown my time, accuracy, and the stars I've earned. I finish each level in a few seconds... at first. \n\nAs I progress this cute little game takes a sinister turn. Suddenly I have to deal with innocent geometric dudes I can't shoot, platforms that disappear should I linger a moment too long, and giant apples I have to shoot before they hit the ground - all while bouncing and dodging (and screaming curse words so vile and bizarre that they haven't been conjured up, not in this plane of existence, anyway. Only in \u201cLovely Planet\u201d).\n\nRemember that level in \u201cCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare?\u201d I think it was called \u201cMile High Club\u201d or something punny. Yeah, this whole damn game is that level. There are no screw ups, no second chances. I've never clutched a controller so tightly, a fact made all the more disturbing because I'm playing a game with a color scheme straight out of the Teletubby-verse. \n\nThose with weak constitutions should avoid this title as the catchy music and rainbow explosion background will literally drive you to slavering madness as it mocks you; taunts you. You'll replay any given level a dozen times, each death increasingly unfair to you. Your shouts of disbelief will slowly transform into maniacal, sobbing laughter as you come to realize you're the devil and sinner in this Kafkaesque Hell of your own making. And finally, with victory nearly in your desperate, grasping reach, your sweat-slicked hands will betray you and you'll fall to your death. \n\nAnd then you'll click retry. \"Lovely Planet\" is endearing, unapologetic in its challenge, and fun to play. This game has heart and charm usually absent in your standard 'tough as nails' fare, and it is a refreshing change of pace. For twitch gameplay enthusiasts and fans of the wonderfully weird, I can't recommend \"Lovely Planet\" enough.", "timestamp_created": 1406148887, "timestamp_updated": 1426589415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 235, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862358", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11370670": {"recommendationid": "11370670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081395790", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407120486}, "language": "english", "review": "Having played the game up until the first level of the second world, here's what I have to say:\n\nI have no idea what the story is,\nI have no idea why I'm doing what I'm doing,\nI have no idea what anything is,\n\nbut I like it.\n\nNothing seems apparent in the beginning, however, slowly but surely, you get a good feel for what's going on. The gameplay is solid - one part FPS, one part platforming. Both parts perform well, and while there are enemies hiding around every corner, somehow you feel like it's your fault if you die. Even though you may not see an enemy at first, you will see one of their bullets whizzing by your head, and that usually gives you enough time to react. My only gripe here is the cherry bomb - once it hits the ground, you have to restart the level, and it's a bit jarring at first because you have to experience it a couple of times to understand what happened and why.\n\nAs for level design, well... it all seems really repetetive. That's really all I have to say that's negatie, though. You play one short level after another, and there after you beat a level, it gives you your time and a 'record' time for you to beat. After enemies are introduced, it's your job to exterminate them. Miss one, and you have to start the level over. Concept is really simple. Difficulty curve is slow, if not spot on - new mechanics and enemies are gradually introduced to you so you have time to get used to what's happening.\n\nGraphics-wise, everything is simple and polygonal, however, that just helps to boost the aesthetics. The environment is colorful and cheery, with bright pastel-like colors. The music is a nice touch as well - not fast, but still cheery and upbeat, fitting in quite nicely with the environment.\n\nSo should you get this game?\n\nIf you're into FPS games like CoD and Battlefield and such, no, this game is probably not for you - you will not be offered a high-octane competetive FPS, as that is not what this game is about.\n\nHowever, if you want to relax and have some fun without the competition and fast paced gameplay, go for it.

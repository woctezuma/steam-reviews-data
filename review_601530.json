Still, there is enough diverse content to keep fans of the genre satisfied.\n\nAll that is fine. The game's core flaw is its storytelling. The story is an ambitious weaving of two narratives (one of which is steeped in South Asian lore) via reincarnation. That sounds like it [I]could[/I] be great, but unfortunately the dev team's skills are not up to the task. The end result is an emotionally confusing field of narrative debris. The many cut scenes are well produced, but in the end they fall flat because the context is weak. I almost never want to skip cutscenes, in any game, but Dakarta really tried my patience.\n\nAnother flaw is the game engine: annoyingly slow movement between scenes and general clunkiness.\n\nSo, thumbs up, I enjoyed this, but see lots of room for improvement.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515052811, "timestamp_updated": 1515052811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515845", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39029656": {"recommendationid": "39029656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124609711", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515021616}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game!!!

The visuals can be adjusted in the game's menu option.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even if it is simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's menu option as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are four different difficulty game modes to choose from: Casual; Advanced; Expert and Custom.\n\nThe notebook keep tracks of the progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates that there are certain tasks that needs to be completed at certain locations within the game. The interactive map is automatically given at the start of the game.\n\nThere is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place. The inventory panel is stationary.\n\nThere are some interactive items in the game. Some of the interactive items may require extra components before they can be interact with. All interactive items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consists of the following: Shadow items; Find pair items; Traditional word lists. Most of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interaction. Some of the hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game's extra feature section.\n\nThere is an optional mini game: Match 3. It is only available during hidden object scenes.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game's extra feature section as well.\n\nThere is a collectible in the game: Memories. They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find.\n\nThere are morphing objects (beyond objects) in the game. They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find as well. \n\nThere are forty different achievement that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that needs to be completed before they can be unlocked.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be access only after the main story is completed.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter;  Bonus Hidden Object Scenes; Bonus Puzzles; Wallpapers; Concept Art; Soundtrack; Prequel Comic Book; Game's Strategy Guide.  Most of these extra features can be access only after the entire game is completed. The game's strategy guide can be access anytime during gameplay.\n\nThere are ten different trading cards to collect. You only get five of those trading cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading cards: Purchased from the Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its' Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to certain extent. The replay value for this game is low.

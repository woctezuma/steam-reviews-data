While this VN might not be long by Japanese standards, it took me full two evening to complete it and I was pleasantly surprised with the story variation and the quality of content it offered.\n\nI will maybe start by addressing a few obvious concerns. First, the game indeed features a childish crush between two very young girls, but never crosses the line into uncomfortable territories - everything that happens between them is really cute and innocent and the romantic ending offers an epilogue set a decade later, with some very, very mild \"sexual content\" (also known as a kissing CG). There's really no reason to freak out.\n\nSecond, while the aesthetic might be diabetes-inducing, it's a well-written and compelling little story (although obviously comedic and at times pretty absurd because of that), that should be satisfying for even more demanding, mature readers, if they're not allergic to cute things. It has a completely different tone that most of Ebi-Hime's work, but it's still very well done, \n\nThird, it's pretty serious about it's main theme of sweets and food, but doesn't go overboard - it didn't bore me with long scenes of preparing meals and \"foodgasms\" like some anime series did in the past.\n\nAll this combines with fun characters and gorgeous art really made it a satisfying, relaxing experience for me. There are things that could be criticized - like Rie being a bit too mature and smart for a second-grader, some grammar mistakes and minor errors or the somewhat forgettable music.

Unfortunately, I didn't have quite such a good experience with Strawberry Vinegar. The formal, stilted dialogue that worked well in Asphyxia's Romantic poet-inspired world is just bizarre in the mouths of modern adults and children. In Rie's case she's meant to be unusually mature for a child, but even a precocious 9 year-old isn't going to say things like, \"Spare me your sentimentality\", or \"A neat little sophism that encourages the importance of family meals.\" It would be *slightly* less weird if the main characters were at least teens, or if people found the way she talked hilarious or cringeworthy, but she's taken completely seriously.\n\nRie is a fairly classic kuudere type who sometimes comes off as more bratty than charming. Her behaviour is rarely called out unless you're *so* awful to people you get one of the many bad endings. This is especially noticeable with her attitude toward her stay-at-home dad. His treatment in the narrative is grating, with an uncomfortable refrain of \"get back in your gender role.\" Rie frequently references his lack of self-respect, including to his face, and at one point says his apron would be \"perfectly fine\u2015if you were a woman.\" Really, Rie?\n\nThe rest of the writing is a mixed bag. Rie and Licia are genuinely adorable together, as are Rie's parents, who make an odd sort of beta couple. The culinary writing is a bit lacklustre\u2015this is no Chocolat\u2015but the sheer variety of food makes the eating segments some of the most enjoyable. It helps that the artist did a great job on the CGs. On the flip side, the story can't quite seem to decide what tone it wants to take. For something about a little girl making friends with a demon through the joys of food, the story dips into weirdly dark territory. There are multiple endings where you can actually die, and at one point Rie's mother randomly waxes philosophical about the horrible origins of Rie's name and how having children is self-centered. (Thanks, mom?) There's a jaded edge to the narrative that's jarring against the goofy baking shenanigans, and the two sides never reconcile into anything cohesive.\n\nMy main problem is the slow pacing. The same jokes and character interactions occur over and over again without adding anything to the story. Rie overanalyzes *every* line anyone says, which interrupts the dialogue and drags things out even more. Overthinking things is part of her character, yes, but that doesn't make it any more enjoyable to read her umpteenth internal monologue. By the time I got to the romantic climax of the best ending, I just wanted to hold down the skip button.\n\nTL;DR: If cute girls and tasty-looking pictures of Japanese cuisine are all you're after, Strawberry Vinegar will suit you just fine.

It's a nice little game about a nine year old girl, far too mature and cynical for her age, who gets forced into cooking for a little demon. The writing is great, providing both charming characters and fun humor, as well as descriptions of food that makes you want to try eat the screen. As a slice-of-life VN it works really great, and the epilogues were surprisingly rewarding. (Wish there was more epilogue, I want to see even more of that romance.) \n\nOne thing I personally would want to highlight is the parents of the main characters and the relationship they share. The mother and father are living in a BDSM relationship that seems to impact every aspect of their everyday life, something their daughter notices and reflects on. The father is really submissive, and basically functions as a cute housewife living to serve his mistress. The childs perspective on their parents BDSM relationship is really interesting in itself, and her insight provides some character growth to her parents. I really wasn't expecting this from a yuri VN that seemed to only be about fluff and food, but I adored what I got.\n\nOne of my main personal negatives would be the age of the main characters. With characters as young as nine years old I found it hard to relate to the romance. However, with them both being far too mature for their age it never felt like they were as child-like as you would expect children who actually were nine, so that could really help those of us who have a hard time relating to romance between kids. (And the epilogue is fantastic, which totally helps. Did I mention the epilogue being good?)\n\n(For anyone ever planning on making their own game like this:) The user interface can't seem to decide on whether to call the settings for \"Preferences\" or \"Options\".

While not long, it is stuffed full of beautiful art, cute characters, delicious food, and good feels.  I caught some bad ends early on and while that could have been frustrating under most circumstances, the way they were delivered made me realize that I had to think about how my character would act for each choice, as a gloomy reclusive 9-year-old girl.  That realization helped me feel more invested in the characters and in guiding them well.\n\nThe CG art is beautiful and plentiful, featuring some of the most beautiful hand-drawn renders I have seen.  The character sprites are expressive and varied.  The music, while it doesn't stand out, suits the scenes and events perfectly.  The characters themselves are interesting and engaging, although they may not be as easy to identify with for someone not familiar with anime tropes.\n\nI chose to play one game \"day\" per real day.  This made the individual play sessions no more than an hour, but each day as work wound down I found myself looking forward to getting home so I could play again.  I do strongly recommend this game.\n\nHowever, despite the high production values, at a release price of 10USD I feel the game would be better served listing a few dollars cheaper, due to its brevity.

The demon says to stay at her home for 6 days (as apparently there is only 6 days in hell, not 7). They both get to know each other, first they start to hate each other, but later in the VN, they start to love each other and show affection to each other. I mean, it even gets to the point where you think a Yuri scene is about to pop up any moment\u2026.I mean there are some that do, so don\u2019t be disappointed [spoiler](I definitely bought this for the plot, right?)[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Graphics: 9/10[/b]\nIf you have read the Visual Novels\u2019 Asphyxia and/or The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns you might be familiar with the graphics, as they are made by the same people. The artwork really shows bright images of the girls and the environment they\u2019re in, they did a great job in terms of the visuals in this novel. The drawing of the girls doesn\u2019t really follow the same \u201canime-like\u201d appearance as other VNs, which felt unique in its own way, but it also felt \u201cout of place\u201d for me as I wasn\u2019t quite used to it at the beginning. \n\nBut overall it delivers a nice artwork for the characters and the environment, great job on this one. \n\n[b]Storyline: 8/10[/b]\nI have already mentioned some of it above. But in terms of \u201cin depth story\u201d it doesn\u2019t go far and long, in fact this VN has really fast pacing and really quick character development, so if you wanted a long, in depth story VN, sadly this is not for you. But for the others, it delivers a nice empathises on both of the girls as they go on about their day. Also, to mention [spoiler]Rie[/spoiler] made her first friend EVER! In her life, that is of course the demon she met, who broke into her home and started eating cookies\u2026well, I guess you can also make friends that way huh, who would\u2019ve thought. \n\nOverall, the novel shows us a story of two girls who show love and affection to each other as the VN progresses on and it portrays their everyday life and show their own personal character development. \n\n[b]Sound: 4/10[/b]\nNothing of the amazing to hear in this novel, there is only ever so many soundtracks until you start hearing the same ones that you heard 2-3 scenes ago. However, some are really nicely done, but I wouldn\u2019t say all of them are of \u201chigh quality\u201d though. Some of the soundtracks don\u2019t even fit particular scenes, but eh, what can you do?\n\nOverall, the soundtrack is quite a let-down. It doesn\u2019t offer much for the reader as some don\u2019t even match the scene.\n\n[b]Gameplay: 9/10[/b]\nThe VN offers the basic options in the menu which could alterate your VN experience. It at least has the SHIFT + TAB overlay support which I really liked, but it only worked when you had a high enough frame rate (Between 30-60 FPS), otherwise it wouldn\u2019t function, or sometimes it would work, but it would lag the game or lag the overlay. \n\nOverall, it only offers basic options and gameplay aspects. But this is enough for this kind of VN.\n\n[b]Price: 10/10[/b]\nAt \u00a36.99 this is a great price for this VN. Any higher than \u00a310 would not have been worth buying at all. This is great to see as many VNs of this length are overpriced despite offering the same features, I\u2019ll give this VN full marks here.\n\nOverall at the price, you get what you pay for, it\u2019s not too low or too high. This is a great price point for this VN.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nIt is a decent VN with good artworks and a taste of Yuri. That is all I can say for that one. I can only recommend the VN if you are into fast paced stories, cute girls and VNs in general. This is NOT for the \u201cserious\u201d reader if you know what I mean. \n", "timestamp_created": 1455121393, "timestamp_updated": 1455121393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565590", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20681237": {"recommendationid": "20681237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031164269", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453087927}, "language": "english", "review": "I wasn't sure what to expect when going into this game, but I honestly enjoyed every minute of it.

The visual elements is provably the most distinctive feature in the particular visual novel I absolutely love the artwork and art style by Silly Selly the artist of Strawberry Vinegar the art is beautifully detailed, and it is very expressive which is very different that most visual novels out there. CGs, CGs of food and sprites are all extremely detailed detailed to the point where the CGs of food looks so delicious that I wish I was the one eating them instead of reading about them being eaten.[Warning \u2013 do not play when you are hungry.]\n\n[b]Audio -[/b] As you can see the music used in this visual novel [strawberry vinegar] are all named after food and my particular favorite is \u201cchrysanthemum tea\u201d.

I personally really enjoyed this visual novel with its cheerful tone! For those familiar with ebi-hime's previous works, which are generally more dark in tone, this VN may seem quite different in terms of style but I was not disappointed for sure. I'd sum this VN up as silly cuteness, food scenes making me very hungry, and fluffiness that made me melt~\n\n[h1]Thoughts, story wise:[/h1]\nStrawberry Vinegar follows the life of Rie, a young girl that is quite sarcastic, cynical, and sassy as we can see throughout the VN. (At age 9, she's read [i]The Capitalist Manifesto[/i], Adler and Kelso, 1958.) One day she finds an intruder in her house stealing her cookies, who is none other than the young demon, Licia. Through some strange circumstances Licia ends up staying with Rie's family for a week, learning about human customs and eating lots of food, described in exquisite detail, accompanied with amazing artwork by Silly Selly.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=595423904\n\nRie's parents are a very endearing couple, and we see the four of them (Rie, Licia, Parents) interact in their daily life. Rie and Licia get to know each other better, and depending on Rie's choices during the game, there may be romantic feelings between Rie and Licia. You can even die in this game though, if you anger some other demons... Overall the story is lighthearted and gave me quite a lot of laughs, with some extra cute fluffy scenes, and made me very hungry during the food scenes.\n\n[h1]Thoughts, game play wise:[/h1]\nThis visual novel features 5 endings (or 6?) with multiple branching storylines - I finished one route and went for another and was pleasantly surprised that they did indeed quite branch out with lots of content I hadn't seem in the other route. Overall this isn't a very long game, about 5 hours for my first route (romance), There are quite a few extras, such as author's notes and music, as well as CGs (FOOD screenshots!)\n\nOne thing I think worth mentioning though is that the light coloured font and the also light coloured text box made it a bit difficult to read initially, so I had to take some time to get used to it and it was better after reading for some time.\n\n[h1]Final thoughts:[/h1]\nI enjoyed this visual novel, between the cuteness and food, Strawberry Vinegar brought a smile to my face. For those that came to this game from Ebi-hime's previous works such as Asphyxia, just a heads up though this game is much different in tone. Ebi-hime is an excellent writer, so reading this visual novel was a pleasure and the artwork is gorgeous, perfectly bringing out the personalities of the characters. If you enjoy VNs in general, or lighthearted, cute ones in particular do check this title out.", "timestamp_created": 1452797588, "timestamp_updated": 1452813152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804368", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20491166": {"recommendationid": "20491166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074249779", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452644016}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really cute and gave me tons of warm feelings.

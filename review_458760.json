Solo dos personajes, en una peque\u00f1a nave, son los ingredientes necesarios para conseguir una poderosa trama emocional que no dejar\u00e1 a nadie indiferente. Sin embargo lo comentan muchos usuarios y es verdad, no es un t\u00edtulo casual ni para todos los p\u00fablicos, en el sentido que para disfrutarlo es totalmente imprescindible: Leer bien el ingl\u00e9s y tener gusto para larga lectura, la ciencia ficci\u00f3n y el tema de las IA's\n\nGr\u00e1ficos y Tecnolog\u00eda >>> POBRE + 0,5 puntos\n\nMucho novel pero poco visual; contraste entre fondos de naves espaciales hechos a 3D con gr\u00e1ficos 6G y un artwork anime para el personaje que ver\u00e9is dibujada (la piloto artificial). Los primeros son correctos para una novela as\u00ed y ambientan bastante, eso s\u00ed, como fondos est\u00e1ticos. En cambio la chica tiene un dibujo correcto que quiere ser bonito pero que le falta algo para cargar con todo el peso que tiene en la historia. Ese arte gr\u00e1fico tiene en todo momento sensaci\u00f3n de quedarse escueto, sobretodo comparado con la inmensa cantidad de texto a leer, y no justifica el peso de 631 mb que ocupa el juego.\n\nHistoria y Niveles >>> BIEN ! + 1,5 puntos\n\nPalinurus se esfuerza mucho en tener una buena historia, por que sabe que es el \u00fanico punto con el que cuenta y el que justifica su creaci\u00f3n. En muchos aspectos el juego es como leer un libro, las ilustraciones est\u00e1n ah\u00ed pero si no estuvieran nada cambiar\u00eda. Eso significa que s\u00ed, la historia contada es de buena calidad: Tiene un planteamiento eficaz y que genera inter\u00e9s, y un desenlace extraordinariamente poderoso que sorprende por su intensidad y los sentimientos que despierta. Pero el desarrollo central se pierde un poco por las nebulosas del fr\u00edo espacio y puede ser algo tedioso, demasiado detallista. Hay mucho texto, mucho, se intenta disimular entregando pocas l\u00edneas en cada clic pero para contar la misma historia sobraba un poco de metraje.\n\nNo pierde calidad por ser tan largo pero s\u00ed puede dejarse algunos lectores por el camino; debes considerar que yo soy alguien que juega visual novels, que adora la ciencia ficci\u00f3n del tema en concreto que trata la historia y aun as\u00ed estoy reconociendo que puede hacerse un poco pesada por la parte de en medio. La historia necesitaba elecciones para el jugador? Hm comprendiendo el final entiendo que no las pusieran. Eso s\u00ed, maravilloso el personaje de Budapest, han hecho un enorme trabajo de concepto con ella y su evoluci\u00f3n durante toda la trama. Realmente es ella (la I.A) el n\u00facleo vibrante de todo el juego y lo que m\u00e1s val\u00eda tiene. +0,5 de valor a\u00f1adido por conseguir hacerme empatizar tan profundamente con ella.\n\nM\u00fasica y Sonidos >>> OK + 1 puntos\n\nMuy desigual en ese aspecto, con buenos temas de ambientaci\u00f3n en algunos puntos, m\u00fasica cl\u00e1sica en otros, y a veces temas que pueden ser molestos para seguir la historia aunque eso es m\u00e1s culpa de la edici\u00f3n que del propio tema musical. A veces un bucle de un tema muy corto dura muchas l\u00edneas de texto, haci\u00e9ndolo pesado, cuando en realidad el tema no es malo de per se y es muy adecuado a lo que se narra.\n\nControl y Jugabilidad >>> BIEN ! + 1,5 puntos\n\nSolo necesitas el rat\u00f3n, como es obvio. Palinurus tiene los t\u00edpicos controles habituales de todas las visuals, avanzar y retroceder los textos, creaci\u00f3n y carga de puntos de guardado que funcionan perfectamente, posibilidad de mostrar el texto m\u00e1s o menos deprisa seg\u00fan el gusto. Una pregunta hago: \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 se puede elegir detener o continuar el modo r\u00e1pido nte las elecciones... si no hay elecciones que tomar? Motor predise\u00f1ado? Aparte de eso no he encontrado ning\u00fan problema en el motor del juego ni en la generaci\u00f3n de textos, es un juego bien construido.\n\nIntegraci\u00f3n en Steam >>>  OK + 1 puntos\n\nNo tiene logros, ni cromos, ni marcadores, el producto queda un poco virgen como arrojado a Steam sin m\u00e1s. Muchas otras visual novels gratuitas tienen algunos logros, soy consciente que no hay toma de decisiones ni nada que premiar pero hubiese sido ideal un \u00fanico logro de haber le\u00eddo toda la historia, o un logro m\u00e1s de visualizar cr\u00e9ditos o artworks. La raz\u00f3n de que esto es un problema es que Steam no contabiliza como \u201ccompletados\u201d juegos que no tienen logros aunque hayas superado todo el contenido. Sin embargo valoro mucho el hecho que sea totalmente gratuito, tiene razonable calidad si consideramos eso \u00faltimo.\n\nCONCLUSI\u00d3N FINAL >>>  5,5  Aprobado y Recomendado\n\nSi fuera un cuento, un libro o un libro digital Palinurus tendr\u00eda una nota bastante m\u00e1s alta. Queda corta por querer aportar un entorno gr\u00e1fico y sonoro que no est\u00e1 a la altura cuando la historia realmente no pide m\u00e1s que negro sobre blanco y una imaginaci\u00f3n bien nutrida. La historia es buena, merece MUCHO la pena conocer a Budapest, y el final es de enorme calidad pero llegar a \u00e9l es largo y puede hacerse pesado a los casuals. Siendo gratuita, no hay raz\u00f3n para no tomar ese viaje y perderse, con una bonita compa\u00f1\u00eda, entre las estrellas fugaces del vasto espacio inexplorado.

Pero la gran diferencia entre un libro y esto es que la novela visual cuenta con dibujos estilo anime (principalmente inmoviles) y mayormente decisiones que hacen cambiar el final (aunque no es una regla, por ejemplo esta carece de decisiones)\n\n[h1]De que se trata?[/h1]\nPalinurus es una novela visual (muy buena) de sciensa fiction que transcurre en 2500s en el cual estas en una nave de 1 persona viajando hacia \"Alpha Centauri\" con una Inteligencia artifical peliroja (lo mejor) llamada Budapest. en el camino, tu nave espacial se va a la p*ta por ciertos accidentes y terminas varado en espacio inexplorado.\n\n[h1]La Recomiendas?[/h1]\nEmociones=Me gusta bastante leer Novelas visuales y esta me atrajo bastante. Los creadores hicieron un buen trabajo tratando de darte diferentes emociones, muchas veces vas a reir, entristecerte, te vas a desesperar, en ese apartador es lo mejor que trae esta VN\nGameplay=El Gameplay en la VN no es muy abierto. Mayormente es elejir decisiones mientras lees. Lo triste es que esta experiencia carece de decisiones dejando lo que ya en si no es tan abierto en algo tan cerrado que el final siempre sera el mismo. y para los que no hablan ingles, lamento decir que la novela visual es 100% ingles.\nGraficos=Los dibujos son bastante bonitos, pero repetitivos. Se nota el exfuerso pero los dibujos no cambian, se van repitiendo y solo se cambian pocas cosas como si esta feliz, triste, llorando, sonrojada y cosas asi. Mayormente Budapest esta de frente, de perfil o tocando la pantalla tactil de la nave. Aunque como dijen son muy bonitos los dibujos y realmente me enamoro el sistema de dibujado\nBanda Sonora=La banda sonora es simplemente hermosa, aunque los personajes no hablen ni siquiera te afecta devido a que en el fondo hay musica dependiendo del momento, mayormente hay musica de piano del siglo 18 y 19 que da un aire muy sactifactorio\nHistoria= Por ultimo la historia, en si nunca jugue una novela visual que tuviera una historia, siquiera parecida. Todo era mayormente maquinas que podian enviar mensajes al pasado, Asesinatos imprevisto por un parasito que probocaba descomfiar de todos, simuladores de citas con chicas que les hacen bulling, etc. Pero nunca jugue una que se tratara de quedarse varado en el espacio con una inteligencia artificial. Es bastante innovador pero... Para ser sincero es Demasiado corta.\n\nLe doy 7/10 puntos. Es muy pero muy buena, pero es corta. Demasiado corta, en la historia pasan [spoiler] 30 dias [/spoiler] pero realmente estas con Budapest nada mas que [spoiler] 2 dias devido a que solo te fuiste a dormir 2 veces en toda la jodida VN [/spoiler] no tiene mucha logica, aparte me gustaria otro final, fue muy raro y todo paso muy rapido pero bueno. es una buena VN que te recomiendo jugar si entiendes un poco de ingles, en mi caso soy bilingue haci que no me afecto, Bye bye.", "timestamp_created": 1492631066, "timestamp_updated": 1492631066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31187494": {"recommendationid": "31187494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160951115", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492391014}, "language": "english", "review": "fuckin hell, now i'm sad.", "timestamp_created": 1492378904, "timestamp_updated": 1492391044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31167950": {"recommendationid": "31167950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202608968", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502762879}, "language": "german", "review": "Es ist wirklich toll.

The story prompt seems simple on paper, but what distinguishes this simple concept from other simple VN concepts is that the quality of writing and storytelling in this VN in particular is exceptional.  Perhaps to make this more impressive is knowing that the main part of the writing was done in a month for NaNoRenO.\n\nAs a brief aside to the music and art quality of the game, I would like to say that both are adequate.  I found the music overall to be rather mundane, but there are a few pieces that, in my opinion, fit excellently with the mood of the setting and enhanced the reading experience.  Likewise, the art quality would from time to time switch from mediocre to cute and pretty, but felt somewhat inconsistent, and sometimes unfitting to the mood.  Overall, I would say the music and art were supplements to otherwise exceptional writing.\n\nWhen I say the writing is exceptional, I don't mean to say \"exceptional for a VN writer in particular,\" but exceptional in the sense that someone (though, there were multiple writers) with a firm control of English rhetoric and emotional storytelling wrote it.  The short story is filled with humor and serious moments that flow naturally and realistically.  At points in their space-travelling, the Passenger and Budapest would frequently tease each other in the same way friends (or perhaps a romantic couple) might, and it feels quite heartwarming and funny to watch the frivolity.  These brief intermissions of happiness, in my opinion, do well in emphasizing the dramatic moments of the game, which feel very heartfelt.  You feel a sense of identity in the deuteragonists of the story and it's easy to form an emotional connection to both of them.  This is the mark of a story largely written by a skilled contemporary writer in the making.\n\nAs a brief digression on the emotional impact of the game; even the main develop of Renpy made a comment on his Twitter of the game's sentimentality: https://twitter.com/renpytom/status/583849407474458626\n\nThe game is not too long, perhaps an hour's length - shorter if you're a quick reader.  I've refrained from detailing any specific plot points at the risk of making them less dramatic or humorous.  It's a VN that's well worth your time, and I hope will at least make you ruminate about the themes in the game, which are fairly straightforward but otherwise thought-provoking.

Not exactly the most original premise in science fiction works, but the game does a good job of its take on it.\n\nThe art itself is passable and pleasing enough to look at, even if it is more standard fare. I thought that the music could have been better as some of the tracks were rather grating to listen to on a loop during certain parts of the game.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this visual novel.

This effect, unfortunately, goes well out the window the second one puts a jarringly obnoxious thumpy-thump beat to it. Add to this some understandably limited production values and the single LOUDEST music mix I have ever heard in a product released to Steam, and neither my ears nor headphones were off to a good start with this \"game\".\n\n   Fortunately my computer does have a volume switch, and the music tracks after the initial one were actually quite charming and refreshingly beat-free. But they do say that first impressions linger, so it's a good thing I'm such a mutha-fuckin' professional and can get past such things, at least enough to be \"mostly objective. Mostly\" (that's a recent and direct quote from a lecturer/marker of mine in the arts degree I'm currently studying; so if SHE gets to be labelled a \"professional\", so do I, fuck you all).\n\n   Immersion-breaking beginnings aside, the rest of this product is actually quite aesthetically-pleasing. The artwork is endearing if unexceptional, and the writing is unusually good for a visual novel. \n\n   Yes, you did hear me right: unusually good FOR A VISUAL NOVEL. You wouldn't expect it, but honestly, most of these things read like they were written by an especially precocious fourteen year-old (at best), or someone for whom neither English nor written communication skills are a forte (at worst). Unless your visuals are going to switch with every single click of a button, you'd best make sure your VN writer's way with words is at least comparable to that of a lower-level fiction writer. This VN certainly has no problems in that area, and even boasts moments of genuine wit and charm (\"it was essentially a primitive form of an escape pod, except roomier and less reliable\"). Very nice work, indeed.\n\n   So what about the \"story\" itself? Hmmm. Well, first up, you need to know that this ISN'T an \"interactive novel\". It's a \"kinetic novel\", in which you don't make any choices; you just click through a story which unveils in a completely linear and non-negotiable fashion. A slightly spiffier way of presenting a short story or novella, in other words. Obviously this will be fine for some, and a deal-breaker for others. \n\n   As long as you're not in the latter category, the story of this VN is, I'm pleased to say...actually pretty darned good (if a tad on the sappy side)! I suspect it's not too much of a spoiler to say it has something to do with the \"nature\" of Artificial Intelligence, and the curious effects of the cold, vast loneliness of space...so if that sounds like your cup of tea (or, er, tube of space-paste), there really isn't much to hold you back. Especially when the frigger is FREE.\n\n   All told, not a bad little effort at all (I even found myself getting the teeniest bit teary by the end)! Just be sure to have the volume turned way DOWN at the start, lest your precious eardrums should be decimated by the initial ill-advised bursts of ruthless techno-thumping.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1481375207, "timestamp_updated": 1481642229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679516", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28287110": {"recommendationid": "28287110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045381877", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 1610, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481373777}, "language": "english", "review": "Palinurus is a pretty decent visual novel that I would recommend free VN fans check out.

It's really well written and clearly there was a lot of effort put into it. It's a bit slow at the start but is very descriptive, sets up the story very well, and is definetly worth reading through. Can't wait for the next addition / arc / sequel to this game. I recommend this game for anybody who likes to read phscological mystery and horror, someone who likes deep stories that bring out different emotions, and even if you just like a somewhat slice of life style VN you'll like this.

Going through it the first time:\n\n-Don't need to care about saving. Able to have about 6-7 pages of free slots to save progress, if it is saving at parts you think are crucial for endings (out of approx. 20 pages; 4 slots per page).. Which you should not do. Give up, or cry about caring when you shouldn't have. There is a saying, \"Know when to quit\" among anime. Respect your favorite animes. Do not save progress unless you got trigger fingers, okay? +Gently rubs your back to support your future self's heart and lungs to be able to not be constricted anymore.+ You'll be okay that way..\n\n-Don't be scared to skip through any suspected unimportant parts, just get to the ending. SEMI-HARMLESS SPOILER: once after you and your friends go to the amusement park which you ought to not care about for the time you waste on reading about everyone's adventures and god knows I only made the main character talk to people in hopes his chronic depression will go away (which was meaningless because it's fake depression in the ending I got).. THEN you can care about your choices since there will be evidence/choices crucial to learning some form of plot that used to be obscured on whether there was one or not.\n\n-Great insight is rare but assuringly out there (better insights are JUST when the screen is dark and the mc be thinkin'), and then there's the royal sht about what the character thinks and you LIVE IN HIS BRAIN, figuratively.. it's bad how you read what he thinks DURING social times that aren't dark-screen-setting'd. Even he gets tired of the way he thinks, but it's a neccessary shadow to his insanity. Love his best friend, too. Blonde and almost the same as you-- AND more entertaining to others AND relatable? What's his deal?\n\n-I wanted to play this game because .......... it seemed like it had a psychopathic character I could be that kills people and loves doing it. Beautiful ending (mind you I got a \"Bad Ending\" that I loved and was like, wut, it's bad? Tho it wasn't bad enough to make me complete. I cri) for what I wanted, but it's hardly worth the effort to get to it. The effort in playing the first time is just the stress of playing an otome w/o knowing how to get an ending properly. Ohh that's right, now that I remembered how I used to play romance novels, \n\nJUST CONSULT A WALKTHROUGH GUIDE. READ LIKE TWO--THREE STEPS IN THE FUTURE AND JUST GLANCE HOW TO GET TO SOME KIND OF ENDING, GOD PRAYS WITH ME YOU WON'T FIND A SPOILER THAT WAY (the most infuriating part that gives me hell over this game that it'll even be fine to read spoilers) .. SO LIVE THROUGH ANY OF THE ENDINGS BY GETTING THROUGH READING ALL THE FLYING MAGICARP ON SPEEDIAL 'TILL THE GOOD PARTS!! DON'T WASTE TIME. BE LIKE SONIC. FORGET THE \"FK, I THINK I MISSED SOMETHING CRUCIAL\" .. SAVING PROGRESS WILL NOT MATTER UNLESS IT IS HOW YOU CHANGE THE ENDING ACCORDING TO THE GUIDE(?). YOU DO NOT DO THE GAME PUBLISHERS ANY GOOD BY THINKING \"Oh, I should get the game instead of watching a playthrough for this kind of good or bad ending\"--\n\nWATCH SOME YOUTUBE THAT IS SILENT AND DOES AN ENDING PLAYTHROUGH LIKE AN OBEDIENT, SYSTEMATIC CHOBIT. DON'T GO THROUGH HELL. IT WILL STILL BE FUNNY AND HAVE ITS MERITS.\n\nYOU DON'T LAUGH ALL THE WAY THROUGH, YOU DEAL WITH A MEDIOCRE HORMONAL FRIEND GROUP AND PETTY BULLIES. YOUR CHARACTER IS A MENTALLY UNCONFIDENT WIMP EVEN IF HE ACTED LIKE A BOSS. He's better if you make him reject everyone, but at the same time he's so wrong it drives me crazy. \"Just do (this)\" and \"Why does it now seem like he is perfectly the kind of protagonist people SHOULD hate for being too dense to his harem that badly wants him, acting like he hasn't felt puberty?\"\n\nIt isn't good for an intelligient older audience. It isn't good for a younger unintelligient audience. It mixes those two things together and is a confused interactive novel. Then again, most are. It's the pieces of its gems that count, and nothing should be judged personally. Except when it makes your livilihood surviveable.\n\n2.) Going through it a second time: ...

Come with me\n\nThe art is amazing, especially the cell phone scenes and the scope things with the laser tag and role playing. \nThe music was ayt, after 10 hours of play time I dont have any of it on repeat in my head (looking at you DDLC) so thats subjective.\nMan. The writing. Man. \nYou play Yama Ishiwhatever, the epitome of depression and snark. Like I get it, the existential nihilism and the depression and all that, its crushing at times. But it isn't necessary all the time, AND 10 FUCKING YEARS ago his sister died so that's his reasoning??? 10 YEARS!!!  \nBeyond the over-played cynicism, there is the weird feeling you don't usually get from this VN, that feeling of knowing better than the protag. This Ishicuck is an absolute idiot. How was Yahiko ever doing anything but saving the guy from suicide??? How about actually saying what you need to?  Asking questions? Instead of imploding into your selfish suffocating ninny-mode with no reprieve except to have an episode? Like who writes this shit?\n\n\nI love a depressing route, don't get me wrong, but does the protag have to be such an insufferable idiot? That Shouji suicide was only one event of many that stuck out to me.\n\nVery quickly I want to mention that I skipped (TAB toggle/ CTRL hold) large portions of the early game, only really paying attention after choices and skimming the log stuff. It's got too much fluff/shit. Like get on with it already.\nBesides that, I get that build up is important, and can take time, so it's not an auto demerit for me, just a heads up that you can skip a lot of fluff in the early half of the game.\n\nAnd finally, I spent 2 hours getting Bad Endings, only to find there is only one way to get a \"good\" ending (frustrating) and even in that, there is more shit (Rui still fucking dies wtf) so like what was the point of the last 3 hours? I understand again, that the shock value CGs are all the rage this last year and a bit, but that final Rui CG is so so unecessary. \n\nAnyway, assuming there is a sequel, I only really gave a shit about Lizzie and Rui, and one of them is dead, so count me out even if it is free. \n\nI ain't some grizzled animetiddies pundit fam, I just like a good story. And this is a free game, I mean it's a good VN. I just personally hate the way the protage behaves  90% of the time (like vomit inducing) and the way the story goes is kinda cliche \"dun dun dun everyone dies no happy ending\".

Its characters, story and music are all top notch, and for the very low price of \u00a30.00 you should really give it a go.\n\nThis review will not contain spoilers - as a result, some truths may be slightly bent to inform you without giving too much away.\n\nTL;DR:\nStory: 10/10\nCharacters: 9/10\nVisuals: 9/10\nMusic & Sound: 10/10\nVerdict: It's free and only 15 hours long, go play it already!\n\n[h1]Story - 10/10[/h1]\n\nIn Lucid9 you play Yama, a high school student enrolled in a private Japanese academy for wealthy kids. At the beginning of the new school year, students start to go missing. Meanwhile a freelance detective approaches you in the hope of solving what the police cannot - how and why these disappearances are taking place.\n\nThe game is around 15 hours long, and mainly focuses on the mystery at hand while also fleshing out each character (especially Yama and his past). The story is executed very well, building suspense while keeping the identity of the perpetrator hidden until the very end, but there are definitely enough clues to figure it out yourself if you pay attention. Yama's shaky past and his psycholigical problems that arise from it make the story much more interesting later on. There is also a fair amount of time spent on the daily life of Yama and his friends, but no scene is superflous - they all help build the character of the main cast and their relationship to Yama and each other.\n\nThere is one good ending, with many bad endings depending on your choices in the final stages of the game. Although you can gain favour with four characters, Lucid9 isn't a dating sim - Rui is always the 'main girl' of the story and the other characters acknowledge this very early on. This helps focus the spotlight on her, which I think works in the game's favour. The deduction sequences are also fun and don't feel forced at all. Overall the story and how it was presented was fantastic.\n\n[h1]Characters - 9/10[/h1]\n\nDespite there being loads of characters to cram into a very short story, Lucid9 pulls it off perfectly. Firstly, Yama's character is not that of a generic protagonist - he can be lazy and harsh but this makes his character much more interesting. His development is timed well and progresses steadily throughout. His psychological problems and his past are relevant and didn't feel like a gimmick to liven up the story. The other four non-romance characters - Masato, Yukari, Ryouta and Shigure - are also developed, albeit much less. I found Yukari's development to be one of the most interesting in any story, and each character definitely has their own unique charm and story (even if they can sometimes be a bit annoying).\n\nThe four girls are also very unique, and you will definitely be enjoying the scenes with at least one of them. I especially liked the developing relationships with Airi and Elizabeth - they felt natural and well written. Akira's scenes are full of energy, Misaki's are sensible and relaxing, Lizzie's are sharp-witted and funny, and Airi's are very calming. Each character's theme was also very well crafted. Finally, Rui's character didn't have that much development and was pretty generic, but she did not bring the rest down at all. I personally found Rui and Misaki to have the weakest characterisation and development - hopefully this is remedied in the upcoming sequel, which should have separate routes per character.\n\nSide note: As someone who has participated in several student drama groups before, I was very happy to see how accurate they made the drama club at the academy! I really got into the two scenes set there and Akira, while slightly over the top, was someone whose escapism I could somewhat relate to.\n\n[h1]Visuals - 9/10[/h1]\n\nThe visuals in this game are amazing. There was clearly a lot of effort put into the character sprites, backgrounds and CGs. The style is distinct, but not enough to  be jarring. The happy scenes were bright and cheerful and the violent scenes were gory in all their glory. There was a perfect mix of light and heavy - they definitely didn't keep it PG when it came to the violence. However, I felt that in a few CGs the faces were strangely proportioned and some backgrounds seemed to be intentionally blurred.\n\nNote also that there is no sexual content, although due to the graphic nature of some scenes and some disturbing scenes and themes I would recommend not giving this game to someone under 12 years old (also, the deduction sequences would go right over their head).\n\n[h1]Music & Sound - 10/10[/h1]\n\nThe music in this game is absolutely exceptional. The generic happy/sad/emotional/mystery themes were great, but what really stood out for me was the character themes. Each character's theme is perfectly suited from them, from Airi's music box and Elizabeth's piano to Shigure's mysterious theme with sirens in the background and Akira's upbeat and energetic melody. The other two outstanding tracks were the title theme, and one other theme called 'Depths' that plays during certain scenes. Depths in particular is a real emotion inducer in context, and it works amazingly.\n\nLucid9 has no voice acting, although an English voice pack is in the works. Also, the soundtrack can be downloaded for free from Steam (it will appear as a .zip in the game directory).\n\nHighlights of the OST:\n[url=https://youtu.be/IWfMivU4sAY?t=0m0s]Urban Disturbance[/url] (Title theme)\n[url=https://youtu.be/IWfMivU4sAY?t=5m02s]Hustle & Bustle[/url] (Rui's theme)\n[url=https://youtu.be/IWfMivU4sAY?t=17m11s]Empty Eyes[/url] (Airi's theme)\n[url=https://youtu.be/IWfMivU4sAY?t=15m17s]Adult Talk[/url]\n[url=https://youtu.be/IWfMivU4sAY?t=1h14m38s]Depths[/url]\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\n\nAs Lucid9 is a visual novel, any old potato can run it. You should have no problems no matter what you're running it on. I myself played it on a laptop with integrated graphics and it was perfectly smooth.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nIf you're still reading, then scroll to the stop of this page and download the game already!

Everyone was hyped about it showing itself as a cutesy dating sim that turns sour at the end, but obviously they haven't seen Lucid 9.\n\nThis game is a thrill to play. Like DDLC, the beginning is a bit mundane, with adorkable characters, except the protag already has some pessimistic views about the world and obvious trust issues, etc, etc. *But*. That doesn't mean all the twists were any less surprising. *This* is what I call Psychological Horror. I seriously doubted myself with the choices presented at the end, because no choice was good and I know it. It's a VN and I have save files, I know, but if a game makes you suspend that belief and makes you actually sit and think about this the way the protag would, you just *know* it's good writing.\n\nAnd it is *incredibly* good writing. The characters' personalities show in their use of vocabulary and it's amusing to see how the same character (the protag) could change his tones to fit with the people he's talking with. You know, like real people do. And it didn't come out as if the protag is a stupid one-dimensional character.\n\nOverall, I loved Lucid 9.

This was my very first visual novel that I was determined to read from the start. The poor male protagonist has his work cut out for him, if he wasnt heading for a nuthouse already, he surly will be in one by the end of this story. I finished this visual novel ages ago however never wrote a review for it, so here we go. I'll try not to spoil the story too much!\n\nMy pros, cons and overall review.\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n- Storyline. It has so many twists and turns that it even gets you as the reader thinking what's gonna happen next, who is it? It gets you on the edge of your seat, you're right there with the group of friends solving the mystery together. It's spectacular!\n- Character Development. The charaters were definitely well written along with some sort of backstory but it's just enough to understand the suspicions of the protagonist as well as his friendships with the other characters.\n- Music. the music is done well, it really sets the mood. Happy, sad, sinister, you name it and it's there making you feel the same dread as the protagonist.\n- Art Design. Magnificently drawn, characters, backgrounds and pictures. They're nicely done for such a dark story.\n- Routes/Story Length. The story is nice and long, a good amount of hours will go into reading and there aren't any drastic choices until the end so don't worry about messing up half way and needing to restart. You'll be ok. Even the ending is nice and long and it gives a semi-heartwarming \"good\" ending although dont expect it to last very long.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n- Routes. There are SO many routes so you'd be spending hours upon hours trying to get them all (especially if you want the achievements).\n- Difficulty. This visual novel is difficult to get by without a guide although I always use a guide for any visual novel I read as I like to get the best possible ending first before getting the bad endings. I did attempt this without a guide at first but alas, it wasn't easy especially with the puzzles you have to solve. Although the puzzles were still fun, even with a guide.\n- No Romance. I'm a huge sucker for a good romance but amidst all the death and despair there isnt a single romance going on. We know 1 of the protagonist's friends loves him however they never go on a date, kiss, talk about it or anything. It's only implied by actions made and nothing comes of it (considering the \"good\" ending, I suppose I see why but still).\n- Language. This story uses a lot of \"big words\" to put it simply, I dont consider this to be a con for me but some may consider it as such so I shall place it here for readers notice.\n\n[b] Overall: [/b]\nThis was an amazing visual novel, although not a romantic one it definitely didn't fail at being a dark mystery visual novel. The sinister elements, the happy times, the twists and turns and the all out performance was fanatastic. For my first visual novel, I do highly recommend this read, you WON'T be disappointed in the slightest.", "timestamp_created": 1509170398, "timestamp_updated": 1509170398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36049988": {"recommendationid": "36049988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023253406", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509206746}, "language": "english", "review": "Twist after twist.

This VN is a true masterpiece that deserves to outshine the majority of its competitors; DDLC just needs to be burned. But that's only a side note...\n\nThis game won't disappoint those looking for some actual effort put into their games. It's amazing that the devs put this up for free; this could easily be a paid game for the quality it was made with. Trust me, everything from the story to the music to the art is top notch; the only complaint is that the sprites for the male protagonists and the side characters aren't as polished as the female sprites, but that's a nitpick. I can't really say too much that wouldn't spoil the story, but pick it up and read for a few minutes, and you'll see if it clicks with you.\n\nThat being said, the horror tag is not a joke. While there are no jump scares or anything that might cause someone to be traumatized, there are some scenes that could easily disturb the squeamish. If the intro bothers you then you might want to stop reading, because later scenes only get worse. That being said, you should give this VN a chance. Intense scenes are few and far between, so there's plenty of time for mental preparation. Think Ace Attorney with a somewhat dark twist.\n\nAnyway, that's it.

Seeing that this game had impressive ratings and was for free, I instantly installed it to my computer. It is somewhat really hard to believe that something of this polish is actually for free in the market, especially when most visual novels that are for free tend to be more of low quality. \n\nThe story of Lucid9 starts rather slow, presenting its cast of characters and their dynamics. Due to this, the story has a large focus on showing each character\u2019s personal history, life circumstances, and how they react to the mysterious murders that surround them which is the focus of the plot. It also knows how and when to give the details of its story which helps in keeping you intrigued and interested all the way to its climax. It also can get crazy and a bit dark if you aren\u2019t prepared.\n\nDue to the story of Lucid9 focusing more on its characters, it is quite important that the character holds up well and can keep you invested in them. Each individual character appears to have their own past and outlook in their current situation that despite being a tad bit generic was still rather enjoyable. Throughout the course of my whole experience with its characters and its story, I ended up being invested and caring for them thanks to their natural, likeable and expressive dialogue.\n\nFor a free visual novel, Lucid9 actually has some really delightful visuals. It might sometimes look a bit off in some areas of the game, but for the most part they do the job right. The music really struck accord with me. With some lively music for high school life and some suspenseful music for its darker scenes, it really did a nice job in setting the tone and mood which complemented each of its respective scenes. \n\nOverall, Lucid9 was a cool experience. It knows what it\u2019s trying to do and does it very well in all aspects through its story, characters, visuals, and soundtrack. Just let yourself enjoy the experience which Lucid9 is trying to offer you and maybe you\u2019ll have a very fun and enjoyable experience.  As I stated before at the beginning, it\u2019s for free so there really isn\u2019t anything to lose but a few hours of your life. \n\nI recommend that you give Lucid9: Inciting Incident a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1502509713, "timestamp_updated": 1502509797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34158567": {"recommendationid": "34158567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408666947", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502410022}, "language": "french", "review": "C'\u00e9tait cool! ... mais la fin m'a donn\u00e9 une crise existentielle", "timestamp_created": 1502413947, "timestamp_updated": 1502429347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34061960": {"recommendationid": "34061960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280962902", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506433553}, "language": "english", "review": "Best free visual novel ?\nThe story is pretty interesting and it's pretty funny too (well it's actually dark)\n\nBGM = 9/10\nArt = 8.5/10 (Visual Novel's art style.. i like it)\nContent = 9/10 (For the quiz tho)\nPlot twist = 11/10 ( GGEZ NO RE)", "timestamp_created": 1502031659, "timestamp_updated": 1502031659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34038391": {"recommendationid": "34038391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334412521", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503232284}, "language": "english", "review": "OMG The most best free visual novel i've ever played \n\nDon't look at the review just play it yourself 100% worth your time 15 hours into the game already still didn't finish\n", "timestamp_created": 1501940359, "timestamp_updated": 1501940359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34028633": {"recommendationid": "34028633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029368135", "num_games_owned": 575, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501902689}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

I would've paid maybe $10 or $15 for it, to be completely honest. It's a high school slice-of-life, mixed with mystery/suspense, and even aspects of a psychological thriller. The art is what must've made this game free, because it was unimpressive at times. The story wasn't lacking. A perfect amount of multiple endings. I didn't necessarily get the ending I desired, but that doesn't damage my enjoyment. There were puzzle elements, though they were easy enough to complete. Made it really interactive, especially since they make you type things to advance in the game at some points, so they're required. The themes are powerful and I often saw myself applying myself to them. The subjects this game addressed consists of mental disabilty/disorder, human purpose/ability/capability, and death of loved ones. The dialogue was also very intelligible. I've mentioned how I have an affinity for rather extensive vocabularies present in games. I was forced to actually think in this game, became attached to some of the characters, and was genuinely surprised when the twist happened(find out for yourself lol). The length only poses an issue when considering replayability. It's good, but not to the point where I'll go back just for completeness. Even with the skip function and save points, it would take too long. Other than that, my qualms with this game cease. Devastatingly shattered my expectations for a free-to-play visual novel.

It's as simple as that. Don't be fooled by the fact that it is free to play, it still stands head and shoulders above your baseline visual novel experience. If the patch for part 2 turns out to be as good as the original, then I'll be forced to meet the creators in person for a nice, firm handshake.\n\n[b] There are only a few things worth warning you about, so I'll lay them out here: [/b]\n\nArt assets. There aren't many. This is obviously a direct result of the budget, and I'm personally not upset about it in the slightest. This is just fair warning for what you can expect to see. I know we all want our waifus and waifu-talking-to locations to be great in number and look one-of-a-kind, but trust me, they're plenty distinctive in other ways. (This is also a good place to mention that this is not exactly a \"waifu\" game, if that is a problem for any of you degenerates)\n\nYou will feel emotions. Sad emotions. This isn't something I personally dislike at all, in fact it's part of what makes this VN experience so great in my opinion. Unfortunately, some of you suck! A few reactions that I've read indicate that tragedy bothers people, but for a pseudo-mystery pseudo-slice-of-life, it's absolutely appropriate. Just be prepared to be hit with some dark stuff!\n\nI am writing this (and played this) before the release of the second part. If you are like me, then you have to go into this knowing that although the ending will absolutely feel like the ending to a legitimate, full game, you will most likely wish you could get into the next part of the story. Unless you are late to the party (HAHA, losers!), you will have to wait. it sucks, but don't let that stop you from playing the game we have now!\n\nThis last one almost goes without saying, since this is always a risk with VNs. the MC might not always do the things you wanted him to do, or think the things that you wanted him to think. This is mostly because he isn't just an empty vessel for us to project into. Not entirely, at least.\n\n[b] Alright, now for the good part. This is BY NO MEANS a comprehensive list of the positives in this game. Nobody has the time to read that. These are my personal favorite little things that stood out and made this VN so cool to me: [/b]\n\nEven though there are quirky weirdos, there is more or less a \"real person\" feel to your relationships with the cast. Now, I'll give you fair warning that the people themselves often have exaggerated elements, but I mean \"real person\" in the sense of how your character interacts with them. Even though they can be frustrating buttholes at times, that's how people are in the real world, too. You aren't always satisfied with what they say or do to you. You aren't always treated fairly. Not every female is gonna suck your donger (Sad, I know). You might have characters you hate, even though you really wanted to love them going in. And people annoy you with their jim-jams when you don't even wannna hear it! This might just be me, but a certain topic that few characters wouldn't shut up about was something that I had no interest in. At first I was a tad salty, but it isn't something that made the experience less enjoyable. Having conflict is important, and making the player salty isn't always a bad emotion to bring out.\n\nGOVER MECHER IS A WORK OF ABSOLUTE FUCKING GENIUS\n\nThis is for the people that have played multiple VNs before. You can't take anything for granted. This game doesn't adhere to the unspoken rules set by other games in the genre. I can't tell you how many times I was groaning in anticipation for a plot point that was either cliche or too boring and unimaginative. I'm not saying that you won't ever be able to predict what's coming next (although I think a few twists may get you), but there will probably be times when people who've played these types of games before will think \"I know what they're going to do with this, and I'm already disappointed.\" There may be a couple instances where you feel let down (I can't read minds), but if you have too many preconceptions then I can guarantee that they won't be met.\n\nYou get a bit of everything. As I mentioned before, this game has some \"slice-of-life\" mixed in with some \"mystery,\" and the two parts are merged in a satisfying way. You get time for a light-hearted goof, and you get time for some spooks. This game has got it all.\n\nLook here, kiddo. I know I told you that not every anime grill is gonna suckle on your ding-dong like in your dating-sims, but you made it this far, so here's the skinny on the situation. You will find the elusive \"best grill\" in this game. In fact, that's the best part of the mystery. You've gotta hunt for the best grill, and it won't be easy! You'll be saying to yourself \"Oh MCMECHA, why couldn't your review just TELL me who the best grill is! I'm too foolish to find her on my own!\" But you see, that's the fun part! It's not easy to find out who the best one is, because you'll want to jingle your jangles with more than one, if my playthrough is any indicator! They've all got strong points and weak points. Hell, I'm almost glad that you won't be able to choose Yahiko in part 2 just because the allure of GOVER MECHER would draw me away from the ladies!\n\nAll things considered, you seriously need to play this game. It's worth every minute of your time, and this VN deserves all of the support it can get from the fine people here on steam. So play the hell out of it and tell your friends.

I tried some so far, both free and bought ones, but none of them was slightly thrilling. When I found this VN on steam, it really catched my attention due to its tremendously high rating. However, I was sceptical in the beginning.\n\nFree? Plain artwork? No synchronisation? That sounds like a very cheap product. Not even worth my time. But hey, it's free. At least I can try it out.\n\nAnd I was proven wrong. Goddamn wrong.\n\nWhat catches your eyes immediately is the way the protagonist talks with the other characters. The verbal exchange of words and the endless witty remarks are absolutely hilarious and entertaining. If you are someone, who likes to reflect on new ways to express trivial things, likes to explore the borders of the spoken word or loves absurd dialogues, then I can assure thee undoubtely, this visually animated opus of modern literature will bestow great fortune on thee, little chap. (Note: If you liked the dialogues in the anime [b]\"Bakemonogatari\"[/b], you will surely love this one as well)\n\nThe main characters talks with every characters in a different way, depending on the situation and the story developed so far, thus creating a very vivid and immersive atmosphere. At some point, I really awaited conversations with specific characters eagerly, because you could rest assured, you will laugh like bloody hell with a cup of tea in your hand. [i]Cheerio, Miss Bennett![/i]\n\nA vast cast of characters is introduced, everyone unique with their own traits and behaviour. Of course, some of them are the typical generic characters everyone knows from animes, but some had personalities I haven't seen before. But don't let the first impression fool you. Some of the characters (sadly not all) are much more complex than anticipated and reveal their depths of their character as the plot unravels (But do not expect too much depths!! You might brake your ankle!!). To my surprise, this VN also thematized psychology to an extent, that it was not ridiculously anymore and could be taken seriously. However, I must warn you again, that the theory of Sigmund Freud or Jung are not discussed in this VN, but a basic comprehension of psychology is crucial to the understanding of the protagonist's thought and behaviour.\n\nThe story itself is mainly a composition of dialogue, comedy, mystery, thriller, and a pinch of romance and masterly switches the atmosphere at any time. Last sentence was a hilarious joke and suddenly we are terrified by new informations. Additionally, the mood of the current situation is always perfectly captured by the background music. Whether a light-hearted tune or tensed melody, whether the music relaxes you or sends a chill down your spine, it amazingly fits well the whole time. As for the lenght of VN: Holy moly, it is fucking long. And I mean FUCKING long.\n\n[u]Final words[/u]\n+ great dialogue humour\n+ diverse story telling\n+ immersive atmosphere\n+ matching soundtrack\n+ interesting characters\n+ FREE!!\n\n- No controversial drama\n- simple animations\n- No seriously, if you are still reading this review, then you don't have any excuses to NOT play this free game!\n\n[u]PS[/u]\nIf you liked the dialogues of this VN, you should really consider watching the anime [b]\"Bakemonogatari\"[/b].", "timestamp_created": 1496936946, "timestamp_updated": 1511377877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32233252": {"recommendationid": "32233252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037414020", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467328585}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the story.

WHY ARE YOU READING THIS REVIEW AND NOT PLAYING THIS AMAZING, FREE GAME?!?!\n\nI'll admit, I never tried a visual novel before, and after a binge on downloading some free ones, I deleted three out of four pretty awful ones...then the fourth one was this... Oh my gosh. For a grammar-freak like me, this game is excellent. The whole game I think I might've caught one or two--three at the most--typos. \n\nI thought the characters seemed stereotypical at first: the jock, the doofus, the love interest, etc., but they are SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT! About five minutes in I was laughing along and getting so caught up in Yama's (the main character) sardonic wit, how his character plays off his friends,  and the humor and brightness of his friends, contrasted with the dark undertones of the game's mystery. \n\nThis game--this NOVEL--compares even to my love of paper books, which is saying something. What may seem simple at first glance and hardly a mystery will fit in beautifully like puzzle pieces later on, and the characters, in which this game has quite a cast, will come alive, each with their own unique personality from each other and any other character you've met. While the puzzles are few, they are fun and stimulating (those who meet Shigure will know), and if you're ever having a bad day, this game will put a grin on your face  a minute in. Alongside the great cast, well-written story, and vibrant humor, there is also more than a handful of poignant moments and themes that will raise fascinating philosophical questions. At times you'll feel like crying, others laughing until your rib hurts at the HUMANESS of this novel, but you will always be left with a promise of hope and courage. \n\nNow enough with my praise. If you want to laugh, grin like a happy fool, and think like a genius, PLAY THIS GAME!!!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1496118990, "timestamp_updated": 1496118990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710614", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32050010": {"recommendationid": "32050010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032545549", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494997687}, "language": "english", "review": "very gud lucid9/10", "timestamp_created": 1496092965, "timestamp_updated": 1496092965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487487", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32016299": {"recommendationid": "32016299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379332021", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 188, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510421899}, "language": "italian", "review": "+ trama interessante\n+ bel sonoro\n+ personaggi carini\n\nUna VN con una trama carina, ricca di colpi di scena e personaggi carismatici!

Funny, yes, and some characters I initially liked, and others I initially didn't like, and besides the very beginning, I thought the story itself dragged.

Some might not think so much of it, some might think more, but I, for the most part, enjoy the story. The first time, that is. \n\nAlthough this is a positive review, I'm first going to point out one of more frustrating points of the game. To beat it and get all the achievements, you're going to have to go through it several times. Certainly, this can be shortened by saving at certain points, but you have to start from the beginning if you happen to miss anything early on. It may seem minor, but, as there are quite a few choices in the game regardless of relevance to the story, it can get rather tedious. \n\nNow, onto the overall review.\n\nThe art was very nice, as far as I'm concerned. It fit the story at most points, though I think some of the characters were a tad plain. Yama, for instance. He's the one you play as, but nothing stands out beyond his yellow eyes. And the yellow eyes don't even really complement him. Other characters could also be seen in the same light. Beyond this, the art suited the game. The eyes did get on my nerves, though, and not just on Yama. Also, the characters look pretty... stunted? It makes them look like children, but that may just be the effect of me looking at them too long.\n\nThe characters don't just have their looks, though. A lot of them were also good in terms of character development. Some of them could have been done better, yes, but overall I think it worked out well. To name a few of the characters that fell short, there was Natsuki Tanaka, Masato Kurogane, and Rui Hayata. One of the characters, Akira Karube, did get on my nerves. Her personality has been done to hell and back in games all across the board. For a major character, however, she contributed very little to the story. Is this a negative or a positive?\n\nNow, for the story itself... I really don't have many complaints here. I do think there should've been more hints along the way about what was really going on, and the player (reader?) ought to be able to figure out at least some of the story before it comes down to the big conclusion. It should also be worth more that the player/reader get close to certain people. At current, are there any benefits to learning about those around you? No. Is there anything relevant to the case? No. Why should you pursue other characters? Curiosity?\n\nThat being said, I did get a bit off-track there. The story is ambitious, I'll give you that, but I think it took too long to get it out there. Some scenes simply dragged on, like that carnival thing. Completely unecessary, that scene. It served no other purpose besides letting you learn some minor things about the main characters, and took too long to get past. There were other scenes like that scattered about, and it isn't very pleasant to go through them five or so times for an achievement or something of that sort.\n\nI'm just going to slide this in since I kind of forgot about it, but the music wasn't bad. I liked the main title theme, but some of the other tracks were obviously overused. Others merely faded into the background. This aside, it wasn't terrible.\n\nLucid9 was one of my first visual novels, and was altogether memorable. It was altogether an enjoyable experience that I would recommend. You'll have to tolerate a few holes (maybe more than a few...), but it can be difficult to find any game without such things. Lucid9 definitely has problems, but it isn't a bad game.", "timestamp_created": 1491538018, "timestamp_updated": 1491538018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30940031": {"recommendationid": "30940031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307739728", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491164201}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has great characters, a good plot and the art work is pleaseing to look at.

Many characters that take the stage will seem overdone at first; you have the dumb guy who thinks he's the most powerful and brilliant person ever; you have the rich girl who is intelligent because she has a standing to uphold; you have the quiet girl who is really good at video games; etc.  However, the characters evolve much further than that in their own, flawed ways that make them seem just as human as anyone you stand next to right now.  To give a fair warning though, if you are NOT OKAY with anything that involves detailed horror, turn away now.  The climax WILL scar you and it is meant to do that.  Lucid9 leaves a very deep and meaningful impact on each that reads to its end, and to add on it has many little bits of dialogue that can be missed on your first playthrough that might just coax you to experience it again.

In this game you play as Yama, a lazy good-for-nothing with quite a few mental issues. A string of disappearances are happening, all of them students from the school Yama attends which is supposed to be highly secure. You\u2019ll have to juggle your school and social life while trying to find out what\u2019s happening to the students and who is doing it. Can you do it before someone you care for joins the list?\n\nUnlike many people who found this story to be touching or sad, I found myself more indifferent and bored. The story drags on for a while, this due to the fact that our protagonist doesn\u2019t actually actively care or do anything about the disappearances until over halfway through the game. While players are fully aware that something is wrong, we experience this through Yama\u2019s eyes. A good chunk of the first game is spent just chatting with friends, taking tests and other mundane things, which is fine if this was a slice of life title. Putting that aside, the other reason why I found the game to drag on was Yama\u2019s pretentious nature. His inner monologues are long, drawn out and reek of someone trying to sound smart but failing miserably. That being said, the characters besides Yama and Rui are enjoyable and I enjoyed the scenes where you interact and get to know them.\n\n[list]\n[*][b]Yama[/b] - Our hero of the story, a self-admitted loser who looks down on almost everyone. As a main character I found him utterly annoying. The game starts with making you wonder if he\u2019s the killer or someone else is since Yama has \u201clapses.\u201d These are when he blacks out but apparently can still move, talk and perform actions. He\u2019s depressed, self-deprecating and puts up a wall to avoid showing the world how fragile he is. His best moments in the game is when he\u2019s interacting with his friends and learning to understand them.\n[*][b]Rui[/b] - The childhood best friend trope, she stands by Yama no matter what and tries her best to take care of him. She always defends him and knows most of his secrets, she\u2019s also in love with him. Wow, go figure. The game is very adamant about pushing Yama and she together, despite him not really showing any interest. All of the character\u2019s in the game push this and Rui refuses to confess because that\u2019s what the trope calls for. I also found her annoying and how she was pushed upon Yama, though I did respect her dedication to him and believe she\u2019d stay that way even if they don\u2019t end up together.\n[*][b]Misaki, Airi, Akira and Elizabeth[/b] - These are the other females in the game that go to school with Yama and Rui, Misaki is their childhood friend. Akira is Rui\u2019s best friend who is also in love with Yama. Airi is a mysterious girl who is very quiet and Elizabeth is the smartest girl in the school who is probably also in love with Yama. The game lets your choose options with them, like call or text and even hang out. You can get to know each of them and doing so makes the game more well-rounded. Doing so also doesn\u2019t matter, the game ends the same way so don\u2019t expect a cute romance with any of them like I unfortunately did.\n[*][b]Yahiko and Masato[/b] - Yama\u2019s two male friends. Yahiko is a ball of fun and laughs who is also very naive. Masato is an incredibly smart jock who is very competitive. They help round out the circle of friends often offer most of the humor present in the story. They both care about Yama very much, however Masato greatly dislikes Yama\u2019s laziness.\n[*][b]Shigure and Mr. Ryouta[/b] - The two main adults in this game, Shigure is a private detective that hires Yama to be her assistant and opens his eyes to the rampant disappearances. She is snarky and at times quite rude but is a good addition to the story and helps move things along. Mr. Ryouta is the dorm manager at the school and quasi guidance counselor. He offers Yama support and an open ear while trying to motivate him to do better.\n[/list]\n\nStory aside, everything else about [i]Lucid9[/i] is fine. You use your mouse to play the game, though there are two points in which you will need a keyboard. You can click to progress the text or put it on auto and relax, there is also a skip feature to zoom past text you\u2019ve already scene while trying to achieve other endings. The user interface is simple and offers all of the options needed for a visual novel such as the ability to hide text. One thing I did not like about the gameplay is how your choices mean very little. Other than failing the final steps against the villain your choices have no impact. Passing or failing tests is meaningless, getting to know a girl or not does nothing, you can\u2019t end up with her and in any deduction sequence choosing the wrong answer will just lead you to try and pick a different one. The ending of the story is always bad and you can\u2019t change it which I don\u2019t mind but it can be a downer.\n\nI really enjoyed the music in the game, it was cheerful when it needed to be and had great sad melodies as well. The music always fit the scenario. The game also has sound effects which were fine, though I found the phone ringing one annoying since there is at least once you don\u2019t answer the phone right away because Yama is having yet another long inner monologue. The art is fine, I enjoyed it and the character models were cute. The game has superb CG art, even of the most unpleasant thing. My only complaint is that where weren\u2019t more CG scenes. The game is rather long and I would have enjoyed seeing more of the lovely artwork.\n\nI may sound critical of the game but did like it on some levels. While some things dragged on for a bit it did build up the feeling that slowly but surely Yama was losing everything around him and it was satisfying when he overcame this. This satisfaction is probably why the lack of any happy endings hurt so much because in the end it seemed like it was all for naught. The game is free so you\u2019re not losing anything by giving [i]Lucid9[/i] a go, the developers promise more content in the future as well. For now you have Steam achievements and cards and an overall interesting experience for free.\n\n[code]This review is exclusively written for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/vnvortex]Visual Novel Vortex[/url], visit the official site [url=http://vnvortex.co/]here[/url]![/code]", "timestamp_created": 1489140336, "timestamp_updated": 1489140354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30394378": {"recommendationid": "30394378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309544693", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500050948}, "language": "english", "review": "(English is not my mother tongue, so the text below may not fit the standarts set by Jane Austin, Charles Dickens or whoever is considered as an example of good English writing. Or even the standarts set by your school teacher.)\n\nIn brief: a really enjoyable visual novel with a few \"it's-bugging-me\" issues.\n\nIn not so brief. While I haven't played too many visual novels and I suppose that there might be some diversity there, most of the ones I played were basically about \"choose a girl, collect enough love points and get your romantic ending (or possibly see her breaking and leaving or commiting suicide if you haven't got enough points)\". It was somehow refreshing to play a VN that has you do something else. The beginning seemed quite boring - while the writing style itself was (and is) good, the contents itself were not that promising, and the only thing that was saving the day for me was the humor. I have to give the writers credit for this, I laughed like crazy at the \"Yama imagines his possible future jobs\" sequence. Despite that, some hours in the game, somewhere around the amusement park part i though like \"just how much of all this slice of life is there in shis supposedly detective story\". But then the things got better, much better. I absolutely enjoyed the whole \"investigation in imagination\" sequence (orchestrated really well, indeed), the writers did their best to make me doubt my theories even though they seemed quite solid, and the climax really gave me chills (while, I've got to say it, some choices seemed quite counter-intuitive). I also liked the many little flashbacks about the previously foreshadowed and then totally forgotten things during the revelation (when a gun on the wall shoots, it's really nice of the author to remind a forgetful reader like me that it has been hanging there in the first place). At the same time... Well, OK, I'm not going to talk about the ending I've seen until there will be the others. Or I will, in brief (some spoilers here)... Sometimes you feel that the ending, no matter how bad, is deserved, and you make it so with your own decisions, and sometimes you don't. Here, I didn't. It was kinda uncalled for. Absolutely uncalled for. But OK, let's wait for the next part and then see.\n\nThe music. I was going to call it \"passable\", but, if I think twice, it is better. It is definitely doing it's job in maintaining the athmosphere, and even if I didn't like the soundtrack in general as much as I liked the music of Everlasting Summer or Katawa Shoujo, still I really liked some particular tracks, and \"Process of elimination\" was just great, really contributing to the scenes it played in.\n\nAlso, as we're at it, solving puzzles was enjoyable. Quite a good way to make the player involved, maybe better than all the classic \"say a compliment to the girl or stay silent\" VN choices.\n\nCan't say too much the visuals as I'm not an art expert. It seemed like there is too few CGs, but I suppose the backgrounds could have taken too much resources. As for the sprites, it could have really helped if, for example, when a character is said to wear a cat suit, actually have such sptite. As rare as these occasions are, if the visuals clearly contradict the written text, it is somehow damaging the thing they called a willing suspension of disbelief.\n\nSpeaking of which, the thing that annoyed me most. Dear creators, if you read it: if you have a Japanese setting, please, be consistent with it. A line like \"No, cats don't speak English\" doesn't make sense because, well, the characters are not speaking English! Even if the novel itself is written in English, it is set in Japan, the signs are in Japanese, the characters are Japanese, so the language they speak in-universe must obviously be Japanese. The same goes for the units of measurement. Even if the creators are English or American, and even if the majority of the audience are English or American, if the characters are Japanese, they use neither feet nor pounds, they should use the metric units. Anything else will look, I don't know, like a Japanese novel set in the US and featuring the American characters using koku or shaku instead of gallons and yards. Not the best idea.\n\nThe special effects, like transitions, are well done, and I have to especially praise those who made the phone calls and text message effects and the VR displays \"interface\". Really nice. The only thing I didn't like was how a character sprite leans closer whenever the said character is speaking. It seemed to me somehow distracting and not really necessary.\n\nALL IN ALL: some really good job the creators did, especially for a freeware product. I totally do not regret about the 20+ hours I spent playing, would really like to see any other visual novel from this developer and, should it be commercial, would not hesitate to pay for it, provided that it is of the same level of quality.", "timestamp_created": 1488992910, "timestamp_updated": 1489004279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30370105": {"recommendationid": "30370105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277933447", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488882256}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy moly.

I want a sequel quick!)\n* Dedection sections are very fun; the player gets to be the detective, unlike in Higurashi\n* Free to play! This is totally a steal! Very much worth the time to go through!\n* The humor is AWESOME! Written very much for a Western audience, with great puns and hilarious situational humor.\n* When it's scary, it's SCARY, but no jump-scares, more like tiny little flashes of images that put you on edge. It's all the subtle things that make this game so thrilling.\n* I very much appreciate that, while there is violence, it doesn't go over the top, like \"999\" levels of description.\n* I'm probably one of the few to consider this a pro, but the lack of gratutious sexuality as is done so often in visual novels is very refreshing. I'm so glad the creators understand that we don't need sexual innuendos or panty shots to create humor and cut some tension (I'm looking at you, Corpse Party).\n* My personal preference: I like stories that are more linear among the bad endings, like Ace Attorney or Danganronpa. \n\nConsiderations:\n* In the style of Higurashi, where the first half is filled with a lot of \"everyday\" interactions and \"shenanigans\", as I like to call them. I understand why: to bond with the characters. But there were times when I was thinking, \"C'mon! Hurry up with the mystery portions!\" That being said, the \"shenanigans\" are very fun, and the character development is very well placed and spaced out in between.

Even so, the mystery pulled me in and made me want to understand the town this school was centered in.

The pacing and building of suspense is top notch; there are several times where I thought the game was nearing its end only to draw me in and push me on some more. This goes on for hours, it's that big; which is very unusual in a free VN.\n\nThe game focuses on a group of eight protagonists: we get to know them, their backstory and character, and while the game is not afraid of re-using VN and anime tropes, it is aware of that and manages to not come off as clich\u00e9d throughout. It is here that the novel really shines: I was very interested to get to know these characters, and often seemed to know more about them than the narrator does. The crime mystery plot is also executed well. At the same time, this could never be the plot of a Disney movie: while there is a lot of (well-excuted) lightness, the game gets very dark at times, too.\n\nIt is not hard to choose those gameplay options that will result in uncovering most of the story elements, except for getting past the bad climax: remember to save when you get a phone call in the subway (you can right-click to access the menu from any screen) -- and you do need to get past it, the ending that follows is not a quick one. Apart from this episode, and a small section where the narrator perspective shifts to Riu (why was that even necessary?), story progression was smooth and kept me on edge.\n\nTechnically, this renPy game is well crafted and has all the features you'd expect: it runs windowed and works well on older systems.\n\nIf you like to read a good story, I can only imagine you discarding this game if you either have no tolerance for the high school dating sim tropes that this game employs in parts, or if it is too dark for you: you will find out about the latter in the first few minutes.

At first I did not know very well what to expect since the world of visual novels is something relatively new for me. But what I was looking for was an incredible and enthralling story through which visual novels are characteristic, and boy Lucid9 did not disappoint at all.\n\n\n[h1][i][PLOT][/i][/h1]\n\nThe plot is incredibly well written in this visual novel, I didn't expect it to be so good. The development is one of its strongest points. The story gradually becomes darker, Madoka style. Most of the characters are very well written, each has a credible personality within the story, which makes them believable. Their relationships, the dialogues, everything is natural according to their personality. I came to feel affection for them, worry, hatred, sadness. I would give it a perfect rating at this point if it weren't for some minor elements of the plot that didn't totally convince me, and because the end didn't hit me as intended because of the multiple bad endings.\n\n\n[h1][i][VISUALS][/i][/h1]\n\nAs for art, in general it is fine. It is not the best thing I have seen but it fulfills its role. The character portraits are fine, in fact there are some that I quite like. However, there are some that need a little more polishing to look good. On the other hand, the lack of variety of background images is often evident. Excessive reuse of these can lead to distraction if you don't have enough imagination. Another problem is that most of the CG scenes don't look that good. This is because in all these cases, the drawings of the characters are not well proportioned.\n\n\n[h1][i][MUSIC & SOUND][/i][/h1]\n\nThe music in Lucid9 is gorgeous, easily one of the best video game soundtracks I've ever heard. Each theme is unique and brings tonality and emotion to the situation in which you find yourself. Sounds, on the other hand, don't stand out so much, they are simply there to add relevance to certain actions that happen in the story.\n\n\nIn conclusion, do I recommend Lucid9? Absolutely. If you are enthusiastic about good stories this is an assured recommendation. In fact this is a visual novel that I'd recommend to anyone who is remotely interested in visual novels. It's really worth it.\n\nMy rating is:  [b]8.0 / Very Good.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1484684739, "timestamp_updated": 1514340829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29303417": {"recommendationid": "29303417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190649271", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502032838}, "language": "english", "review": "a great game for players how like long games [more than a week]", "timestamp_created": 1484598195, "timestamp_updated": 1484598195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29272556": {"recommendationid": "29272556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052274460", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484485554}, "language": "english", "review": "I went into this game without expecting too much from it - it's a free visual novel in a high school setting that only requires 700 mb of hard drive space.

There are some funny parts, but overall this is NOT a feel-good game.  If you are the type of person who doesn't like darker elements, I don't suggest you to get it.  Or maybe I do, just for the quality...\n\nPros:\n-Well-written, with a twist close to the end.  Of course, said twist also makes you wish the story didn't have to end up this way once you see it coming.  But that's part of the fun.\n-This hasn't happened yet, but the creators plan to completely voice-over the game.  Which is totally cool.  If you've heard the voice actor clips, then maybe you can understand why I'm so excited.\n-Really pretty background art (except for when it shouldn't be pretty but eerie.  That's well done, too.)\n\nCons:\n-The ending.  THE ENDING.  WHY.  I know that this game is technically speaking incomplete; maybe it'll be better after the rest of it comes out.  Not that the ending is badly written, necessarily; it's somewhat logical, considering how the creators plan to progress the game.  But for now...AAAAAGGGHHHH!!!\n-Some of the character poses are a little awkward, particularly when it comes to the females. It seems that the artists have a bit of a problem when it comes to drawing a girl standing at a three-quarter angle; the face suddenly appears flat.  It's not noticeable for all of them, but it's particularly obvious for Rui.\n\nOverall, this is a really good bargain for its price (which is a grand total of $0.00).

Both start off light-hearted and have their fair share of [strike]arguably[/strike] comical slice-of-life high school shenanigans, and both eventually take a much darker and more serious turn (although Lucid9 has no supernatural elements). This is not to say they are the same, but I wonder whether the creators were inspired by 07th Expansion's work.\n\nI believe this comparison already sets the bar pretty high, and trust me, the game does not disappoint. Writing is very good and each character has a very distinct voice, filled with entertaining expressions and colourful vocabulary that get you through even the lengthiest calm/comedic moments (which I am personally not very fond of). The mystery parts are also well written and visual/sound effects work well with the narrative to convey a story that made my heart race and my eyes never deviate from the screen.\n\nAnother plus of this novel is the portrayal of mental illness. It is a central topic to the story and it is never portrayed in stereotypical or negative light, only realistic. I also enjoyed their use of dissociative disorder, which is hardly ever seen in media.\n\nAs for the cons, the main ones I'd list would be the length of comedic filler, the fact that some choices seem to serve no purpose but get achievements, and the character art.

Lucid9: Inciting Incident showed up in my queue, and it instantly piqued my interest. I was surprised that it was free, but I decided to give it a try anyway. I immediately loved the game after playing through it. This visual novel is well crafted, and is definitely able to make you feel many different emotions throughout its story. \n\nTo start off, I\u2019ll talk about the characters. Normally, I\u2019m one to forget a character or two if there happen to be a lot of them. There are indeed many characters in Lucid9, but they are all extremely memorable for their personalities.  I won\u2019t go into specific details because of spoilers, but every character develops over the course of the game, and it definitely is something that is important for visual novels.\n\nThe game\u2019s overall synopsis involves a high school student named Yama Ishimoto in Japan during 2018. Later on, he is asked to be involved in an investigation regarding a chain of disappearances that have occurred at the academy. Again, I won\u2019t spoil in case someone does read this, but the mystery definitely builds up throughout this story. Though it may seem like your choices don\u2019t matter, don\u2019t make this assumption. Lucid9 likes to throw some curve balls to make this visual novel more and more interesting. \n\nIt may seem like this game is only cute, that is not the case, as it transforms into something that contains purpose. It can make you feel happy or apologetic for these characters. You never fully know these characters, and that\u2019s what makes this game different from most visual novels. You think you know everything, but in the end there are still secrets that we don\u2019t know about the characters. The overall plot and ending prove this as you experience it first hand.\n\nOverall, this game makes you laugh at the comical and happy moments, and at other moments, it makes you feel pain and may bring you on the verge of tears (that happened to me at least). If you plan to play the game, it is highly recommended that you play it without any spoilers to fully enjoy the experience that this visual novel offers. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to continue to cry obtaining the achievements in this game.", "timestamp_created": 1483302212, "timestamp_updated": 1483302212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28836442": {"recommendationid": "28836442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112155697", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483466027}, "language": "english", "review": "A brilliant mystery novel. lots of puzzles involved.

I didn't follow a guide, so if you want to look up a guide on how to get each achievement use it as you are playing if you want to get a certain ending.

There are not many decisions to be made in this game, and most of them do not really do a lot.

Most of the choices have to do with certain mystery cases that you need to solve, where there will be one \"correct\" answer and you will trial and error through all of them before you find it.\n\nI found the art quite charming and the story was interesting. I don't know the developer's fixation with death though. Parents die, siblings die, friends die, friends of friends die, etc. In most cases, I think a murder/death should be a strong element that invokes emotion; but in this case, it happens so often, and it affects so many people that you get desensitized to it. \n\nI found the character development very good, with the game spanning 13 hours so far for me. The archetypes are fairly typical, but with enough individual flair to keep the reader engaged. The mystery/action sequences are also well done, although I do wish there was a way to skip past them on subsequent playthroughs as it does get rather repetitive.\n\nI did some research and apparently the developers will be putting out the rest of the story (for free!) at some point. The amount of free content here is simply amazing. Well done and can't wait to continue the journey (and to figure out what the name of the game means)!\n\nAs a sidebar, if you liked this game, you should check out \"One Thousand Lies\" - similar art direction and goofy type of dialogue.

I have a constant feeling that the different assets of the novel just don't really work together, with character sprites not really mixing with BGs and struggling to show what the text wants them to.

Nekopara, the detail in showing who is speaking and how they are feeling during things like a phone call or a video game simulation really shine.

As you can see by my playtime it took me over 20 hours to get all the endings and achievements. This is the main reason why this [u]free[/u] game had been sitting on my wishlist for over 5 months. The other reason is that I am not into visual novels lately but once I start reading them I don't stop till I reach the end. Well, I can say I've no regrets.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nAs I already mentioned for a [u]free[/u] visual novel the story is really long. Not only that but it's really well written. There's variety of words, inversion, puns, no grammar or whatsoever mistakes(?). Not wanting to spoil the story for you I will say that there were moments when I laughed out loud (10+ times?) and other when I cried. The funny thing is I haven't done the latter in years. Literally. You can only guess how touching the story actually was. There are a few plot twists, some of which are really unexpected and I won't be surprised if your jaw drops with your mouth wide open. I will just say that this is not your average they-lived-happily-ever-after novel so prepare to turn into an emotional wreck after reading it (if you're the emotional type that is).\n\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\nThere are a lot of them. I liked some more than others but I didn't hate/despise any of them. I'd like to mention that they were all very well-drawn (which is truly praiseworthy given the fact that the game is [u]free[/u]) [strike]and I wouldn't mind seeing the waifus in the nude[/strike]. Since the story was so interesting, as if I was part of it, I felt some of the characters really close - like people who you could spend time with or share anything with. Sometimes one of them would say something stupid or odd, or both and that would make me chuckle or even laugh out loud. \n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nAs a muzical addict I've paid attention to the music. If I've said it was great that would be an understatement. Well, it sounded familiar for a moment or two (maybe because the dev(s) have other visual novels that I'd played) but other than that I really enjoyed it. At some parts you will hear the same music that you've heard earlier but it's no surpise since the novel is long. I don't say this as a bad thing, mind you. I want to donate somehow and adding a paid soundtrack DLC seems like a good idea (at least to me).\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI would have written a longer review if I wanted to add spoilers but decided not to. I appologize if I did, if so - it was unintentional. I am glad this game has achievements otherwise I'd have probably skipped it. I am puzzled at how is it even [u]free[/u] given the fact that it takes a good 10+ hours to read the whole story. I've played a lot shorter novels and I'd paid money for them. That's why (as I said) I want to donate if that is possible. I'd already done the same with 3(?) other visual novels that were free. I can't help it. I am a simple man - I read a good [u]free[/u] visual novel, I donate. So do NOT hesitate and give \"Lucid9\" a try. I assure you that if you're a visual novel fan (not the pls-boobs type) you will have a great time with this one.

And worth recommending even if it wasn't.\nWant a free introduction into the visual novel format that justifies the genre?\nIt's like getting a really nice eBook or manga for free.\n\n\n[b][u]Story & Writing[/u][/b]\nWhat has been penned by Fallen Snow's writers is a interesting murder mystery wrapped up in a familiar high school setting in Japan. It starts off in typical tropervile scenarios, but begins to throw things upside down within a few in-story days, with a climatic choice-filled encounter serving as the peak.\nUnlike some other VNs, I have never quite felt a need to skip through unread portions of Lucid9 - most of it is engaging. Story has always been a integral part of VNs, and Lucid9 doesn't disappoint.\nWriting wise, there are aspects that bug me. Firstly, you can tell that the writing is westernized and English based, despite the setting being in Japan. That's not surprising; Lucid9 is a VN of non-Japanese, international origins.\nBut when you consider suggestions that the characters are actually conversing in Japanese (strongest hint is that only half-English Elizabeth is billingual), some of the phrases, rhymes, and so on just don't seem like they'll fly in Japanese. But it's not a dealbreaker.\nThere are also current pop culture references that seem out of place in Japan. \nThat said, the story takes some meta jokes that might be silly but are good for laughs anyway. General writing is not overly flowery - it's at a level that is just nice for visual novels.\nThen there are all the characters. Each, archetypal at first glance, has at least a decent amount of depth and don't beg you to forget them with their colorful personalities, all lovable.\nChoices-wise, Lucid9 is not a kinetic, but [i]Inciting Incident[/i] is the first arc, the \"common route\", of the story. The ultimate outcome is almost singular, despite your choices, and during the aforementioned climax, there is only one way to succeed (but many variations to failure, ala [i]sound of drop[/i])\n[spoiler]The ending for [i]Inciting Incident[/i], however, is a twist. It will polarize. It already has. And I must say that I strongly respect any writer in this genre that has the bravery to make protagonist (who people may not care about) development at the expense of a heroine (who people are very likely to care about). There's a reason this isn't done much.[/spoiler]\nWhat else I can respect is a lack of fan servicey writing or situations throughout Lucid9:II. Perhaps those are reserved for the heroine arcs of the second part, but for now it is nice to see a VN that doesn't need to prop itself up in this way. But bear in mind that this is VN with some dark themes and graphic descriptions of violence. Tread carefully.\n\nContent length? Easily seven hours at minimum, and engaging enough to keep you there nonstop.\n\n\n[b][u]Artwork[/u][/b]\nLucid9's artwork has a vaguely amateur feel to it. It's not bad, per se, it just feels a bit below the expectations you might harbor if you've seen some of the more famous 'big' works. But then, fate/stay night's original artwork wasn't that professional at the time either, look how that stopped it. [spoiler](it didn't.)[/spoiler]\nYou can sort of see that the girls, drawn in softer, moe styles, contrast with those of the guys' who are prominently sharper and more defined. There are some mild clashes in art style for the drawn characters, but it's not at all as unnerving as say, Driftwood, another recent free visual novel up here on Steam.\nBeing more picky, I feel a need to complain about Misaki's alternate poses (where she is facing straight on or holding her phone). Proportionately, they look odd. And her face more so.\nElizabeth's sprites also look awkward from my point of view.\nBackgrounds on the other hand, are consistently done well and are not sources of complaint.\nAs with the story writing, fan service in the artwork is also non-existent. Whether that is a downer or not is up to you, okay? But then, fan disservice is. Bloody scenes are present. You're warned.\n\n\n[b][u]Sound & Music[/u][/b]\nFirst, I want to sound off that Lucid9 has a pleasantly surprising range of sound effects through out, including the good choice in interface blips. This is a department that some VNs are lacking in these days, especially free ones.\nWhat else is pleasantly surprising, especially for a free-to-play project, is the upcoming inclusion of voice acting (in English).\nThe music, like the artwork, has a sense of amateurism, but not in the same way as the art. To explain, most if not all the tracks sound like they were made on a home software suite. Which I expect they were. To elaborate, they are not bad compositionally (there are several composers involved here) - some tracks just sound like they were made with rather low end instrument libraries. None sound like they were made with live instruments, and that's not really a surprise, given Lucid9's origins. No, no, it's not a dealbreaker, it's just something I want to point out.\nThat said, I'd like to hear Miki's theme produced with some new libraries - I like hers particularly.\nWhich brings me on to the fact that just about every major character appears to have a leitmotif accompanying them, linking to their personalities. Elizabeth has a slightly jazzy piano number with her and Airi has a distinctively music-box like theme.\n\n\n[b][u]System[/u][/b]\nAt first glance I didn't think Lucid9 was built on RenPy, though closer examination (and finally a look at the files) confirmed it was. The interface is pretty and the main menu is foreboding, but you can still tell this is RenPy when you notice the \"Skip Mode\" prompt on the top left and familiar options in the menus.\nUnlike other RenPy games though, there is an actual backlog, rather than 'rewinding' when you scroll back, which means you cannot change your mind about a choice you've made unless you've made a save. Which isn't too bad, given the decently large number of save slots (64). I'd appreciate a \"return to last choice\" function, but again it's not a experience breaker.\nLucid9 also leverages some effects such as 'character zoom' where a currently speaking character's sprite 'moves forward', which is a nice touch. There are also clever manipulations of the interface at critical moments such as flickering text and one of my favorite small touches is the change in color of the interface at the 'darkest' moments.\nThere are also a couple of moments where you have to enter text to answer a question.\n\n\n\n[b][u]Verdict[/u][/b]\nFSS has made a visual novel that can definitely stand on its own along other western-origin entries. It's gotten all the necessities right with above average production value among its kind. Which would be true even if it was $10. But it's not - it's free! [b]FREE[/b].\n\n[spoiler]But I still don't understand why it's titled Lucid9.

Later on this will be remedied though. It also lacks diverse, multiple routes and instead has a common route with a variety of potential Bad Endings. Anything else really would be spoiler territory.\n\nFor a free game made by developers that created it in their free time, the production value is impressive. Most of the background art and character art is really good, and there are some select examples of really great artwork. Despite a large number of music contributors, the soundtrack feels unified and though the songs range from average to great, their use in creating mood (as well as a lack of music) within the game is tasteful and adds a lot to each scene and every interaction. Its UI is standard and everything works, so no faults to speak of there.\n\nIn terms of the actual canon content, the pacing is questionable at times and the characters are a little bit tropey but they all still exhibit their own distinct personalities. Some more than others. Though I understand the reasoning for the balance choice between slice of life and mystery/thriller/horror elements I think that it can be a bit skewed and at times works to the story's disadvantage, but it also makes for some great build-ups and climaxes. Maybe I'm stupid, but the mystery remained a mystery to me up until its reveal, and that was very satisfying to me. Each scene and every \"chapter\" so to speak flowed well but there are bits that feel like they drag on.\n\nFrom a more critical perspective the characters are fairly shallow but the plot writing is done well; everything feels like it adds up which isn't easy to do. Thematically it feels hackneyed, processed, and clunky, but despite all of these it never actively took away any notable amount of enjoyment for me. It just didn't add anything.

With that in mind, it didn't take me too long to hop on board. The only reason I hesitated was because I thought this was some harem visual novel which only slightly focused on the murder aspect. I'll admit, I wasn't far off on that. Not to say they didn't go into great detail with the mystery, but it felt like a very minor aspect that no one REALLY cared about until the end of the game.\nGreat characters, though I'll admit some are rather stereotypical. Still, they manage to make it work for the most part. The novel takes place in Japan, and there was only one part of this that bothered me. The fact that the English girl is apparently speaking Japanese and using British slang at the same time. As a bilingual individual, I can assure you that language does not work that way and that no one would be able to understand you or would be extremely confused. If you're saying \"bloody\" in another language, the connotation is different than what it would be in English. Another thing that bothered me a bit is that it's suggested that you can romance girls, but nothing ends up happening and the main character will always end up seeming to have a crush on a specific character. I'd be fine with this if it weren't insinuated otherwise\nI love visual novels, and there are so many good ones that are just too dang short. This game was a pleasant change. Assuming you want to read all of the dialogue (some bits more interesting than others. The murder mystery was fun, but I would have loved if there was more detective work. Then again, you can figure out the mystery on your own, outside of the game. \nBoth the murder and the main character's past and mental status are huge pieces of this story, especially the latter. You're left guessing what happened and with whom until the answers are finally revealed. Granted, I guessed who the murderer was pretty early on based on tropes I've seen. The conclusion is great, no matter what ending you get, to be honest. Good ending (well, \"good\" is subjective, I suppose) or bad endings, they were all satisfying and drew me in. Honestly, with all these twists and turns, sometimes this game feels like it's just trolling you. Though I mean that in a good way.\nIf you're okay with a lot of dialogue and a slow story, then I definitely recommend this game.

Always a good thing.\n\nThis first introductorary story arc focuses on introducing the characters, giving Yama quite a bit of character development, and the first mystery, involving a string of disappearences at the school Yama attends.\n\nOh, and Yama has PTSD, with the occasional panic attacks and memory loss. That one always helps you maintain a level head while investigating. (That was sarcasm, I'm not too good at it, but Sarcasm and Banter are probably this VN's strongest points, although the plot and logic puzzles are pretty good too, and we haven't seen enough of most of the characters (Rui, Yama and the SK excluded) to judge their quality yet.)\n\nAnyway, a well-developed mystery, a cast of quirky and interesting characters, some scenes that got me laughing out loud...\n\nDefinitely worth the 0 dollars you pay for it.\n\nOh.

After playing it through once, I found it to be an absolute gem, one of those games you just won't know is good until you play it. I'll be honest, my experience with VNs is that I'll often stop a few days before returning to it because I just can't be bothered to keep myself up reading just plain text, but for this game, I just couldn't stop reading, for there is just so much that I love about Lucid9.\n\nFirst of all, the plot was great and was a crazy roller coaster ride with many ups and downs, even moments I would consider loops and corkscrews. The pacing itself didn't feel rushed to me at all, and additionally, this was JUST the common route and there's so much more to come out for this game in the future. The happy moments in the game were well placed in this relatively serious game, letting you know that while there certainly is a danger present to the characters, they are still students that want to enjoy life and have fun.\n\nThe writing was excellent, I especially loved all the references to various anime and games. There's also a little bit of 4th wall breaking, which is always welcome. Everything just flowed really well and often seemed clever.\n\nIn regards to the characters, I absolutely loved them. It's not very often that I feel an attachment to characters on this level, they just feel so human and likable. When it comes to Yama, I felt like I could relate to him to some extent, so much so that it felt like I was IN the game every now and then. To me, all these characters are just boasting with personality and just kind of stood out to me. The characters also get a good amount of character development, and as I learned more about each and every single one of them, the more real they seemed.\n\nMusic is excellent, it really helps sets to the mood for the events going on in the game.\n\nWhen it comes to the art, I didn't like it at first, but as I played through it, it just grew on me and I've come to love and appreciate it.\n\nFor flaws, It's VERY hard for me to point out any flaws for this game, the experience just felt perfect to me.\n\nOverall, I'd have to say that it is CERTAINLY worth investing all the approximate 10 hours into, and considering it's FREE, there's practically no reason to skip over this game.

It will give you lots of laughs, excitement, mystery... and sadness, and a lot of it. 90% of the decisions you make actually have consequences, and most can be really painful to endure.

It's honestly quite difficult to describe without dropping spoilers, but to put it simply the writers manage to achieve an almost perfect mystery novel voice. [9/10]\n\nArtwork is passable and consistent throughout the playthrough. It won't necessarily dazzle you, but it definitely helps bring the characters to life and backgrounds serve their purpose well enough. [6/10]\n\nThe audio is very well done. The soundtrack was definitely my favourite aspect of the game; all of the music, ranging from catchy, upbeat tunes to dark and foreboding ambient tracks really pull you into the protagonist's head, making the immersion all that much better.

The main character (Yama) is initially built up to be quite perceptive [spoiler]regarding Rui[/spoiler], but afterwards it becomes quite clear to the player that outside of this he's almost... unbearably dense [spoiler]as is most clearly seen with Akira[/spoiler]. I feel that when the player becomes more knowledgable than the character they play as, it breaks the immersion. It's an obviously necessary mechanism for setting up a sequel, but I feel that just in this one situation the writing could have been better.\n\nTL;DR, give this VN a look, it definitely won't disappoint!

In my opinion, it had way too many unnecessary fillers that overshadowed its intriguing storyline. For example, the amusement park scene didn't contribute to the main storyline at all. It was basically just a bunch of friends spending free time at the park. And the whole scene took quite a bit of my time, and I still learned nothing about the main plot. I value my time and when I read this VN I felt like my time wasn't well spent, (like I lost more than what I can gain). Don't get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying that the game is a total waste of time. Its main storyline caught my attention and that's why I stayed from beginning til' end (note the 20 hours of play through). This VN had lots of potential and it's free, but sometimes free does not always mean that it will yield a positive experience.

By the end, the game rips out your heart. It shows your heart to you. Then it crushes your heart in front of you with just how cruel the reality of the real world can be.\n\nCHARACTERS: 10/10\nThe characters are actually pretty fun to watch as they interact with each other. There is a shockingly high amount of witty dialogue between most of the characters. Yahiko, the supposedly ever gullible guy who hides his real emotions behind a wall of arrogance and endearing naive attitude. Rui, the witty childhood friend who helped her best friend through a very dark time of his life. Yama, the snarky sarcastic guy with issues who lovingly pokes fun at his friends. Masato, the smart athletic guy who takes most things literally and loves to compete with his friends. Shigure, the independent and intelligent woman who uses her excessively large vocabulary to insult people that piss her off. This is about half of the cast but I won't spoil this treat for people. The characters are memorable and I will not be forgetting them any time soon. The character personalities and their friendships are fleshed out well enough that I see this aspect being, dare I say, believeable. \n\nMUSIC: 9/10\nThe accompanying music is actually pretty fitting to the situations that the main character finds himself in. In particular, I really enjoy the title music and the melancholy tracks. When I heard the title music, I suspected that I was in for one hell of a treat when it came to the music. I wasn't fond of the \"comedy situation\" tracks, hence the 9/10. However, the rest of the tracks made up for that by being very well suited to the themes and situations of the game. Even though there are some parts where there is no music, this doesn't detract from the game at all. The ambient sounds fill the gap rather nicely for almost all of those situations. As for the rest of the situations, the silence works perfectly for driving home specific emotions that are tied directly to the silent scenes.\n\nSTORY: 10/10\n\"Life isn't fair. Deal with it, kid.\" That sums up the cruelty of this exceedingly well-written story. If you're looking for a lovey-dovey experience that makes your heart feel warm and fuzzy, then you are looking for those things in the wrong game. If you wanna know what the story is about, just read the developer's wall of text in the \"About This Game\" section. I will say this though: pick your choices wisely or you [i]will die[/i].\n\n\nMYSTERIES: 9/10\nYes, you are actually pushed into solving mysteries in this game. Don't expect Danganronpa murder mysteries here. However, each mystery is well crafted and it can take some time to figure out the correct answers. Still, the answers are always right in front of you. You just need to adjust your way of thinking from time to time. If you don't have the patience for the mysteries, you can always hit up the Lucid9 guides section. There is a guide that only covers the mysteries. Why take the easy way out when you can give your brain a reasonable challenge?\n\nTWISTS: 8/10\nAbout half-way through the game, I narrowed the murderer down to three suspects. To do that, I literally spent about 30 minutes thinking over all the details that had been discovered in the game. However, the murders aren't the only situations with twists. Sometimes, you think you've got a person figured out and then you find that you are dead wrong. Other times, you think you've got some \"friend\" of the main character figured out. Then, you notice a little context clue that puts an entire fight between two characters into an ugly context all too similar to real life for some people.", "timestamp_created": 1465463610, "timestamp_updated": 1465463610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23460088": {"recommendationid": "23460088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145623592", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465429353}, "language": "english", "review": "I fear for the mental stability of whoever wrote this.

I must say i was quite impressed with this one. I never expected that there is gonna be a visual novel which is this good on STEAM. This game features several interesting ways of gameplay. From a traditional click and read gameplay to a detective finding out clues gameplay. The artwork is good, the story is godly and most of all, the characters itself feel special in their own way. And ofcourse there are several different endings which you could get. Well most of them are bad endings which result in DEATH. But to tell you the truth it is quite hard to get a bad ending if you are thinking rationally and carefully. You need to remember past events and look through peoples hearts. Did that person really do it? Are they seriously like that? I know that they cant do that but....you get the point. There are several things which you need to pay attention to and i warn you, this game will make you insecure a lot. Nonetheless the drama in this is game ridiculess i really cant wait to see a continuation in the future if there is one xD. And there are going to be things which you will not be able to find out.

This is the third Visual Novel I've played recently. I had stayed away from them for some reason, but now I'm glad I actually took the time to check them out. What I like about this game are the choices. Some Visual Novels won't give you any and some of the others that do, their choices mean little. That's why I've stayed away from these games. But the choices in this game matter. You can't get every achievement in one playthrough which is good, too. It'd be boring if you could gain it all at once. I like how different things happen depending on your choice and what you do. \n\nI enjoyed the story of the game as well. It was confusing when points of view shifted at first, but I understood it once I looked at the corner of my screen and saw the different color. A nice murder mystery with romantic and psychologic elements in it... Overall a great story. \n\nIf I had one bad thing about it, though... I was a little sad at the ending. Not in a bad way. It was a good ending, it's just... Yeah, I didn't want it to end like that. Also, I wish that I could have seen a few more images of my character. Not saying that I wanted Yama plastered everywhere, but a few more shots of him would have been nice. \n\nFor a free game, I'd say that it's long enough.

I decided to take a break and finish it the next day.\n\nAnd I once again got absolutely stuck reading it to completion without a break.

I like many elements of this game. The rollercoaster of a storyline, mental descriptions, referenceses to many other entertainment, anime, and the like, vivid characters. music. I love all of them. \nBut still, there are improvements to be made. I am not saying that you did not do a good enough job, you did well for a free VN, but still, there are flaws here and there.\n First off , I dont feel like the story is tied together tight enough, as in, there are some details that are not tied in with the story, not serving a purpose; i mean, is it really neccessary to play through every item in the amusement park? I feel like the author really worked on the details of the game, dropping off seemingly useless information and using it as a key piece of the information later on. I really like this touch, but as I have said, some of them are actually of no use, making the story feels untied, unfinished,(yes I am only refering the story of the first game,despite the future lines and plot holes for later installment)\nThis might be personal, but I kinda saw how the storying was going, even to the very end, but maybe thats just me, being cynical and all. The pacing of the game is weird, like events are happening around the main character, even in the rather mundane days, there are always things happening, which seems unnatrual to me. \nAlthough there are flaws, i don't hate the game for having those flaws.

The music fits the scenes and the user interface was smooth and felt very polished. \n\nOverall, Lucid9 is a great visual novel worth playing (even though its free, the quality is good enough to rank with good paid visual novels).

I would pay $50 in a heartbeat, if I knew the money would go to the staff.\n\nI'd like to mention a few concerns first: \n  - Character art doesn't match the intensity of the story. Think Grisaia no Kajitsu, Katawa Shoujo, etc. The art definitely grew on me over the course of the story; I'm not trying to belittle it. I just hope no one has passed over this game because of that. Don't.\n  - Music was serviceable but not memorable.\n  - Lack of autonomy in certain areas - regardless of efficacy - was strange. A certain email exchange, for example, and the issue with Masato, and pretty much anything involving Natsuki. I assume they're setting up for a sequel, so hopefully some of these things will recieve focus in the future.\n  - Early, seemingly-minor decisions being important meant that viewing other paths required replaying almost the entire game. Text skipping with transitions off made this doable, but I still believe that texting the wrong person at the very beginning should count for less than the important choices you make toward the end. Anyone who cares enough about the game to view more than one path probably won't mind some extra text skipping, but the long turnaround time between the early choices and the ending choices does make finding the paths pretty frustrating. Also, personally I found it jarring during my first playthrough to see every CG and then get the Fruitless achievement.\n \n\nAnd with the out of the way, here's some high-level Pros, because an exhaustive list of individual things I liked would hit the character limit:\n - writing with depth and logic, and the kind of effortless quality that means it took blood, sweat, and tears to produce.\n - thought-provoking riddles, puzzles, and questions. This game rewards critical thinking.\n - fantastic characters and characterization.\n - slick-looking UI and animations. I had assumed the game was made in Ren'Py, but according to their website they rolled their own. I wonder if some of the features can be ported into existing engine(s)? Thinking of the cell phone, HUD, and keyboard input in particular.\n - yo dawg I herd you leik memes so I put memes in your memes so you could laugh while you laugh\n\nLucid/10\n\nLONG LIVE THE RESISTANCE", "timestamp_created": 1462662087, "timestamp_updated": 1462662087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22852661": {"recommendationid": "22852661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169166896", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462663664}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Visual Novel.

Better than looks make it seem. If you decide to try this VN out, make sure you actually read the dialog and don't quit just a few hours in to fully absorb the greatness that is Lucid9.\n\nThis in-depth review is as spoiler free as possible.\n\nPLOT: 10/10\nThe first few minutes of the game make you feel like this will be your average visual novel where you choose between different girls and end up dating one of them at the end. Just your normal fluffy waifu simulator. But as the story progresses, the plot goes deeper than you would think.\n\nEven though I was enjoying the light theme of the story at the beginning, I almost stopped playing because I thought that it would only go up to that. Boy, was I glad I didn't stop. This VN is intense, with you trying to make ends meet in your mind as to what is actually happening. If you're reading this, I advise you NOT TO STOP just a few hours in. You won't be able to grasp how well written this story is. But then again, if you're only looking for that fluffy otome style VN, maybe you should turn away.\n\nCHARACTERS: 10/10\nI loved the characters in this game. VNs usually only focus on the main girl you are aiming for. This game, on the other hand, lets you get to know all of the characters fairly, as long as you take the time to hang out with them of course. Each character has their own personalities and quirks that make them different from one another. Your relationships with them span from typical childhood friend to idiotic-but-lovable classmate, making your interactions with each of them different. \n\nWRITING: 9/10\nThe writing was exquisite. Each character also had their own way of speaking and texting, with varying degrees in their vocabularies. I also loved the details put into this game. By the time you reach the climax, those minor details that you brushed off as insignificant all come flooding back. Those minor bits of foreshadowing all clump together to paint the entire picture. Just lovely.\n\nART: 8/10\nIt's your typical anime styled visual novel. It's clean, and the variety of expressions on the characters were good. The backgrounds were pretty as well. The small details like the characters zooming in when speaking worked really well.\n\nMUSIC: 8/10\nThe background music really ties the feel of the scenes together. It's a great way to set the mood. Happy music for light-hearted scenes, and more solemn music for the more serious parts. Here's hoping that the future voice acting patch helps bring everything together as well. \n\nOVERALL: 9/10\nVery enjoyable, and easy to get hooked on. I can proudly say that my hours spent playing this VN have not gone to waste, especially for a free game. If you have even just a few hours of spare time, I highly recommend giving this game a shot. \nP.S. I enjoyed the various easter eggs and shoutouts to different games.

All the positive reviews sure made it seem that way. But, to me, it feels like I've wasted my time. The beginning was excusible. I believed it was great foreshadowing of what could happen, according to the game description. From there, everything seemed perfect. I felt like I bonded with the characters, I actually felt like I related to the main character more than most VNs. I took more time with it than I did most VNs, as I was enjoying it very thoroughly. The story felt smooth, and remained that way until the final 5-10 minutes of the game. At that point, there is such a MAJOR plot twist that many people couldn't handle (hence, the \"feels\" reviews.) And although it seemed cool, the story lost a third of my interest I previously had. But what had to be the final 30 seconds to a minute COMPLETELY RUINED IT. It has made my opinion of Mass Effect 3's ending seem like it was a masterpiece. A minor \"spoiler\": [spoiler] THERE IS NO GOOD ENDING!

The ones that really made you care for the characters and their safety. This VN seems to go way beyond those shows and books. I cared about a couple of virtual characters as if they were my friends.  Lucid9 really likes to mess with your emotions, I went from crying to being happy that everyone was okay and everything was going to go as planned, to crying again in matter of minutes. It gets you immersed in the story and makes you care, then it takes that away and does exactly what you didn't want. \n\nI had a hard time quiting. I stayed up late playing for hours, you constantly want to see what happens next and you start to enjoy the moments when you aren't worried about what could be happening to your friend.\n\nPlus, ITS FREE! \nSo even if you have never tried a VN before, please give this one a try. And i dont mean play the first 10 minutes then leave, actually play for a good hour or so.

I apologize for both.\nNow honestly, I knew nothing about Lucid9 when I saw it here. I was looking for free games, I saw it, and I downloaded it simply because I had nothing better to do. Visual Novels were a game genre I had never really played much of, and as a result I both didnt know what to expect and didnt expect much, seeing it as \"another anime game\". I enjoy anime and am a huge hypocrite for saying that, but I digress. Anyway, when I started it up I was initially confused but intrigued, which was enough to draw me in. The characters made me laugh and reminded me of my own friends, and so I began the game thinking it simple, but nothing that could hold me. And then I slowly got more and more engrossed. I met Shigure an actually thought out what I was going to say, I did my best to not cheat on her \"test\" (besides that horse question, screw that one. Good on you guys though) and I really liked the mystery feel I got from the game. Yama himself was probably what kept me tied, as he reminded me a lot of myself, Sarcastic, believing school to be a waste of time, the \"weird kid\" with few but close friends. It felt nice to have a character to relate to. Yahiko's optimism and oblivious personality made me laugh, Masato continued to impress and surpise me with, completely betraying the typical \"jock\" feel I initially got from him. And then it got serious. With the murders, the investigations, this happy game (well, novel) I was once playing (well, reading) turned into a much more serious and thought provoking game, especially when characters like Mr. Ryouta and Airi were involved. Without spoiling it, I went through a LOT of bad ends, looking for my happy ending, before I eventually realized that I wasn't SUPPOSED to get a completely satisfying ending. I repreatedly fought the killer, and a certain someone repeatedly died. It wasn't until I made it past the ordeal that I realized I got my happy ending, just not the way I wanted. And then the ACTUAL ending came, and holy balls. I felt angry, confused, betrayed, wanting more...and I can't wait for the next part of this. Lucid9 impressed me repeatedly with both it's lighthearted moments and the more serious one, its dumb seemingly meaningless questions and phrases a huge part of the plot, the psychological questions and detective games forcing me to think and really immerse myself into this amazing game. Seriously, it might not mean much coming from a guy sitting on his computer, typing on a keyboard, but good on you guys, you have made one of the most unique experiences I've ever,,,experienced (couldnt think of  a better word) in a game (again, well novel). If you're on the fence about buying this game, go for it. Well, its also free, so also nothing to lose...but ignoring that fact, this game will draw you in and really make you think and become attached to its amazing characters and think about its story. Again, sorry about being disorganized and lenghy, but alot to say, might as well say it. Can't wait for the next part guys, this is amazing.

I assure you this far from that, assuming you have the basic cognitive functions I would expect from a chimpanzee. I wouldn't considered myself an expert on VN's but this Visual Novel most definitely has more substance than some of the ones I've played...or is it read?Who cares. \n\nThe sprites are exceptional quality and add to the various scenes in here. The characters are unique in their own right, seemingly one dimensional characters abiding by overused stereotypes become diverse characters each with their own quirks and personality. As an aspiring writer I can appreciate the authors tone as well as the imagery choreographed into the intense and immersive dialogue and narrative. And most of all, it gives choice. Of course we will go down the plot but the choices you make allow you to learn about this exciting world brought to life as well as it's characters. \nThough my ratings aren't that important it would appeasing to the skim readers out there to see this:\n\nPlot: 10/10\nCharacter sprites: 8/10\nDialogue: 10/10\nCharacter Development: 9/10\nGrammar: 10/10 (I have yet to see one mistake)\nAudio :10/10(No obnoxious elevator music or static)\nBackground Music: 10/10(Used effectively to set a certain mood... I got all the OST's on my phone)\nPacing: 10/10( The story doesn't feel rushed in the least and it progresses at a reasonable pace)\nTone: 10/10 ( The character's voice isn't cliche and is rather relaxing in the text. It even feels a bit relatable to be honest)\nChoices: 10/10 \nCharacter Voice: 10/10 (Each character has a unique way of speaking and thinking and their personalities become prominent within the dialogue.)\nWorldbuilding: 10/10 ( Of course it may seem to some that the setting is rather vague but it does so to keep you engaged. The VN tells you what you need to know while leaving you in the dark about a few things. Things which you can learn via the narrative or dialogue,,,and maybe intuition if you actually have the critical thinking skills required to make logical deductions.) \nConnection to characters?(Mind you this is a person opinion. I felt fairly connected to each of them. They all had their own unique sides to them. Keep in mind that each of the characters had their own INDIVIDUAL person to create them. It wasn't just one or two goofs who created the whole cast. It was an army of them. Apparently skilled individuals in their own right and it showed in the final product that is Lucid9.)\n\nAm I shamelessly promoting them and do I work for them? Nope, I wish I did, then I'd have something to brag about to my extremely small social circle. Am I promoting them? You're the genius go figure that one out.\nOne a side note: The person I felt that I would have an easy time hanging out with is Airi. Socially awkward, sure but, she's one hell of a character. Top waifu for sure in my books.\nI won't spoil anything so go and enjoy or hate Lucid9. If you have the time to read this whole essay of pretty words and such then you probably have the time to play (or read) Lucid9.\n~Black Hat Detective\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1461614151, "timestamp_updated": 1461614151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22629930": {"recommendationid": "22629930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095749513", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461854744}, "language": "english", "review": "Theres a bug after the Tech Showcase Choice , where Misaki's Sprite is Missing\n\nOverall I'll Rate this 8/10\nThere's Still some Grammar which need some work.\nAnd I dont give 9's to an unfinished VN :P\nAnyway great Vn considering this is Free and can't wait for the Route :3 and Voices", "timestamp_created": 1461592434, "timestamp_updated": 1461592434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22628653": {"recommendationid": "22628653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259376436", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484667878}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6258\u798f\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5c0f\u9ec4\u6cb9\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u5c0f\u6765\u770b\u5267\u60c5\u4e0d\u957f\uff0c\u521a\u770b\u4e86\u4e2a\u5f00\u5934\u8fd8\u6ca1\u901a\u5173\uff0cBGM\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u3002\u542c\u8bf4CV\u5feb\u6709\u4e86\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1461587363, "timestamp_updated": 1461587363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22627202": {"recommendationid": "22627202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039625952", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461745518}, "language": "english", "review": "This is amazing I love it <3", "timestamp_created": 1461580354, "timestamp_updated": 1461580354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22626730": {"recommendationid": "22626730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087423751", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461574348}, "language": "english", "review": "Lucid9, where to start with this gem?\n\nI really don't know what I was expecting when I installed this game. But what I recieved was more then I've expected.\n\nHonestly after playing this game, like most other people, I agree that I would have payed for this game. The fact that a game that so thought out and hard worked on is free, honestly leaves me slightly upset. In fact I would've rather spent $60 on this game then any other game I've ever bought in my 12 years of gaming, regardless of the fact that it is 'only' a visual novel.\n\nBut more about the game:\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is how masterfully fluid the game felt. The first bit everthing was a blur, not paying much attention to the subtle things that all came back when it mattered. But as I played longer and felt myself getting more immersed, it was hard not to remember everthing. I realized everything I did, learned and 'saw' was more important then I possibly could have imagined. But in the end I feel like I did more than play a game. \n\nFor Example, meeting multipe indepth characters that not only I could relate to, but could empathize with. I not only meet and felt for these charaters but came to care for them, which is rare to find in games now-a-adays. Just throwing people into a game and telling some background on them doesn't mean there's a connection. How quickly the characters in this game got to me was amazing. \n\nI also personally love the music. The way every scene has a specific piece and how it set the mood for who's talking or what's about to happen. There isn't much else to say about it other that.\n\nBut to sum up the game, it's one I won't be forgetting, in a good way. I haven't played my other visual novels but I feel it was that opened me up more to the catagory. And I have this game to thank for the many, many more VNs I see myself playing in the future.\n\n[b] If you haven't played the game and want to, I highly suggest not looking at this next comment.

As a person who was a little bit touched by Undertale, appreciating what it is, although not bursting into tears for the endings, i have to say, this game actually messed me up. \n\n---From here on, this can be considered spoiler. Please come back AFTER going through the endings.---\n\nIt's been quite some time the ending of a story has left me with a bitter taste, since it's not only sad, but it's the end. Not since Orwell's \"1984\" have i felt this impressed, outraged, and yet, mute. The agony of being there, helplessly watching as the story unfolds at some point, just drove a stronger connection between Yama and me, since i regretted his actions. Because you're not the only one writing this story.\n\nBecause you are not the mastermind.\n\nIn fact, i can't help but notice the game actually slaps you in the face [spoiler] by actually making you think the ending would be a slice o'life sequence (as a reward for having to guess the correct choices for about 10+ minutes), and then brutally murdering one of the most lovable characters in the game [/spoiler] harder than you can think. Even with a substantial quantity of choices, you have no true choice in some matters at hand.\n\n[spoiler] Because like Yams; you are helpless.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Because like Yama, you can't do anything. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Because like with him... It's all out of your control.[/spoiler]\n\nSo my way of coping with everything i just saw? None. I am quite literally feeling as down [spoiler] as if a close friend had been taken, and although i have memories, they will never be enough. Because the game WANTED this, no matter how i felt, just like real life. And i can't help but feel as hurt [/spoiler] as if it was tangible... As if i was there [spoiler] in that damn kitchen...[/spoiler]\n\nGoddamn you devs, i came here for some laughs and cool riddles/puzzles, and you give me all this emotional baggage?\n\nBoo, devs. Boo.\n\n(Seriously though, kudos for crafting this.

The backgrounds are really well done and sets the mood perfectly for the different scenarios in the story. The charecter art is Awsome! Showing the unique aspects of each character. small critique is that some of the perspectives make the characters look a little wonky and the ingame portraits seem more sketchy than the full screenshot pictures. But its really good and does not distract from the story at all ^^. BTW The menus and UI and the PHONE is Really cool and I mean Really cool.\n\nWriting: S+\nThis is one of the best stories I have ever read. The charecters are real and life like. It's actually really scary how accurate they are when describing what its like to be inside the head of a depressed person. The characters are real people and you learn to know their motivations and backstory and love them to bits. So when the going gets tough it really tugs and the heartstrings. Also those royalty free names tho! ^^. AND THE REFERENCES!\n\nOST: SS+\nTHIS OST IS AMAZING. Each theme really captures each characters personality and adds a new level of depth to the story. It makes you feel sick when you should feel sick, It makes you feel relived when you should feel relived. Its comforting when you need comfort. It makes you cringe at the most cringiest moments in the story. Its just so good I can't put it into words. Even though the themes loop, it never seems repetetive or annoying. Until you get to a certain part of the story but I won't say anything 'cause spoilers. If you guys release the ost for mp3 let me know ^^\n\nSpecial Effects: S\nThe way the screen flashes properly showing you what the protagonist is feeling is a really nice touch. The realistic sounds that you would hear from white noise to the vibration and dail tone of a phone are all top notch. \n\nOVERALL: It's really good. LIke REALLY GOOD!

WHAT A ROLLERCOASTER. sjflkaj;s\n\nAll I could think about this week was Lucid9. I recommended it to everyone I knew who liked the VN genre (and would listen to my ramblings), and have gotten at least one poor soul hooked on this game. I wish more people would listen, though, because this masterpiece deserves so, so, so much more love and attention. <3\n\nI finished it just a few minutes ago, and I am worn [i]out.[/i] This game managed to dig through my internal organs, squish them into mush, and leave me to stew here with a broken heart and a liver halfway up my chest. Not a great situation, but somehow... really, really satisfying. I feel like I need a day of napping just to recuperate from the up-and-down emotions I felt throughout my playthrough of this game. I've laughed, felt accomplished (acing that history quiz without once googling anything made me so proud!), been shocked, terrified, disgusted, sad, and extremely [i]affected.[/i] Lucid9 manages to deliver a story so well paced and written that it rivals many of the other costly games I've played. I honestly can't believe this gem is free; I would pay for it in a heartbeat, although I must say that it was the price tag that drew me to pick it up in the first place. \n\nAnyway, there's something for everyone in this VN, especially for those who are fans of other VNs, manga, anime, and the like. I'm not a massive enthusiast, and usually can't stand just sitting and clicking, but the story is so engaging that you'll find yourself hard-pressed to close the game and go to bed. With the variety of romance routes, cute girls (and boys), self-referential humour, satire, and lots of tearjerking kmoments, I guarantee something will get to you. The music and art is pretty neat, too, and the assets are arranged in a way that definitely maximises the writing's impact. \n\n* - Side Note: The UI in this game is absolutely gorgeous as well. I'm so glad it was something that was seriously considered in the development, because I [i]hate[/i] outdated/clunky menus. Lucid9's everything is so clean and minimal, and I can't thank the devs enough for that, hahaha.\n\nAnd what's more -- love it or hate it, you might as well try it. The developers are angels, honestly, because there's nothing you need to give to play this beautiful game besides your time. And I'm sure it'll be well spent. \n\nGreat work all around, Fallen Snow Studios -- I can't wait to play episode 2. :D", "timestamp_created": 1461343903, "timestamp_updated": 1461942046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640725", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22570242": {"recommendationid": "22570242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169033661", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461342443}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is incredible, especially considering the fact that it was free.

So now short and sweet.\n\nStory:\nNever a dull moment. And I have the attention span of a yogurt bottle (does yogurt have attention?). Don't be fooled by what it appears to be at first- a simple slice-of-life visual novel with plenty of wit and and humor. It's not. Very deep and [spoiler]by the time the ending came I was so invested that the ending made me feel sick to my stomach (and I don't get queezy with blood; it was out of sheer rage/sadness at what happened).[/spoiler]\n\nCharacters:\nThey may appear stereotypical but they're not. No, not at all. Each are unique and interesting in their own way.\n\nArt:\nI don't know anything about art, but to me, it was really high-quality. \n\nMusic:\nI typically don't notice the music as much as i do the other features. This one I did. They all fit the scenes perfectly and definitely helped raise my stress during the more intense scenes (and of course helped me laugh during the comedic scenes). I wouldn't mind paying some money for future DLC which includes the soundtrack (though the complete OST is on Youtube).\n\nOverall:\nLucid9 definitely could have cost around $10 and it still would have been worth it. You can tell the effort put into this marvelous game in every aspect as you play through it. Even if you're not a fan of visual novels or even anime, I highly recommend playing this.

The visual part of the game is not perfect but i was more into the story then the visual part but if you fancy that kinda thing its not bad but definitely not anything special, I will say *spoiler* the flashback scenes and relapses definitely add to the Visual part, i was looking so closely to try to catch a glimpse of what the image was and piece things together. The characters are all interesting and they all definitely get their chance to shine, some characters get a bigger backstory than others but all in all I would definitely recommened taking your time and talking to all of them and not skipping over a chance to.\n\nFYI, If you dont like the darker side of VN and just want that Slice of life stuff this VN is not for you.\n\n\nOverall i give this VN a 9/10\n\nI will absolutely be playing again for different routes and when the voice acting is added in. :)\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1461207218, "timestamp_updated": 1461207218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22542883": {"recommendationid": "22542883", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993240784", "num_games_owned": 682, "num_reviews": 194, "playtime_forever": 1373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461201106}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0420\u0435\u0434\u043a\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0445, \u043d\u043e \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435 \u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c. \n\n[h1]\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c.[/h1]\n\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b - \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0434\u043a\u043e \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439...\u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c.\n\n\u0412\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439...\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0438 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430.

The fact is that, even though I thought a relatively passive \"visual novel\" playstyle was going to bore me, I was engrossed in the story almost from the start.  It's well-written, aside from a few spelling errors here or there (Which initially got me off-side but are, really, quite far and few between), and the character interactions and semi-narration from Yama are fun and, importantly, serve a purpose rather than being inane padding.\n\nThere are some choices throughout that impact your end-game result, of which I have seen several.  Which means you'll get more than one playthrough.  Which is amazing, considering that there is already at least 10-12 hours (It depends on how quickly you read, I guess.) of content on the initial playthrough.  For second time round you are given the handy option of fast-forwarding through what you have already read - in case you just want to explore different paths to the end without going through the entire story bit by bit.\n\nThe story is nothing gripping or earth-shatteringly new, really, but Yama - whose perspective you are reading from - is well thought out and well written, which is good news because you spend almost every moment with him and his thoughts.  Because of his well-written internal dialogue the supporting characters and, thusly, the story itself becomes intriguing and in turn keeps you reading until the very end.\n\nThe background art is simple but effectively conveys setting and the character art is crisp and well-drawn in a typical Manga style which, while nothing new is also not unpleasant.  There is no voice work so it is a hefty amount of reading to put in - perfect for solid or enthusiastic readers although people who need to perhaps be more visually stimulated or distracted by more than just words and simple art may find it difficult to get through the whole thing.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed my first playthrough and looking forward to seeing the different paths each choice leads to on subsequent replays.\n", "timestamp_created": 1460990116, "timestamp_updated": 1460990116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22499124": {"recommendationid": "22499124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062601770", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462198968}, "language": "english", "review": "You know that feeling when you finish a really good series or book, and you have nothing to do with your life?\n\nThat's exactly what I felt.\n\nNormally, it would take me several episodes to get me hooked on a series or lots of chapters in a book.

It took a short while to download, so I played it at 10:20.\n\nI didn't read what it was about, I saw anime-styled characters and a school, and I thought it was just a slice of life kind of thing. I thought it would just be a funny game where I didn't have much of an attachment to the characters.\n\nAfter the initial six minutes of getting hooked, I kept playing and didn't keep track of the time.

It's very easy to binge.\n\nIt left me in shock, a game where I was experiencing high school in a First World Metropolis? I normally think slice of life's are cheesy, but for some reason this was an emotional rollercoaster unlike some Visual Novels.\n\nThe characters had similar characteristics to many of my friends, I could literally match them to some of the characters.\n\nThe dialogue felt real, it felt as if this wasn't written and it felt as if real people had said it.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed of the same songs, but man oh man they are perfect for the situations they're in. I couldn't have picked better for the scenes.\n\nThe art style may throw those people who think that being a weeaboo is just liking the art off but the art was amazing and I loved it.\n\nThe story is truly amazing, it was easy to understand, was stressful and entertaining, and put me through several stages of emotion.\n\nI went from happy, to sad, to happy, to sad, to even sadder, to nearly crying...\n\nI finished the game, chatting with friends along the way.\n\nAfter I finished I was just like; \"Damn, what do I do now...\"\n\nThis game gave me an experience no other games could give me.

I feel like it delivers on all fronts, (with the exception of in-depth romance, which I read harem routes and a progression to the main story would come later) and is all-in-all an indepth story which is easily bingable. \n\nI started this at 10pm, didn't get to bed until 7am, didn't finish reading the good ending until the next day.\nWhen you get into Lucidy9, you'll find yourself pointing fingers at the characters, seeking out hints behind the mystery, and all the while pushing your character into the arms of your chosen waifu and aborsbing yourself in the drama, past, and daily life of the main character Yama.\nThis VN easily plays as a psychological mystery horror, romance, comedy, and still manages to tie all of its many characteristics rather perfectly.\nWhen you finish this VN, you'll feel joy, you'll feel truimph, and ultimately, you'll feel sadness.\n\nIf you want to feel the familiar feels of a good book, or vn, or anime, or whatever stimulates your feels, this is a very good option. \n\nAnd just a tip;\nthe best ending is a little hard to get. In the ending sequence, what you need to do is particularly specific.

Better than a lot of paid visual novels on steam right now. The first part of a bigger story that manages to resolve its central plot line. If you like visual novels, give it a shot.\n\nStory\n\nLucid9 follows Yama Ishimoto, a cynical carefree high student of a prestigious high school in 2018 Japan. All is fine with the world, except  it is swiftly shown that students are going missing. The opening scene quickly shows there's a serial killer involved and the central mystery is established.\n\nInciting Incident is the first part of a larger story and, as such, the romance aspect one may come to expect from visual novels isn't especially present yet. Instead, much of the plot is focused on solving the mystery presented early on, and I believe it has done a good job for this. Yama is neither a super genius or a detective so most of the time he isn't actively trying to solve the puzzle, but the reader, if they stay focused and pay attention, are provided with plenty of clues disguise as typical high school slice-of-life scenes. Having been through the story already, I will say that I believe the mystery is completely fair and can be solved with the information provided directly to the reader.\n\nCharacters\n\nAlong side the mystery plot are the characters. Yama is quickly shown to be rude, self-centered, snarky and judgemental, most likely far from the expected badass/all-loving/idealistic protagonist one may come to expect from most visual novels. A large number of visual novels will focus on developing the heroines rather than the protagonist and it's refreshing to see a visual novel protagonist with potential for character developments. That said, while it is nice to see someone who's not a straight-up nice guy protagonist, Yama can sometimes be a huge unreasonable, judgemental and unapologetic asshole. So while it's good that the character has a lot of room for development (and he does develop here), Yama can also be very hard to stomach, especially when he gets away with being a huge prick to people who are not his friends. This being a first part of a bigger story however means there's still plenty of time for him to grow out of that, something I look forward to seeing.\n\nThen we have the five heroines: Rui, (blatant) tsundere childhood friend, Elizabeth, high-and-mighty straight-laced overachiever, Akira, bubbly and over-energetic friend, Misaki, quirky and carefree childhood friend and Airi, weird emotionless and literal-minded bullied kid. If you're familiar with visual novels or just anime in general, they will all sound incredibly archetypical. Fortunately, the writing proved to be much better than I initially anticipated, and the girls all have hidden depths that, so far, manages to be believable as well as surprising and avoided being broken birds for the protagonist to fix and woo. The same can also be said to the two male friends: Yahiko, the cheerful idiot, and Masato, the hot-headed stubborn musclehead. It is this unexpected depth that especially impressed me and moved me from eye-rolling at the early parts of the plot to being fully invested in the mystery and development of the characters. That said, it should also be mentioned that a lot of the early dialogues, while not indicative of the strength of the writing, can be so filled with constant sarcasm, snarks and wackiness that they can get very insufferable very quickly. Once you get pass that however, there's a lot to love here and the writing as a whole will prove to be much better than the early stages would suggest.\n\nGameplay\n\nLucid9 is a visual novel and come with the sort of gameplay (or whatever you choose to call it) one would expect from the genre. Choices are present. Some are clearly there to let you \"earn points\" with the respective heroines, some are there for fun, and some are there to test the player's ability to solve the mystery. It is this last set of choices, the one that requires actual deduction, where the game sets itself apart from decision making from more typical visual novels. Of course, considering the mystery questions are boiled down to multiple choice, it removes some of the inherent logic and difficulty in deduction, but nonetheless these sequences are fun brain teasers. That said, there's one sequence late in the game filled with bad ends that most players would likely fail at more than once. The bad ends themselves can be surprising, but they are also very contrived and out of nowhere. This section, I believe, is especially unfair and the trial-and-error that may be required to get through really hampers the tension intended here.\n\nArt and Music\n\nVisually, the game is adequate. It's not the best looking visual novels out there and it's not the worst either. Character designs aren't the best, though that may just be my personal preference, but backgrounds and UI look pretty good for a non-commercial production. The soundtracks serve their purpose and while not many stand out to me personally, there are one or two (especially one used in the ending) that I found very impressive and fitting. At the time of writing, the game has no voice acting. However, the developer promises a free voice patch in the future and samples can be found on the game's website.\n\nConclusion\n\nInciting Incident, while a first part of a larger story, manages to conclude its driving mystery while leaving plenty of questions up in the air for the latter parts. That said, the story does end in such a way that more or less demand an immediate follow-up. This coupled with the future voice patch means that right now is perhaps not the best time to start. However, if I am to judge what is present right now on its own merit, I'd say the game is definitely worth getting (and come on it's free). The surprisingly well-written characters and the intriguing and fair mystery sets this above a lot of other paid visual novels and I'd definitely recommend it for any fan of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1460923812, "timestamp_updated": 1460923812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502467", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22485769": {"recommendationid": "22485769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078720450", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465750971}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like visual novels in general than this is a nice addition to your collection.

Without it, you die!\nLucid9 is like air! Without it, you die!\nLucid9 is like fried chicken! Without it, you die!\n\nIn all seriousness, this game has exceeded my every expectation. Prior to release, I figured that it would be a charming free-to-play with surprisingly good art and music. I did not expect it to be as engaging as it truly is.\n\nThe story is simple but exciting, the characters are interesting and fun, the dialogue is incredibly well written and seriously brings these characters to life. There are also multiple endings that you achieve based on your choices, as expected from a game of this genre. You can really tell that the team involved poured their hearts and souls into the creation of this visual novel, and I have nothing but respect for them.\n\nI've REALLY enjoyed my experience with this game, and I'm so excited for the voice acting patch next year. They've got a really solid cast picked out, and I can't wait to hear the characters' interactions fully voiced. If you're on the fence about giving it a shot, don't be a shackin' dummer. The incredibly steep price tag of $0 might be intimidating, but give it a chance. I promise, you'll be pleasantly surprised. my heart can't even right now\n\n**EDIT**\n\nWas going to leave it at that but then I felt bad that I wasn't doing this game justice.\n\nLucid9 is an interactive visual novel with characters and humor that will surpass any visual novel expectations you may have from other games. Your choices will carry varying degrees of impact on the storyline (I'll talk about this later). Even if you're not into anime or visual novesl that much, I highly reccomend this game to you.\n\nHOWEVER the female characters don't have huge personalitities so if you're into those then you won't find them here.\n\n++DIALOGUE\nThe dialogue in this game is fantastic. Yes, there will be some times where you will feel like cringing but overall it really makes the game. The characters actually have a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ton of personality and flavor tips that I found myself cracking up to. Solid 9.5/10\n\n++ART\nNow I'm not an art major or anything but the art in this game is fantastic. The art style isn't too extravagant. Some backgrounds are reused for a few places but overall there is quite a large amount of unique pieces. 8/10\n\n++LENGTH\nPersonally I got around a solid 10 hours of gameplay for my first playthrough. This is with me not using the skip tool, reading 95% of the dialogue (was a bit late a night). I've also spent about 2 hours just going back and choosing different options at different moments just to experience it all. Plus it would be good to mention that there ARE NO MICROTRANSACTIONS WHATSOEVER in order to increase game length, so you get this wonderful experience without digging into your steam wallet/paypal. 9.5/10\n\n+STORY\nThere is a surprising amount of depth and storyline to this free gem of a game. I won't go into details for the sake of saying that YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME FOR YOURSELF. I found myself cheering and stunned at some moments of this game. \n\nHOWEVER\nThe game does leave off with a cliffhanger that gave me mixed feelings. It's nice to know that there'll be another game but at the same time I feel like some people will like the ending to this game a lot more than others. Other than that the only real bashful thing I have to say about this game is that a lot of the decisions you make early on won't effect the end outcome (TO MY LIMITED KNOWLEGE, WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW IF I FIND OUT MORE). A lot of the really important decisions come at the end, and I even had to look up a guide to get the ending I wanted. 7/10 for story.\n\nSHOULD YOU INVEST TIME IN THIS GAME?\n\nplease. At the very least do it for a lone Picklegoose who needs to relate to someone about this game- my heart is just done. This is an emotional rollercoaster of a visual novel that will leave you at the very least happy that you invested your time into it. I hate slice of life. I love mysteries. You know what I really hate? How VN authors always shove slice of life into mystery stories. The slice of life just inevitably clashes with the heavier tone of a good mystery and lessens the suspense. At least, I used to think that such pitfalls were inevitable before reading Lucid9.\n\nLucid9 takes a while to really get going on the mystery side, instead opting to be predominately lighthearted for the first several hours. Surprisingly though, that actually plays well into the storytelling. In a VN like G-Senjou no Maou, the slice of life scenes, while fun and enjoyable in a vacuum, feel out of place in the larger context of the story. Going from intense crime solving and battles of wits to unconsequential goofy high school funtimes doesn't always work so well. \n\nHowever, Lucid9's brilliantly written slice of life (whose brilliance is largely due to hilarious, snappy dialogue) provides some excellent build-up that heightens the impact of the mystery plot later on. When a character is in danger, you actually care. When it comes time to solve the mystery, you really won't want to point fingers at any of the great characters you've come to love. What I'm getting at here is that the slice of life segments do a great job at creating a cast of likable and believable characters that all tie into the plot very nicely.\n\nOf course, even if the slice of life half of the story is strong, the mystery needs to also be good. And it is! The entire story is peppered with subtle foreshadowing that is hidden in plain sight to keep the mystery \"fair\" to solve, while also being discrete enough that you likely won't know the answers long before their reveals. That said, a substantial part of the mystery is incomplete, meaning that I obviously can't comment on how the full plot will turn out. The mystery plot threads that were resolved, however, were very satisfactory in just about every way. There are also a couple of really fun interactive \"deduction\" sequences ala Ace Attorney or Kara no Shoujo that I probably won't soon forget.\n\nThe music and art were both great too, though I wish that some characters like Haru and Shoji had character sprites. They seem a bit too important to not have them. Also, Akira's theme is seriously catchy. A++ on that one.\n\nThis has gone on too long for a Steam review already, but I just wanted to say that I was extremely pleased with the VN and honestly very shocked how high quality it turned out. OELVNs unfortunately don't have the best reputation, and a free one seems even more sketchy (I imagine the full VN will easily be worth the $20-$30 that other SP VNs are going for). I'm so glad to have given it a chance though, and I can't wait for the rest of the routes! I hate slice of life. I love mysteries. You know what I really hate?

We have currently recorded all of day 1 and will resume day 2 sometime this month. Note: I did not read the entirety of the script prior to recording as I wanted the full experience by actually playing the game.\n\nStory: Short and simple. I'm a picky person in regards to storytelling and Lucid9 managed to be one of those stories that did exactly what I wanted and captured me. Smooth writing with clear and concise details and a plot that seems very light-hearted but with a brutal twist as you near the end. Some minor grammar, punctuation etc errors, but that's just a nitpick. Basically, Lucid9's story and storytelling were both captivating and effective.\n\nCharacters: Typical anime tropes with tsunderes, quirky comic reliefs, sarcastic know it alls and more, but with heavy background that isn't explicitly described in detail. I presume they are waiting until post common route to get into individual routes which would more then likely have detailed backgrounds of each character. Still. The characters and their interactions with each other were both colorful and dynamic, assuring my growing love for them.\n\nArt: Need I say more then beautiful? It is very Key-esque, and probably even Key inspired. Very detailed and colorful.\n\nMusic: Always catchy for me. Music is something that is paramount to a good game, movie, anime, etc. This game had music that kept me humming along whenever one I really liked popped up. \n\nVerdict: 9/10 Frankly, Lucid9 is one of the best OELVN's I've played, which is unfortunately not many and I recommend it to everyone. It even managed to keep me awake a full night with no sleep. That should tell you something. I'm excited to be working on the voice acting for the patch, slated to be released next year and will work extra hard to make sure we give you the performace that really brings these characters to life.", "timestamp_created": 1460762790, "timestamp_updated": 1460934642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22438108": {"recommendationid": "22438108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288551775", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465270150}, "language": "english", "review": "90% of the (female) cast are composed of lolis!

Set in the near future of 2018, you have your highly intelligent but seemingly lazy, cynical and snarky male protagonist. You also have the female childhood friend love interest who stuck up for him in the past, helped him get through some past trauma and essentially stick to him like glue his entire life, whilst never actually confessing to him. You even have childhood friend number two, the female transfer student, and let's not forget the protagonist's male allies either;  the apparently aloof, warm-hearted and kind womanizing support character number 1, and support character number 2, the jock (although in his defence his grades are superb). Oh and of course the first female childhood friend has a female friend support character trying to match make the protagonist despite also having feel-\nOk, so you get the idea. As one of the characters say, the protagonist's school life seems like the perfect set up for a 'really crap anime'.\nThankfully, it is anything but.\nDespite the initial setup that might send warning signs of a 'cliche', 'boring' or 'generic' environment, the witty dialogue, references, memes and humorous character chemistry create a thoroughly entertaining and amusing experience. The dialogue is spectacular, which is probably partially due to the fact this is an original English story, but to the writers' credit, I'm still surprised by how good the dialogue is.  As you can probably tell, I really enjoyed this section of the game; the protagonist's snarky attitude reminded me of Yuuji from Grisaia with his internal dialogues, and the cutesy art and music meshed together pretty well to create a fun slice of life RomCom. \nExcept, of course, that's not what this VN is about. Or at least that's not the main driving force behind the plot. Even throughout this happy-go-lucky style of plot, there is an undercurrent of a darker, more mysterious and dangerous force at work, just in case you didn't notice from the store page screaming murder and mystery at you. And this is where the story really picks up and becomes more about the mystery, murder and detective aspect rather than the high school life of an ordinary student. We see more about the tragic past of the protagonist and his friends, and more foreboding of the murderer's intentions with the chilling music emphasizing the danger as we attempt to deduce who it is. However,  despite the transition into the faster paced plot driven 2nd half of the VN, the focus of the original story is never lost. That is to say, even with all the events in the plot building up climatically to the final showdown, there is always a focus on the main character, his relationships, his past and how he'll change for the better, which I think is a pretty good thing. Because if I had to pick one aspect of the game as a whole that I like the most I'd have to say the characters. Despite what I said about them coming off as generic and cliche at the start of the game, they develop and become fleshed-out, and they seem, believe it or not, human. Which is actually a big deal. They become relatable and pretty damn loveable, which is why they're my favourite part of Lucid9. \nWhat impresses me the most though is the fact that this is done without any monetary support. To be frank, I was expecting the lack of monetary funding to result in compromises whether it be in the technical elements like the settings/menu options or in the quality of the writing/art/music. But the art style fits the tone, the UI is polished and almost 40 tracks accompany the novel throughout, from the 'nostalgic emotional memory' feel to the 'imminent boss fight' feel, which really does enhance the effect of whatever may be going in the story at that time. For me, I usually place a lot more importance on the writing and art than anything else, but when all the other bits and pieces work, even I can appreciate what a difference they make to the overall quality. \nAnother technical element worth highlighting is the choice system, and the interactive aspect of the game in general. Some of the choices give access to new comedic scenes, CG arts or achievements but some of the others are more serious, dictating whether you reach the bad or 'true/good' end. I think a nice balance between difficulty and importance is achieved as a result, because it's pretty easy to either create meaningless choices or give options to a problem that is too tedious to solve by mistake. The few logic puzzles are an enjoyable aspect as they change the pace a bit and force you to think, but at the same time they're definitely accessible, and if you choose the wrong answer or the joke answer you're easily forgiven too. I'm eager to see more of them in the future since I suspect they will become more common in the individual heroine routes when the fundamental mystery plot is actually revealed.  \nI suppose the one gripe I have is that a technical feature that I think could be implemented is missing; a skip to the next choice feature, mostly for replaying + achievement/cg hunting. Personally I've never been that much of an achievement collector but I admit I get curious if I see a bunch of hidden achievements and missing CG art, enough to want to select the choices I didn't choose last time and see what happens. A skip to the next choice feature would help in that regard, rather than just using the ordinary skip function whilst making a lot of save points at all the choices.\nOverall though, I'm pretty damn impressed by Lucid9. I'll definitely be looking forward to both the voice patch and the heroine route patch, since this is only the beginning after all. This is easily in my top 6 VNs, and to be honest, if you've gotten this far in the review and still aren't sure whether to try it or not, just do it.

That alone not enough of an impression as to how recommendable this game is? Very well, keep reading!\n\nTHE DIALOGUE IS THE BEST I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. If I were to come out with it thus far, the dialogue is one of the strongest points for this entire visual novel. The balance between comedy and seriousness is very... well, balanced as well as well-written. The dialogue just perhaps IS the strongest point of Lucid9. I have had so many laugh-out-loud moments reading the dialogue as well as shudders of fear because of this dialogue and any and all implications. It's so well-written for each character as well as the protagonist's narration. Even the text messages. Good lord, the text messages.\n\nTHE WRITING OVERALL IS SO VERY DETAILED. I do not think I have been as impressed with writing in a visual novel in my whole life. As mentioned, I believe dialogue to be the strongest thing in Lucid9, but the aforementioned narration of the protagonist is just as amazing with how descriptive it can be. May I add that it never overstays its welcome, either. If there's something funny but fast being commented on, then the response in narration is short, snappy, and funny. If it's serious, you bet it'll switch to longer panel/novel sections to describe it. As aforementioned, I feel the balance is on point. It feels like conversation and thoughts in real life.\n\nTHE CHARACTERS ARE ALL THREE-DIMENSIONAL... DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY THINK FROM APPEARANCES. You may being seeing these cutesy anime waifus and pretty bishounen anime husbandos being like, \"ugh, I bet SHE'S gonna be all uguu kawaii desuuuuUUUU,\" or, \"ugh, I bet the protagonist is gonna be ALL ABOUT that harem lifestyle!\" No. Please. Please let me tell you that the characters are some of the most three-dimensional that I've ever seen. I can relate to many of the things the protagonist says, and can honestly feel like he... is human. He feels so human. And others around him feel human, too. Also believe me when I say they know what they're talking about here; these writers have knowledge in the cliches and tropes and popular trends of anime, pop culture, technology, and society when considering their characters and their interests, etc; they parody it frequently. (Or at least, I think so). So far, every single character has beat my original impressions based on appearances or introductions alone. I love everyone.\n\nTHE ART IS SOLID AND THE UI IS WELL ORGANIZED, STYLISTIC, AND CONSISTENT. Sprites are very pretty to look at! I prefer the male character art as opposed to the female style in this, but it's definitely right for those who want their cute waifus! The menus already (really, the title) can give off the tone this game wants to set and stays consistent all throughout. These 9 hours I have poored in definitely do stay comedic, but it almost feels like they want you to know what you're getting into. By the time you hit 'start,' you'll have an idea. The in-game menus (save, load, quit, etc.) are also much more effective than your usual visual novel. They are shortened to just icons in the corner of the screen and take up virtually no space so that the writing is put on the spotlight always.\n\nTHE MUSIC AND SOUND IS WELL-COMPOSED, CATCHY, AND VERY ATMOSPHERIC. The music the moment I got into the title screen is good, and again, sets a very specific... tone. The tracks are not too repetitve in my opinion unless your patience is short, and some of the more dramatic tracks are still on my brain right now. I'm no sound effects specialist or anything, but the sound effects are also very good. Please play with headphones on! The sounds of passing footsteps going from ear to ear is honestly lovely to hear as a touch.\n\nTHIS IS A FREE VISUAL NOVEL, BY THE WAY. IT'S FREE, and it goes FAR beyond my expectations for what a free visual novel usually contains. I have not gazed upon such a beauty of a visual novel in a very long time, especially being free. Have I mentioned that it's free? \n\nIF I HAD ONE CRITICISM, it might be the... setting. All of this feels particularly strange being set in Japan. Not that I am against it at all because it does remind you it's Japanese, but it feels so very westernized. I guess that's me just being nitpicky about Japanese names, honorifics, etc that may give those unfamiliar a hard time later on.\n\nEDIT:\nI did not take into consideration at the time of writing that this is supposed to be introductory towards visual novels, meaning good for beginners in the genre, but is as well for seasoned readers. Though my point is still accurate with how westernized it feels, I believe that it is more appropriate that this is westernized for such a cause. IF YOU DISLIKE JAPANESE NAME WESTERNIZATION(?)

Extremely well executed plot. Deep, flawed, very loveable, human like characters. Nice art (I'm too dumb to tell more than that). Notable BGM and some very polished minor details. FREE. FREE FREE FREE. Go play it.\n\nWarning though: INTENSE.\n\n\n\nFULL REVIEW:\n\nI went into this game figuring I'd play it a little bit at a time. It looked ok enough, at least.\n\nI marathoned it pretty much in one sitting. Skipped class to do it, too. It's THAT good. Even if you don't like the whole anime subculture, give it a shot. It dodges or parodies a lot of the cliches and presents a deep, thought provoking, and emotionally powerful story. If you DO like the anime subculture, you'll probably like it even more.\n\nThere's so much to be said about it... What a rollercoaster. \n\nVery mild spoilers below; I won't discuss specific events, but I might mention themes and such. Anything I say you can figure out from the description of the game.\n\n\nPLOT:\n\nIt seems like a nice, innocent little setting. High school, cute girls, blah blah slice of life.\n\nIt's not.\n\nThis is not to take away from the first part of the game; I enjoyed it. It was funny. About one third to half way through the story, though the plot gets more and more intense. It transitions from \"cute and enjoyable\" to \"powerful and meaningful.\"\n\nThe climax is absolute insanity; it's horrifically disturbing yet simultaneously exhilirating, fueled all the more by the sudden influx of decisions you have to make. Everything is connected very logically and coherently, however. It's not some random shift that leaves you scratching your head wondering how you got there. It's an inevitable build up that leaves you both anticipating and dreading your arrival at that point. The contrast between the first and last parts of the game really emphasize a feeling of breakdown. \n\nMore generally, the plot is extremely well constructed and paced. It never felt too fast or too slow, which is probably why it managed to retain my horribly short attention span for such a long period. It flows really well too, where one event easily leads into the next. The actual events of the plot are good, but nothing spectacular, but the way it's executed makes it fantastic. \n\nI loved the whole thing. Laughed like an idiot almost nonstop at the copious wit and comedy, raged at the insanity, cried when appropriate. It's an absolute rollercoaster, but so worth the ride. \n\nFair warning, though. It gets REALLY intense. And it really hurts sometimes. I liked the pain though. \nIf I have any complaint, it's that there were some plot points that I found disatisfying, as a player. I understand why they were made though. That doesn't mean I have to be happy about it. Lucid 9 unappolgetically proposes some very difficult themes and sticks to them. It's a story that has meaning.\n\nThe rest of the game HAS to come or I'll cry for real. \n\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nMy favorite part of any story. If I don't like the characters, I don't read. Simple as that.\n\nLucid 9 has really, really good characters.\n\nWhile they're obviously based on common anime archetypes, Lucid 9's characters transcend the cliches on which they were born. They're nuanced, fleshed out, very flawed, and so, so lovable. They feel very human and complex, in a way that almost no other anime or game I've seen has managed. You won't always agree with them. Actually, a lot of the time, you probably won't. But they're all the better for it. And most of the time, you'll laugh and cry with them anyways. Just don't try to write yourself into the story or expect them to be perfect. This ain't no utopia. \n\nAlso, the girls are cute. And the guys. So if you don't care about any of the stuff I just spouted, at least there's that.\n\n\nWRITING:\n\nThe writing is super smooth; this is very clearly a game that was originally written in english, not translated. I'm kind of a prose nerd, and some of the phrases gave me chills. The word-art is every bit as well done as the visual-art. \n\nIt's also hilarious and amazingly witty, especially in the beginning. At the end, when everything goes nuts, nothing feels cheesy, which is quite a feat in emotional scenes. I'm a very critical reader, but I had no issues with the writing. 10/10\n\nOh, and Gover Mecher is genius. Funniest satirical parody. \n\n\nART:\n\nIt's pretty. I like it. Sorry, I have the artistic talent of a brick. Go look at the pictures. You'll know if you like it or not.\n\n\nMUSIC:\n\nI don't notice the BGM in most games, but Lucid 9's really stood out to me for some reason. It manages to be catchy and noteworthy without overbearing, enough so that I felt inclined to include it as a seperate section.\n\n\nOTHER:\n\nThere are plenty of little things that make the game feel very polished and add a lot to the atmosphere. Simple things like phone animations, ocassional game-esque overlays, and flashing or faded UI contribute heavily to a scene without being ostentatious. It's not stuff I would have thought of, but there are some scenes that I can't imagine without them.\n\n\nVERDICT: \n\nExcellent game. Deep, provactive, but fun and enjoyable. I read through it in one sitting and I don't even like VNs. Those of you brave souls that DO will probably like it even more.  \n\nAlso, it's free. FREE. With far better production value than most commercial stories. You legit have nothing to lose. Except time, I guess. Which most of us will probably waste in worse ways anyways. \n\nDid I mention it's FREE?", "timestamp_created": 1460699835, "timestamp_updated": 1460700018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22420936": {"recommendationid": "22420936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298649395", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460707074}, "language": "schinese", "review": "this game is good!", "timestamp_created": 1460691069, "timestamp_updated": 1460691069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22420189": {"recommendationid": "22420189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253761967", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460856071}, "language": "english", "review": "one of my favorites in just a short time im impresed 10/10 would recommend", "timestamp_created": 1460686583, "timestamp_updated": 1460686583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451657", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22419334": {"recommendationid": "22419334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024342128", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499128065}, "language": "english", "review": "Is it good?.Yes\nIs it the typical anime bullshit cliche?.Yes and no\nDoes it point those cliches?.Yeah many times\nDoes contain Nudity?.Sadly no so keep your pants.\nDoes it contain kawaii characters?.ohh yeah very very.\nAnnoying characters?.Like any other visual novel about highschoolers.\n\nThe Word Foot or feet its used so much that the game should be called Foot Fetish visual novel with a theme of japanese.", "timestamp_created": 1460681490, "timestamp_updated": 1460751315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532403", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22419166": {"recommendationid": "22419166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211290956", "num_games_owned": 1608, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460680396}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun free game.

But how good is it? This is what I think of Hexcells Infinite.\n\nVery good, in fact. As you would expect with a third entry it is the most feature complete and the best experience, in my opinion. It strikes a nice balance between the last two games in terms of difficulty and with it's random generator, you can play this game indefinitely. Everything you have come to expect from Hexcells is here, and it's brilliant. \n\nLike before, your task remains the same; clear the board by colouring or deleting hexes, using the set rules of the game. You know the drill, troops. I think this title does a better job of mixing in all kinds of puzzles in terms of difficulty. For instance, I really struggled with one but afterward I didn't have any problems with the one after that. In Hexcells Plus it would have bludgeoned you to death daring you to take it on with your logic. My logic sucks. So no surprises I enjoyed this one more. There are fiendishly difficult puzzles though, don't worry about that. \n\nThe real reason why I love this one the most though is the random generator. This thing is awesome. It uses an eight digit seed to randomly assign you new puzzles at the click of a mouse. You could even feasibly play just one every day using the different dates as the seed. Simple but brilliant. I often log in and play five or so at a time, listening to music and just relaxing. The random puzzles aren't as hard as the hand-crafted ones, or as unique, but you occasionally get one that keeps you on your toes, just to make sure you're paying attention. Love it.\n\nOther cool little features include in-level saving. I never realized this was needed until it was there. Now you can exit a puzzle anytime and pick up when you play again. Simple and effective. Also, the area of effect hexes(as I like to call them,) now have a toggle so the area that appears is outlined by a black line. This makes it much easier to see hexes in the zone without squinting. Excellent. \n\nOverall, this is the best Hexcells experience. With 36 puzzle of its own, and with its random generator, there is enough here to keep you occupied for some time. I have no doubt this will remain my favourite puzzles game, and I'm a little sad there is no more Hexcells. In the meantime, however, I'll continue solving random puzzles and having a blast. Do yourself a favour and pick this one up. You won't regret it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1514633528, "timestamp_updated": 1514633528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595376", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38853025": {"recommendationid": "38853025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043118900", "num_games_owned": 565, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "last_played": 1514626617}, "language": "german", "review": "Spielt sich exakt wie Minesweeper, das Gratis-Windows-Spiel von windows 98, nur mit Hexagons.\nF\u00fcr 5 Euro v\u00f6llig \u00fcberteuert, im Sale f\u00fcr 1,50 f\u00fcr Liebhaber vertretbar.

The menu just felt broken in general, with clipped text and overlapping elements. Difficulty-wise, Infinite is on par with Plus - much tougher than the original game, but unlike previous games, there was at least one puzzle that required a 50-50 guess to complete. I looked at the last couple of unopened cells every which way and there were simply not enough clues to deduce where the blue cells hide, which is disappointing in a puzzle game. The only real addition is a random puzzle generator, and it is rather underwhelming. All of the puzzles I generated were pretty much identical blobs of cells that were far too easy to solve and got repetitive very fast.

They also added the infinitely generated puzzle feature. Nice.\n\nThe game is essentially minesweeper with better defined rules, less rng, and paths that go off on thier own that aren't shaped like squares. This means you can work through your checklist of math rules a certain row has, and once you finish that row the new information you have will help you solve other rows of the equation. The branching paths were cool, but sometimes the puzzles got so big that it took a really long time to work through a branch and once i was done i would still have like 5 other paths to work on, which can be pretty exhausting. \n\nThe repeat in mechanics really knocks the game down a peg. A big part of why a puzzle is interesting is because it's new; having to work with new problems and rulesets is a big part of why the game is fun. The more i play this puzzle game, the less i enjoy it because it feels exactly the same as the last game.\n\nThe no mistakes requirements to unlock new levels also really got on my nerves this time around. Making players constantly have to resolve puzzles they already worked through is frusterating and i found it to be a big turn off from the game.

Not sure how I feel about the infinite puzzle generator, which is the only reason I'm writing this. Obviously they aren't going to be as challenging or complex as the main levels, but some of them are incredibly easy and extremely repetitive.

It's difficult to explain, but the latter is far easier and typically much larger in addition to being more common. As a daily thing it isn't too bad, but the sameyness of the generator really starts to show after a while. If you're considering ignoring the other two titles in favor of the infinite generator, I wouldn't really recommend it.

This game has both premade puzzles, on a fair learning curve of difficulty, and a procedural generation system that presumably is capable of generating an additional 100,000,000 different puzzles. This solves the replay issue of the previous games, and also includes a save feature (letting you leave a puzzle and come back without having to start over), and the option to swap your mouse buttons (which is critical if you're a Minesweeper player as the default \"safe\" or \"flag\" buttons are opposite). And just as HexCells Plus increased the size and complexity of puzzles compared to HexCells, HexCells Infinite increases them even more, so that save function is a lifesaver on the later puzzles.\n\nAnd yes, this is a Minsweeper style puzzle game, but because the levels are premade they progress on a fair learning curve and are all 100% logic solvable with no guessing required, ever. At the risk of sounding condescending, if you're reading a negative review by someone who says guessing is required, they just couldn't logic the puzzle out. I was able to logic solve them all, and when I did make an error, I was able to figure out what error in logic I had made, or what I had failed to notice, that caused my mistake. The game lets you make a few mistakes without failing you on the level, but as a perfectionist I restarted from scratch each time, and was able to clear them all.\n\nEven the procedurally generated \"Infinite\" levels seem to follow the 100% solvable rule, I've done about 20 so far and had no problems, and in each I could see what are probably the base elements of coding that ensure the levels are solvable. There are often multiple - or as I see it, overlapping - ways to prove many of the cells as safe or not, which I'm guessing comes from the failsafe coding. The downside to this is they tend to be fairly easy, even the really large puzzles (the generator makes them in multiple sizes as well as configurations) have none of the complex logic required to beat the higher premade levels.\n\nThe only downsides I see are:\n1. Because this is a standalone game, it has tutorial style puzzles to teach the mechanics of the various logic rules, but if you're already familiar with the series you'll solve them almost instantly.\n2. There's still no \"maybe\" flag, so any \"what if\" analysis you do has to be in your head or on paper, and with the complexity of some of the puzzles, this is an ever bigger problem here than it was in the earlier games int he series.\n\nFully recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1502151721, "timestamp_updated": 1502151721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34055709": {"recommendationid": "34055709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011142637", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484635794}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth the 2 dollars and some i paid for it, a fantastic little puzzle game", "timestamp_created": 1502009573, "timestamp_updated": 1502009573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34020684": {"recommendationid": "34020684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036851146", "num_games_owned": 557, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492165263}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]10/10 Basicly the same as the normal Hexcells, but better then Hexcells Plus[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]Graphics: 9/10 [i]the colors got me dizzy after long sessions[/i]\n[*]Music: -/10 [i]disabled[/i]\n[*]Performance: 10/10\n[*]Cinematics: -/10\n[*]Story: -/10\n[*]Content: 10/10 [i]it's I N F I N I T E[/i]\n[*]Controls: 10/10 [i]two buttons[/i]\n[*]Gameplay: 8/10\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1501868793, "timestamp_updated": 1501869521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563758", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34010604": {"recommendationid": "34010604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018969559", "num_games_owned": 533, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510723171}, "language": "english", "review": "My friend sold this to me as \"Minesweeper but actually difficult and no guessing\".

This game differs from the previous game in that it now includes a puzzle generator and the ability to save the progress of a game.  So, once finished with its 36 built in puzzles, you can play an infinite number of generated puzzles (hence the name), and when you get brain-fatigue in the middle of a big puzzle, you can quit without losing your progress.  As with \"Hexcells Plus,\" \"Infinite\" jumps right in and ramps right up.  The game is excellent and all puzzles are solvable without guessing.  The save ability is especially useful because some of these puzzles are huge (puzzle 6-8 took me about 3 hours to complete).  My only real complaint is that some of the puzzles are still too big (even though they can be saved).  With exception of completing 60 randomly generated puzzles to get the final Achievement, finishing the game with all the rest of the Achievements took 19.8 hours.

And it is.\nHere is a quick answer for those who are bothered by this problem.\nThese \"random\" stages, as you can see on the generating page, are generated from a certain seed. \nIf you don't understand what this seed stands for, don't bother. Just FYI, a certain seed can only generate one certain pattern of Hexcell puzzle. This explains why you sometimes see repeated puzzles. Well, I guess the one you see most times is the one generated by those zeroes, lol.\n\nAnyway, I am not able to explain the algorithm how a Hexcell puzzle is generated from a seed.

Aside from the 36 campaign puzzles (that sprinkle in a few tutorials to explain the core concepts) Infinite has an infinite more (well, 999,999,999 mode to be more precise). Obviously infinite mode gives the player a lot of value and replay ability as most of these puzzles (I've done 60 of them) take between 2-15 minutes. The option to use the date as a seed is a nice touch for daily playing.\n\nInfinite added a much needed save feature: maintaining the progress of your current campaign or infinite level. I say needed because some of the campaign levels can take a long time to solve (a few clock in at well over an hour during first playthrough). This also resets all the available information which is great if you accidentally or foolishly turned off some vital clue.\n\nI give credit to the sound design. Aside from the pleasant music, revealing hexes produce one of several different musicle cues. It's just a nice touch to engage the player and give a bit of variation.\n\nMy only complaints are that highlighting columns and particularly blue hexes) to give information can sometimes make it difficult to see elements of the game. Several times the faint flashing  against the white backdrop almost blends in which may lead to mistakes. As for mistakes, while there is no guessing in the game, it can be a bit of a chore to put an hour into a level only to have a misclick force a restart (but no one said achievements are supposed to be easy).\n\nHexcells infinite gives some strong improvements over past iterations while keeping the core mechanics in tact.

It's a far superior puzzle game than the Hexcells trilogy, and is a game that actually challenges your problem solving skills.\n\nNow onto Hexcells Infinite.\n\nThe idea of different types of hints comparing to minesweeper is refreshing, there are 3 types of additional hints besides the number of adjacent blue hexes: \n1) Number of blue hexes in a column\n2) Consecutive or non-consecutive blue hexes in adjacent hexes/column\n3) Number of blue hexes in 2 hex radius\n\nHowever the freshness of new ideas runs out extremely quickly, and there will be no more new mechanics from that point on - the game becomes extremely repetitive, with few exceptions.\n\nThere are 2 methods the developer adopts to make this game challenging:\n1) Reduce redundant information to bare minimum, by giving you non-blue hexes with question mark instead of an actual number. In my eyes, all this does is to make the levels long, and extremely unsatisfying to solve. It doesn't really pose interesting challenges, instead it just creates dead ends and forces you to move to somewhere else. When you have a board with over 400 hexes, it gets extremely annoying and frustrating to click on that one non-blue hex only to see a question mark.\n2) Create extremely large levels that take over half an hour to complete (if your goal is to make 0 mistakes) - or significantly longer if you are not a fast thinker. Many levels include completely independent sections which would have served much better as multiple smaller levels. Instead of keep creating interesting mechanics, the only variation becomes the overall shape of each level. It's quite sad to see a promising idea dying so quickly, it's like a novel with amazing first 3 chapters, but 20 more boring and mundane long chapters after, ruining the entire book.\n\nThe way this game works, is for the player to slowly exhaust all the available information to determine which ones are blue hexes. But because there are only 4 types of information, it really doesn't require that much problem solving skills or creativity. Most later campaign levels feel like chores, and you are forced to do them slowly. At some point you might be forced to take a guess, and seeing the 0 mistake jumping to 1, ruining your perfect record, is quite infuriating.\n\n\nThe game has nice audio, however there are some minor technical issues:\n1) Regardless of which monitor is selected to play the game in windowed mode, the game would always launch across all monitors.

I'm not much of a puzzle game fan though I really like logic problems which this definitely caters to. It's super interesting to see how the puzzles develop over time as you learn more and more principles about the mechanics of the puzzles. I also like that there's only one right answer but multiple ways to go about solving the puzzle; you can go at your own pace and take any direction you wish. If you get stuck, just look at a new area of the puzzle and you might have new information since your last visit.\n\nThe instructions to hexcells are a little vague, so definitely take your time on the first instruction puzzle of each series and don't worry about finishing without mistakes the first go around. The most important lesson is that marking hexes grey can sometimes be just as important, if not more important, as marking hexes blue. Keep that in mind and you'll have a great time.\n\nIf you are new to the hexcells series -- this is the one to get. I haven't tested the other standard levels, but this one offers longterm replayability that the other two games don't by adding a custom levels feature. Reddit.com's /r/hexcells and /r/hexcellslevels are great tools for finding cool community-created levels as well as installing plugins to make applications of the levels faster and easier. Hexcells Infinite also comes with a new puzzle a day and a random puzzle feature. I will warn you that the random hex puzzles are rather easy to complete, often giving a ton of information for free without needing any moves, and don't give the same satisfaction completing them that finishing the base set does. I will definitely be purchasing the other two hexcells games to get my puzzle fix soon.\n\nAs for value, I beat 36 included levels in about 11 hours according to steam, though I've played the game sometimes without launching steam so I'm not sure if it tracked everything. I'd say the total is closer to 20 hours for the base levels, and I expect to probably sink another 20 or so hours playing custom levels and the new daily puzzle. For $5 that's a steal, I paid like a buck and a half on sale which is highway robbery. \n\nTo the developer, if you made new levels in a DLC I'd definitely buy it! I would also humbly suggest a way to play this in the dark like SquareCells has, spent a lot of late nights burning my eyes out with this game :)", "timestamp_created": 1489772156, "timestamp_updated": 1489772732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30566049": {"recommendationid": "30566049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102408722", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508393896}, "language": "english", "review": "Yep.", "timestamp_created": 1489744611, "timestamp_updated": 1489744611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30564258": {"recommendationid": "30564258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352638818", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513063763}, "language": "english", "review": "Delete all puzzle games you may have in your library because Hexcells Infinite is the only one that you need in your life.", "timestamp_created": 1489733514, "timestamp_updated": 1489733594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506782", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30515332": {"recommendationid": "30515332", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989273094", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492217578}, "language": "english", "review": "The thrid in the Hexcells series, Hexcells Infinite is a refreshing addition to this line of minesweeper inspired puzzle packs. The original Hexcells was refreshing and fun whilst Hexcells Plus was, at times, exceedingly tedious with some of the puzzle designs. The tedium of Plus--as generally caused by a little too much \"mucking around\" with the blue cell counter mechanics on some puzzles, is not replicated in Hexcells Infinite. Hexcells Infinite, unlike it's predecessors does have some capacity for random puzzle generation. Although, thus far, the randomly generated puzzles are not as complex as many of the prefab puzzles in the \"story set\"--for lack of a better term--they remain fun and the seed system does afford sufficient depth of puzzles able to be generated to afford extensive diversionary and casual replay value.\n\nThe soundset remains relaxed and in sync with the previous titles and the controls remain identical as well.\n\nMy greatest irritation remains with perfecting each puzzle--which is to say, the instant one makes a mistake, to erase that mistake one must start the entire puzzle from scratch. This is perfectly fine, in terms of design overall, but I have found myself, at times, forgetting which button tags a blue cell and which uncovers a yellow cell--resulting in stupid mistakes and thus having to redo an entire puzzle from scratch. An undo function, allowing for a single mistake to be back-tracked once per puzzle would remove the occassional misclick irritation of having to restart a puzzle you already know how to do but were \"clumsy\" in regards to inputs.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent program, surpassing it's two predecessors in replayability, and would be enjoyed by any fan of minesweeperesque puzzle games.

Hexcells ist eine Art Minesweeper-Variation nur mit hexagonalen, also sechseckigen, Spielfeldern. Es gibt auch keinen echten Niederlage-Zustand. Das Spielfeld ist zun\u00e4chst meist komplett gelb, ihr versucht anhand der Informationen, die ihr habt die Felder in schwarze Felder und blaue Felder einzuteilen. Fehler werden gez\u00e4hlt. Die schwarzen Felder haben Zahlen in ihnen, die angeben, wie viele angrenzende Felder blaue Felder sind. \n\nZum Zeitpunkt des Reviews gibt es drei Hexcells-Spiele: Hexcells, Hexcells Plus und Hexcells Infinite. Der erste Teil hat mich laut Steam etwa 2 Stunden gebraucht bis zur Vollendung, Plus etwa 4, Infinite etwa eine, allerdings habe ich die letzten beiden Spiele nicht abgeschlossen. Dieser Review beschreibt alle drei Spiele, weil die sich sehr \u00e4hnlich sind. Nicht alle Elemente der sp\u00e4teren Spiele sind in den fr\u00fcheren. So enth\u00e4lt Infinite einen Zufallsgenerator f\u00fcr Level, der euch quasi unendlich viele Level zur Verf\u00fcgung stellt, die ihr l\u00f6sen k\u00f6nnt. Die fr\u00fcheren beiden Spiele haben das nicht. Plus ist meiner Ansicht nach der schwierigste Teil der Serie. \n\nDas Prinzip von Hexcells ist recht einfach, aber es kommen noch weitere Elemente hinzu. So stehen Zahlen an den Spalten, bzw. an den Kanten von Sechsecken, die angeben, wie viele blaue Felder in der Reihe sind. Zahlen in geschweiften Klammern stehen daf\u00fcr, dass die blauen Felder definitiv komplett verbunden sind, mit Minuszeichen an der Seite daf\u00fcr, dass die Felder nicht alle verbunden sind (wenigstens ein Feld steht ab). Sp\u00e4ter kommen noch Zahlen in blauen Feldern hinzu, die angeben, wie viele blaue Felder in der Umgebung von zwei Feldern sind, und schwarze Felder mit Fragezeichen drin, d.h. ohne Angabe, wie viele blaue Felder in der Nachbarschaft liegen. \n\nDie R\u00e4tselspiele steuern sich gut, mit einer Taste (bei mir linke Maustaste) deklariert ihr das aktuell mit dem Cursor \u00fcberfahrene Feld als schwarz, mit einer anderen (bei mir rechte Maustaste) als blau. Weiter k\u00f6nnt ihr noch die Hilfestellungszahlen an den R\u00e4ndern und in blauen Feldern ausgrauen, um zu markieren, dass die f\u00fcr euch keine Bedeutung mehr haben, weil ihr die Reihe bspw. schon gel\u00f6st habt. Ziel des Spiels ist es die R\u00e4tsel fehlerfrei zu l\u00f6sen um die Maximalzahl an blauen Dreiecken zu erhalten. Mit denen schaltet ihr neue R\u00e4tsel frei. Es gibt in den drei Spielen jeweils sechs Welten mit jeweils sechs R\u00e4tseln, Infinite bietet den Zufallsgenerator, d\u00fcrfte damit der klare Gewinner sein, wenn es um Inhalt geht. \n\nDas Spiel wirkt von der Optik her sehr klar, sehr rein, sehr stilsicher. Auch die Hintergrundmusik passt perfekt zum Spiel. Sehr ruhige T\u00f6ne, die den Spielfluss gut unterstreichen. Jedes Mal, wenn ihr ein Feld aufdeckt macht das Spiel einen Ton - das passt einfach zusammen.\n\nHexcells ist ein cooles kleines Spiel, was euch f\u00fcr ein paar Stunden unterhalten wird. Wer auf R\u00e4tsel steht, macht mit den Spielen der Serie nichts falsch. Meiner Ansicht nach ist der Erstling der einfachste, damit ein guter Startpunkt f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger, wer sich nur eines der Spiele kaufen will, sollte zu Infinite greifen, weil dort durch den Zufallsgenerator noch etwas mehr Inhalt geboten wird.", "timestamp_created": 1488731043, "timestamp_updated": 1488731043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30336766": {"recommendationid": "30336766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046172633", "num_games_owned": 710, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "last_played": 1514820220}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0422\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 Hexcells.\n\n[u]\u0418\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439[/u]\n\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044f\u0445, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a \u0438\u0449\u0435\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u044b\u0435 \u044f\u0447\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438-\u043c\u0438\u043d\u044b, \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044f \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044b\u0445 \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0445 -

If too much time is spent walking the player through the gameplay, not enough time can be spent on levels that challenge all of the aspects the player had to learn to make it that far.  \n\nThe last few levels were quite challenging, and I was happy to tackle and master them.  All of them could be solved logically without guessing, but it took me some time working out what combination of information available to me would let me click or destroy the next block.  One aspect I was immensely thankful for was that the developers put in a level save feature, so whatever progress you made already could be saved for later, giving you a chance to take a break and come back to the place you had got stuck on.  You could jump inbetween levels, making progress until you hit a roadblock, and then switch your focus somewhere else.  It helped me tremendously.  \n\nWhat ices the cake for me and gives this title the most value out of the others is that there is a puzzle generator for this game.  Very similar to how you can find websites to solve nigh infinite combinations of Sudoku puzzles, you can generate all of the puzzles you could ever want to do for this game.  The only flaw is that the puzzles are immensely easier than the ones with a human touch, and there's no way to select if you want a smaller, easier puzzle or a larger, more difficult puzzle.  It's all randomly generated with no way to set parameters for the puzzle you get (unless you look up specific codes, if there would be any of those listed somewhere in the first place).  Either way, I have enjoyed the trilogy, and can always come back to this one in the series if I want to play new puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1484700968, "timestamp_updated": 1484700968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29292113": {"recommendationid": "29292113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313955074", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511705300}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u626b\u96f7\u3002\u953b\u70bc\u5927\u8111\uff0c\u953b\u70bc\u903b\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6709\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\u771f\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u5de7\u5999\uff0c\u6bd4\u626b\u96f7\u8981\u597d\u73a9\u5f97\u591a\u3002\u800c\u4e14\u6709\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u591a\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e00\u76f4\u73a9\u4e0b\u53bb\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5de6\u53f3\u952e\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u70b9\u53cd\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u70b9\u9519\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1484556874, "timestamp_updated": 1484556909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29277865": {"recommendationid": "29277865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150367736", "num_games_owned": 687, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476568464}, "language": "french", "review": "Aussi hardu qu'Hexcells plus, et contient un mode avec des milliers de niveau pour ceux qui ne sont pas rassasi\u00e9s.

Ziel des Spiels ist es alle Felder aufzudecken. Diese k\u00f6nnen entweder Blau sein oder Grau sein und dann Informationen \u00fcber die Anzahl benachbarter blauer Felder enthalten. Durch diese Information werden dann benachbarte Felder systematisch nach dem Ausschlussprinzip aufgedeckt. Zus\u00e4tzlich wird durch Zahlen au\u00dferhalb der Felder angezeigt, wie viele blaue Felder sich in einer Linie befinden. Seit dem zweiten Teil der Serie, gibt es zus\u00e4tzlich Informationen \u00fcber die angrenzenden Felder auch in blauen Feldern. Jedoch beschr\u00e4nkt sich die angezeigte Zahl nicht auf die 6 direkt anliegenden Felder sondern auf 18 umliegende Felder, also quasi 2 Kreise um das Feld herum. In Hexcells Infinite sind viele Puzzle nur \u00fcber gegenseitigen Ausschluss zu l\u00f6sen, was die Komplexit\u00e4t und damit die Schwierigkeit enorm erh\u00f6ht.\n\nFalls man mehr als einen Fehler in einem Level macht, bekommt man Punkte abgezogen. Am Ende des Levels erh\u00e4lt man dann eine f\u00fcr das Level festgesetzte Anzahl Punkte. Wenn man nicht alle Punkte freischaltet muss man das Level noch einmal machen und mit nur einem Fehler bestehen. Mit einer gewissen Anzahl Punkten kann man dann immer 6 neue Level freischalten bis insgesamt alle 30 Level freigeschaltet sind.\n\nZus\u00e4tzlich gibt es in diesem Teil der Serie einen Levelgenerator, der bis zu 1 Millionen verschiedene Level generieren kann und somit die Mischung aus einfachen, schweren, symmetrischen, chaotischen und in Mustern angeordneten Leveln durch eine riesige Anzahl zuf\u00e4lliger Level abgerundet und dadurch die Wiederspielbarkeit massiv erh\u00f6ht.\n\nDa Hexcells ein abwechslungsreiches und auch auf gewisse Weise sch\u00f6nes R\u00e4tselspiel ist, dass sich mit etwas Ruhe und Geduld gut bew\u00e4ltigen l\u00e4sst, kann ich es sehr empfehlen. Der Preis ist recht g\u00fcnstig und die Errungenschaften sind in diesem, dritten Teil der Serie, mit viel Geduld und etwas Ausdauer gut zu erreichen.\n\nIch empfehle, dass Hexcells Complete Pack zu kaufen, da die Schwierigkeitskurve bei Hexcells Infinite sehr steil ist und das Puzzle ohne zumindest Hexcells Plus gemeistert zu haben schnell sehr schwer und dadurch frustrierend werden kann. Der Preisvorteil des Complete-Packs gegen\u00fcber dem Einzelkauf der Spiele ist ein weiterer Grund f\u00fcr das Pack. Besonders im SALE ist das Complete Pack durch seinen geringen Preis ein tolles Geschenk f\u00fcr Fans von Logik-Puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1484333842, "timestamp_updated": 1484333842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29222252": {"recommendationid": "29222252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024050400", "num_games_owned": 446, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484309284}, "language": "english", "review": "Very much like chess, only that you play against the best, ie. yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1484309357, "timestamp_updated": 1484309357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507657", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29211250": {"recommendationid": "29211250", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970934254", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502922871}, "language": "english", "review": "I have really enjoyed this series.

You're going to hear comparisons to Minesweeper, but I can assure you that the differences are enough that you might love this game even if Minesweeper isn't your thing.\n\nThat's certainly the case for me. To start with, there is never a need to guess. Every puzzle has all the clues you need. Now, admittedly, guessing can sometimes be fun and fulfilling, but this is the kind of game where if you fail, it isn't because of the random flip of a coin, but because you didn't pay close enough attention.\n\nThat's what I love about this game: It is a pure logic test that does great things for exercising your brain. The first couple of worlds introduce you to the rules. After you've got the rules, though, the priceless part of the game is the random puzzle generation that will make a seemingly endless stream of puzzles.\n\nIt isn't without problems, though. The music gets to be a bit much, fortunately you can turn it off. There are surprising UI elements missing. You can't advance through the game numbers (seeds) in a linear fashion, unless you're willing to remember your 8-digit numbers yourself. Even so, I'm not sure how random the random system really is, since I SWEAR I've replayed some of the games.  Some players might appreciate a hint system.\n\nAll that aside, though, it is a very enjoyable puzzle game, and is likely to go on my list of puzzle games that take all my time.", "timestamp_created": 1483686237, "timestamp_updated": 1483753127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29039887": {"recommendationid": "29039887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013698729", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483609156}, "language": "polish", "review": "Hexcells Infinite od poprzednich cz\u0119\u015bci r\u00f3\u017cni si\u0119 ma\u0142ymi usprawnieniami  i generatorem poziom\u00f3w.

Gameplay is (as others have noted) reminiscent of Sudoku and Minesweeper. The puzzles themselves arent very hard, and to my knowledge have no life system other than the fact that you get rewards based on how few mistakes you make. This system works very well and is very easy to understand the mechanics of the game with its \"do it to learn it\" tutorials.\nThis game has my praise as being a simple brain teaser, and I recommend it for this reason. It does its job and it does it well. Everything else below this is annoyances I have however, as this is a game about following the limited rules, and trying to do as well as possible. Some of the rules introduced, however, limit your ability to use your brain however and this peeves the hell out of me.\nAn annoying point for this system is that 1 mistake might be no lost points in some levels, while other more difficult puzzles might be that 2 mistakes is 2 lost points. Another issue I have with this is the need for guessing, in a system that gives its credits based on mistakes made. This game REQUIRES you to guess all the time, even in the first few levels even. And what I mean by guessing is that instead of intellectually plotting out your course, you are required to take a stand and say \"well at least its just 50/50.\" And this is exacerbated by the \"?\" buttons. There is a level where there are ROWS of these unknown buttons, making it impossible to go around and therefore impossible to know how to move on without guessing. Turning this puzzle game of intelligence into a bit of a dick. And then theres the fact that the blocks you fill in as correct dont have numbers on them too.

Every black cell showing you how many blue cells are around the currnet black cell. you can't mark more blue cells than the black one showing you. But this is just the basics. during the levels you will discover more rules that will make the puzzle harder.\n\nIn conclusion, a really good puzzle game, desined very well, just mark the orange cells while listening to the relaxing in-game music or just play it while listening to your own music (recomended). train your brain and clear your mind.\n\nbtw, sorry for bad English.",

I won't spoil the fun of working them out for you though.\n\nSpeaking about the new and different ways of locating the mines, the main campaign of pre-defined set levels slowly introduce these new mechanics to players while explaining the methods you can use these to solve the puzzles. This starts with the basics so that even a novice easily start to play and goes all the way up to some really challenging tests towards the end with the final puzzle taking hours to complete. Luckily this game auto saves constantly so you can ways come back to where you left off.\n\nHexcells Infinite is probably the best of out the 3 current Hexcells games due to the new Infinite mode (that wasn't in the previous 2 games) which randomly generates new levels so there's always something to come back to or continue on after the main campaign is completed. \n\nAs you can see in the screenshots on this store page it has a nice minimalist look with both light & dark setting so that you're not blinded by that white blackground all the time. \nIt runs very well on any PC that I've had no matter the specs low or high.

F\u00fcr erstere mag ich das Spiel ganz ausdr\u00fccklich, f\u00fcr die anderen halte ich das Spiel f\u00fcr schlecht.\n\nDas R\u00e4tsel sind (oder sollten es sein) reine Logikr\u00e4tsel, bei denen man mit Hilfe und beginnend mit den vorgegebenen Hinweisen die Felder mit unbekannten Inhalt als Blau (\"Mine\") oder Schwarz (\"Leer\") kennzeichnet. Die dazu n\u00f6tigen logischen Schl\u00fcsse k\u00f6nnen einfacher oder komplexer Natur sein.\n\nEs ist vergleichbar mit Sudoku, wo es auch einfache oder komplexe R\u00e4tsel gibt. Bei letzteren muss man vielerlei \u00dcberlegungen anstellen, bis man gewisse Schl\u00fcsse definitiv ziehen kann und damit weitere Hinweise auf die verbliebenen Felder erh\u00e4lt.\n\nAber wie bei Sudoku sollte es nie passieren, dass man keine definitven Schl\u00fcsse mehr ziehen kann und also mehre alternative L\u00f6sungsm\u00f6glichkeiten \u00fcbrig bleiben.\n\nGenau dies ist aber bei in etwa der H\u00e4lfte der R\u00e4tsel der Fall. Bei einigen dieser R\u00e4tsel k\u00f6nnte es, das sei zugegeben, noch sein, dass mit au\u00dferordentlich komplexen \u00dcberlegungen noch weitere Schl\u00fcsse gezogen werden k\u00f6nnen (welchen Spa\u00df hat man da noch daran? Man bedenke, z.B. 30 Minen auf 70 Felder verteilen und jeweils pr\u00fcfen, ob die Randbedingungen erf\u00fcllt sind, ohne zu wissen, ob eine eindeutige L\u00f6sung existiert, ist eine Lebensaufgabe), bei den meisten bin ich mir aber verdammt sicher, dass sie nicht eindeutig l\u00f6sbar sind.\n\nDass es nur eine einzige, vom Spiel akzeptierte L\u00f6sung gibt, das sollte klar sein, hilft da nicht aus der Bredoullie. Das w\u00e4re ja wie beim Sudoku, wenn man die L\u00f6sung nachbl\u00e4tert und daraus schlie\u00dft, dass das Sudoku eine eindeutige L\u00f6sung hat.\n\nSo sehr mich genau die R\u00e4tsel begeistert haben, wo man gerade so mit viel \u00dcberlegung eine eindeutige L\u00f6sung finden konnte, finde ich es insgesamt schlecht, wenn dies m.E. bei etwa jedem zweiten R\u00e4tsel nicht m\u00f6glich ist.\n\nDas Spiel enth\u00e4lt nun auch zufallsgenerierte R\u00e4tsel. Das ist grunds\u00e4tzlich schon mal gut, weil so der R\u00e4tselspa\u00df verl\u00e4ngert werden kann. Andererseits sollte dies doch zeigen, dass die Entwickler ein Computerprogramm zur Erstellung der R\u00e4tsel verwendeten. Ob sie dies auch bei den 36 vorgegebenen R\u00e4tseln taten, weiss ich nicht. Aber um so mehr frage ich mich, wie es passieren konnte, dass einige R\u00e4tsel nicht eindeutig l\u00f6sbar sind.\n\nDie Spielidee und die \"guten\", meist anspruchsvollen R\u00e4tsel sind, wie gesagt, aber sehr gut.\n\nDer Spielstand eines R\u00e4tsel wird nun (im Gegensatz zu den Vorg\u00e4ngern) sogar gespeichert, aber nicht in der Form, dass man dahin zur\u00fcck kommt, wenn man sich beim R\u00e4tsel vergallopiert hat, sondern nur inder Form, die eine Pause beim Spielen erlaubt ohne bei der n\u00e4chsten Sitzung das R\u00e4tsel neu beginnen zu m\u00fcssen.\n\nPro & Contra:\n\n+ Sehr gute Spielidee\n+ Viele gute, anspruchsvolle R\u00e4tsel\n\n- Viele nicht eindeutig l\u00f6sbare R\u00e4tsel\n\nWegen der M\u00e4ngel im R\u00e4tseldesign (die zumindest den Spielspa\u00df t\u00f6ten, wenn sie auftreten) kann ich das Spiel trotz der guten Spielidee und vieler guter R\u00e4tsel nicht empfehlen. Dennoch kann das Spiel teilweise sehr gefallen.\n\n[i]Falls mir jemand aufzeigt, wie alle R\u00e4tsel durch Logik l\u00f6sbar sind, ohne einen Computer in Anspruch zu nehmen, w\u00e4re ich interessiert daran, dazu zu lernen.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1479250145, "timestamp_updated": 1479250487, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.399303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26611287": {"recommendationid": "26611287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076916370", "num_games_owned": 4159, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479272246}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e09\u90e8\u66f2\u662f\u6211\u73a9\u8fc7\u6700\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u5927\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002\n\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6210\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u590d\u5237\u540c\u4e00\u5173\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1479192134, "timestamp_updated": 1490189957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26545470": {"recommendationid": "26545470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051443766", "num_games_owned": 1225, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474593331}, "language": "english", "review": "This review is written for Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite\n[h1]Hexagonal Puzzler[/h1]\n[b]Reviewed after completing all achievements[/b]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nHexcells plays like an average 2d puzzle games, you click your mouse to solve the puzzles not hard.

This is because this game has a 'perfect' rating, in which there must be no missclicks on a puzzle to actually complete it for the achievements.

That having been said, there is a LOT here.  The Level progression seems a bit more erratic than previous ones - some of the puzzles in Chapter 6 are easier than previous puzzles you encounter - but that isn't too much of a drawback in the grand scheme.  I've barely tapped into the \"random\" puzzle generator (reputed to be 1,000,000 puzzles at your reach) and that is really where the meat of the title is; be aware that the Level campaign of Hexcells Infinite took significantly less time for me to complete than Hexcells Plus (roughly half the time!).  If you don't plan to play the random levels that may be something to keep in mind, but I would still wholeheartedly recommend the game regardless.  \n\nOn Mac the game ran extremely smooth with no hiccups, freezes, or CTD.

Gives a minesweeper kind of feel, which adds in more puzzle enhancements as you progress through the levels. Starts off very basic so that you get a feel for the game, and then you look up and all you want to do is perfect all the levels. So the games goes, there are a few blocks with numbers on the board and you have to puzzle out whether the block is another number or a blue block. The block has 6 sides (obviously) and the number says how many blue block are touching it. As the game progresses, it adds {} around a number to say the blue blocks are sequential, or -- around a number to say they are split. It then goes father to say that there are so may in this line by putting the number on the outside of that row or column. The easy feature which helps a lot for bigger puzzles is that you can click on the outside number and it draws a line through that row or column to see which ones.\n\nAll in all lots of fun and challenging at the same time.

At some point the proof gets too complicated for me to keep in my head so I have to resort to pen and paper, but that's fun too.\n\nI wish the game contained a tool to mark \"candidate\" cells \u00e0 la Minesweeper, and it would be great to be able to toggle the advanced rules for the randomly generated levels (I find the \"number inside blue cell\" mechanic makes the game really slow), but those are only minor complaints.

There are no new game mechanics. The tutorial aspect is handled better than in the first game. There is a nice progression between easy and challenging levels and the game felt much more balanced than the first two rather one-sided parts. The pre-made levels took me about 10 hours to complete as a seasoned logic puzzle player and featured a few really nice stages.\nArguably its main selling point is the titular infinite mode. Finally Hexcells allows you to generate millions of levels and thus offers near infinite gameplay. The levels are usually much easier than the pre-made levels, which is completely fine with me and makes this an even better casual game for inbetween. My only gripe with this mode is its large randomness. Generated levels take anywhere between 3 and 20 minutes to complete. I would have liked a little more control over length and difficulty.\n\nThe interface is much improved compared to its predecessors. Finally you can mute the music independenty from the sound effects. The game lets you save levels mid-progress, visibility of areas can be improved and you can swap mouse buttons more easily. It is such an improvement that it makes you wonder why the previous two games weren't patched to this UI. Like with the other parts I've never encountered a bug, error or crash.\n\nDue to the infinite mode this game as a stand-alone is worth full price.

It is a logic game were rules of the levels are defined by numbered brackets (minesweeper style) that give information on whether nearby brackets are false or true. This is sometimes mixed in with column markers that do the same, but for a column (picross style). To deepen the gameplay a bit more, you are sometimes also presented with special rules beside the numbers which frankly, in my humble opinion, make minesweeper look like a joke.\n\nThe base levels start easy enough but the difficulty curve steeps beyond what was comfortable in the first game yet stays bellow the hellish fires of Hexcells Plus. This time round we are presented with a random level generator which definitely extends the game but sadly does not escape the dredge facing all random generated content. Even though Hexcells level are simple, they always feel like it is you against the designer. Where the designer tried fooling you with level symmetry, hiding some emotion in the puzzles. In contrast, random generated levels feel cold and somewhat uninviting. It's not a dealbreaker by any means but I would have opted for community designed level sharing instead.\n\nAs with previous games, It kept me coming back. Infinite is challenging and fun. Cheap and as long as you'd like it to be.

You are given a layout of golden hex tiles, possibly with one or more of them already highlighted or flipped. Flipped tiles have numbers on them, and also labels indicating whether or not adjacent tiles which should be highlighted are continuous or non-continuous (or no designator at all). There are also row and column labels which allow you to see how many tiles need to be highlighted in any given row or column.\n\nEach puzzle mixes these up in a unique way to push you to solve it.\n\nThinking about this game as a more sophisticated version of minesweeper is, I think, fairly ideal, because that is more or less what it is, and the function it serves. It is something to throw away a bit of time on, not sit down and play continuously.\n\nIt is about as fun as Minesweeper is, and I\u2019d basically consider it filling that role in your game library.\n\nThe sequels get steadily harder, and unfortunately, I'm not 100% sure all the puzzles are solvable without guessing - there were a few points where I got stuck and the only way forward seemed to be taking a guess. That happened on only a small fraction of the puzzles, but I'm not sure if I was simply not good enough, or if they are legitimately ambiguous.\n\nMy advice? Pass. It isn\u2019t a bad puzzle game, but it isn\u2019t anything remarkable either. If you did get it as part of a bundle or something, it isn\u2019t a terrible thing to install and just screw around with when you\u2019d mess around with solitaire or minesweeper or whatever, but I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to buy this.", "timestamp_created": 1472289808, "timestamp_updated": 1472889267, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407163", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25153695": {"recommendationid": "25153695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063135436", "num_games_owned": 1935, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 4848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495537978}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5988\u5988\uff0csteam\u4e0a\u4e5f\u80fd\u626b\u96f7\u4e86~\nsteam\u90fd\u80fd\u626b\u96f7\u4e86~\u8fde\u8fde\u770b\u8fd8\u8fdc\u5417\uff0c\u54ea\u4f4d\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\u7238\u7238\u628a\u4e5f\u8fde\u8fde\u770b\u4e5f\u5f04\u5230steam\u4e0a\u5427~", "timestamp_created": 1472176708, "timestamp_updated": 1472176708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25152833": {"recommendationid": "25152833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282335679", "num_games_owned": 3469, "num_reviews": 257, "playtime_forever": 1326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472263595}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u73a9\u6cd5\u8ddf2\u4ee3\u76f8\u540c, \u96e3\u5ea6\u8b8a\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e86, \u4e26\u6c92\u6709\u589e\u52a0\u65b0\u898f\u5247, \u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7121\u9650\u6a21\u5f0f, \u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0d\u65b7\u73a9\u65b0\u95dc\u5361\u4e86\n\n\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u63d0\u7684\u8b8a\u52d5/\u512a\u9ede:\n1. \u53ef\u4ee5\u5b58\u6a94\u4e86\n2. \u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7121\u9650\u6a21\u5f0f, \u6709100,000,000\u95dc\u53ef\u4ee5\u96a8\u6a5f\u6216\u8f38\u5165\u6578\u5b57\u9078\u95dc\n\n\u7f3a\u9ede:\n1. \u97f3\u6a02\u4ecd\u662f\u90a3\u9ebc\u5dee\u52c1\n\n\u4eca\u6b21\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u8981\u89e3\u958b60\u500b\u7121\u9650\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u95dc\u5361, \u6211\u8a66\u73a9\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u53ea\u82b1\u4e868\u5206\u9418, \u5404\u4f4d\u52a0\u6cb9!!", "timestamp_created": 1472171836, "timestamp_updated": 1472171856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25136199": {"recommendationid": "25136199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023359027", "num_games_owned": 832, "num_reviews": 687, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472145895}, "language": "french", "review": "Pris lors d'un bundle, le jeu ne m'int\u00e9resse pas plus que \u00e7a mais, pourquoi pas.", "timestamp_created": 1472145942, "timestamp_updated": 1472145942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25108761": {"recommendationid": "25108761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020125851", "num_games_owned": 8497, "num_reviews": 717, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472028908}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A Minimalistic Puzzle Game[/h1]\nhttps://youtu.be/td3a_kVk6zU\n+ The gameplay is very simple and mainly consists of flipping over tiles to find the correct pattern.

It's a great idea, but there were a number of things I had issues with in the first game.  Hexcells Infinite fixed pretty much all my issues, and is a fantastic game.\n\nThis game is a terrific logic puzzle, along the lines of Macross/Nanograms/Griddlers/Pic-a-Pix - whatever you call them.  It's more complicated than any of those, however, bringing in some ideas that seem almost Minesweeper-esque, without the guesswork of Minesweeper.\n\nThe first two games in this series feel almost like tough tutorials for this third game.  This one has much more complex logic puzzles, but not a single one needs any guessing or significant backtracking to solve.  \n\nThe 36 main puzzles take a lot longer than the first two games - one of my biggest complaints about the first Hexcells is that it seemed rather short.  Hexcells Infinite not only takes longer to solve due to the tough puzzles, but it also has a random puzzle generator, with almost one billion puzzles in it.  They're all easier than the hardest of the Infinite puzzles, but there are some that require a bit of work, and it's great to know you'll never run out of puzzles.\n\nMy other large issue with the previous two Hexcells was the lack of any save function, which Infinite added (thank goodness).\n\nOverall, Hexcells Infinite is a fantastic game for anyone who likes logic puzzles.  I can't recommend it enough, especially at the cheap price.  Buy it in a package with the other two Hexcells if you can afford it, because the other two ramp up the difficulty much more gently than Infinite does.  But if you can only afford one of them, definitely get this one.\n\nSince I've seen a lot of reviewers do personal scales, and it's helped me a lot to decide what to buy, I put my own here. [b]I give Hexcells Infinite a 5 out of 5[/b]. Additionally, I usually only give a thumbs up if I got at least two hours of enjoyment out of it for every dollar I spent, and this game did that. \n\n[b]5: Amazing game, easily worth the full price.[/b]\n4: Good game, solid addition to the genre, might want to wait for a discount.\n3: Pretty entertaining game, but some issues. Buy at a discount unless you love the genre.\n2: More cons than pros, a lot of issues. Only buy with a strong discount, and only if the game truly sounds like something you'd enjoy.\n1: Don't get this game unless it's free.

Imagine if Minesweeper met Nonograms and had hexagonal babies... then you're close.\n\nPure deductive logic. The solutions are unique and reasonably tricky, but fair. There's no trick questions or guessing. If you're used to Japanese deductive puzzles (like Kakuro or Ken Ken) then ignore the previous 2 iterations and jump straight to this one.\n\nUnfortunately the 'infinite' puzzles are a bit inconsistent. Many lack much of a challenge, meaning you can kinda mindlessly click through them, akin to Minesweeper: relaxing but not overly taxing. Whether that's a bad thing ultimately depends on what you're looking for. If you want something quite gentle, this'll tick it perfectly.

It would take a player about 1,141 and half years (with a 6 minute per puzzle average) to exhaust every available puzzle, and that's assuming that they never eat, sleep, or take any breaks. If you were to buy just one installment of the Hexcells franchise, it would be a mistake not to get this one. It simply has the greatest value per dollar spent. (roughly 228 years of gameplay per dollar if you were wondering, and that's not even when it's on sale.)\n\nNumbers aside, this game is an absolute masterpiece. From the minimal sound effects to the tranquil soundtrack, the sound design is spot on and keeps the player engaged. The gameplay is heavily influenced by japanese logic games and minesweeper, but it still manages to feel completely original and unique. More importantly, the concept is easy to learn and it only takes a few minutes for a new player to get used to the gameplay and environment. \n\nAnd that's not even the best part - the best part is that it NEVER feels impossible to solve. More often than not, when a player makes a mistake, they immediately realize what they did wrong. Even if you feel like you're stuck, there's always that one number you missed that tells you where to look. This game is like a great magician, in the sense that a great magician leaves nothing to chance despite how wildly impossible their act may seem. If you love puzzle games, Hexcells Infinite is a must for your Steam library.\n\nI give this game a 9.8/10.\n\nNot a perfect score for the following reasons:\n- Highlighting an external grid number underneath another highlighted external grid number works OKAY, but I'm sure there are better options than white on white lines.\n- You can make any number of mistakes on the infinite puzzles without facing any sort of penalty. Maybe I'm just being nitpicky at this point, but it just seems like a loose end in an otherwise flawless game. They could at least have it set up in a way where the puzzle doesn't count as completed if you make 3 or more mistakes.\n\nSuggestions:\n- Themes! I'm talking unlockable themes, different hex colors, player-created backgrounds, custom cursors, and so on. This game would certainly benefit from workshop access and, dare I say, skins.

This series goes beyond your normal Minesweeper in the fact that clues will often involve more then the directly adjacent tiles  i.e. columns, diagonals, non-continuous, continuous only, double spaces, etc... If you get Infinite, it boasts an infinite puzzle generator that was some estimated 999,999,999 random puzzles to try so, good luck with that.

No new mechanics are added compared to previous games, if you played them you know what to expect but that is not necessary in order to enjoy this one.\n\nIt is Minesweeper-like game where your goal is to decipher the pattern and mark the blue cells by gradually eliminating empty ones. They contain numbers which show how many blue cells are adjacent to them. New rules are introduced which add to game complexity, such as number of cells in columns, clusters of cells that must be separated from each other or adjacent to one another and blue cells with numbers which show how many of them are located in a 2 hex radius.

You input or generate a random string of numbers, and a puzzle is made from that. When you've passed through the crafted levels, you'll likely find these generated levels simplistic and more of a timesink than an actual challenge. It's mostly repetition from what you've learned from the designer's levels, and while there may be some golden nuggets among these numbers, there's an 8-digit string to generate levels from, which is where the \"infinite\" part comes from. This of course doesn't mean they're bad, they're just not as good as the designed ones.\n\nAll in all, I can say that if you like brain training games that challenge your logical side, this one's worth it, and the infinite levels serve nicely as a filler for when you've got nothing better to do.", "timestamp_created": 1459103271, "timestamp_updated": 1459103271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22087117": {"recommendationid": "22087117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134210605", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512954682}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this puzzle game.

If you play it properly and not just by clicking random cells until you finish it, then it is superb.\nIn order to get the best out of this game (and in my opinion the only way to play it) you should challenge yourself to not make one single move if you are not 100% sure about it. As many have said before; the puzzles are supposed to be solved without having to guess or be in doubt whether the cells should be blue or not, so do not guess, do not think \"hm, maybe this should be blue\", \"this is probably right\" or anything along these lines. If you are not completely sure, then do not click. \n\nImprovements have been made since the last two games. One is that you can save your puzzles and then go back later and finish them (which is what I recommend you to do if you get stuck. Take a break, go do something else and then come back later and you will see new per,c  that you did not see before. It is so easy to get stuck focusing too narrowly on one area or staring blindly on a spot that might already be solved). The other thing is that a random puzzle generator has been added. Although the random puzzles are easy and does not require much effort and thinking they are still addictive! It is very relaxing to solve them and great if you just want to wind down a little bit. \n\nIf you are already a fan of minesweeper or sudoku, then you will LOVE this game. Hexcells is the perfect mix between those two. \n\nIn conclusion; I cannot recommend this game enough! I loved the first two ones, Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, and now with this one having a random puzzle generator just makes it the ultimate puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1457743973, "timestamp_updated": 1480213992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511401", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21760228": {"recommendationid": "21760228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105579300", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488867418}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u5165\u4e86\u4e09\u6b3e\u7684\u5305\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u5237\u6210\u5c31\u7684\n\n\u5148\u73a9\u7684\u8fd9\u4e2a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u626b\u96f7\u4e00\u6837\u5de6\u53f3\u952e\u4e92\u6362\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u53bb\u73a91\u548c3\uff0c\u4ed6\u5988\u7684\u4e0d\u80fd\u6362\u4e86\u662f\u548b\u56de\u4e8b\n\n\u6211\u5237\u4e2a\u6210\u5c31\u5bb9\u6613\u4e48\n\n\u867d\u7136\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u73a9\u4e2a\u5341\u51e0\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u5c31\u89c9\u5f97\u5988\u7684\u6211\u5230\u5e95\u5728\u5e72\u5565\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1457675279, "timestamp_updated": 1459303692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21739595": {"recommendationid": "21739595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195202387", "num_games_owned": 1108, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458198607}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u8d28\u91cf\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u3002\u6253\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u795e\u5668\uff0c\u548c\u626b\u96f7\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e0a\u624b\u5f88\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5230\u96be\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1457575115, "timestamp_updated": 1457575115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21726029": {"recommendationid": "21726029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053491735", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508959972}, "language": "english", "review": "Thus far, the best hexcells game.

For those not in the know, Hexcells is a puzzle game that's similar to mine sweeper only with 6 sides instead of 4 and an error counts against you but doesn't end the game. Also you never have to guess in Hexcells, there is always sufficient evidence given to correctly select the next move (though you may find yourself pulling out your hair until you find it). \n\nThis game has the same clean graphics and soothing atmospheric music as the previous 2 games but does have some improvements. The biggest of which is you now have the ability to save and come back to a puzzle. This is a huge improvement and especially helpful as some of the levels in the base game are larger and more complicated than levels in previous games. You can also now set which mouse buttons you want to use to mark a square as blue or not which is a bonus to us lefties.  \n\nWhere Hexcells Infinite really shines though is in the Infinite part. In addition to a set of given puzzles you can there's also an infinite mode where a set of 8 numbers (selected randomly, shared with friends or based on the date) will bring you a specific puzzle for you enjoyment. These puzzles tend to be shorter than the 'main' puzzles and are a great way to pass the time or give yourself a quick mental warm up for the day.

That\u2019s right: There is no *significant* reward for completing a map with zero mistakes, and there is no punishment for literally guessing every step of the way and finishing with 20+ mistakes (other than barring your progress through the blocks of preset levels, but unlocking all puzzle groups doesn't really pose much of a challenge, i.e. you can do that even if you finish each map with a few mistakes). \n\nOn the bright side, extra points go to sound design, as every correct click results in a soothing, oddly satisfying sound bit; however, there is no volume control in the game, only an ON/OFF switch, which I suppose is aligned with the game\u2019s minimalistic design, but it\u2019s a feature I missed nonetheless. \n\nAll in all, the game is reasonably priced, and certainly a step up the challenge of playing Minesweeper.

While the original hexcells had a nice difficulty curve, this one's all over the place. I actually enjoyed playing the first hour and I thought they'd redeemed themselves from hexcells plus. I was getting stuck, but still progressing which makes the game fun. But the levels difficulties are all over the place. For example one level introduced a new concept and gave you an incredibly easy puzzle to make sure you understand it. Then just the level after it throws you into this massive puzzle with numbers all over the place and I'm just sitting there thinking, I can't be bothered with this. It becomes more of a grind and loses its fun. I think it would have been nice for the dev to add a mid-level save so you can come back later; some of these levels are massive and will take a long time.\n\nI'm also very disappointed that they added a ? cell. It's so cheap because it forces you to solve the puzzle in only one possible way. It can also be so disheartening; you might spend a solid 5 minutes to find a cell you can make progress on only to uncover it as a ? so you can no longer progress any further down that route.\n\nHowever, do I think this game is worth buying? Yes! Solely because you can play custom levels. It offers more than the other hexcells games.

Highly recommend starting with the first one and playing through the entire series (Hexcells, Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite).\n\n5/5", "timestamp_created": 1455276179, "timestamp_updated": 1455404221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21145285": {"recommendationid": "21145285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278830554", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501417825}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc138\uc77c\ud574\uc11c 3\uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\ub97c \ud55c\ubc88\uc5d0 \uad6c\ub9e4\ud588\ub294\ub370 \ud6c4\ud68c\uc5c6\ub294 \uad6c\ub9e4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc21c\uc11c\ub294 \ud5e5\uc140-\ud5e5\uc140 \ud50c\ub7ec\uc2a4-\ud5e5\uc140 \uc778\ud53c\ub2c8\ud2b8 \uc21c\uc774\uad6c\uc694,  \uccab\ud0c4\uc778 \ud5e5\uc140\uc740 \ub2e4\uc18c \uc26c\uc6b4\uac10\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \uc778\ud53c\ub2c8\ud2b8\ub9cc \uad6c\ub9e4\ud558\uc154\ub3c4 \ub420\uac83 \uac19\uc544\uc694.\n\ud2b9\ud788 \uc778\ud53c\ub2c8\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc120 \uc138\uc774\ube0c\ub098 \uc7ac\uc2dc\uc791\ub4f1 \uba54\ub274 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ub410\uace0, \ub79c\ub364\ud37c\uc990\ub3c4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc810\uc774 \uc81c\uc77c \uc88b\ub124\uc694.\n\uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc544\uc9c1\ub3c4 \uc548 \uc9c8\ub9bc.", "timestamp_created": 1455260167, "timestamp_updated": 1479990933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21140142": {"recommendationid": "21140142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077245539", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479338017}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice and \"pure\" (minimalistic) puzzler.\nHexcells Infinite is the latest and best of the Hexcells-triology.\n\nThe puzzles are much harder than in the very first Hexcells (IMHO).\nBut, some nice features made it in: one can save the state of a puzzle at any given time, and restarting a puzzle is easier too (no more going back to the main-menu).\n\nAdditionally, there are tons (1.000.000) of random puzzles.\nWhile the random puzzles vary in difficulty and are (obviously) not hand-crafted as the official levels, the random challenges still add some more hours of fun.\n\nPS: The whole series is a good example on how one idea evolves over time and the game becomes better and more fine-tuned.", "timestamp_created": 1455236329, "timestamp_updated": 1455236329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21121544": {"recommendationid": "21121544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083947260", "num_games_owned": 575, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471148011}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uba38\ub9ac \uc368\uc57c\ud558\ub294\uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1455175655, "timestamp_updated": 1455175655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505122", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21120407": {"recommendationid": "21120407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136769898", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456355531}, "language": "english", "review": "Some of the best mathematics-based puzzling in existence!", "timestamp_created": 1455170368, "timestamp_updated": 1455170368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21119918": {"recommendationid": "21119918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063285023", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455168086}, "language": "english", "review": "I was doing fine until the ? cells came up.

It only perfects the difficulty of what the previous parts had to offer.\nBut why the name \"infinity\"? It comes with a Random Puzzle Generator, offering no less than 100.000.000 puzzles. This is where the true replay value shines. Want to share a certain puzzle with a friend? Just give the puzzle grid number to him and he can load it no problem. You can even save a puzzle midway, Something that is lacking in the standard puzzles.\nAll in all a very valuable addition to an already great game. \n\nAs with the previous two parts, ALL puzzles can be solved by using simple (and sometimes not so simple) logic. You never have to guess to solve something there's always a \"if this needs this, then that must be so or so\". Highly recommended if you enjoyed the previous parts.

Simple design & graphics, fitting music. You have numbered tiles that tell how many adjacent mines there are. And later on there are numbers outside the grid that tell how many mines are in that column and numbers inside mine tiles that tell how many mines are within a two tile radius. You use the information given to get through tiles and eventually uncover the whole area. There are no game overs (so you can continue on despite guessing or making mistakes) but you can do the puzzles without guesswork.\n\nThe controls are pretty simple (left click to mark as a mine, right click to reveal). You can also right click on column numbers/mine numbers to hide them. It's not very obvious but you can access the menu/restart the stage by clicking on the word MENU on the top left corner.\n\nI enjoy logic puzzles and these kept me entertained for a several hours (I spent a good amount of time just thinking about the problems and eventually got hints from people on the forums).\n\nThe Infinite version finally allows for saves so you can safely take a break during puzzles (which I often did to reset my mind and try again later).\n\nIt also introduces randomly generated levels (based on seeds) so you can keep playing after you finish the campaign. However, from my limited experience, the randomly generated levels are usually not as satisfying as the dev-selected campagin levels. The generated levels don't usually require thinking about more than one layer of information at a time and have a good amount of simple cascades. I didn't really think about or appreciate the developers' puzzle design skills until I started playing the generated puzzles.\n\nThe most polished and, in my opinion, the best of the three Hexcell games. The difficulty curve isn't as steep as Plus (they offer more levels that help show needed concepts) but I'm not sure if Infinite is a little easier than Plus or if Plus' puzzles conditioned me and helped me solve these faster.\n\nIf you like logic puzzles like Sudoku/Kakuro you should try the original Hexcells first. If you enjoyed Hexcells and are looking for a new and harder challenge, this will probably be your cup of tea.", "timestamp_created": 1452481067, "timestamp_updated": 1452481067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20460137": {"recommendationid": "20460137", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984269843", "num_games_owned": 718, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456537860}, "language": "english", "review": "If you don't like this game then you're stupid.  I mean that in a literal sense -- your IQ must not be high enough to understand it.\n\nYears ago there used to be this board game \"Mastermind\".  It was hard as hell, you had to deduce the colors that  your opponent had chosen and was hiding behind a tiny screen.  To make it more difficult, you could have blanks.  You had a limited number of guesses to deduce what the colors were.\n\nFlash forward 20 years to the game \"Minesweeper\" included with Windows '95.  In that game, as many of us remember, you had to figure out which of the hidden squares on a grid held a mine and which did not.  You were told, given an empty square, how many mines bordered that square.\n\nHexcells Infinite is a wonderful combination of both.  It requires focus, patience, and some abstract reasoning abiliity.  Some evenings, after a long day at work (or working two jobs), I actually find it pretty relaxing to be able to focus my thoughts on something else.  My mind never shuts down, it is always thinking about something.  Other thank alcohol or other illicit drugs, this game is one of the great ways to derail my thinking from all of the stresses in my life.\n\nI've played about 15 hours so far and have not solved the game.  This is because you need to achieve a certain level of perfection on each level.  For every error you make, you earn fewer points. You need a certain number of points in order to \"open\" a different, more complex level.  You will definitely finding yourself approaching levels over and over trying to achieve perfection.  But it doesn't feel like grinding, not one bit.\n\nThe numbers that you reveal can be coded in different ways.  One way means that there are that many mines bordering that hex.  Another means that there are that number of mines bordering the hex, but they are in sequence (for example, -2-).  Another means that there are that number of minuntes bordering the hex, but they are not next to each other (for example, [3]).  There are several other different notations and on many levels the game gives you just enough (JUST enough) information to deduce the layout of the hexes.\n\nThoroughly enjoyable.  There is also a daily randomly generated hexcell grid that you can generate, but even without this the replay value will be medium to high if you give yourself enough time to forget the layout of the grids.\n\nA wonderful little game, high recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1452472718, "timestamp_updated": 1452472718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20424392": {"recommendationid": "20424392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043693538", "num_games_owned": 627, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513541123}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it.

Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. \n\n[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]\n\nThere is no difficulty mode option that's assigned. But each of the puzzles has their own difficult.\n\nHexcells Infinite basically has same formula as its' predecessors Hexcells and Hexcells Infinite. So the objective remains the same. Which is to figure out which cells to make blue and which cells to make black.\n\nThere are total of three slots with six worlds that has thirty-six puzzles to solve. The first world for each of the three slots are automatically unlocked. Completing one world will unlocked the next one. All of these puzzles can be replayed after the first go around. Please do note that the puzzles in the other two slots are the same as the ones in the first slot.\n\nThere is a special feature bonus that Hexcell Infinite has. Right beneath the three slots, there's an option for continous gameplay of Hexcells. Henced why the game called Hexcell Infinite. The special feature bonus gameplay can be customized in many different ways that the regular gameplay of Hexcells cannot.\n\nThere's no time limit in this game. Allowing the individual take as much time that they want to solve each of the puzzles.\n\nThere seven achievements for this game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.\n\n[h1][b]Miscellaneous[/b][/h1]\n\nFinal thoughts, it's an neat game to play and enjoy.

This edition comes with a really neat feature to generate puzzles randomly (hence the \"infinite\"), which provides endless hours of puzzle-solving fun! My only complaint is that the randomly generated puzzles seem to be relatively easy, for the most part, due to a lot of duplicated/unnecessary information provided. I don't know what sort of algorithm the authors use to generate the puzzles, but if the algorithm is flexible enough, it would be nice if the amount of information provided could be customized so that players could choose their difficulty level.

Minesweeper is great for killing a few moments, from the basic versions in Windows 2000 and XP to the shiny new ones in 7 and 10. Start menu, \"mines\", press Enter, and away you go. Even when the hardest difficulty defeats me time and time again, I still find myself looking for it over Solitaire or Hearts.\n\nSo why does the \"ambient logic\" of Hexcells annoy me so much? Well, if you've picked up on how pretentious that quoted phrase sounds, you're riding the same wave of boredom that I am.\n\nTo put it plain, this game feels more like a tumor growing on Minesweeper than any real advancement. It's slow, it's overcomplicated, and it's not really about puzzles. It's about processes of elimination, like Sudoku, and with the pressure to complete every stage without error, you will feel discontent when you have to guess what's behind that next orange tile.\n\nDon't kid yourself on this point: if you're looking for any shred of entertainment you'll have to guess. Life is too short to work out every combination and deduce if you're about to fuck up the tantalizing \"Mistakes: 0\" in the corner when there's regularly 50+ tiles and 10+ column hints to combine. Math majors aside, I don't know who could find that fun.\n\nBut enough of taking potshots at my humorless peers, let's take potshots at the developer instead. This game really is dead-set on monopolizing your time and attention. Minesweeper is a game to be played for a few minutes, preferably with the ability to quickly background it when something more important pops up (e.g., your boss rounds the corner). You're better off playing it on mute anyway; the audio is annoying and the interface is minimalist to a fault. Quick, exit to the stage select screen without touching the mouse (you can't) and without waiting for the pause menu to fully scroll into view (good luck). On OS X, this game disables every normal exit strategy to simply access another window - Cmd+Tab and Mission Control - and for what reason? Both Microsoft and Apple go to great lengths to disallow this behavior because even with the best of intentions, no application is so important as to block access to everything else. Yes, you can exit with Cmd+Q, yes, you can play it in a window by guessing at keyboard shortcuts, but disabling the ability to use my system as I see fit while it is running is really what made me cross over from indifference into irritation. And with gameplay this shallow, that's the strongest emotion this game musters up.", "timestamp_created": 1448523182, "timestamp_updated": 1448523182, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19249058": {"recommendationid": "19249058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044953582", "num_games_owned": 538, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448462520}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked the first two games, then this game is an easy buy!\n\nUnlike the past two games, this one is most assuredly going to stump you (especially if you're going for Perfectionist - no mistakes in the campaign) and frustrate you.

This is still a great game, but since the infinite mode is such a big part of the game that it's in the title, it has to be addressed.\n\nThe campaigns through all three games have a good number of memorable puzzles, some of which employ excellent variations in implimenting of the game's hint mechanics, but no such thing can be found in the infinite mode. Infinite puzzles are all bland, unmemorable blobs, and they offer no surprises in how they combine various hints. After playing about 15 infinite puzzles, you can be fairly confident that you have seen everything infinite can offer you in terms of challenge--even if it can challenge you at all. If you've managed to complete the entire campaign honestly, working to understand complex chains of hints, then most infinite puzzles should be trivial to complete.\n\nA trivial puzzle is not a fun puzzle.\n\nSo, yes.

Do you enjoy cracking puzzles using logic? Do you want an endless amount minesweeper inspired logic puzzles that require 0% guessing and 100% pure thought to solve? Well Hexcells Infinite is just the game for you.\n\nAesthetically the game is very minimalistic, clear and clean. The ambient music and the soothing ethereal piano keys played, when you unravel successive hexes, can be quite relaxing. \n\nThe game has a finite amount of hand-crafted puzzles with a decent enough difficulty curve. The earlier levels are pretty easy to grasp and as more elements and guidelines are introduced the puzzles get increasingly harder. The last of the hand-crafted puzzles can be seriously challenging to beat using just your logic and not guessing without making any mistakes. But like I've said each and every one of these can be beaten without guesswork, just need to look at it in the right angle.\n\nAfter you've completed the hand-crafted there's the infinite puzzle generator. While I've noticed that the levels you get using the generator are usually a lot easier than the last of the manually created levels, so there's not that much challenge there anymore for me, but I still occasionally find myself popping back in to complete a few of them. It's refreshing to warm up your brain's logical thinking with them I suppose.\n\nAll in all I have to recommend this title to any puzzle fans and especially to those who love minesweeper (because it's pretty much minesweeper but better).

Players are presented with an orange grid comprised to hexagons and it is up to them to determine whether these cells belong to the blue pattern or not (black cells). The black cells not part of the pattern have a number in them to indicate how many blue cells are adjacent to them, thus providing a clue as to how to proceed.\nAfter completing a puzzle the player is awarded blue hexcells based on the amount of mistakes made; these in time accumulate to unlock one of five new areas - allowing you to complete more difficult puzzles. Some areas also introduce new clues and rules to help you, making the puzzles more complex over time.\nThe biggest addition to this game is the infinite mode, where puzzles are randomly generated so there is always a new puzzle to try out.\n\nAlthough similar to Minesweeper as mentioned, there is a key difference: there is always a logical next step. You never have to take a gamble so if you feel stuck, take a step back and focus on another area.\n\n[b]Why I recommend the game[/b]\nHexcells Infinite is a very simple puzzle game in its visual design. The menu is simple and provides the players with the option of turning the ambient music on or off, selecting which mouse button turns the cells blue or black and selecting one of three save slots. The same can be said for the puzzles themselves; a grid of hexagons on a white backdrop. To me this is good design, as I'm here for the puzzles and that's where the focus clearly lies.\nThe puzzles themselves are interesting, more difficult than Hexcells but slightly less difficult than Hexcells Plus.\nWhat's more, my biggest problem with both previous titles has been resolved; it is now possible to leave a puzzle mid-game, thereby saving your progress and being able to continue next time where you left it.\n\nHowever, like previous titles it is still not possible to erase a save slot so starting completely from scratch is not an option if all three slots are in use.\nFurthermore, I personally find the infinite mode wanting. The randomly generated puzzles are neither as difficult nor as interesting compared to those made by Matthew Brown, the developer of Hexcells.\n\nThat being said, I recommend this title (and both previous ones) wholeheartedly for anyone interested in puzzle games.", "timestamp_created": 1440938624, "timestamp_updated": 1440938624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17733428": {"recommendationid": "17733428", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999815773", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493174921}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Not only does this game add new puzzles for you to solve, it also adds a random generator for you to enter a random seed and get solving! Too much time on your hand? Don't worry, there are many, and I mean MANY, puzzles waiting to be solved by pure logic and process of elimination. Happy Solving for infinity and beyond!\n\nHere is my original Review for \"Hexcells\".\n\n[quote=Enix]A compelling puzzlegame, as an obvious big brother of Minesweeper.\n\nContent\nMany puzzles await your solving. Go through different levels of difficulty and solve all of the puzzles to get to 100%. Can you get every one with no mistakes?\n\nHexcells (apparent from the name) adds new dimensions to the classical game of Minesweeper: More adjacent fields to one hexagon as well as border numbers, which indicate how many fields of the pattern are in a line/row/diagonale. Each boder number can indicate different things, everything is explained within the game. No need to rush things. You are now thinking outside of hexcells.\n\nSound & Music\nShallow but fitting background soundtracks and sounds. Nothing special, but that wasn't needed here. The soundtrack and soundeffects change every once and a while when you complete a puzzle.\n\nGraphics\nDon't expect anything here. The game is primarily a puzzle game, so no high end graphics or effects. The design does its deeds and fulfills its task. Visuals are never irritating and do what they need to do.\n\nWeakpoints\nSometimes, portions of the soundtrack are a little too high-pitched in my opinion. This can get annoying, if you are not used to hearing the same sounds over and over again. They are adjustable ingame though, from soundeffects only to completely mute.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\nGreat puzzlegame, compelling, challenging, tricky but fair. Nice soundtrack, nice sounds, simple gameplay yet sometimes mindwreckingly hard.

It truly is a complete masterpiece and I don't think anyone could come up with a better long lasting puzzle idea if they tried. Wheras I find most puzzle games loose there charm after a while of just doing very similar puzzles over and over again I find that hexcells has enough variation to keep it intriguing and fun to play for hours on end!\n\nSo hexcells infinite is a follow up to the originals, hexcells and hexcells hexcells plus. They are pretty much identical games with a few differences. I will cover all of the games in this review because I think if your going to play them you should start from the beginning and play all of them. The original hexcells is a very easy concept version of the two later games. I say concept because this is what it felt like at this stage. Its as if he was just testing the water as to whether people enjoyed it. It was very simple and when replaying it, it only took me around 1 hour to complete. But then you go on to hexcells plus. This is a very large step up in difficulty and really does get you thinking. Infinite follows on with this step up in difficulty following around the same level of difficulty. \n\nWell what do you do in hexcells? It's basically an upgraded version of minesweeper. Having the field instead in a hex format makes for much more extensive gameplay. They have extra functions in around the hexes instead of just numbers. You have {} which say that the hexes are connecting each other. - - show that they aren't connecting each other. You have large orbits (Not sure what to call them so that name will do?) which show how many hexes are in a large area. And finally there are numbers above some rows that show how many hexes are in that row. So all of these new elements really make you have to think and utilize all of them together to complete a level without making mistakes.\n\nThis newest entry series introduces a new feature called inifnite mode. It is a randomly generated field of hexes that is unique every time. There is said to be 999,999,999 different combinations so good luck getting through them all. I have currently done about 150 puzzles. This is where the real longevity of the game comes from. Although infinite mode isn't quite as challenging as the story puzzles it does make it so you don't have to keep playing the default puzzles over and over. I have found myself playing hours on end on this mode. \n\nThere is one thing that makes this truly better than minesweeper. No guessing. Yes you heard that correct. There is no guessing at all in hexcells. The maps and algorithms are specially crafting so you never find yourself uncertain to whether there is hex there or not. This makes the gameplay infinitely more fun and makes it so it doesn't get aggrivating after a while. \n\nSo if you are a fan of minesweeper or any puzzle game at that hexcells is definitely for you. You can currently buy the hexcells complete pack for a price of \u00a35.99 which is an absolute steal for the amount of time of gameplay you can get out of it. It is an ideal game to spend 10 minutes or so on now and then whenever you have a moment. \n\nReally this isn't the kind of game I expected I would lose my life to but i'm glad I found it!\n\n[h1]TheIronicGamers rating system[/h1]\n[list][*] Don't ever buy this game. \n[*]Maybe consider it on a sale. \n[*]An average game.\n[*]A good game that should definitely be considered.\n[*][b][u]A must play![/u][/b]\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1438355173, "timestamp_updated": 1438381515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17309580": {"recommendationid": "17309580", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972465191", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 25110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477969493}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly excellent game.

Just like its predecessors, it features fantastic Minesweeper-like mechanics that are supplemented with different methods of revealing information about the solutions to its well-designed puzzles. It also features that same ambient-style soundtrack that leaves players both relaxed and focused. One small but appreciated addition is the ability to quickly restart puzzles and save progress on the current puzzle. It's especially great for taking a break from those bigger puzzles.\n\nThe difficulty here, save for a puzzle or two, felt slightly easier than Hexcells Plus. I'm not sure if this is actually due to the hours of practice I've put into the first two games, but regardless I'd recommend at least playing through the original Hexcells before taking on Infinite.\n\nMy reviews of the previous games contained complaints about having a limited replay value and, even as well-crafted as the game's pre-designed puzzles are, this is still an issue. But now the game tries to counter that with its Infinite mode, creating randomly generated puzzles to provide an infinite amount of content.\n\nThe only problem with this is that many of the puzzles generated are nowhere near as satisfying to play as the ones included with the game. Few of them approach the challenge and cleverness of these pre-arranged puzzles. Playing the randomly-generated puzzles makes one appreciate the care the designer took to make the pre-built puzzles enjoyable. In spite of this, it's hard to complain: Infinite mode is just icing on the cake and is something that will likely make me keep this game installed for quite a while even though I've mastered all the built-in levels.\n\nThe bottom-line is that Hexcells is a brilliant game series and Infinite is, while not the most challenging entry, the best entry yet.

Hexcells and Hexcells Plus each had 36 AMAZING hand-built puzzles of ever-increasing difficulty, but once you completed the puzzles with no more than 1 mistake each, that was it. The game went back on the shelf.\n\nHexcells Infinite also has 36 well-crafted hand-built puzzles, but once those are done you can keep playing with randomly-generated levels. If you buy only one of the trilogy, get this one.\n\nTo the developer(s): There are a couple things I'd still like to see improved.\n\n1 - The randomly generated levels vary widely in difficulty and in how long they take to solve. I like to play Hexcells during a 15-minute break at work, and I'd like to be sure I can solve a puzzle in that time. So I'd like to see some size and difficulty settings when generating levels. It would also be nice to be able to disable some of the mechanics, like line clues and blue cell clues, when generating levels.\n\n2 - Just a small UI annoyance. When you go to the Infinite screen to start a random level, it always has 000000 as its seed. You have to click \"use a random seed\" and then \"start\". I almost always want to use a random seed, so just pre-populate it with one and save me a step.\n\n3 - Eventually I'd like to see player-built levels (and even worlds/series of levels) be an option. Random maps are great, but I bet some of your players could come up with really awesome, brain-wrenchingly difficult, beautiful puzzles.

I strongly recommend it to both casual and hardcore puzzle fans. While I've never played the two previous games, I've also never played a puzzle game that so elegantly turns simplicity into difficulty without any sort of contrived pressures such as time limits or fail states. You'll go from feeling like Aristotle to agonized trying to faultlessly solve later levels.\n\nSome describe it like Minesweeper, but I have no attachment to minesweeper. I never even understood it until a friend explained it to me in my 2nd year of college. You just deduce (and in my experience, with enough thought you'll never need to guess and check) where blue and gray hexes are in a field of uncovered, yellow ones. It's simple, but grows fairly deep as new mechanics are added.\n\nBetween the 36 handmade levels and the practically infinite levels, Hexcells Infinite packs more than enough content for me to recommend it at a full price. While it begins easy and ends quite hard, there's no fail state, so you can play as carelessly or cautiously as you wish. It also has some of the best puzzle mechanics for such a simple foundation such that it doesn't need to necessarily increase the number hexes to increase the difficulty of a level. The designers deserve a lot of praise, as the later levels are able to both hide and provide information, cleverly entwining hints and further complexity into one hex. It's casual, for sure, as it doesn't pressure you. I like this, because some of the levels truly frustrate me.

This is in no way a bad thing.\n\nLike in the originals, the game mechanics are simple but interesting: you have to find out whether all the hexes within the puzzle are blue or black with rules similar to Mine Sweeper and Hanjies. Baseline is that you can always deduce everything: no guessing is required. Though guessing is not punished either. Nevertheless, you need a near-perfect streak to acquire most achievements.\n\nThe mechanics have not changed at all after the originals: black hexes contain a number that states how many hexes around it are blue, and blue ones might contain a number stating how many hexes in a two-hex radius are blue. In addition there are Hanjie-like column-numbers that state how many blue hexes are there in a given line.\n\nAll 36 puzzles are new, so the owners of the original ones will be pleased. The difficulty curve is a bit steeper than in the original Hexcells but little less than in Hexcells Plus. In effect, it is great as a stand-alone title requiring no knowledge of the two games from before. For me it took 8 hours to complete all 36 hand-crafted puzzles.\n\nThankfully, saving within a puzzle has finally been provided! I have to wonder why it wasn't featured in the originals. The other new, much-sought after feature are the random-generated puzzles that add a ridiculous amount of replayability: you provide a random number seed and the level is generated, there being supposedly 2 billion levels. Unfortunately, I found the random levels frankly uninspiring and underwhelming in difficulty when compared to the original puzzles. Curiously, the way the random seed is provided introduces a social feature: you can post the coolest random levels (i.e. their seeds) to public forums for others to try. With so many random levels, there are bound to be some gems in the flock discovered only by trying.\n\nWith Hexcells Infinite, I'd wager this kind of puzzle game has pretty much been perfected as a concept. I would certainly welcome there being more of these cleverly crafted and well-designed puzzles. The graphics are as perfect as they can be for an abstract game and the ambient music fits the abstract theme splendidly.\n\nIf you already played and enjoyed [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/265890/]Hexcells[/url] and [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/271900/]Hexcells Plus[/url], this game is a must-buy.

These shapes make it sometimes hard to figure out what is going on and in later levels you get extra clues for the lines of hexagons and stuff like that.\n\nplaying Hexcells is fun in a kind of weird way. Even if you don't want to make your math homework, you sit down to \"calculate\" the grids, but it is not that much math anyway, more like drawing lines from dot to dot.\n\nLater versions of Hexcells (Hexcells Plus & Hexcells Ininite) are basically the same thing on harder levels and Infinite includes an Endless-Mode that let's you play levels created by chance. Start with the normal game and get infected, this game is addictive and you should consider buying the complete pack right from start.\n\n\n10/10 I think I've seen more hexagons than a beekeeper did\n", "timestamp_created": 1432817824, "timestamp_updated": 1432817824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511546", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16011824": {"recommendationid": "16011824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134751039", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509024290}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0430", "timestamp_created": 1432651521, "timestamp_updated": 1432651521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15910996": {"recommendationid": "15910996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025224623", "num_games_owned": 1470, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432278886}, "language": "koreana", "review": "Hexcell \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\ub294 \ubaa8\ub450 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc778\ud53c\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub294 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ubcc4\ub2e4\ub978 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5c6\uc774 \uc138\ubc88\uc9f8 \uc528\ub9ac\uc988\uac00 \ub098\uc628\uac83\uae4c\uc9c0\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \uc528\ub9ac\uc988\ub4e4\uc744 100% \uc644\ub8cc\ud55c \uc785\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud658\uc601\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc,\n\uc774\uac74 \ub108\ubb34 \ub178\uac00\ub2e4\ub124\uc694. \n\n\ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud37c\uc990\uc744 \uc644\ub8cc\ud55c\ud6c4\uc5d0\n\ub79c\ub364\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\ub294 \uadf8\uc57c\ub9d0\ub85c \uc778\ud53c\ub2c8\ud2b8 \ud37c\uc990\uc744 60\uac1c\ub098 \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\ub77c\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub77c\ub2c8\uc694!!\n\n\ubc8c\uc368 \uba87\uc2dc\uac04\uc9f8 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc911\uc778\ub370\n\uc9c0\uaca8\uc6cc\ub3c4 \ub108\ubb34 \uc9c0\uacb9\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n", "timestamp_created": 1432105158, "timestamp_updated": 1432105158, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15889629": {"recommendationid": "15889629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029112749", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433523499}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't finish this Hexcells game (yet) but I played the previous Hexcells games (which are very good in my opinion) and this game just add the magic touch to the previous Hexcells game.

The gameplay across the series is essentially the same (which is why the Curator links for the first two games also point here), but I'll cover the important differences between the three titles.  In the interest of full disclosure, the \"infinite replay value\" bullet point above only applies if you have \"Hexcells Infinite\".[/i]\n\nLet's just get the elephant in the room out of the way first; the parallels with Minesweeper are obvious.  That said, calling this a \"Minesweeper clone\" is like calling a Lamborghini a \"Honda Civic clone\" because they're both cars.  Even so, taking a Honda Civic around the block will still give you a decent idea of whether you like driving cars or not, so it's a starting point.\n\nThe Hexcells games will most appeal to people who like Minesweeper, but thought the game mechanics got a little bland and are irritated by the fact that some blind guesswork is almost always necessary on the harder boards.  Here, you've got a wide variety of \"cell types\", but arguably more importantly: no guesswork ever.\n\nThat's not to say Hexcells isn't tough; the first game may lull you into a false sense of security, I'll admit, but by the time you're solving the latter puzzles of \"Plus\" or \"Infinite\" you'll realize that this is a [url=http://www.gamesradar.com/why-dark-souls-friendliest-most-benevolent-game-its-generation/]Dark Souls[/url] of cell-logic puzzling.  I lost count of how many times I got stuck for minutes at a time, just staring at the screen looking for the next clue, finally seeing it, getting excited at the prospect of homesteading another swath of the game board...only to find that the logic train derailed after a single cell or two.  But it's not just that it's hard, it's that -- it's hard to describe without playing the game, but it's a common theme in people's comments -- you can [i]tell[/i] that the author did it on purpose.  He [i]knew[/i] you were going to be at that exact spot, thinking that exact thing, and he [i]deliberately[/i] pulled the rug out.  It's just something about the way the puzzles go: there's a devilish humor in some of the dead ends.\n\nThe first game (\"[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/265890]Hexcells[/url]\") definitely has the easiest of the \"designed\" levels, and introduces most of the game mechanics.  It's a solid game on its own, and I would certainly recommend starting with it, but if you're only going to buy one of the three, skip it (but don't...buy [url=http://store.steampowered.com/sub/50074]the bundle[/url]).\n\nThe second game (\"[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/271900]Hexcells Plus[/url]\") features much harder \"designed\" levels (although they do start out pretty easy as well), and again I would certainly recommend playing it in sequence as part of the trilogy...but if you're only going to buy one, skip it (but don't...buy [url=http://store.steampowered.com/sub/50074]the bundle[/url]).\n\nThe third game (\"[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/304410]Hexcells Infinite[/url]\") has \"designed\" levels on par, difficulty-wise, with \"Plus\".  If you're only going to buy one of the three, this is the no-brainer choice because in addition to the manually-designed levels, \"Infinite\" also has a randomized level generator (the pedants in the audience will point out that it's really just a set of 10,000,000 procedurally-generated levels, but...yeah).  It's also the only one of the three to support user-created levels (the support is clearly a bolt-on in all its kludgy glory, but bless its heart it does work and kudos to the developer who went back in and added it in an update at the community's request).\n\nThe generated levels aren't nearly as hard as the lovingly-crafted \"main campaign\" levels, but they're difficult enough to give you a bit of a think and personally I like the fact that I can chew through them a few minutes at a time with a lot of action-packed, exciting clicks and right-clicks.  I've even encountered a few that had \"gotchas\" that almost looked deliberate.\n\nAs a last parting shot, just in case there are any of you out there who are thinking \"I liked Minesweeper's gameplay perfectly fine thank you very much...but yes, the forced guesswork [i]was[/i] annoying\", check out [url=http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/mines.html]Simon Tatham's \"mines\" implementation[/url].  In my opinion it's not nearly as much fun as Hexcells (sorry Simon!) but it does scratch that specific itch.\n\n[h1]If you like this game, check out...[/h1]\n[list]\n  [*]

It has great relaxing music and visuals, and the puzzles themselves are designed to be fun and relaxing.\n\nThat first paragraph is the one I copy/pasted between all of my Hexcells reviews. Hexcells Infinite continues the trend the others set, but is FAR more polished with more features.\n\nFirstly, along with the standard 36, there's a new puzzle generator using 'seeds'. Seeds is just a random string of numbers used to generate something, in this case a puzzle. You can choose for the Puzzle Generator to either randomly generate a seed for you(and therefore a random/new puzzle), or use the current days date, making it a sort of daily challenge. Either way, you can share the seed with friends and compete to see who does better.\n\nSecondly, there's far more sounds and music tracks to listen to while you play, all of which are wonderful and relaxing.\n\nAnd lastly, theres some customization options now. For those who have played the other two Hexcells, you know of the mechanic/clue thats a blue cell with a number in it that tells you how many blue cells are in the area, and that you can left click it to make it highlight its 2 cell radius. In Infinite, there's an option to make that highlight flash, or to make it not flash and have a black border. Either way improves visibility in the way you like it. Next is that you can switch which mouse button does what, so instead Left Click for Blue Tiles and Right Click for Black Tiles, you can reverse that so it's Left Click Black, Right Click Blue.\n\nAnyway, if you like Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, then Infinite is a absolutely must have. If you haven't played any, and can only afford one of the Hexcells games, then I recommend this one, as it has the Standard 36 Puzzles, Puzzle Generator, More Music/Sound, better Customization, and just generally better overall. And for those who don't know, each Hexcells has little text tutorials that does wonders for teaching and isn't invasive/hand-holding.\n\nEach new Hexcells DID introduce new mechanics, and while Infinite does explain it properly, I'd say get the Hexcells Complete Pack since it's such a great Puzzle game. But again, if you can only get one of them, get Infinite, I definitely recommend to any Minesweeper/Picross/Nonogram/Puzzle fan.", "timestamp_created": 1425647464, "timestamp_updated": 1425647464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502735", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14752037": {"recommendationid": "14752037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130817851", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428140024}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc804\uc791\uc774\ub791 \uac19\uc774 1~6\uc758 \uc6d4\ub4dc\uac00 \uc788\uace0, \uc778\ud53c\ub2c8\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub4dc\ub77c\uace0 \ud574\uc11c \uc528\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac8c \uc788\ub294\ub370, \uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ub9cc \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uac00 \uc870\uae08 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1425598785, "timestamp_updated": 1425598785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14747572": {"recommendationid": "14747572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029972608", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 216, "playtime_forever": 875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425577387}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]PROS:[/b]\n+ satisfying gameplay\n+ really nice UI & menu\n+ relaxing soundtrack\n+ more chalenging than original Hexcells\n+ infinite level generator in Infinite mode\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n- can get a repetitive feel when played for a longer while\n\n[b]Comment:[/b]\nAn okay game that makes you think more and more as the levels progress. And think infinitely when playing the random levels that are generated. Overall it is a good \"time waster\" when you have a couple of minutes to play. Hexcells had a couple of points where you would more or less just guess what tile to choose. Hexcells Plus had a lot of this and it can be really frustrating. Hexcells Infinite is a middle ground netween the two. They fixed most of the complaints I had before, a level can be exited and continued later and there is as many levels as you dare to play. I very recommend this to anyone who likes logic games. Also worth mentioning are two prequels, all three games can be bought in a nice bundle.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1425577674, "timestamp_updated": 1499075308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464037", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14746781": {"recommendationid": "14746781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046460631", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 12656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1513679865}, "language": "english", "review": "Waiting on the music pack for this game.

It is similar in concept to Minesweeper, but is played on a hex grid. Gameplay consists of deducing which hexes are empty and which should be marked blue (\"mines\"). The similarity to Minesweeper ends there, and Hexcells improves on the experience in a couple of very important ways.\n\nFirst, the levels in Hexcells are hand-crafted, not the randomized grid of Minesweeper. And the level design is flat-out brilliant. You're led through a series of challenges of gradually increasing complexity, at each point figuring out new ways to combine the information you have and make forward progress. In all, the main levels constitute perhaps 6 to 10 hours of gameplay.\n\nThis version of the game (Hexcells Infinite) also includes an infinite mode with computer-generated levels. These aren't quite as aesthetically pleasing as the hand-made levels, but they are still very enjoyable. With infinite mode the game has infinite replayability.\n\nThe second thing that makes this game so fun is that all of the puzzles -- including the computer-generated ones in infinite mode -- can be solved using pure logical deduction. No guessing is needed, ever! (One could solve levels using trial and error, but that really isn't in the spirit of the game.)

Remember how fun it was finding those hidden mines, and how you could feel your brain scream \"NOOOOOOOOOOO\" whenever a mine would pop its stupid head up and kill you? Remember how immensely frustrating it was when it was entirely impossible to solve levels without guessing?\n\nWELL, NO MORE! Hexcells to the rescue. \n\nHexcells is very similar to Minesweeper in that you have to use various clues and reasoning to find the hidden blue cells on each level, but unlike Minesweeper, Hexcells' soultions can ALWAYS be reasoned, and if you're doing it right you will never have to guess.\n\nThe levels start out easy, with simple rules and puzzles, but new tricks are added just regularly enough to fully grasp, and before you know it, you'll find yourself scanning through 15 different criteria to find the 1-in-100 blue cell to start a level off. It's very satisfying.\n\nSpeaking of satisfying, the puzzles here never seem overwhelming or too tricky. Take my opinion with a grain of salt (since I have always loved games like this), but the level of difficulty in these puzzles was just perfect, and while some levels did force me to stare at them for a while, the solution was always there somewhere just waiting for me to grab it.\n\nThe Hexcells series is really 3 games: Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They each have different puzzles, and they are each worth getting, but Hexcells Infinite is the one to get if you're on a budget. It has the most advanced puzzles, and it includes a random level generator, so you can literally play to your heart's content. All 3 of them will slowly progress you through the mechanics of the game, though, so don't feel like you will be overwhelmed if you jump right into Infinite.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the random levels in Infinite are mere pale shadows compared to the premade levels (they are often quite easy), but for fans that cannot get enough and don't want to go back to the guess-fest Minesweeper, they can be a lot of fun.\n\nI highly recommend this game. If you're a fan of logic-based puzzle games, you can't go wrong with any of these 3 games. The prices are cheap, and the series is rather unique. If the devs could have just tightened up the infinite level generator ever-so-slightly, this game might be the only game I've rated to pass Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.\n\nScratch that Minesweeper itch, my friend!", "timestamp_created": 1421873230, "timestamp_updated": 1421873230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14082841": {"recommendationid": "14082841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127219714", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421670772}, "language": "japanese", "review": "Hexcells\u3001Hexcells Plus\u306b\u7d9a\u304f\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u7b2c\u4e09\u5f3e\u3002\n\u4eca\u56de\u306f\u554f\u984c\u306e\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u751f\u6210\u6a5f\u80fd\u304c\u642d\u8f09\u3055\u308c\u3001\u3044\u304f\u3089\u3067\u3082\u5909\u5316\u3059\u308b\u554f\u984c\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u4e8b\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u3002\n\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30a4\u30fc\u30d1\u597d\u304d\u306a\u3089\u5f37\u304f\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1421767039, "timestamp_updated": 1421767039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14073583": {"recommendationid": "14073583", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971023053", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453953256}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the third game in the Hexcells trilogy, and I definitely recommend that you play the first game (Hexcells) and then the second game (Hexcells Plus).

The game base mechanics feel like a mix between Sudoku and the old Microsoft Minesweeper.\n\nOne difference should be pointed out, though: Sometimes in Minesweeper, you would end up having to guess, because with the information available to you, there were more than one possible solution. Not so in Hexcells. There's [b]always[/b] enough info to get you one step further. You just have to be able to process the information properly. Don't get me wrong - there are times when I've been completely stuck. Some of the later pre-made levels are monstrously tough to do flawlessly. The fact that you [i]know[/i] it's all down to you and your abilities though, makes it more of a challenge and less frustrating.\n\nThe ways the information about the board is communicated to you, has been one of the primary points of evolution in the series. To my mind, the developer has been extraordinarily clever in devising new ways give you hints. If you haven't played the earlier games, the major difference for you as a player, is that the boards are much more varied in this version, simply due to the developer having more tools available to play with. The earlier games are good, but this version truly shines.\n\nThis latest iteration is called Infinite for a reason, though. He has finally been able to make a level generator, which only needs an 8-digit seed to produce a board. That means if you really want to, there are 100,000,000 boards to play. It's not really infinite, but for all intents and purposes, it might as well be. One of the fun things about this level generator, is that it gives you the possibility to challenge other players to complete the same boards as you do. All you have to do is tell them the seed for that board.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of abstract, number-type puzzles, this game should keep you occupied for quite some time.", "timestamp_created": 1421322033, "timestamp_updated": 1421322033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13988217": {"recommendationid": "13988217", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994525036", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513314346}, "language": "english", "review": "Minesweeper meets picross, with minesweeper's pick up and play replay value through randomized puzzles, and picross's criss-crossing clues that ensure you're always provided enough information to complete the puzzle without mistakes or guessing.

And enjoyable not only for fans.\n\nThe formula didn't change. Neither did any art or soundtrack. As players will still have to solve field full of hexes, clearing and tagging the \"mines\" based on information provided and revealed in these non-randomized puzzles, making your brain go hot. Or rather making your eyes twitch around, trying to find what you missed. While listening to ambient something that is nothingess that is supposed to be sound and soundtrack.\nWhat it gives is 36 more levels. And they are as real deal as in Hexcells Plus, tutorials taking little time before sending you to solve many challenging puzzles. Maybe even slightly harder, one level takes a lot of \"what if blue hexes were there\" preplanning.\nBut well, that's about it, the puzzles challenge isn't as different as between Hexcells and Hexcells Plus and Infinite doesn't introduce not even a single new element this time around.\nOh, and you can also easily cheat, by clicking on everything on the map, then remembering it and redoing the puzzle perfectly. Better resist this and instead do it all fairly, restarting upon a single mistake.\n\nInstead it gives you a whole new mode: Infinite mode!  Which brings out a randomizer into play, finally. And it's still more fair than Minesweepers.\nPuzzles there are generated from the certain some-digit number, so it could be shared. You are present with few options, where you can either randomly generate it, or you can generate based on current date (so you would know what some others got to experience same puzzle as you today), or you can paste the number (that you saved because you want to farm achievement on easy puzzle or because friend shared with you) or you can continue the puzzle on which you leaved the game.\nPuzzles are always made to be so you can figure them out fairly. And well, there are so much you can randomize and keep it fair, that you find the experience actually quite repetive. You will quickly learn the possible field form. All the methods it uses. Even more annoyingly, it can be overloaded with more than enough information. So this much-awaited feature isn't going to last so long either.\n\nIt's still probably the best Hexcells out of pack, having levels as good as in Hexcells Plus plus the bonus randomizer feature.

You don't need to have played the previous Hexcells games before (count me in), but it's the first Hexcells game, which includes a random puzzle generator, if I'm not mistaken. Therefore the prior titles are obsolete and Hexcells Infinite could be all you need. The objective is similar to Minesweeper: identify all blue fields (bombs) and reveal the whole stage. The hexcells themselves and the new game mechanisms like indicators, which will reveal, how many blue fields are widespreaded in one straight line or how many have to be in a certain area and in which order (in sequence or detached), are great innovations and can deliver a great and satisfying challenge for your brain, especially in huge levels, where you can easily loose the overview and have to count a lot. On average most levels can be solved in 7-20 minutes.\n\nThe game has 2 modes: chapter mode (6 chapters with 6 levels per chapter) and infinite mode (generate random levels (8 digit seed number), share your level by sharing your seed number, import seed numbers from friends or simply use the date of the day as seed number)\n\n\n[b]Pro:[/b]\n[list][*]easy to learn, hard to master without doing one single mistake\n[*]no gameover if you've done a mistake (BUT you have to replay the whole level, if you want to gain 100% in every level and the related achievement)\n[*]no time limit (time will still be logged)\n[*]relaxing and zenlike atmosphere/music\n[*]36 challenging predefined levels plus random puzzle generator = more puzzles than you will ever play, probably\n[*]the random generated levels can be shared with other people\n[*]extremely addicting\n[*]very high replayability\n[*]mid-level saving possible\n[*]price[/list]\n\n\n[b]Neutral:[/b]\n[list][*]you could get the ambition to punch someone or destroy something, if you did an unwary turn (again) and have to repeat the same level (again) for perfection (that's no contra, because difficulty is an essential part of logic games, but still....AAAARGH)[/list]\n\n\n[b]Contra:[/b]\n[list][*]surprisingly nothing[/list]\n\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nHexcells Infinite is the perfection of an ancient logic puzzle game, simple as that. It's another useful game for a healthy brain workout and I have absolutely nothing to complain about. If you've played Hexcells or Hexcells Plus before and liked it, but you've missed a random puzzle generator, then here it is, the true INFINITE version! It's no problem, if you haven't played Hexcells before. You can learn it easily and have a great time staring at your screen until your eyes pop out of your head. The random puzzle generator guarantees a very high replayability and endless fun. You can get a lot of entertainment for a very fair price. Absolutely recommendable for logic puzzle lovers.

The community made puzzles are a good way of getting some tricky puzzles to do. Lastly, I have to say that I was disappointed to find that the first few worlds were once again a too easy tutorial, and I wish that the tutorial levels had been put into a separate section of the game so that we could have had 6 full worlds of puzzles to exercise \u201cthe little grey cells\u201d to quote Poirot.\n\n[b]Too Short[/b]\nAgain, this second issue was addressed in two ways - infinite mode, and community made puzzles. Infinite mode generates random puzzles for the user to complete and it certainly satisfies the issue of there not being enough puzzles. However, whilst it delivers quantity, it fails at quality. By quality I mean difficulty, because the randomly generate puzzles are far from difficult. It seems like a great idea with potential, but it could definitely do with some difficulty settings so that you can request hard random puzzles. The community made puzzles offer some harder choices to do, but it will take time for the selection to be built up.\n\n[b]Community Puzzles[/b]\nI know this is getting a bit long, but this is an interesting new part of this particular Hexcells game. I will point you to the post that explains it and strongly suggest that you watch the two videos there because they do all the explaining (I originally didn\u2019t bother to watch them and was confused for it). It is very easy to play custom puzzles, you simply copy the puzzle to the clipboard, open Hexcells, and click the option in the bottom right to play a custom puzzle. Making your own puzzles is something I haven\u2019t yet explored. One note is that I\u2019ve learned to mostly avoid any that have custom rules because the logic sometimes seems a bit sketchy leaving you to guess.\n\n[b]Community Puzzle Links[/b]**\n[list][*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/304410/announcements/detail/233383138547016335]Hexcells Infinite Announcement - Custom Level Support[/url]\n[*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/304410/discussions/0/613936673556813085/]Hexcells Inifinite > General Discussions > Topic Details > \u201cLevel Editor: Create and Play Custom Levels!\u201d[/url]\n[*][url=http://www.reddit.com/r/hexcellslevels/]Hexcells Infinite community shared levels on Reddit[/url][/list]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe concept of this game is wonderful. It adds a few levels of complication than Minesweeper and the solutions are all attainable through pure logic. No guesses are required, if they are sometimes tempting to do, so get in touch with your inner vulcan mind.\n\nSome of those complications I mentioned include:\n[list][*]cells are hexagons\n[*]hint numbers are quite varied, and form a set of logical rules \n[list][*]in cells\n[*]at the top of columns/rows\n[*]signify that \"mines\" are adjacent\n[*]signify that \"mines\" can not be adjacent\n[*]a larger hex area has a certain number of \"mines\"\n[/list][/list]\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nVery simple - right click and left click. Plus, now featuring a button in-game to flip the button functions! Rejoice! This can also still be changed about in the options dialogue that pops up when opening the game.\n\nAlthough, by this time I've become entirely accustomed to them and didn't make too many stupid mistakes by hitting the wrong button. \n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1]\nNo storyline, doesn't need one.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nRelaxing gentle zen echoey noises. Also, when you click a cell you get nice tinkling chime-like noises. I don't know why that makes it more satisfying to click on cells, but it does! It's fun to go back to the really easy puzzles and click through like mad to get a cascade of tinkling noises.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nVery crisp, clean, and clear. The numbers are reasonably large. Some puzzles form an interesting overall image or pattern, and overall, the puzzles come across as well designed. There is also an option in-game to make blue cells with numbers have a different outline effect.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[b]+ [/b]crisp clean graphics whose job is to be functional\n[b]+ [/b]simple controls to grasp\n[b]+ [/b]more interesting concept than random old Minesweeper\n[b]+ [/b]improvements over the first two games\n[b]+ [/b]community made puzzles create more variety\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[b]- [/b]still lacking in [b]really[/b] tough puzzles\n[b]- [/b]the random puzzles are too easy\n\n[h1]Help Me Help You[/h1]\n[b]If you did not find this review helpful,[/b] I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn\u2019t helpful for you.

I brewed some coffee, have some nice cookies on plate. Clicked the game, headphones on, play time. \n\nThings that I noticed, is that this game is incredibly logical. Horsemedic (guy who commented) was right, this game is entirely made out of logic, to the point of ridiculousness. \nOne of the rule, \"-#- means that blue numbers of panels are NOT connected\", sounds quite simple, but when you think about it, this phrase DID NOT say \"ALL blue panels are NOT connected\". Which means, there is at least one panel that isn't next to each other, but has no guarantee in -3- as this can have 3 blue panels that are not connected, or have pair that is next each to other and have one separated. While this only make the game confusing, it still is, following the rule of the game.\n\nFurther that I played, I noticed that this \"hole\" of the rule isn't conflicting the game at all. If you get stuck, you can look for other clues. Eventually you'll hit the spot you were stuck on, but with more clues to help out. \n\nI've already said in the last review but the graphic and music are top notch. I like the color use of this game, it's gentle and comfortable to see it for long time. Music is very relaxing, good soothing sound.\n\nI guess, the only complain that I can make at this point is that I wish there were spread sheet of set of rules instead of explaining it beliefly and let you try it out during the gameplay. (which helps too but isn't very clear sometime) As understanding the set of rules become the most crucial part of this game I think developer could have spent a little more time for it. Maybe, on the first Hexcell, it might have been more user friendly. I haven't tried it yet.\n\nAs a last note, this is NOT a minesweeper. Who ever said it is, did not think enough through like me. The format is very close to it, I agree, but the minesweeper somtime takes you to a gamble while Hexcell can make \"educated guess\" to clear without making single mistake. \n\nSo let me say it again- this game, is NOT a minesweeper. It is more like a Sudoku. Don't expect be like one; this game has no timer, nor any score system for it. Take your time. Grab coffee or tea. Rewind your brain and take the challenge. \n\nI recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1418179477, "timestamp_updated": 1418318331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13300518": {"recommendationid": "13300518", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992967892", "num_games_owned": 11168, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418175433}, "language": "english", "review": "Hexcells Infinite is just an improved iteration of the Hexcells games with the single added feature of a random set generator. \n\nThat's pretty much it.

While a naive comparison, the game plays similarly to a very advanced Minesweeper. By the second act, though, you'll have discovered the futility of that comparison; this game is on an entirely different level and has an elegance in the solutions that random Minesweeper puzzles cannot ever hope to achieve.\n\nA couple of the puzzles stumped me for more than 90 minutes, and my roommate rapidly grew tired of me talking the solution out loud as I moved my mouse around. There's a brilliant simplicity to the gameplay and yet, while playing, one must keep a large amount of logic in their head. It's easy to get overwhelmed by logic in one area of the puzzle while overlooking the simple move forward in another area, and the feeling is intense when you slap your forehead in stupidity on discovering it.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite relaxing, and even after working on the same puzzle for an hour it did not grow tiresome. It's really fun when you get on a \"roll\" of solving the puzzle, too, because you generate little ditties as a reward.\n\nThe only negative of Infinite compared to the rest of the series is the randomly-generated puzzles. The developer added these so that he could put a bow on the series and call it done and, while they do indeed fill a gap, you can tell they're a far different experience than the handmade puzzles (don't worry, Infinite has the same number of handmade puzzles as the previous two). Sudoku has this issue, too, and it's just the nature of puzzle generation algorithms. Still, if you're dying for a new puzzle, they might hold you over, otherwise I'd just play them for the achievement.\n\nAt any rate, I've found if I step away from a puzzle or play others, I forget a solution, so you could probably revisit the entire series in a few weeks' time and have a whole new game.\n\nThe entire Hexcells series contains puzzles that are among the greatest I've ever solved. I highly recommend the entire collection, and also very strongly recommend that you start with Hexcells. It is easier than the other two, this one included, by far. Definitely, though, work up to this one.

Then, as the puzzles continued, my mind became so occupied with the intersecting logic that I stopped trying to compare it to other games at all. \n\nThe level design is excellent, and the puzzle progression slowly encourages you to learn new solving techniques, with no huge jumps in difficulty. In addition to the handmade puzzles, Hexcells Infinite includes a random puzzle generator to increase your playtime, and add a nice break when you get stuck in the main game. \n\nHexcells Infinite improves on the previous versions by allowing you to save your progress in every.

They fixed one of my major gripes from previous iterations with this one in that when you exit a puzzle, it saves your progress so that you can continue at a later date. My only two issues remaining are as follows: 1) you cannot see, on the main map screen, which levels you have perfected (no mistakes), which is irritating if you are going for the perfect score; 2) you have to be 100% sure of every tile if you are going for the perfectionist badge as there is no 'undo' option, so one mistake on a massive grid means beginning all over again.\n\nThat said, I'm a perfectionist, and I get mad with myself when I make mistakes! If you haven't played these games, check them all out. Infinite introduces the 'infinite' puzzle mode, which relies on seed-based generation to present you with one of one million puzzles to work on, so it will keep you going for a while! That said, many of the generated levels (having completed over 60 at this point) are the same map with different layouts of blues and greys - unsurprising, but I seem to get one map in particular quite a lot.\n\nHighly recommended for puzzle fans.

It has been called a cross between minesweeper and picross, and the description fits the basic mechanics. The game is soothing, with great sound and visual design, and with no time pressure. Although it doesn't end when you make a mistake, instead allowing you to continue playing, it does encourage you to keep mistakes to a minimum by giving you a score at the end of the puzzle, which is used to unlock furthur puzzles.\n\nAs for the puzzle design itself, the puzzles that come with the game have a great difficulty curve, but one which works best if you've played the first two games. It starts off with a refresher on the mechanics, but quickly becomes devilishly difficult. I fully recommend sleeping on some of them and coming back with a fresh pair of eyes; this is something the game lets you do, as you can end a puzzle and come back at any time. One potential issue with this is that it forgets which clues you have highlit or dismissed, although you may consider that to be a good thing as it forces you to reconsider every clue when you come back to the puzzle.\n\nThe automatically-generated \"infinite\" puzzles are much less difficult, but still fun for the most part.

Of course the cells are hexagonal rather than square, but it is still VERY minesweeper to start with (the one major difference being that in this game you never have to guess; you're welcome to if you want, but you can always work it out somehow).\n\nIt really starts to pick up as you play through though; new rules to play to are introduced- you are given numbers of cells that must be adjacent, numbers that aren't adjacent, numbers over entire columns or diagonal lines of the game's grid and finally numbers that tell you how many cells up to two cells away are in the pattern.\n\nEvery rule is simple, and they're introduced at a good pace that lets you get used to them before the next one comes along. But the sum of the 6 or 7 simple rules and the large variety in sizes and shapes of game grids provides some fabulously complicated puzzles; and they seem to be done in such a way so that there are any number of places to get stuck, not just one incredibly hard point per level that a lot of other puzzle games seem to end up with.\n\nI haven't tried too many of the randomly generated levels- you can use 8 digit seeds to create levels (theoretically 100 million of them)- the ones I have had a go at are obviously not as well crafted as the main levels in the games \"campaign\", but they did offer more difficulty than I expected, so I was pleased by that as well.\n\nTL:DR; This is like a harder, much more complicated and polished minesweeper with more rules to remember; leading to more variety in the levels, with the added advantage that there is no guessing required.

Most of the puzzles it generates are very similar and can be blazed through very quickly due to lots of obvious clues.  None of them come anywhere close to the difficulty of the hand-made puzzles.  That is a general problem with procedurally-generated content though.  It's extremely difficult to make it as good as hand-made content.\n\nDespite the disappointing puzzle generator, the game is just as fun as previous Hexcells and I highly recommend it to puzzle game fans.", "timestamp_created": 1410461959, "timestamp_updated": 1410461959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12041824": {"recommendationid": "12041824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023019827", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 2695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425288273}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall: Excellent\nDifficulty: Medium-high, some High\n\nLikes:\n- Every puzzle can be solved without guessing\n- Campaign puzzles are well-designed (e.g., no unnecessary redundant clues, solutions are often subtle)\n- Campaign puzzles can be very challenging\n- Has procedurally generated puzzles\n- Supports player-created levels!

I regret that only one of them provides special instructions (in this case \"each column contains an odd number of blue cells\") as I feel more of them would benefit the challenge variety. This absence is also partially responsible for the scarcity of satisfying \"aha\" moments, when several clues combine beautifully into a challenging part of the solution. Previous games had me complaining about the puzzles' less than perfect elegance: you usually have quite more clues than you really need. This is still a problem, even if it's now marginally less severe than it was. Another issue, especially for newcomers, is that nowhere in the instructions does the game direct your attention to the box at the top left corner, containing the number of yet undiscovered blue cells, even though it's an essential information for many of the puzzles. All of that didn't stop me from enjoying the 36 puzzles and feeling a real satisfaction each time I could perfect one. They are more missed opportunities than mortal sins.\n\nThe real attraction of Hexcelles Infinite, of course, is the randomly generated levels. There are 100 millions of them, so there is no risk of running out before growing completely tired of Hexcells. You can let the computer choose or you can specify a seed yourself, so it's easy to share a level with your friends . There is an option to use the date as a seed as well, and have a \"puzzle of the day\", but don't expect a leaderboard for it, \u00e0 la Spelunky. The real question is this: \"Are the randomly-generated puzzles as good as the hand-crafted one?\" Predictably, the answer is no. Mainly because the elegance issue, that I mentioned above, is considerably worse. Random levels are chock-full of redundant clues, and lack any kind of the symmetry that makes a puzzle attractive. I find that a real shame, as it shouldn't be too difficult to devise an algorithm that gets rid of some of the redundancy, and maybe couple it with a difficulty setting. Are the random puzzles good enough to sustain interest? Your mileage may vary, depending on whether you play casually, or seriously. \"Serious\" players will lament the low difficulty. Most of them took me less than 4 minutes and I've yet to find one that I couldn't solve in less than 10. But that may be exactly what you're looking for, and as a way to relax and pass a bit of time, the random puzzle generator is serviceable. Nevertheless, my impression is that those that enjoy the kind of challenge offered by the 36 main levels, will find the random ones too trivial for their taste.\n\nAudio-visually, Hexcells Infinite is identical to its predecessors. You get the same white, blue and yellow colours, the same menu presentation, the same ambient soundscapes... It's all very nice and stylish, but a bit of variety, like selectable visual themes, for example, would have been welcome.\n\nHexcells Infinite is the best Hexcells yet. It feature another 36 good, difficult puzzles and the random number generator has the potential to satisfy your need for casual puzzle solving during a great many hours.", "timestamp_created": 1410186023, "timestamp_updated": 1410186023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712815", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12020679": {"recommendationid": "12020679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006768620", "num_games_owned": 1028, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410511149}, "language": "english", "review": "While Hexcells Plus still is the best of the 3 Hexcells titles(featuring the most balanced puzzle set) more Hexcells is never a bad thing and Infinite is certainly worth picking up. Though having said that, while most definitely recommended, it is not without flaws either.\n\nIn Infinite there is a difficulty jump in some puzzles, unfortunately in such a way that you feel rewarded by guessing more than in Plus. The obscurity of or mental notation required for some late game \"hints\" without any method to make notations in game(ie: Minesweeper question marks or Sudoku progams often having multiple number entry \"scratch paper\" type options) can feel overwhelming, and hurts the general relaxing ambiance of the series as it introduces an element of frustration not present in the previous two games.\n\nThe Infinite puzzle generator is also a bit of a bust. While a wonderful idea, the unfortunate truth is that random generated puzzles in this sort of game simply can't compare with hand crafted(and the developer does an excellent job at that). And as there is no difficulty option when generating the puzzles, you are often thrown a near endless parade of fairly simple(and overly large for that simplicity) boards. Rather than the random generator, being able to access player designed puzzle might be a better option for extending the life of the game, be it through workshop integration or simply allowing a puzzle editor that would provide a sharable code as the random seed generator does now.\n\nAnyway, bottom line is this: Any Hexcells is amazing, but if you have to choose between one of the three go with Plus still.

perfectly. The basic Minesweper-like premise of uncovering and filling in hexagons based on numerical clues remains, but the premade puzzles are more well thought out than ever. You are able to save your progress and come back later, a welcome addition, as well as restarting without having to exit the level entirely. \n\nThe infinite puzzle generator is the real draw of this game, and it does not disappoint. The algorithm doesn't generate puzzles that are quite as clean and stripped down as the main game; there are often redundant clues. This also means they tend to be easier, though, which comes as a relief to me after spending an hour unsuccessfully wrestling with a level 6 puzzle. I was a little apprehensive about the procedurally generated levels; I was reminded of Minesweeper's frequent guesses and subsequent frustration. There's no guessing required, though, at least in the levels I played. Really, having played the other two games in the series, I should have known better. There are daily puzzles (specifically, puzzles using the current date as the seed), and you can also play random puzzles. If you like, you can use the seed of a given puzzle and share it to challenge your friends.\n\nAll in all, if you like this sort of puzzle game, you should pick up Hexcells Infinite. It's worth it at full price. I'd recommend getting the others as well.

It's essentially an ultimate version with some _really_ hard levels, where you can stare at the board for ten minutes at a time before you have deduced the next possible step.\n\nThe logic involved seems to me to be a bit more advanced than in Plus sometimes. There are for example more occasions, in which the puzzles require counting the remaining blues and determining by addition of unsaturated column-restrictions and number-blocks, that there is no possible way that some unrelated  cells could be anything other than blacks (or blues), often giving you the decisive hint to complete the puzzle.\n\nI'm three levels short of completing the game, but will pause for now, since it's getting late and sleeping during work hours is for some reason frowned upon at my job. But the level-generator is certainly great for long-term motivation and I can see myself going back to it every now and again, even if the resulting puzzles don't seem to be as challening or clever than the hand-made ones.\n\nIn terms of presentation, little has changed compared to Hexcells Plus. Wouldn't have needed to anyway, in my opinion. Saving puzzles is nice though when you're stuck, and as someone who enjoys watching tv-shows or listening to music while playing, the option to turn off music and sound separately is great and much appreciated.\n\nIn conclusion: Truly good successor with very well designed puzzles and another difficulty-increase. The level-generator is the icing on the cake, I recommend this game to every puzzle-fan. Though if you've never played any hexcell-game, you might as well start with Plus (or even the original, which I've personally found a bit too easy, but still makes an excellent tutorial to the series). Just play them all in order, and continue playing infinite for the random-puzzles once you're done with the handcrafted levels! :)", "timestamp_created": 1409615058, "timestamp_updated": 1409615058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11951510": {"recommendationid": "11951510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075135779", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409600756}, "language": "english", "review": "Take a look at Hexcells here http://youtu.be/jBxeUihyaUs", "timestamp_created": 1409606244, "timestamp_updated": 1409606244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458136", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11951093": {"recommendationid": "11951093", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991641137", "num_games_owned": 540, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450551979}, "language": "english", "review": "I have become one with the hexagons, and it is glorious.", "timestamp_created": 1409603521, "timestamp_updated": 1409603521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11949833": {"recommendationid": "11949833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031837797", "num_games_owned": 6025, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476614272}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u516d\u8fb9\u5f62\u626b\u96f7\u7b2c\u4e09\u4f5c, \u5fc5\u987b\u597d\u8bc4!\n\u8fd8\u591a\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u529f\u80fd, \u518d\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u6253\u901a\u4e00\u6b21\u5c31\u6ca1\u7684\u73a9\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e86!\n\u6839\u672c\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765, 100\u5c0f\u65f6\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f4, \u6211\u6765\u4e86!", "timestamp_created": 1409596587, "timestamp_updated": 1409596587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11949663": {"recommendationid": "11949663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000485607", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423623825}, "language": "english", "review": "4:20 with 4 mistakes on random puzzle 69696969", "timestamp_created": 1409595500, "timestamp_updated": 1409595500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.268287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11949643": {"recommendationid": "11949643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041818023", "num_games_owned": 1830, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 1400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411003898}, "language": "english", "review": "The Hexcells series are my favorite puzzle games.

Ha, Hexcells Infinite just laughs at that.\nThe puzzles are so well made and most of the time you'll stare at your screen for a good 10 minutes until you see what you have to do for the next step, and often it turns out to be the most simple thing, the game hides its clues very well in the least obvious way possible, so I really recommend playing the first two games before this one to get you ready, but before you do that, i'll let you know, that no matter what, there is no need to guess in all of the Hexcells games at all, so try to think twice before you make your next move!\n\nAnd now, the new stuff! Randomly generated levels, I find them pretty enjoyable, they are all possible without guessing, which is impressing! The only problem I have with them is that they are kind of \"too easy\" compare to Hexcells Infinite levels, but I don't blame the creator for that, they are still very enjoyable to solve. \n\nAnd the last thing left, the level editor, yes you heard me, a LEVEL EDITOR, everyone likes level editors (Ri.. right??), however, the level editor does not come with the game and needs to be downloaded from the Steam Community, but I didn't really mind that, the level editor also has an auto-solver that tries to solve your puzzles to make sure they are 100% possible without guessing, and I find that neat, the editor is fun to mess around with, and will sure give you a few hours of enjoyment. \n\nAnd now for my final opinion:\nHexcells Infinite is a MUST for any puzzle fan, it's great, fun, cheap, and has a great replay value because of the randomly generated levels and the level editor.\n\n*If you liked Hexcells Infinite you may also like:*\n- Hexcells and Hexcells Plus.\n- Squarecells. \n- Crosscells.\nEvery other puzzle game made by the same developer, basically.", "timestamp_created": 1409593263, "timestamp_updated": 1511885719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

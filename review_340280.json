I found it relaxing and enjoyable, that is until I got to a certain point of the game.\n\nI think they were onto something with this. The blue and red stages were very fun and enjoyable, and I wish they would have stuck with that concept and pushed it throughout the entire game.\n\nAlthough at the time of writing this review, I only have a half hour on it, it was mostly because it stopped being fun and enjoyable once I got to the green section. It was fun, enjoyable, relaxing, that is until it kicked you in the face with the green part and was more frustrating than anything.\n\nThat's not to say there isn't a person that would love this game. Anybody that derives an enjoyment from hard puzzles should absolutely love this game. But I'll have to say, if you're interested because you just want to unwind on something simple and fun, you'll only enjoy the first ~20 minutes worth of this game.

Innercube has six  different colored sided cubes, but Cubot cubes are just one colored. Well but let's now discuss Cubot.\n\nCubots is the currency you can earn in this game after completing each level. You can buy solutions for that (it starts with 8 cubots) but who seriously does? There's apparently no other purpose of Cubots. Like in Hexcells where you need the points to unlock next levels. In Cubot every level is automatically unlocked after beating stage 6 - evertyime. Each level has 8 stages a 10 levels that makes 80 levels altogether - That's OK. \n\nThe levels can be distinguished by new cube types (different colors: red does double steps, green has reversed movement, and so on ... ) or new puzzle elements (like colorchangers, portals, elevators or stoppers). \nThe aim is to bring all cubes to the same colored fields in the end. Very positive is that the level design has different layers where you also can fall down from a higher level. I also liked much the level select menu with a miniature picture of the whole map. They even lately added a level editor.\n\nNow comes the moan. This game makes fun for sure. But it's not as high as expected. It seems sterile that after every solved stage 7 you'll get as reward a hardcoded wise quote of Erno Rubik, Eric Schmidt or Albert Einstein. It isn't random and/or surprising. Also the puzzle elements are well mixedup in higher levels, but there's no higher value to progress at all.\nI missed some basic game elements like the \"undo\" button which I'm used to. Some menus do not respond on the first click. It also seems after once changing the camera view or use the mouse roll gesture the WASD controls get temporarly deactivated. That's annoying because these are just little fixable bugs. But my first impression got spoiled due to that.\n\nCubot is not a bad game. I wouldn't say that and I recommend it.

"At its core, this is a really good puzzle game with some great ideas. You eventually have to track many things at once that behave in different ways, while figuring out how to make them work together. \n\nIts not perfect. New concepts and block behaviors are shown with an animation before the levels in which they first appear, but these animations/descriptions are not particularly clear. It doesn't matter, though, because the first few groups of levels are exceptionally easy - in general, the game progresses a little too slow at the beginning. Its not 'that' hard to figure out the basics! And new mechanics are easier and easier to fit in, since you already have a handle on the previous ones. \n\nIt has a very pretty aesthetic, but the usability and controls don't live up to it. There doesn't seem to be an ideal setup - controller makes most sense for the core gameplay, but the menus are so slow with a controller that I stick with mouse/keyboard - however, mouse controls are awkward. Keyboard is fine, but I gotta be careful not to left click! \n\nThe biggest issue by far is lack of any kind of 'undo'. When you've got a level that takes 20+ moves at minimum, and you're going for that minimum score, you don't want to make a mistake 20 moves in!

The game is also colourful, even if it uses around 5 colours (black, white, red, blue, green), they are used well and simply to differentiate the cubes.\n\n+ Gameplay is frustrating at a good level, it really teaches us how annoying the human brain can, you will play a level so hard but when you finally look past the complications and realise how simple it is, you have a laugh and possibly call yourself an idiot, then experience the same thing the next level. Although the game is really short and easy controls as if it were a mobile game, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this indie game was ported to mobile devices like [i] Super Hexagon [/i]. The fact it allows the use of Xbox 360 Controllers and PS3 Controllers, allows for more consoles to play it, so it could possibly find itself on the Xbox Store or the PSN.\n\n+ The controls are extremely simple, the arrow keys to change angle, and the WASD keys to move the keys, that is absolutely it. Nothing else is needed to play the game. So Cubot continues to keep it simple.\n\n+ The length of the game is short, that is not bad but some people who love puzzles love lots of puzzles, so since this game looks young, they could possibly introduce a Steam Workshop for the community to create puzzles as well, or give a weekly puzzle, so the game can last longer than just play, finish and leave it in storage forever.\n\n+ Simplicity is the strongest feature of the game, it is focused sorely on making the game so simple to the level where it looks complex, but it isn\u2019t. That is what makes the game so great. We love challenges but they give us something so easy its challenging.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nTruthfully, I was scrolling through the Store page, just looking around and I find this $2 game on steam, the pictures and description looked intriguing and I enjoy puzzle games, so I figures why not. And it is one hell of a good way to spend two dollars I'll give ya that.\n\nCubot achieved a level of simplicity whereas it is very complex. The beginning levels of the game is simple but gradually they make it seem harder, but once you see past the complexity and use simplicity, the game will seem so much easier and you will feel like an idiot. They repeatedly shove in your face that this is simple, so treat it simply. But the human brain isn't hardwired to look at things simply, it is hardwired to over complicate things and look too deeply into something when the answer is literally in your face.\n\nI recommend this game if you like having a more than decent puzzle game at a very affordable and cheap price.", "timestamp_created": 1420780844, "timestamp_updated": 1420784470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601182", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13903519": {"recommendationid": "13903519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071528308", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437882584}, "language": "english", "review": "Brain, use.", "timestamp_created": 1420773591, "timestamp_updated": 1420773591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.370991", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13903090": {"recommendationid": "13903090", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970667973", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422465880}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it", "timestamp_created": 1420770583, "timestamp_updated": 1420770583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446364", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13902956": {"recommendationid": "13902956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040448680", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420928349}, "language": "english", "review": "I've really enjoyed this game so far.

The difficulty comes from the fact that there are multiple levels (extending the game into three dimensions) to deal with, and all cubes move simulaneously; when a cube is moved left, every cube will move to the left. This leads to very interesting and unique gameplay, and as the levels progress, the game grows increasingly challenging. For the perfectionist, at the end of each level, the perfect score for that level is revealed, and you can then retry the level to lower your score the one or two (or five or ten) moves. However, completing the game and earning the achievements do not require this, making the game fun for serious and casual gamers.\n\nThe only downside I found to the game is that the sound played when you hover over a button, something required in-between every level, is harsh and out of place with the music.

The controls consist of (if using the WASD/Mouse) using the WASD to move the cubes Up/Down/Left/Right and using the mouse to move the angle of the camera so you can see the puzzle from different angles. The cubes move square by square and that is pretty much it. \n\nSimple Gameplay:\nThe objective of each level is to get the colored cubes to the matching colored tile at the same time.\nThe game introduces the player to different mechanics in the puzzle as the player progresses through each level. Using WASD keys (or whatever control scheme you desire), players move the cubes one tile by one tile, two tile by two tile, etc. (depending on the color of the cube). However the puzzles get harder as the player realizes that cubes of the same color both move simultaneously with each press and introduce more things such as buttons.\n\nSimple Graphics: \nCubot offers a very clean and simple visuals. As the screenshots show, it's cubes with various colors and white tiles with colors painted into some of them.\n\n* Audio Simplicity:\nAfter spending a tiny bit more time on the game, I personally thought that the audio was extremely soothing and compliments the pace and style of Cubot. Although if you are very conscious of the audio, it may become too repetitive or get annoying. Cubot's soundtrack is very, as stated before, soothing and quite atmospheric, somewhat similar to Antichamber for those who have played it. However, some sounds are generated from, for example, hovering the mouse over a menu button (as some reviews have stated) may be \"out of place,\" it's just like Antichamber when you pick up a cube or interact with an object, nothing too awkward. \n\n9/10 Simply Complex.\n\n* Edited (1/12/2015)", "timestamp_created": 1420743876, "timestamp_updated": 1421099565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13897448": {"recommendationid": "13897448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093594649", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420741912}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f!!! \u0417\u0430\u0434\u0443\u043c\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 5+", "timestamp_created": 1420741951, "timestamp_updated": 1420741951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13896847": {"recommendationid": "13896847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041358331", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431365879}, "language": "english", "review": "First 3 or 4 Chapters: Hm, okay, easy game.\nThen it starts to melt your damn brain...\nBut seriously, it is a very nice game.

A cynic may suspect that this \u201cminimalism\u201d is a carelessly-crafted excuse for a lazy or empty game. Such skepticism could not be more misplaced.\n\nCubot is puzzle-solving game comparable to sliding puzzles, or perhaps to Rush Hour. Cubot adds to these games what could only be feasible in a three- dimensional game: three dimensions. The objective of the game is to land each block\u2014puzzles quickly include more than one block, onto its respective target location. Each action, however, moves all blocks in accordance with the game\u2019s rules as well as with each block\u2019s own distinctive properties. There are, as far as I can tell, ten different kinds of blocks. One moves one space per turn, another moves two. One presents or removes obstacles, another moves in the opposite direction of all other blocks. There are 80 levels and, while this isn\u2019t the most difficult game ever presented, it is satisfying to solve (particularly in the fewest number of turns possible). \n\nOn top of these mechanics, the game manages to have a personality despite its minimalist form. The music is calm and the UI is very clean. The developers even threw in some famous quotes, and they\u2019re about\u2014you guessed it\u2014solving puzzles. For the low starting price of $2 and the presumption that it will get even cheaper, this game is certainly worth it if you like puzzles (I\u2019m enjoying this game the same way that I enjoy the Portal games, even without the witty dialogue) or if you\u2019re looking for a game that isn\u2019t too difficult to 100%.

This one involves moving cubes around to get them to their correct colored tiles, with different types of cubes introduced every chapter. I finished the game in about 5 hours. There are 10 chapters with 8 puzzles in each.\n\nThis will be my first negative review as well as the first game where I asked steam for a refund (which I was unable to get so I finished the game to be able to write the most complete review I could). I really enjoy puzzle games and I also enjoy a challenge, but what I dislike when it comes to puzzle games is tedium. This game is, in my opinion, a very good example of tedium vs. challenge.\n\nThe first few chapters were okay in this aspect because the game still hadn't gotten too complicated, but it was in the later half of the game where it really got frustrating in a bad way. This game doesn't have an undo button of any sort, which is a real problem, especially when they count every move you make. If you plan to make the number of moves determine how well a player did, then you gotta give people a chance to rethink something or unto a misclick. There were a lot of times that I had to start the level at the very beginning again because \"x\" cube fell to \"x\" location, making it impossible to finish the puzzle. That would leave me to do the 30 - 60 moves again.\n\nIf you are trying to get the \"Best Score\" of the level, then you will have an exponentially harder time at it. Honestly there was enough challenge without the added tedium of no undo. Sometimes you gotta move a cube to figure something out, but this forced you to do long puzzles in your head, or suffer many many restarts. I think one of the best qualities about puzzle games is that it helps you improve your puzzling skills and help you undersand how to solve certain things, but with the level restart it takes a whole lot longer to understand the concepts of movement and manipulation in this game.\nAnother annoying issue I found was the instruction animations and quotes that couldn't be skipped, so when you repeated those levels you would get that screen over and over. This really becomes infuriating when you have already had to restart the level fifteen times because of mistakes. When I started I had hoped to have \"Best Score\" on all of the levels, but I gave that up half way through for the sake of the little sanity I had left at that point. It even got so aggravating that I used a walkthrough for the last two chapters.\n\nThe rest of the game's aspects were ok - not anything super impressive, but not anything horrible either. The minimalist graphics and animations of the cubes were nice. The settings were simple but effective enough for a game like this. The opening menu was a bit annoying to look at because of the focus on the social media buttons and tne giant \"play\" button in the center with the real menu in much smaller text below that. It just made it feel clunky and unecessary, but overall it still wasn't confusing to navigate. The music and sound effects were fine, as they weren't distracting or too annoying, but they weren't exactly great to listen to after extended periods of time. (It would've been nice to have slight music variation.)\n\nTL;DR After playing through this game in its entirety, I've come to the conclusion that the negatives outweighed the good. Any fun factor the game might've had was completely lost in the tedium. Not being able to undo miskates or skip things you have seen before makes even generally patient people want to tear their hair out. If you are looking for games like this I would reccomend Cubicolor, or Blockwick 2. Despite the negatives I listed, I did see the potential in this game and I think the developer could really make something great if they continue making games, so I hope my review isn't too discouraging, as I would definitely be interested in seeing what comes from the developer next!", "timestamp_created": 1516580976, "timestamp_updated": 1516581997, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 237, "total_negative": 17, "total_reviews": 254}}

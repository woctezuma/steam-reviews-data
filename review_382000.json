It was incredibly simple and intuitive but most of all, fun!  Mindshow is amazing and really gets your imagination flowing with the various props, settings, and characters you're given access to.  My 8 year old daughter ended up absolutely loving Mindshow and she has made about 10 videos herself already.  \n\nI do have some minor gripes and that mainly consists of the frequency of bugs I've encountered, most of them ending up forcing me to exit the game and reload it.  Sometimes the software no longer allows me to control or move a character, seemingly at random.  Other times, I can't get past the calibration when it asks me to hold my arms out to my sides because it freezes up.  I'd say these glitches/bugs happen once in a while but more often than not, Mindshow works just fine.\n\nI think it would be amazing if the devs added a feature to add multiple cameras you can place around the scene so that you can capture the action from various angles all at once rather than having to manually record the scene multiple times for each camera angle you want to have.  This feature could also output a separate video file for each camera/angle to make it easier for us to edit them into one video.  That would be amazing!\n\nAll in all, Mindshow makes me incredibly excited to be an owner of a VR headset because this is just not something you can experience with any other medium and it's so much fun!

I have a couple of comments and suggestions for the developers but before that, here are three short clips I made with this software yesterday: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6pKLYta47afVdovc3D3T5mTa3QX1RgU8\n\nWhat I love:\n\n-The auto smoothed camera movements when recording\n-The amazingly well done inverse kinematics\n-Extremely easy to use UI for expressions and an amazing display of using blend shapes to do so\n-The very quick rendering time for videos\n-The idea overall\n\n(Keep in mind, I realize this is early access and many of these features are probably ALREADY in development, but just in case, here are my thoughts!)\n\nWhat I would love too see improved or added in order of importance (top to bottom: most to least)\n\n1. Allow the user to add on to a current animation by using the slider to start the time at which they would like to resume recording.  This way we wouldn't have to completely overwrite our movement recordings for a character if we want to add more.\n\n2. Allow the user to preview the video they just shot BEFORE rendering it.  This is a big one for me as I am a perfectionist and I do not want to wait for a render every time I try a new camera technique.\n\n3. Allow longer recording time.  This one seems obvious, but I would really love to set my own limits based on my machine's capabilities and memory.\n\n4. Allow more characters in one scene.  Yes, this can become noisy and intensive, but with this being said, I would also recommend allowing for a muted mic setting for background characters.  I would love to be able to add characters that have no speaking parts, but just do idle things in the background.  This may cause lag, but that should be left up to the user to decide.\n\n5.  It would be great to allow users to import their own 3d environments, for instance an option to import a custom .fbx with a navigation mesh build in.  This would be for advanced users, and may be more of a steam workshop detail, but I think it would be great.\n\n6. Just in my opinion, it may be more user friendly to allow the handheld ui (on the right hand) to pop up on touching the thumbpad (not when applying pressure, just touching), and be selected on press down, rather than how the UI currently only shows up if you press and hold down the thumbpad, navigate to the option,  and the option is selected on press up.  Again, just my opinion based on what I think is a more user centered design.\n\n7. While I like the built in camera smoothing, it may be interesting to give the user the option to turn it off for a more deliberately shaky, documentary style video.  With this, it would be nice to give the option to zoom in/out, as well as focus in/out.\n\n8. Lastly, allow for users to stitch multiple camera clips from different angles in the same scene.  Now, this one would technically be higher up the list for me, but I also realize that this can be quite easily done via external software, so for that reason, it may not be as important.\n\nAnd that's that!  I will update if I come accross any other suggestion.  I hope this reaches the developers well.  This is a really great, well made application, and perfect idea for VR.  I will be following this project and I can't wait to see future developments!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1504485847, "timestamp_updated": 1504485847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34724061": {"recommendationid": "34724061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377600766", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504545023}, "language": "english", "review": "i come to work lol this game is fun but i can play it for vr only so it sucks ass", "timestamp_created": 1504482502, "timestamp_updated": 1504482502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34721516": {"recommendationid": "34721516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017007749", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504470372}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the future.

Only then will it live up to its potential for more ambitious users.\n\nUntil then though, there is still a lot of fun to be had!", "timestamp_created": 1504300152, "timestamp_updated": 1504300152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34669190": {"recommendationid": "34669190", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984644722", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513524394}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

Man I wish something like this was around when I was a kid!  Mindshow is just amazing!  I loved what I had seen in vids and trailers and when I launched this title I was so amazed at how easy it was to use!  \n\nIf you like theater,. or man,. IMPROV,. this is a title you just have to have in your library!  being able to set up your own scene and then act it out and then set more actors and jump into them and act,.. with yourself is just a blast!  I was talking to my son about how much fun this could be with a group, playing improv games, one character is played by one person, then you put someone else in the scene and let them play off of the firrst and see where it goes! \n\nCurrently, in early access, you have a set of predone sets and situations you can act off of with some pre recorded actors, or if you like you can pick from a variety of sets, pic up to 3 of several different character models to place as you like in the set, and several props the characters can interact with.  you imagination is the limit!   It seems you are limited to 30 second scenes but that's ok.  Above I posted a short I did for my buddy who just had his first daughter, in the longer scene at the beginning I just recorded several scenes and spliced them together.  nothing fancy just windows movie maker.  After you lay out and act out your scenes you then have a virtual camera you can use to direct and record from any where in the scene.  which is really cool.  I also noticed it uses positional audio which is another plus.  \n\nanimation is just plain intuitive since you just act the scene out and your character model seamlessly moves with you.  their mouths move when you talk, and your right track pad has four facial emotions to give the characters more visual depth.  A couple of the models have voice filters which actually I would love to see more of.  Or the ability to peg a filter to a specific character like a woman for dudes to use and so on.   There arn't any sound effects to add, which is something else I would bet is coming in the future of this title.  \n\nOk this is a free title as of now so you really have no excuse but to download and try.  Things I would like to see in future builds.  More environments, possilby customizable, more characters,. also a character model builder so you could make your own, a sound booth or something so you could add music and sound effects to your scenes.  maybe more than 3 characters as well but if you are creative you can get around that limit.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and download this title! have FUN!!!", "timestamp_created": 1504271056, "timestamp_updated": 1505656241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34657318": {"recommendationid": "34657318", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980702099", "num_games_owned": 561, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507052998}, "language": "english", "review": "GODS WORK.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1504264730, "timestamp_updated": 1504264730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34652250": {"recommendationid": "34652250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287419912", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511879991}, "language": "english", "review": "Was This made for VR or Was VR made for this? \nSimply the Best Game Ever. \nYou are limited only by your imagination.\nRemake your favorite films, Act out some made up story. \nJust waiting to see someone do a whole Shakespeare play in this. \nAwesome Awesome Awesome\nand Its Free!!!!!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1504244926, "timestamp_updated": 1504244926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34651535": {"recommendationid": "34651535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294652176", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509936384}, "language": "english", "review": "it takes forever to save........!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1504241517, "timestamp_updated": 1504241517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497350", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34649446": {"recommendationid": "34649446", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968571015", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504148416}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun, polished, well-thought creative tool!

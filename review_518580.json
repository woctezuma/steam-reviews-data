It's also just as blue as your average episode of R&M with plenty of F Bombs throughout.\n\nThe game says it requires the HTC Vive but it worked fine on the Oculus Rift, however the whole game was designed for Room Scale VR, and for the most part you'll be facing away from the sensors which did for me, cause the occasional issue with occlusion, but nothing that ruined the experience. There is no teleportation so you will need an area of around 2m x 1.5m to be able to reach the corners of the room, but again, there aren't really any situations where this is required.\n\nThe game itself is a linear experience where you move between a series of VR worlds and have to try and find your way to the next one, which is usually only a matter of doing one simple puzzle, but the fun of each zone for me was to hang around and listen to all the dialog. You could probably finish the game in 5 minutes if you are rushing through, but there is 20-30 minutes of content there if you take your time and listen to everything.\n\nOverall this is one of the better free VR experiences i've tried and though there isn't really any reason to play it a 2nd time, it put a smile on my face for 25 minutes, which is good enough for me.\n\n7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1513950452, "timestamp_updated": 1514592092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38501159": {"recommendationid": "38501159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002374945", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512096109}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantasticly funny and unbeatable at the price of $0", "timestamp_created": 1513885078, "timestamp_updated": 1513885078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38477181": {"recommendationid": "38477181", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964361996", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509824543}, "language": "english", "review": "Many a true nerd played this, so i played it", "timestamp_created": 1513834278, "timestamp_updated": 1513834278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38457729": {"recommendationid": "38457729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030285795", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514229985}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing, funny and short and free.

Whether you like the humor or not, it is still an excellent and mildly creative look into how room scale can be used.\n\nCons: If you don't like what you see in the 2 - 3 minutes of the first scene, it's not going to get any better further in. You have 7 total scenes for maybe 15-30 minutes of gameplay (or as little as 5 if you really rush through everything) So it's up to you to decide if it's worth continuing to wade through more of the same.\n\nBug Warning: I haven't experienced this myself, but I have a 2mx2m play area, with the ability to extend outside by a bit on most sides.

They either messed up hard, or the creators cant make anything other than character driven jokes.\nI understand that they need to drag out jokes for people that stick around, but portal does it 100x's better.

Its very clear they ad-libbed one take for most of these scenes. It desperatly wants you to continue the game, while also trying to entertain you with bottom of the barrel humor. If you spend roughly 2 minutes in each section, youd have the best experience. The problem is the game is less than 10 minutes long, and a torturing 1 hour long if you are crazy enough to withstand the constant gibberish.\n\nJust look up a video.

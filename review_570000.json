Compared to other potent stimulants, Old Friend causes greater serotonin release and somewhat lesser dopamine release. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in the regulation of mood, sleep, pain, appetite, and other behaviors. The excess release of serotonin by Old Friend likely causes the mood elevating effects experienced by Old Friend players. However, by releasing large amounts of serotonin, Old Friend causes the brain to become significantly depleted of this important neurotransmitter, contributing to the negative behavioral aftereffects that players often experience for several days after watching Old Friend.", "timestamp_created": 1491100957, "timestamp_updated": 1491100957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462272", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30781422": {"recommendationid": "30781422", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999416724", "num_games_owned": 462, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490485284}, "language": "english", "review": "Everyone needs to play this, it's perfect!", "timestamp_created": 1490652769, "timestamp_updated": 1490652769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505747", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30765175": {"recommendationid": "30765175", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983490423", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490585453}, "language": "english", "review": "Not worth it, unless you REALLY like dancing to mediocre music.

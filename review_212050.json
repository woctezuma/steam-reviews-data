Usually the only chore with this genre is that sometimes there is no rhyme or reason to the puzzles, and one ends up clicking and combining everything possible in order to proceed.\n\nThis game has a similar problem with a twist. Most of the time it is clear WHAT should be done, and the actions make sense as such, but the user interface is so horrid it regularly is nigh impossible to figure out HOW to do it. In general, the game's UI makes doing anything at all as hard as possible, and not in an entertaining manner.\n\nJust an example: there is a thing you need to read to gain crucial information, and it is made clear you can't take the thing with you. In most games, simply reading the thing would unlock dialogue options related to it. Not here; you have to figure out that you CAN drag-and-drop the thing into a special inventory (\"short term memory\"), where it becomes a conversation item, that can then be used in dialogues elsewhere. Anything can be dragged into this inventory, but only a few items can be stored there at one time; as it is often not clear which STM items are important and where they should be used, this quickly becomes very annoying. (To muddy the waters even further, there's also a third separate inventory, for \"long term memories\". They also need to be used like items.)\n\nThere are not enough saving graces either. Having several playable characters is an intriguing idea and one plot twist and a couple of puzzles utilize it nicely, but it also multiplies the irksomeness of the overly convoluted inventory system. (And that's a major issue, because most of the gameplay in this genre consists of inventory management.) The story is OK, but not very original. Graphics are very retro and get the job done, but are nothing to write home about. The characters are clich\u00e9d and lack depth. Dialogues are vapid. Atypically for a Wadjet Eye Games product, even voice acting and music are stale.

If that seems like a bold statement, let me explain why I believe that.\n\nOn first glance this game seems like a tribute to old school games of this genre, but its graphic style is maybe its only classical aspect. Rarely have I ever seen so many innovations and brilliant design decisions in a single game. After a short introduction you find yourself in control of 4 different characters, each with their own inventory and Short Term Memory. A third category, Long Term Memory, is mostly shared between all the characters. Considering that every single object or character in the world can be memorized for a later use, the game presents us with a number of options that far exceeds any adventure game I have ever played. \n\nSome people said it was complexity for complexity sake. I strongly disagree with that. By offering us that many choices, the game forces us to get rid of the old habit of rubbing each item against every other to find a solution ; in Resonance it would take a lifetime to test everything. As a direct result you have to pay attention to what's happening and figure out all the puzzles by thinking about them logically : you can't brute force your way through. \n\nThis makes the progression that much more involving and satisfying. Resonance is a game that trusts its players to be willing to pay attention to details and spend some time thinking before acting. Play this game carelessly and you will be frustated : is that a fault of the game though, or just your lack of focus ?\n\nThe overall story is fascinating but it's the narration and the way the puzzles are set up that truly elevate this game to a masterpiece. Being able to use information in addition to regular items is truly revolutionary and gives the developer a way to set up brilliant puzzles all through the game. Interactions with computers are simulated though a visual interface that reminded me of Vampire The Mascarade : Bloodlines and Uplink. By allowing you to type passwords, browse through files or type console commands, this system gets very involving and satisfying. I would love to go into details about some of the best parts of this game but I truly believe you should experience them for yourself. \n\nI could probably talk about this game for hours but it would be a shame to reveal too much about it. I cannot encourage you enough to play it if you like adventure games or are just interesting in game design. It's innovating, surprising, involving, emotional, satisfying, and just plain brilliant.

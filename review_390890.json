Despite no longer being blonde, Zelda has gotten significantly more stupid: the alternate dimension has stripped her of her Triforce of Wisdom, leaving her with only two apparent skills: getting kidnapped and catching arrows with her face.\n\nIn this timeline, the wizard Saruman has improved the Uruks originally created by Sauron: he made them green and also very good at shooting long bows. Also, he invented suicide bomber spiders or something; he can do that, he's a wizard, you know.\n\nAnyways, in this quest to rescue Princess Zelda twenty-five times, Legolas can rescue Zelda alone or with up to three other companions: Link, Hawkeye, or Red the Green Arrow on the same machine with local co-op. However, Legolas works alone, which is why I worked through the campaign by myself without any other person's help. And no other reason.\n\nBesides rescuing Princess Zelda, you can also play as Garrett that guy from Thief and be in a sneaky forest in a randomly generated time trials kind of game thing, or you can also play as some guy who fights orcs in a gladitorial arena. As with the campaign mode, these other modes can also be played with others in local co-op, although Garrett and this hypothetical gladiator also work alone in their lore, which is also why I opted to not receive assistance in these modes. And for no other reason.\n\nThere is also a deathmatch PvP mode, but, as I have mastered this game, I thought it would be unsporting to decimate the competition. Therefore, I have not played deathmatch for this reason. And for no other reason.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the most succinct way to describe this game is simply try playing Hotline Miami with a controller, but then also you have to use a bow instead of a machine gun or shotgun. Also, instead of having a 80s bee bop soundtrack like Hotline Miami, this game has a much more soothing soundtrack in campaign mode while you scream obscenities at your computer for being a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing piece of absolute\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665for not \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing reading your \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing inputs \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 this game cheats so much \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 everything broke\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665game 10/10 would put disk in blender if it was on a disk.\n\nAlso, the game is less than the price of a sandwich from Subway. I mean, I don't know what else you would do with $5 if you had it, but you certainly couldn't buy a footlong from Subway. That's how cheap this game is: it costs less than a sandwich.\n\nAlso, the system requirements are a bit high, and the 13 whole MB it takes up on my hard drive is a little bit excessive. Had to uninstall GTA V and overclock my i7 in order to support this massive game.\n\n10/10 would not recommend to people concurrently in anger management therapy.", "timestamp_created": 1512650957,

You'll need to dodge often to avoid their attacks, then quickly aim to kill them before they shoot again.

It's up to 4 player local co-op. I played with my 8 year old son and we had a great time beating all the campaign levels. It was a tough challenge when your enemies have perfect aim and you die with one hit. Thing is that your enemies do too and you can use them against each other when they step into the crossfire of other enemies. \n\nWe went through 25 levels in the campaign where you need to kill the enemies until you kill one who drops a key to unlock a prison where your \"princess\" is waiting to be rescued and taken to the exit. You have one basic enemy who will shoot arrows back at you and then you have a crap bomb that will chase you down and explode. On top of those you have land mines and exploding barrels. When enemies die you get money that you can use to unlock 4 different types of arrows. When you use a different arrow the enemy will use the same one so take that into account.\n\nThere are 3 other modes to play through that will add more replayability and challenge. There's Gladiator mode which is a survival style mode where you fight through waves of enemies and each wave it adds more enemies, Rogue mode is a timed mode where you need to get the key, kill all the enemies, save the princess and get to the exit in time. You can gain a little more time with the enemies you kill. Each level is randomly generated so it gives you a lot to play through. The last mode is Arena where you just fight your friends. We didn't try it since it was just the two of us but with 4 players I bet it could be a blast,\n\nAt $5 this game is well worth the money.

You play as an archer who is sent to enemy camp where hostage is held, to kill all hostiles and save the [strike]princess[/strike] captive.\n\nControls are made with focus on being precise, and the game reacts properly, without any delay. You can move, roll and shoot (to any selected direction). Controls reminds me of another indie game, Titan Souls (though there you could use only one arrow, Angry Arrows allows you to spam as many arrows as you want).\n\nDifficulty of the game is set pretty high and requires a patient player. If you can get angry and tilted pretty fast, this isn't a worthwhile pick for you. There aren't any checkpoints, each level (though they are not long) requires to be beaten without dying. There aren't any lives - one shot, one kill, and that applies to both player and the enemy NPCs.\n\nBut the NPCs aren't everything to make your playthrough harder, there are also mines, explosive barrels and, mainly, fast annoying spider mines.

But overall, this game has lots of potential. And, if the creator of this game got a small group of people with his smarts, he coult definetally make amazing games that could probably take over minecraft. If you took this kind of game and made it like survival (chopping down trees and hunting and such) I would pay at least 20 bux for it. But if you do that game, please make it free (I have limited money for games). Thank you developer for making this great game.\n\nPS: I was wondering what kind of software this game was made with.

AND GO!\n\n\nI can't believe only three people have reviewed this game, I absolutely love it. I never expected a game this simplistic could be so fun and so hard at the same time. The main objective of angry arrows is to kill the enemy who has the key, unlock the cage that has the hostage, and get out safely. Sounds pretty easy right? Absolutely not! One shot will kill you requiring you to think out strategies to take out enemies before they have the chance to hit you, you only have the ability to shoot and roll out of the way of arrows. It has so many good things going for it too. The campaign mode is difficult and requires you to think out strategies instead of charging into battle. The rogue mode randomly generates a level in the forest for you to complete based on a random set of numbers, or a seed. The gladiator mode has you set in an arena facing down increasingly difficult waves of enemies who come your way. The final mode is just a simple versus mode where you and at least one other person fight each other to the death. \n\nAll in all this game is amazing, and for the price it is at you shouldn't even hesitate to buy this game immediatly!", "timestamp_created": 1439614174, "timestamp_updated": 1439614174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526515", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17545056": {"recommendationid": "17545056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009204040", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 2220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475475837}, "language": "english", "review": "In Angry Arrows, you take upon the role of Legolas who has to battle hordes of Uruk-hai to rescue Princess Zelda from  the Legend of Zelda series in an alternate timeline in which she no longer wears a dress and has brown hair. Despite no longer being blonde, Zelda has gotten significantly more stupid: the alternate dimension has stripped her of her Triforce of Wisdom, leaving her with only two apparent skills: getting kidnapped and catching arrows with her face.\n\nIn this timeline, the wizard Saruman has improved the Uruks originally created by Sauron: he made them green and also very good at shooting long bows. Also, he invented suicide bomber spiders or something; he can do that, he's a wizard, you know.\n\nAnyways, in this quest to rescue Princess Zelda twenty-five times, Legolas can rescue Zelda alone or with up to three other companions: Link, Hawkeye, or Red the Green Arrow on the same machine with local co-op. However, Legolas works alone, which is why I worked through the campaign by myself without any other person's help. And no other reason.\n\nBesides rescuing Princess Zelda, you can also play as Garrett that guy from Thief and be in a sneaky forest in a randomly generated time trials kind of game thing, or you can also play as some guy who fights orcs in a gladitorial arena. As with the campaign mode, these other modes can also be played with others in local co-op, although Garrett and this hypothetical gladiator also work alone in their lore, which is also why I opted to not receive assistance in these modes. And for no other reason.\n\nThere is also a deathmatch PvP mode, but, as I have mastered this game, I thought it would be unsporting to decimate the competition. Therefore, I have not played deathmatch for this reason. And for no other reason.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the most succinct way to describe this game is simply try playing Hotline Miami with a controller, but then also you have to use a bow instead of a machine gun or shotgun. Also, instead of having a 80s bee bop soundtrack like Hotline Miami, this game has a much more soothing soundtrack in campaign mode while you scream obscenities at your computer for being a fucking piece of absolute shit for not fucking reading your fucking inputs fuck this game cheats so much fuck everything broke ass game 10/10 would put disk in blender if it was on a disk.\n\nAlso, the game is less than the price of a sandwich from Subway. I mean, I don't know what else you would do with $5 if you had it, but you certainly couldn't buy a footlong from Subway. That's how cheap this game is: it costs less than a sandwich.\n\nAlso, the system requirements are a bit high, and the 13 whole MB it takes up on my hard drive is a little bit excessive. Had to uninstall GTA V and overclock my i7 in order to support this massive game.\n\n10/10 would not recommend to people concurrently in anger management therapy.", "timestamp_created": 1439609736, "timestamp_updated": 1439609736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 98, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609762", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17544120": {"recommendationid": "17544120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142457336", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499135279}, "language": "english", "review": "Really nice simple game that i love.

And they almost never miss! The game gets really fun in co-op mode (local only!). If one of the players dies and the other one is still alive, you respawn after five seconds. So you can strategize, like spreading out or one player heads out and the other cowardly hides behind a wall. So in campaign mode you try to reach a hostage and bring him/her to the exit, while not being killed by mines, enemies and robots. Some more enemy types or traps would be cool, though we haven't finished the campaign yet, so maybe there's more than these three types.\nThere's also a couple of other modes, Gladiator mode (fighting wave after increasing wave of enemies) and Rogue mode, which introduces random seed forests in which you only have a limited time to free a hostage. I did not think these two modes added a whole lot to the game.\nVersus mode, however, was great, you can choose between four different types and it adds a lot of replayability.\nWe played this with two xbox360 controllers and after a bit of practice, the aiming feels precise and fast, so no complains about the controls.\nAll in all, great co-op game for a low price, recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1439491947, "timestamp_updated": 1439491947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17522370": {"recommendationid": "17522370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072787070", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497996095}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game, a little hard but a lot of fun", "timestamp_created": 1439484060, "timestamp_updated": 1439484060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523540", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 119, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 125}}

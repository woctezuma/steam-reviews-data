I wouldn't mind throwing that guy/gal a few dollars their way for it.\n\nWant to make it easy and blaze through everything? You can do that. Want to make it as bullet-hell-ey as possible? You can do that. How about a tense, tactical experience where you die in one hit but enemies are few, but dangerous? You can do that!\n\nMy only two gripes are that the weapon selection is fine but I do wish they had a bit more fun with the selectable weapons and while I like the upgrade mechanic in theory, I kind of wish you can do that in-between sessions as an option.\n\nI reccomend using a controller and lowering your graphics if there is some slowdown.

It's nothing innovative. There's not wrinkle. But for what it is, it's very good.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nYou're either the kind of person who loves this type of game or you don't. If you hate shoot 'em ups, avoid. If you [i]want[/i] to like shoot 'em ups, but are looking for a suitable entry point, this is your game. Yes, it's a bullet hell and much of the skill comes from hitting and not getting hit. Unlike traditional shoot 'em ups, you don't have to start from the beginning when you lose. You don't even run out of continues. You keep going until you beat the level or decide you've had enough. \n\nOne benefit in this game is the local co-op multi-player. You can have up to four people playing with you at once. And it's a blast.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nThe graphics won't wow you, but they're pretty. The polygons remind me of the PS1/PS2 era of gaming. The look reminds me of anime, which shouldn't surprise you since you're playing a mech. While you won't mistake this as having a \"retro\" look, it is definitely nostalgic. \n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nThe music is a high point as it should be since at once point you're fighting a [spoiler]giant disco ball[/spoiler]. Regarding the sound effects, the best it can be described is as \"arcade-y\". It's fun!\n\n[h1]Hardware Optimization[/h1]\n\nI've tested this game on a variety of hardware: an i7 tower with a GTX 1050 Ti running Windows, a Thinkpad T440p running Ubuntu with integrated graphics, and an HP Stream 11 running Windows with integrated graphics. It runs with flying colours on all three. It runs well with low and hi resolution graphics. If you bought virtually any new computer within the past 5 years, you should be able to run this.\n\n[h1]Value[/h1]\n\nI bought this in a bundle, so I didn't pay anywhere near the full price. That said, the value largely wrests on who you are. If you're an old hand at shoot 'em ups, you could probably find cheaper games that scratch that itch. However, if you're looking for a good game to buy a child, or are just looking for short co-op action with a friend, then this is well worth the money.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nIt was a fun few hours that I spent with this game. The graphics and sound were nice. Though there's nothing innovative going on with this game, the formula works. Certainly some people might find this too easy, but then again, hard shoot 'em ups are plentiful.

Meu PC n\u00e3o \u00e9 dos melhores, mas a maioria dos jogos desse tipo eu consigo jogar na resolu\u00e7\u00e3o 1920x1080 com os gr\u00e1ficos na configura\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia. Esse jogo ficou lento mesmo com os gr\u00e1ficos na configura\u00e7\u00e3o mais baixa, por isso tive que baixar a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o pra 1366x768 e manter a qualidade baixa pra conseguir jogar direitinho.\nMas valeu muito a pena! Junto com o Sky Force, s\u00e3o os melhores jogos nesse estilo que encontrei aqui no Steam.\n\u00c9 poss\u00edvel jogar em at\u00e9 4 jogadores na mesma tela (eu joguei com mais duas pessoas). S\u00e3o 5 rob\u00f4s pra escolha, cada um com caracter\u00edsticas pr\u00f3prias e um especial pr\u00f3prio (bot\u00e3o B) focado nessas caracter\u00edsticas.\nPossui v\u00e1rias armas prim\u00e1rias e secund\u00e1rias pra escolha livre e que podem ser trocadas ao final de cada fase.\nTem um vasto sistema de aprimoramento que pode ser equilibrado ou focado em determinadas caracter\u00edsticas (resist\u00eancia, dano, cura, etc).\nA dificuldade de jogo \u00e9 totalmente customiz\u00e1vel, podendo ser configurada para bem f\u00e1cil, pra quem quiser s\u00f3 se divertir e finalizar o jogo em poucas horas ou pra uma dificuldade insana, pra quem curte desafios e gosta de odiar os jogos morrendo v\u00e1rias vezes.\n\u00c9 muito legal jogar com mais gente, mas sozinho tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito divertido.\nO controle do Xbox 360 funcionou perfeitamente pra esse jogo, sendo que n\u00e3o sei como \u00e9 a jogabilidade com o teclado ou com outros gamepads.\nA primeira fase do jogo no modo campanha s\u00f3 tem rochas pra destruir, isso \u00e9 para os jogadores testarem as armas e se acostumarem com os bot\u00f5es.\nEm tr\u00eas jogadores, n\u00f3s finalizamos a campanha em aproximadamente 3 horas na dificuldade normal. O jogo tem um sistema de ressuscitamento pra quando um jogador morre e os outros continuam vivos, \u00e9 s\u00f3 chegar perto do que morreu e ficar apertando Y repetidamente at\u00e9 a barra vermelha sumir, quanto mais gente ajudar, mais r\u00e1pido ele ressuscita (e ainda tem um aprimoramento pra ressuscitar jogadores mais rapidamente) por isso quanto mais gente jogar, mais f\u00e1cil e r\u00e1pido fica de zerar o jogo.\nDepois de terminado o modo campanha existem outros modos de jogo (incluindo um \"modo infinito\") e uma quantidade grande de conquistas, algumas bem dif\u00edceis. O slot de salvamento fica aberto para jogar quantas campanhas quiser e a dificuldade do jogo pode ser alterada a qualquer momento. Os aprimoramentos ser\u00e3o mantidos quando a campanha for reiniciada no mesmo slot.\nNenhum de n\u00f3s sabia ingl\u00eas direito, por isso nem acompanhamos a hist\u00f3ria e passamos o texto bem r\u00e1pido, sem ler.

There is also the gauntlet mode which is very similar to endless, but I have yet to reach the end of a gauntlet, at this point in time, to know if it is endless or not. \n\nYou get to play 5 different mechs that each have their own unique capabilities and suitabilities to how you play. A decent variety of weapon for you to choose from and each having their own pros and cons. Having tried all the mechs and different variations of each weapon, I definitely know I prefer a certain combination of weapons compared to others. The base stats are all the same for each mech and all the upgrades will apply to the mech you select before the start of the campaign. Some of the upgrades are interesting and quite helpful depending on if you are playing solo or co-op. Because it's a couch co-op game, it'll most likely be a solo campaign for me most of the time so a few upgrades are not as high priority for me than others. \n\nThe game's music is very nice and I think carries the right beats and mood for each stage in the campaign. While there is a very minimal story plot in this game, it was amusing to progress through the game with it, but definitely not story-rich. The context did make me a laugh a bit, but that's about it. (It's a shoot-em-up game, take it for what it is!)\n\nI think the custom difficulty adds a nice touch to the game. Haven't tried it yet, but being able to customize the game's difficulty would make the game appeal more to a much wider variety of gamers - aside from the preset difficulties in the game.\n\nOverall, I did finish the game once on sunday stroll mode just to learn the game and practice how I want to play before the harder modes. Definitely will go back and forth playing this game between others to complete all the upgrades and maybe unlock all the achievements. 8.5/10!", "timestamp_created": 1490574388, "timestamp_updated": 1490574536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30740233": {"recommendationid": "30740233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051322981", "num_games_owned": 2584, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491296924}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u522b\u770b\u9759\u6001\u622a\u56fe\u753b\u9762\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u91cc\u9762\u6d89\u53ca\u633a\u7c97\u7cd9\u7684\uff0c\u96c6\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u7cbe\u81f4\uff0c\u654c\u4eba\u4e5f\u5f88\u7cd9\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bdd2D\u5934\u50cf\u4e5f\u662f\u53ea\u6709\u65e5\u5f0f\u7684\u5f62\u800c\u65e0\u795e\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u65b0\u624b\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6846\uff0c\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u4e0d\u8981\u8ffd\u6c42\u592a\u591a\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u7136\u800c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3eSTG\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u6a2a\u7248\u7684\uff0c\u4e00\u822c\u6765\u8bf4\u4f1a\u4e0d\u597d\u505a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u51fa\u4e4e\u610f\u6599\u7684\u62e5\u6709\u6781\u5176\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u624b\u611f\uff01\u654c\u4eba\u5957\u8def\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8eb2\u907f\u8d77\u6765\u6781\u5176\u5e26\u611f\uff01\u800c\u4e14\u5e76\u975e\u65e5\u5f0f\u7684\u4e00\u53d1\u6b7b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b21\u6709\u4e86\u62a4\u76fe\u6709\u4e86\u8840\u6761\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u653e\u677e\u7684\u6c89\u6d78\u5728\u8eb2\u907f\u7684\u5feb\u611f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8212\u670d\u6781\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8bf4\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u8fd9\u611f\u89c9\u7684\u628a\u63e1\u975e\u5e38\u5230\u4f4d\uff0c\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u5728\u5f39\u5e55\u4e4b\u95f4\u7a7f\u68ad\u7684\u4e50\u8da3\u5728\u6a2a\u7248STG\u4e2d\u7b80\u76f4\u5c31\u662f\u9876\u5c16\u7684\uff01\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u9996\u9886\u8702\u90a3\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u592a\u7a7a\u6218\u6597\u673aG\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\u5982\u679c\u559c\u6b22\u9996\u9886\u8702/\u4e1c\u65b9\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u4e5f\u5e94\u8be5\u8bd5\u8bd5\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1490491555, "timestamp_updated": 1490491555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30734334": {"recommendationid": "30734334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274837402", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494265232}, "language": "english", "review": "I am enjoying this game.

The soundtrack is great, the choice for weapons is nice, enemy variety is nice, but it really shows that this is their first game  Level progression is different backgrounds with enemies flying towards you in waves.  There's even an endless wave mode you can play, which is nice to have.  Bosses are okay.  They aren't amazing, but they aren't bad.  Overall, for their first shmup, it's passable.  I feel I got my money's worth, though I also somewhat feel the soundtrack is as valuable as the game.  The amount of options with regards to customizing the game is also nice, but I feel in the end it may have hurt them as I would rather have a very polished single form game than an unpolished \"you can do anything\" game.  The story is stupid, but I enjoyed it because it was self aware.  However, nowadays, the \"I hold up my spork\" kind of random stories are a dime a dozen.\n\nThat said, I feel there is a lack of polish on some things, which I imagine occurred due to this game being an amalgamation of ideas and the little bumps haven't been ironed out.  The many pieces of the game don't really fit together.  They're just...there.  Like the different mech's special attacks.  Largely unneeded as it's better to prioritize shooting your main weapon.  The game needs focus.\n\nThis game is not a slow moving bullet hell like touhou (which I am glad for, as I do not enjoy that game), it's not a score/coin reward game like giga wing, and it's also not a strong level progression game like r-type or jamestown (though jamestown is a mix of story and coins, which was very highly polished).\n\nI think that its main problem.  It's not quite sure what it wants to be.  Numbers pop up like crazy, so is it a reward kinda game?  There's no coins, so my brain's reward center isn't happy.  Level progression is lame and consists of different enemies on a slow moving background.  There's no level elements like barriers or a finely detailed background that goes along with the enemies.  At times it is a fast moving bullet hell game, which is great as the recharging shield mechanic makes the game frantic, but it's missing that polish to tie it all together.\n\nThe stupid story is kind of the epitome of this game - forgetable.

Mieux encore, m\u00eame en solo, je me suis r\u00e9gal\u00e9 ! Puis, le 9 septembre est arriv\u00e9 la version Stellar Climax. J\u2019ai test\u00e9 cette nouvelle version environ 6h30 et au final, je suis plut\u00f4t d\u00e9\u00e7u. La pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente mouture \u00e9tait meilleure tant en terme de visibilit\u00e9 que de sensation de puissance dans le mode campagne. [u]Toutefois, le jeu reste tr\u00e8s fun et je le recommande toujours aussi chaudement, tant pour jouer en solo qu\u2019en coop local ![/u] Je vais commencer mon \u00e9valuation par le n\u00e9gatif et ferai souvent r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne version.\n\n[u]Le n\u00e9gatif :[/u]\n-[u]Pas de tutoriel:[/u] Emb\u00eatant car le layout n\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que quand on met la pause, si on ne sait pas \u00e7a, on cherche les boutons tout seul et \u00e7a finit par le faire mais quand m\u00eame, j\u2019aurais bien aim\u00e9 un petit tuto.\n-[u]Quelques probl\u00e8mes de visibilit\u00e9:[/u] Les d\u00e9cors sont certes plus beaux mais masquent parfois certains ennemis \u00e0 l\u2019apparence terne en comparaison et m\u00eame certains projectiles sont moins faciles \u00e0 rep\u00e9rer !\n-[u]L\u2019al\u00e9atoire du magasin d\u2019aptitudes:[/u] Certes il peut \u00eatre reset autant de fois qu\u2019on le d\u00e9sire (pour quelques points \u00e0 chaque fois) mais m\u00eame ainsi il tarde parfois \u00e0 donner les aptitudes passives que l\u2019on d\u00e9sire pour faire son build.\n-[u]Une sensation de puissance diminu\u00e9e en mode campagne: [/u] Le magasin de fin de mission ne propose plus les m\u00eames am\u00e9liorations passives et \u00e9videmment les plus abusives n\u2019y sont plus ([u]adieu la sensation de cracher du feu comme un dragon, soit avec power-up, un jet de flamme x6 qui remplit une partie de l\u2019\u00e9cran[/u]). Avant si on voulait faire sans ces am\u00e9liorations passives abusives, il suffisait d\u2019aller en Gauntlet ou simplement de faire la campagne sans les prendre. Au final, avec cette nouvelle version, je m\u2019attendais \u00e0 de nouvelles aptitudes passives, des trucs funs pour faire un run p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la Biding of Isaac, comme avant mais en mieux, bah non et c\u2019est bien dommage.\n-[u]Trop de power-up tue le power-up:[/u] Ils sont plus nombreux qu\u2019avant mais c\u2019est un souci car on drope plus rarement ceux que l\u2019on souhaite comme le triple tir qui permet presque de remplir l\u2019\u00e9cran mais pas longtemps. Le pire c\u2019est que selon les passages on peut avoir beaucoup de power-up comme quasi aucun d\u2019un gros moment, c\u2019est trop d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibr\u00e9 \u00e0 ce niveau.\n\n[u]Le positif:[/u]\n+[u]Du coop local jusqu\u2019\u00e0 4:[/u] On peut faire un mix entre manettes et clavier/souris (on peut aussi jouer uniquement avec la souris, il y a une option pour \u00e7a, par contre, \u00e7a met le robot en auto-fire). Toutefois, on ne peut pas reconfigurer les touches que ce soit manettes ou clavier/souris. Et comme dans certains jeux, la difficult\u00e9 augmente avec le nombre de joueur.\n+[u]5 robots jouables et plusieurs armes:[/u] Chacun poss\u00e8de deux aptitudes uniques (une sp\u00e9ciale, lan\u00e7able souvent et une ultime, lan\u00e7able plus rarement car tr\u00e8s puissante) ainsi qu\u2019une arme principale et une arme secondaire \u00e0 choisir (parmi 7 dans les deux cas) \u00e0 chaque d\u00e9but de mission.\n+[u]Une bonne palette de coups:[/u] Le tir de l\u2019arme principal, celui de l\u2019arme secondaire (les deux peuvent \u00eatre activ\u00e9s en m\u00eame temps), une attaque au C\u00e0C (on ne peut pas tirer en m\u00eame temps), l\u2019aptitude sp\u00e9ciale et l\u2019aptitude ultime.\n+[u]Auto-fire activable et d\u00e9sactivable:[/u] Une touche pour chaque arme.\n+[u]3 modes de jeu:[/u] Un mode Campagne (le mode histoire en gros), un mode Gauntlet (le but est de survivre \u00e0 des vagues d\u2019ennemis dont la puissance augmente avec le temps, c\u2019est un mode sans fin) et un mode Challenge (qui contient notamment un challenge boss rush). Tous sont jouables en coop local jusqu\u2019\u00e0 4.\n+[u]Une difficult\u00e9 ajustable par le joueur:[/u] On peut customiser la partie que l\u2019on va faire (possible en mode Campagne et Gauntlet uniquement). Ainsi, on peut devenir tr\u00e8s fort ou tr\u00e8s faible ou alors rendre les ennemis tr\u00e8s forts ou tr\u00e8s faibles ou faire un mix de tout \u00e7a, il y a vraiment beaucoup d\u2019options, c\u2019est une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ajustement que je trouve tr\u00e8s sympathique !\n+[u]Une personnalisation de son robot durant le mode campagne et \u00e0 plusieurs chacun am\u00e9liore son robot comme il l\u2019entend:[/u] On peut am\u00e9liorer ses caract\u00e9ristiques de base (d\u00e9g\u00e2ts, r\u00e9sistances aux d\u00e9g\u00e2ts etc.) et il y a des aptitudes passives \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer (avant elles pouvaient changer la fa\u00e7on de jouer, maintenant, beaucoup moins, il reste quand m\u00eame quelques sp\u00e9cialisations possibles mais c\u2019est plus l\u00e9ger).\n+[u]Un mode new game+ pour la campagne:[/u] Ce mode permet de conserver ses caract\u00e9ristiques et ses am\u00e9liorations passives. C\u2019est une super id\u00e9e mais je doute qu\u2019on finisse par se sentir surpuissant comme avant et pour moi, c\u2019est un point n\u00e9gatif, je n\u2019ai pas envie de faire et refaire la campagne sans belle carotte \u00e0 la clef (on peut acheter am\u00e9lioration une fois qu\u2019on a toutes les caract\u00e9ristiques \u00e0 fond, la Stardust Emblem mais je ne suis gu\u00e8re tent\u00e9).\n+[u]Une autre sensation de puissance: [/u] Pour revenir sur les power-up, dans les nouveaux, il y a les drones, on ne peut en avoir qu\u2019un \u00e0 la fois, le drone se fixe \u00e0 notre robot durant un certain temps et en plus on peut avoir un autre power-up en m\u00eame temps, ce qui donne une nouvelle sensation de puissance, c\u2019est pas mal mais \u00e7a ne vaut pas l\u2019ancienne sensation, notamment parce qu\u2019il arrive qu\u2019on n\u2019ait aucun power-up d\u2019un gros moment. Par contre, \u00e7a am\u00e9liore le Gauntlet !\n+[u]Tout n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 alt\u00e9r\u00e9 en mal:[/u] En effet, \u00e0 part pour les soucis de visibilit\u00e9, le Gauntlet et le mode Challenge n\u2019ont que peu chang\u00e9 puisqu\u2019on n\u2019avait pas acc\u00e8s au magasin de fin de mission et qu\u2019ils b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient des drones et cie. Il y a le nouveau robot et d\u2019autres changements plut\u00f4t int\u00e9ressants. En plus, il y a eu diverses corrections de bugs etc. donc du bon quand m\u00eame.\n+[u]Certains boss ont chang\u00e9:[/u] En effet, certains ont des comportements diff\u00e9rents dont un qui m\u2019a clairement surpris dans mon essai du Gauntlet sur cette version, il m\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs tu\u00e9\u2026 \u00e7a, par contre, j\u2019ai ador\u00e9, c\u2019\u00e9tait une surprise int\u00e9ressante !\n+[u]Des nouveaux checkpoints:[/u] Il y a des checkpoints avant chaque boss, avant, il fallait se refaire le stage du boss et heureusement car avec la difficult\u00e9 accrue par les diff\u00e9rents changements \u00e9nonc\u00e9s plus haut \u00e7a aurait pu \u00eatre un truc de dingue. Par exemple, en Iron Man avec Black Bear, j\u2019ai eu beaucoup de mal sur certains boss et refaire \u00e0 chaque fois les stages avec le risque d\u2019arriver amoch\u00e9, non merci, j\u2019aime bien avoir du challenge dans un jeu mais \u00e0 ce stade \u00e7a n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pour moi.\n+[u]Diversit\u00e9 et rejouabilit\u00e9:[/u] Au final, tout \u00e7a apporte une bonne diversit\u00e9 et une bonne rejouabilit\u00e9 au titre pour peu que l\u2019on aime ce qu\u2019il propose.\n+[u]Dur\u00e9e de vie de la campagne:[/u] Au final, les changements apport\u00e9s au magasin du mode campagne rendent celle-ci clairement plus difficile et donc plus longue.\nLa campagne contient 9 missions d\u00e9coup\u00e9es en 3 stages chacune et un boss final r\u00e9parti sur 3 stages. Avant il fallait compter ~2 heures en normal pour finir la campagne une premi\u00e8re fois, maintenant, je ne sais pas trop, ~2 heures m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour finir la campagne en normal avec le nouveau robot.\n+[u]Musiques et bruitages:[/u] Les musiques sont bien agr\u00e9ables, p\u00eachues et s\u2019int\u00e8grent bien au jeu.

There is variation in guns; there are for example chaingun, plasma shotgun and my favourite, flamethrower! There are 4 mechs, each with their own special abilities. My favourite is Black Bear, she has a shield which brings great joy if you manage to use it right and bounce enemy fire right back at them. Also, the mechs have badass swords. I can't but wonder, why this game isn't more popular, it really is really good. The story mode even has great humour, made a big smile on my face many times. After you beat story, there are Gauntlet mode and many Challenges to extend the lifespan of this game.\n\nHaven't had chance to try the co-op, I expect it to be awesome, since the game is awesome even playing by yourself!\n\nI really can't think of any negative sides about this game. This really isn't anything ground breaking (how many shmups are, on the other hand?), as you probably wouldn't expect, but a very neat (and most of all FUN) mecha shmup! Well worth the price.

Its a great horizontal arcade 2D shooter in its own right, but the RPG elements make it unique. Has a very PS3 look and feel to it.

Very much in the vain of SkyForce Anniversary, the RPG elements really bring a lot of replayability to the floor. With so many 'ports' coming to STEAM, its a breath of fresh air to see a title like this one. I really don't mind pixel graphics, but so many bad ports in general. I honestly have no idea if this game is a port or an original, but I can assure you, its done right! I love a good arcade shooter, Raiden III/IV, Crimson Cover, Mushihimesama etc, but after a few continues and 15-20 minutes I'm watching the end credits.

Also frequent upgrades (usually 2) in the middle of levels that allow you to build towards your defined style (such as being a sniper and picking up crit upgrades) as well as a shop at the end of each level that allows for spending points towards more upgrades.\n* Tons of game customization (enemy durability, player shot speed, hibox radiuses, spawn rate, fire rate... just about all low level manipulation you can think of). Lots of presets available, so you can easily switch between 5 difficulties' worth of settings, as well as extra presets like \"Iron Man\" where you have 0% shield multiplier.\n* Lots of environments - from frozen skies to exploding suns, underwater wrecks to alien hives, gas giants to robot factories, there's 10 locations in all with quite a bit of variety.\n* Can jump right in with the gauntlet mode - basically a never-ending mode (well, until you die) where you go for the high score.\n\nCons:\n* Story dialogue / plot is seemingly intentionally bad, but just ends up being unfunny and adding very little. Anime avatars for the characters seem a bit out of place. Wish I could turn it off entirely.\n* Would really benefit from having online multiplayer (as well as would probably sell a ton more copies.

Want to call this a con, but can be a pro if you have trouble spending lots of time with friends after school/work since this game only has local co-op - it does mean you can beat this game in one sitting though, from start to finish.\n* Music is ok (opinion), although if I bought the soundtrack it'd probably only be for a few tracks (namely the last boss ones, because that fight had multiple phases and is pretty exciting)\n\nUpdate Feb 2016 - it does look like they are listening to users, and they added a bunch of new upgrades, a new level, steam achievements and a bunch of other little features while I wasn't looking.

Unlike a bunch of western-made mecha games, this one is less \"lol, mecha cliches\" and more just nonsense, which I found more entertaining and less rehashed. I mean, it's a game in which the final boss's first form is a giant disco ball.\n\nUnfortunately, though, it's also a game with a major problem - it took me about 90 minutes to complete the campaign on the default difficulty settings, during which I only died once, and rarely came close to death on any other occasion. Unless you mess with the settings to make things very difficult on yourself, it's just ... not a difficult game, between your small hitbox, taking several hits on your armor to kill (and being able to repair that damage), having regenerating shields on top of that, and frequently being able to destroy enemies before they can pose a real threat to you, as well.\n\nThis also causes the customization system to feel kind of futile, since I never really saw any reason to play as anything but the first combination I found that I liked - the Blue Falcon with the Taranis LB-02 plasma shotgun and Mjolnir UG-08 particle beam, which I settled on pretty quickly after realizing that I didn't like the Vajra 75-ZS pulse rifle. As in, I basically completed the entire game with the second weapon set I tried, without the game ever making me think a different setup might be useful for certain stages.\n\nAs a result, I'm not entirely sure I can recommend it for its current price of $10. (Well, $9 as of this writing, due to the launch discount.)

It's not a game that takes it self too seriously, as you fight everything from a giant talking asteroid to a giant disco ball. What stands out here is the customization and options that are available. Your weapon load outs will play to specific play styles that will do well in parts of levels but not in others, and it helps that the local co-op can play to the game's strengths in question. The customization of fire rates, enemy durability and power ups help to create an experience that can work for any player in the end, giving challenge for those SHMUP pros while scaling back the experience for those who need a little help. Also: props to the fantastic soundtrack here: it's the highlight of the game and frankly makes me recommend the soundtrack as a purchase in of itself, even if you don't like SHMUPs. Does the game's combat over time drag a tiny bit? Yes it does, but in the end, for a 10 dollar title, you can't get much better then the bang for buck that this game provides. \n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_rkwYRPnZg[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Customization options for gameplay is one of the strongest in the genre this year, or of many SHMUP like games I've played. Customization of fire rates, enemy durability, and what power ups do makes a game that can tailor itself to you specifically, if you put the time into it. While it can screw with the balance, the default selections do a good job to balance, and it's your decision in the end. \n[*] Fantastic Soundtrack. Well worth a look by itself. \n[*] Weapon and Mech selections make a huge difference, as you can really change up your playstyle based on what your selection is. Coop choices makes a difference. \n[*] Some backgrounds are fantastic (the water level in particular). The graphics options are great for a game of this cost, and while it doesn't take every opportunity for the visual style to come through, it's pretty fantastic. \n[*] The controls are solid.\n[*] The 4th wall breaking humor does the job. It's a cheesy storyline, but hey, did you expect otherwise?\n\n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The Gauntlet mode could use a little bit more punch in the end. It feels very similar after a couple of plays. Over time, the game does have slight trouble in variety. \n[*] Boss patterns needs a little bit more as they repeat too often. \n[*] It's hard to see the detail on the Mechs that they put on them\n[*] Like other games in the genre, sometimes there's too much on the screen, and the explosions and bullets can get lost in the visuals. \n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1447179831, "timestamp_updated": 1447179831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 112, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 118}}

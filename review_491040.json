Your character is limited to horizontal movement along the bottom of the screen while enemies pour in above and rain down attacks aimed in your direction. To aid in your survival are two things - a dodge roll that makes you invulnerable while doing it and various pieces of cover you can duck behind. That cover will eventually be destroyed by enemy gunfire though which encourages players to constantly move around and find opportunities to fire back.\n\nThe default weapon you begin every stage with is the infinite use handgun, but shooting the yellow droid dishes out ammo for the bigger guns. Whether it's the spread gun for spewing out multiple bullets at once or the rocket launcher designed for high impact damage there's plenty to play around with and easily switchable at the tap of a button. Knowing when to start using up your ammo reserves is key to getting through the stages, especially when the harder enemies start swarming in.\n\nBot Vice serves up fast short bursts of entertainment with its 50 levels. Each level can be completed in a couple of minutes when played well but replayability is boosted by aiming to finish missions with full health and/or higher letter ranks for time taken. That and it's just kinda fun to drop into a level and blast all the enemies to pieces. The game also offers a sizeable challenge with various difficulty settings. The campaign also puts you on an overall timer on anything higher than easy for that extra push. This is an area the game does stumble on a bit though, as even on the easy setting some missions can be rather brutal. The boss of the final campaign mission especially feels cheap, almost turning the experience into a bullet hell scenario. Fortunately this is not frequent enough to spoil an otherwise fun game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514762891, "timestamp_updated": 1514762891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38897694": {"recommendationid": "38897694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066989236", "num_games_owned": 534, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 167, "last_played": 1514719098}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me he divertido mucho con este arcado con sabor a\u00f1ejo.

But, in turn, the stages are short and almost no time is wasted upon death. You get right back into the stage and go again. It aims for the more arcade approach of death being plentiful, but minimal in its punishment. The controls are very responsive and there is always a solution to just about any situation. If you have reflexes, you can do it.\n\nThe presentation is fantastic. Extremely colorful stages with varied enemies to occupy them. Animations are well done and expressive. On top of all that, the soundtrack is just as great. An 80s synth and chiptune inspired soundtrack keeps the energy up throughout the whole game.\n\nOnly minor complaints that mostly come down to taste:\n-The screen shaking can get very out of hand. With so much going on in the screen, the shaking makes it very difficult to keep track. Fortunately, there are options to tone it down.\n-Controls take some getting used to. They're defaulted with movement being on the control stick, but I found the movement works much better on d-pad. Once again, you can edit this in the options.\n-Erin's voice is pretty low energy during cutscenes.

Enemies can rush you for free because your saber is not a threat.\n2)Too many guns to switch through for how fast paced and frantic this game wants to be. Especially combined with how much ammo is wasted by the inaccurate \"aim\" button.\n3)The aim button doesn't serve its function well when enemies are constantly moving. It also doesn't target based on distance to the player, but rather on what enemy is closest to the barrier (I THINK, it feels a too inconsistant to analyze).\n4)Not enough wind up from enemies. Especially for the early areas. Enemies do not telegraph their attacks enough for the amount of enemies you are expected to keep track of. And enemies who come in attacking right away, such as the jetpack bots, do not give you enough time to realize that they have entered.\n5)Bosses bringing minions with them RARELY feels good in ANY game, and this is NOT one of those rare times. It feels especially bad since \"aim\" never seems to focus on who you'd like it to, and it is a sorely needed tool for bosses that rush right at you and can attack through cover.\n6)The cover doesn't feel good enough because enemies are constantly attacking you without telegraph and eventually through the cover.\n\nI'll keep trying to power through it because it's such a neat game idea with designs I'm a fan of, especially the soundtrack, but it's hard to reccomend it without some balance changes.

At first it appears very difficult, but after you master the controls in ~2-3h, it gets a lot easier. It's actually very short game - 50 stages, but at the same time it's pretty cheap, so in my opinion it's worth it's price even without discount.\n\nSo, pros:\n1) Difficulty is alright, you have to dodge and hide plenty, altho i'd wish for something more challenging like \"only HandGun mode\".\n2) Enemies are diverse, and what's more important, are satisfying to kill. Bosses included ofc.\n3) Art is very nice, 16-bit atmoshpere is there for sure.\n4) Price is exactly right, not like with many other indie games, which either sell crap for such price, or selling same quality as this game for 3-5x the price.\n\nSounds and music are good, voices and story are there for the check. It doesn't matter, really, game is not about the story, it's about gameplay.\nAlso, don't believe that \"controller is strongly recommended\" sign, I presonally play all games with k/b - and it's totally fine.\n\nAnd the only con that I can think about - game it too short. 50 stages, half of which you don't even have to complete good, just finish them and you're done. \n\nSo in the end, game is good, especialyl for it's price, altho it could be made a lot more harder and challenging.

It was hard to keep the momentum going, because there was so little story. But, we only had a couple games, so onward we pressed in some vain effort trying to complete one more level. The alternative was network television, and that seriously sucked.\nBot Vice is quite a step up from those types of shooters (I am sure they have a name), with buttons to keep aimed while running, for example, but this is still a retro experience, nonetheless. It is quality work, with snazzy music, fun animations, and smooth gameplay. Works perfect on Ubuntu Linux.\nIf this is your thing, then here you go.

I stumbled upon this game while looking through steam and it was on sale too.  This game grab my attention right away, because it gave that nostlagia of mega man x art style with the bullet storm and pixel arcade gameplay.  Which brought back those fond memorys of my youth, when i played those type of games.\n\nReview starting.\n\nBot Vice is a very fun game, it got the bullet storm feel gameplay which fair waring.  with the art style pixel like mega man x games and with the feel of the arcade gameplay in the mix.  Which the devs made amazing work to this game, it just makes me want to go to a store and play a arcade cabinet.  That how much nostlagia feeling i had when i played this game and it worth every dollar for the price.\n\nPros & Cons.\n\nPros+\n\n+Interesting Story: The Story was good, with the added cutscene made it felt you aren't just playing a arcade bullet storm game.\n\n+Gameplay: Gameplay is fun, but challenging as well.  With the mix of adventure style that you can choose the next stage level if you want to continue playing.  Bullet storm, seeing all those bullets coming like a rain shower.  Able to take cover, dodge bullets and beat up bots which one bot appears often to help you.  It gives a heart and many gun weapon choices.  Best one is that split shot, freaking helpful.  \n\nThere is also a extra mission mode, i am at this moment still playing those modes to get it all done.  But i did beat the story, only strange thing is i don't know why erin is in different hair color? guessing they forgot.\n\n+Soundtrack: Music is nice, give that action arcade feel to the game.\n\n+Sound Effects: They done good work on the sound effects, it brought that arcade feel to the game.\n\n+Voice Acting:  The Voicing for the characters are done good, but yet in a way it kind of felt that maybe some of the other characters weren't heard well.  Some of the enemy bots, will say stuff but with so much explosion barrels.  It not easy to hear them, that not a negitive to down vote the game.  More of them needing to adjust the sound effects in future games.  As for the actor and actress, Erin voice actress did a good job to her voice.  The same for the actor for the enemy bots and the villain bosses.\n\n+Art Style:  The Art has always look and felt as a mega man x game.  With the retro style to the art from the days of consoles and arcades cabinet look.  It makes me just want to go and make a cabinet custom arcade for my own, just to play this game on there.\n\nCons-\n-Nothing to really complain at all.\n\nSo that is it for my review, i personally had a great time playing this game.  It was worth the price, even if i got it for sale it worth it.  Would I recommend this game to a friend, yes if they enjoy the arcade style gameplay.  If you feel that maybe you want to wait for a sale, then wait.  No harm or foul on that.  I bought it on sale but if it wasn't on sale i would have just bought it full price.  It only $1.99 not really going to break the bank.\n\nHope my review helps others out.

I've not been that frustrated in a very long time. But I completed it, 100%, and by the end, I think I had enough fun that I can't justify not recommending it. It's got so much going for it, but it's miserable sometimes. I constantly felt like I was fighting the mechanics. The dodge roll would go in the wrong direction fairly often. The aiming system was so unintuitive and wonky for me. I felt like you almost always needed it, but sometimes it just screws you over. Missions with challenges to not destroy things made the aiming a nightmare. I kept getting to bosses, wasting all my stuff on nothing, assuming I would still be locked on to them, and then dying. The cover system felt better as I played, but at first it felt like it would have been a lot better to just have cover that you walk behind, rather than having a separate input. This could all just be me, I don't know. The dodge roll going the wrong way certainly didn't feel like it though.\n\nThere were a bunch of other little things I kept getting mad about, but I couldn't stop. At one point I was basically just so mad that I felt I had to beat it just to show it who's boss, like I had reverted back to childhood or something, but regardless, I played it to completion. It was a dollar, it clearly has a lot of effort put into it, it's a good challenge, even if some of that challenge felt like the controls working against me. It's good.

It's like...discovering a new favorite shmup game (can I call this a shmup?)...except you went back to 1995 to look for one in an alternate reality where the SNES CD-ROM system released in North America.\n\nWhy mention the SNES CD-ROM and not just SNES.  Answer: Voice acting.  Superbly done, too.  It would still have been a great game using just the text, but the voice acting is the icing on the cake.  Also, nobody plays shmups for the story, but the developers threw a fitting one in anyway.  And that's a good thing.  Aside from the solid core gameplay (more on that later), there are so many little extras that make this game. \n\nThis core gameplay is balance between hiding, rolling, and shooting.  The gameplay is definitely fun, but you need a controller for it.  You definitely wouldn't want a keyboard on this one.  I'm using a logitech F310 and it works well for the gameplay.  \n\nI really enjoyed the overall game time limit mechanic too.  Take as long as you want on each level, but you will need to have a cumulative time of under 30 minutes for the game.  This forces you to go back to those first levels and improve on your time using what you learned.  \n\nand it's $0.99 on sale?\n\nWorth it.  In fact, worth it at full price ($1.99).\n\nThe replay value is high too.

Even at full price the game is packed with a whole set of much harder llevels outside of the (already quite lenghty) campaign to crown a great old school (for real) experience.\n\nThere are a few concessions like the lack of a real scoring system but you'll still be pursuing the A ranks and 4 hearts goals, as well as a lot of challenging feats in the shape of achievements.\n\nSpecial mention to the graphics and music, the former being almost a cal back to Sparkster/Rocket Knight Adventures but with a cool biomechanical style of its own, combined with awesome synths worthy of the early PSX Capcom and SEGA eras. By adding a more modern touch with the voice acting (which turns out to be fairly good actually, with each character having a distinct voice), the presentation is very sleek.\n\nVery recommended and if you see this on sale, don't hesitate to pick it up!

typically write reviews for games, but whenever I see game made by basically one person that is this fun, I gotta give em props. I am a sucker for old school games, But I hate people who think nostalgia alone is enough to act as a hook. That is not the case with Bot vice. The game does a good job of making fun of old school games and the corny stories that they follow, while also making the game adicting and fun! If you make a light parody/homage type game, this is the way to do it.\n\nNext off lets talk about the game play. This game does a great job of establishing all of the controls and power ups from the very beginning as well as the maneuvers. The controls are simple and tight and the game plays like a cross between Sin and Punishment, and  Wild Guns (not a bad combination at all!). My only real gripe is that I wish that there were more guns ! I don't need like 20+ but maybe 3-4 more would do it for me. \n\nMoving on I will cover  the games look and design. I love the variety of bot designs and bosses, They are nicely animated and have a vibrant appeal to them. The baddies also have an array of attack styles that make you have to adapt accordingly, usually by waiting for an opening (Snake bot I'm looking at you!) The satges also are beautifuly designed! each of the stages look unique and have interesting gimicks that can add to the mayhem, such as trains ramming through the stages, armored trucks launching bombs every where.or even Robot trash bugs chasing  you out of trash cans! \n\nMy final talking point is music. I love video game music and music and general so For me a games soundtrack appeal is crucial to my desire to want to play a game. I believe that A games soundtrack should enhchance and support the overall game. This game nails it! I love the Megaman and TMNT esque soundtrack that this game delivers! the 80's and 90's synth fit the homage style and each stage has it;s own theme! No reused songs except for the bosses at the end of the main levels, but each boss specific stage has their own high octane but kickin background theme! I only wish that the Music was dlc :D\n\nMy only real gripes are that I wish there was more guns , that there were a co op, and that the game innovated a little buit more in establishing its own Identity. but judging by the ending, I am sure we will see more from the creators one day! and I look forward to it! Get this game if you like frantic high octane shootouts and a cast of corny quote spewing enemies with laughable voices!  For a Arcade game 8/10\n\nAlso when you beat the game be sure to check out the extras, because the fun truly begins there ;)", "timestamp_created": 1506297201, "timestamp_updated": 1506612433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35184920": {"recommendationid": "35184920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339867589", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512831703}, "language": "english", "review": "Old school shoot em up goodness.", "timestamp_created": 1506269787, "timestamp_updated": 1506269787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35036055": {"recommendationid": "35036055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048362160", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505973009}, "language": "english", "review": "Very solid take on the top down shooter.", "timestamp_created": 1505695057, "timestamp_updated": 1505695057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35035198": {"recommendationid": "35035198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000789472", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506747013}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish more present retro style games were like this one.

What this shooter provides is a sense of raw, exhilarating action that many modern games have forgotten about. DYA Games was not kidding: this game truly is pure gameplay and no filler, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Bot Vice is tough. VERY tough. But it always makes you want to come back for more, trying again and again until you finally complete a stage after the twentieth attempt.  Combine this with fantastic pixel art and Dominic Ninmark's truly phenomenal soundtrack, and I can easily say, with no exaggeration, that Bot Vice is my favorite game of 2016.

The hell was I thinking?!  This game, and by extension DYA, their studio, is an excellent arcade machine.  This is a nice Wild guns style game where you are moving and shooting things on a single screen.  Kill enemies until the boss appears, then destroy them.  Rinse repeat.  The game is fast paced and when you die, which you will, it restarts instantly, never having you fall into a lull with no action.  You have plenty of weapons and chances to use them and it's engrossing in short spurts.\n\nThat's the key.  This is an arcade game and in short spurts, it's excellent, fun, and has a surprisingly fun story.  DYA goes all in with all its games with voice acting and storytelling which, love it or not, is pretty impressive.  This is a fun 30 minute to an hour game that you play, put down, then play again later for a rush.  It's not long, but it is fun and defines, for me, retro done well.\n\nIf you want immersive, beautiful storytelling and design, go for Supergiant.  If you want charming narrative with a dark, witty world, go to Failbetter.

The frantic style of the game reminds me a bit of Wild Guns though that is not comepletly accurate. Unlike Wild Guns you have a melee attack (that can also stop some projectiles) a dodge roll and a cover system. \n\nEnemies come at you relentlessly but the game isn't unfair and slowly introduces new enemy types throughout the levels. You WILL die in this game (even on Normal mode) but that is ok. You have 30 ingame minutes to beat all the stages or you will get a game over. It isn't impossible to do your first run. I managed to do it on my first normal mode run. I recommend playing either on normal or easy on your first run of the game. \n\nThe presentation is pretty damn good! Some of the voice acting can be a little hit or miss but it is pretty good. Erin's actress is pretty good though some of her lines were a bit flat. The final bosses voice made me laugh (I think that was on purpose)\n\nI would love to see a sequel that expands on this or a DLC update. I recommend this game if your looking for a frantic arcade shooter.\n\nlast unrelated thing I do not like how the developer asked some reviewers to take their reviews down.

The game takes around 2 hours to complete the main story, with another ~2 hours in extra missions. (guessing as I have not completed them all yet.) Instead of going for a dual joystick shooter style, the game is designed with a Super Nintendo controller in mind. This means that instead of using the right stick to aim there is a nearest enemy lock button. It takes a second to get used too, but it works and I really felt like I was playing a high quality snes shooter. This game was more challenging than your average game, but definitely doable. The first stage ends up being the hardest because of the learning curve. It is kind of a bummer though, they are SO close to making a game that looks and feels exactly like it was on the SNES so I don't know why they went and did things outside of the SNES capabilities. Remove voices, keep it to muffled quips, tighten up the writing and you could sell the game as a SNES throwback that is super legit. Heck even the file size is only 160 MB, and I bet it would be a ton less if they removed voices. The game is so close to perfect (for what it is), so it is a bummer they did not bring it the rest of the way. Still, what is there is very good and nothing ruins the experience.\n\nThe voices are alright. The one in the trailer is the worst of them which makes it a strange choice.\n\nAlso, I think the cover art for the store page might be hurting their sales. It just doesn't evoke anything to me.

These are initial impressions. Opinion subject to change (though at this point I highly doubt it).\nThis game is a bullet hell through and through, merciless at every turn. While enemies in the levels are static, their attacks are absolutely not. Everything is aiming at you. Figuring out how to avoid their attacks is an absolute necessity in this game. From time to time in each level a robot will fly around; you can shoot it to get your weapon powerups and one of your four hearts back. These are not only key to your success, their timely distribution is a large part of what makes this game challenging and fun to play- they come in at set intervals, give you set powerups, and if you're not paying attention you'll burn right through their usefulness without doing anything. The biggest thing to note about this game is that you are constricted to a 2D axis of movement (left and right), but your aiming can lock on, allowing for a much greater complexity of attack.\n\nWhich brings me to my biggest (and pretty much only) complaint I have with the game. The lock on feature is a very awkward beast to get a hold of- it may not always lock onto the enemy you want, though it is generally fairly predictable given you take the time to position yourself correctly. Locking on is confined to a single button, and you cannot select what it will lock on to, only influnence that by moving closer to/more directly in front of the enemy you wish to target. It's does automatically start targeting the next enemy, though enemies will often bunch up in levels to make themselves harder to hit. As you can imagine this makes chaining lock-ons just a bit awkward. Locking on (like almost everything else in this game) is not instant and so in general by the time you've reacquired your enemy you've likely lost some health. It's not impossible to mitigate, just quite frustrating in parts.\n\nThat being said, the rest of the game's mechanics are designed in an extremely intelligent fashion. You generally have three options outside of normal movement to avoid projecties- you can slash at them when they're in range of your saber, you can press up against the barricade (provided enemies haven't destroyed it), or you can roll out of the way (invulnerable to attacks during it). All of these have weight and consequence. The same goes for switching weapons- each enemy has a different resistance to each type of weapon, though a few well-aimed shots from your default weapon will generally make paste of whatever you aim it at, unless it's big and bulky or a boss enemy. None of the powerups works well against all enemies, and your default gun can only ever hit one thing at time, so switching your powerups are essential to finishing the level. It all forces split-second decisions and hairpin timing- this game has a ridiculously high difficulty curve until you learn the levels and enemy patterns.\n\nLock-on system issues aside, this is absolutely a solid game and I couldn't recommend it enough to fans of shmups and bullet hells.", "timestamp_created": 1498886721, "timestamp_updated": 1498949374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486378", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33061235": {"recommendationid": "33061235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263133791", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498867592}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo rapido, restart rapido e boa dificuldade.", "timestamp_created": 1498867652, "timestamp_updated": 1498867652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32871869": {"recommendationid": "32871869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011794200", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500762785}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay - Amazing\nSoundtrack - Amazing \nVoice acting - amazing\nArt - amazing\nController - Amazing\n\nThis game is very good, is pretty fun and art style is reminder SNES 90s\n\nPretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1498586989, "timestamp_updated": 1498586989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750451", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32789757": {"recommendationid": "32789757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088478538", "num_games_owned": 690, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498425459}, "language": "english", "review": "It has a bit of a learning curve at first and a controler is a must but once you attune to it this becomes a very fun experence indeed.

Targetting will always feel somewhat off, but somehow, like everything else in the game, it somehow works out.\n\nI strongly recommend starting on Easy.  Even then the game can be very challenging and may take you some time to get through all the levels.  If you are feeling adventerous, you could always start on Normal.

It feels nice to be able to jump into a game without any handholding so I can shoot a lot of things and blow them up.  Taking on waves of enemies is always a thrill, and the boss fights really make you work hard to win.  It's the sort of hardcore gaming fix I needed.  Enough for me to start speedrunning it.\n\nAs a speedrun, this game has been downright amazing.

You have to really pay a lot of attention and practice a stage a bit before progress can be made sometimes, but replaying stages is still fun cause they are relatively short and you're just thrown right back into the good action. It's not like a lot of platformers where if you fall in a pit or something you'll have to do a bunch of annoying jumps and obstacles over again just to get another shot at where you messed up. \n\nAlso, the spritework and music here are fantastic!

It's awkward to say if either the way the controls are set are awkward or how I can only lock onto targets or just shoot infront of me is setting me back, but the game is good and is a love letter to those games of old where you'd feed your weeks allowance just to beat that ONE level. And seeing how short Bot Vice is in a sense the levels sort of HAVE to be hard so you can feel as if you'd just climbed a mountain. Not a bad thing to have if you ask me but personally it's not my cup of tea. As stated above the game does feel somewhat awkward and more then enough all the same allures me in to try and beat it. However I've only beaten the first level and after that it was a mix of not wanting to play and relief that I at least beat A level. If you like games that'll grab you by the collar and make it known this is hard, then by all means dive right in. However just prepare to rage quit a few times in the progress.

It offers 25 stages with boss battles every 5 stages or so.\n\nIt's really good but hard. I needed to play on easy mode to even get a chance, Now that I'm more familiar with the controls, I'll give it another go on normal.\n\nThe main downside is the voice acting. It's not horrible, I quite liked the voice actress of the main character but I think the game would've been better without it. The story is also nothing to write home about. It's kindof self-aware. I think the game maybe would've been better with a simpler, shorter story?\n\nSome more feedback for the developers:\n\n\n\n- Adding an easy mode was a good idea. I know it doesn't exactly fit with your vision, but some people like to enjoy the game at their own pace. If you didn't add one, I probably would've cheated to get the experience I want.\n- Add a way to reset controller options to default\n- Maybe add cosmetic stuff like unlockable costumes for the main character after completing the game\n- Yay, post credits scenes are awesome.\n- I really didn't like the voice of Dr. Octipus\n- I'm not sure if I entirely like the way weapon cycling works. Not sure how I'd change it. Maybe automatically change to a new weapon on pickup? Maybe only go back to your pea shooter after you exhausted all options? Shortcuts for every weapon? The way I used the weapons now is just go through them one for one, till they run out.\n\nLooking forward to your next game!", "timestamp_created": 1478288271, "timestamp_updated": 1478288431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26409493": {"recommendationid": "26409493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052037870", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488943183}, "language": "spanish", "review": "entretenido y desafiante, recomendado!", "timestamp_created": 1478226727, "timestamp_updated": 1478226727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26174071": {"recommendationid": "26174071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075335802", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503132453}, "language": "english", "review": "honestly, this games gonna hit that nostalgia itch you might have if you're a fan of the Snes games and their destruction graphics.

En este ambiente de innovaci\u00f3n el meternos en medio del meollo siempre ha sido una obsesi\u00f3n, algo que comenzamos a sorprendernos gracias a la primera persona de t\u00edtulos como Operation Wolf o a la tercera persona de juegos como G.I. Joe. \n\nPero, entre estos dos, hubo un subg\u00e9nero muy peque\u00f1o, que populariz\u00f3 el famoso Cabal, un juego tan popular, que todos los que intentaron copiar su estilo acabaron etiquetados como \u201cclones de Cabal\u201d, a pesar de que la propia compa\u00f1\u00eda acabar\u00eda haciendo uno de ellos: Blood Bros., una secuela que mezclaba elementos del oeste con imaginarios, y del que m\u00e1s tarde otro \u201cclon de Cabal\u201d se inspir\u00f3 para crear Wild Guns en Super Nintendo.\n\nBasado en estos t\u00edtulos llega la \u00faltima obra de los espa\u00f1oles de DYA Games, un heredero directo no solo de estos juegos que os he comentado sino, sobre todo, del esp\u00edritu arcade que corr\u00eda con tant\u00edsima fuerza a principios de los 90.\n\nComo dice la propia publicidad, Bot Vice es \u201cJugabilidad pura y dura. Sin relleno\u201d. Y vaya si lo es. Es duro, r\u00e1pido y no deja ni un segundo de descanso. Vamos, que vais a sudar tinta. Mucho. \n\nDe hecho, tengo que confesaros que todo el an\u00e1lisis que vais a ver a partir de ahora est\u00e1 grabado en f\u00e1cil. Eh, eh, que aunque facilita UN POCO el juego, creo que el esp\u00edritu de lucha y superaci\u00f3n sigue estando ah\u00ed: completar las fases no deber\u00eda costarte m\u00e1s de un minuto, y sin embargo pasar\u00e1s 10, 20, 30 o incluso un par de horas para terminar algunas de las pantallas. Tanto te metes que, de repente, algunas las completas al primer o segundo intento: no es que sean m\u00e1s f\u00e1ciles, es que tu eres mejor jugando. \n\nPero, y esto es lo importante, la dificultad no es, para nada, un lastre: siempre vas con el impulso de \u201cun intento m\u00e1s\u201d, \u201cun intento m\u00e1s\u201d, porque sabes que no has muerto porque el juego quiera, sino porque t\u00fa has fallado. Tienes claro qu\u00e9 es lo que te ha matado y por qu\u00e9 ha ocurrido. Y eso es lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de lograr en un videojuego.\n\nVale, pero\u2026 \u00bfDe qu\u00e9 va Bot Vice? Bueno, hay una invasi\u00f3n de robots, han pedido un rescate enorme y la prota no se est\u00e1 por muchas ostias. As\u00ed que, a tiro limpio, va vaciando de enemigos cada una de las 25 \u00e1reas del juego lo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido posible. Y digo r\u00e1pido porque si la suma de tiempo supera cierta cantidad, la fase final es inaccesible. Para solucionarlo, podemos rejugar cualquiera de las pantallas anteriores para mejorar nuestro tiempo.\n\nA pesar de que parece sencillo, el control es muy completo y necesita de un tiempo para que nos acostumbremos: podemos elegir entre 5 armas diferentes, rodar por el suelo, cubrirnos contra las paredes, golpear con nuestro brazo mec\u00e1nico, apuntar a enemigos o disparar en l\u00ednea recta. TODO esto EXIGE que consigamos dominarlo a la perfecci\u00f3n, o estaremos fritos en segundos. Y se traduce en una experiencia agotadora, pero inmensamente satisfactoria.\n\n\u00bfTienes un mal d\u00eda en el trabajo? Revienta coches.\n\u00bfTienes un mal d\u00eda en casa? Revienta trenes.\n\u00bfTienes un mal d\u00eda en general? Revienta helicopteros de guerra.\n\nY, caray, que todo esto viene acompa\u00f1ado de un apartado t\u00e9cnico brillante. Hemos visto muchos juegos con est\u00e9tica de los 90, pero pocos lo han sabido adaptar de una manera tan perfecta: la relaci\u00f3n de tama\u00f1o de los sprites respecto al escenario, la velocidad y movimiento de estos, las animaciones hechas a mano, la respuesta de los mandos, el parpadeo de los elementos destruibles, las voces digitalizadas durante la acci\u00f3n, la paleta de color elegida, la m\u00fasica sintetizada a manos de sueco Dominic Ninmark\u2026 Incluso la dificultad me parece remarcable. \n\nS\u00ed, la dificultad. Porque me habr\u00e9is o\u00eddo quejarme en otra serie de este canal, Va de Retro, que algunos juegos de Super Nintendo me parec\u00edan f\u00e1ciles. Este juego no lo es. Es un heredero directo de las recreativas de la \u00e9poca, solo que aqu\u00ed no pierdes dinero. Y aunque en un principio piensas: \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no han comenzado con algo m\u00e1s asequible para luego subir la dificultad? Bueno, es que cada fase presenta alg\u00fan reto nuevo y lo hace bien, una clase de dise\u00f1o ante la que me quito el sombrero.\n\nNo todo es perfecto y hay un par de detalles que no me gustan. Por ejemplo, mientras que las voces quedan muy bien durante la partida, en las escenas antes de los jefes son un poco\u2026 meh. De hecho, creo que tiene demasiada historia para ser un shooter. Aunque, eso s\u00ed, esto nos brinda la oportunidad de ver a\u00fan m\u00e1s pixel art de muy buena calidad.\n\nOtra cosa que me resulta problem\u00e1tica es que, en ocasiones, la mira cambia de objetivo y esto me puede dejar vendido. No se muy bien como funciona porque muchas veces se queda bloqueada en un enemigo aunque se aleje a la otra punta del escenario, y otras cambia por enemigos que est\u00e1n m\u00e1s lejos que nuestro objetivo deseado. En las fases normales no es mucha molestia, al fin y al cabo todo debe eliminarse, pero contra los enemigos finales puede llegar a incordiar mucho, no pudiendo centrar el fuego contra el jefe y teniendo que acabar de vez en cuando con escoria que ha venido a molestar.\n\nEntonces, \u00bfqu\u00e9 es Bot Vice? Una manera de que sep\u00e1is c\u00f3mo nos sent\u00edamos los jugadores de finales de los 80 y principios de los 90 en los salones recreativos, cuando nos volv\u00edan locos los disparos, las explosiones, los colores chillones y la superaci\u00f3n de retos imposibles. Un viaje en el tiempo que reproduce, casi perfectamente, los cabreos, las desesperaciones y las alegr\u00edas que nos daban estos t\u00edtulos. Bot Vice es el juego que so\u00f1aba con tener para mi Super Nintendo.

It's one of those games where I wish it was my idea as its gameplay philosophy resonates with me.

I don't even mind dying as the music is catchy. I personally love the fact that this game treats me like I've been playing video games for the past 25+ years and is incredibly difficult right off the bat. It's super rewarding when you've got a good flow going using ALL of your abilities and your reflexes are on point. Mashing handgun, dodge rolling, constantly switching weapons depending on the scenario/strategy, blocking bullets with my sword, and carefully timing enemy patterns at a super fast pace. Mentally exhausting, but very fun. This game is one of a kind and I commend the developers for sticking to their game design philosophy instead of catering to the majority. I understand exactly what these developers were aiming for and it clicks with me. Some might complain about the controls. They are certainly different and have a learning curve, but they are excellent. It will take some time to get used to them, but you'll realize you only have yourself to blame when you lose. Sometimes it can add to a game by making the controls something to master. There's a big difference between \"bad controls\" and great controls that just have a learning curve like Bot Vice. Therefore, I'd disregard any complaints about controls. I wish this game received more attention, but its difficulty might only reach a very niche market.

The game is inspired by \"games of yesteryear\"...more specifically, games of the 90s (some may think it reminds them of SNES, others may think of 90s arcade games) like Wild Guns and Time Crisis. Dya Games also has another game worth checking out, titled \"Super Star Path\", a sort of shooting game and puzzle fusion.\n\nAt any rate, I will say one thing right now...this game is \"hard\"...VERY \"HARD\"...why do I say \"hard\" the way I do? Well, to be perfectly honest, I love the difficulty of the game and I am actually used to challenging games, even making videos years okay of how to beat every stage in a game like the SNES version of \"Jim Powers\" (if you look up the game, it is supposed to be notoriously hard) without losing a single life. Yeeeeeeeeah...so I welcomed the challenge and when sitting down and playing this game, I can see why many would have a problem with it; the difficulty hits hard, right from the start...but honestly, after about 15-30 minutes of practice, I really had no problem for most of the game and could see that the game was difficult, but definitely fair...it doesn't have a ton of \"cheap\" deaths like something like \"I Wanna Be The Guy\", lol...but like the aforementioned game, or any game that is challenging (but worth playing), you kinda should WANT to practice...I know if I play a fighting game, I don't expect it to be easy; I just practice...I don't see why a game like this should be treated any differently and once you get the cover and roll system down and know to use the targeting system to shoot around obstacles, the game becomes just like my beloved games of old; full of non-stop action, neat visuals, and awesome music!\n\nYou control the 28 year old Erin Saver, who lost her partner and one of her arms years ago...now, with a new bionic arm, she is getting revenge and serving justice at the same time to the corrupt and criminal wildbots! Can you beat the 25 levels and protect Tominaka Plaza and get rid of the threat? Well, there are a few more things you should know...to start, the game has \"time\" and you can't beat all the stages if you do not have enough time. You can replay stages to get a lower time, which will give you more time for your \"overall time\" and about a \"B\" or \"C\" rank on all stages will allow you to have access to the final levels. As mentioned before, you can take cover (duck behind) objects to stay safe, or you can roll to evade fire. Enemies can destroy your \"walls\" and if they destroy a spot, that is one less spot that you will be able to take cover, which means you would have to roll to dodge. If enemies get close enough, you can cut them down with Erin's mighty saber attack (which can stop some enemy attacks/destroy bullets), but be careful as they might shoot you...study enemy firing habits. \n\nEnemies will sometimes lob things OVER your wall, so you can't avoid those attacks by covering; you'd have to roll. There is a little guy that moves around and won't attack...shooting the little guy will award you with power-ups! You have your standard shot, a machine gun (super rapid shots!), a flamethrower (short range, but powerful), a spread shot (good for waves), Rocket Launcher (the explosion around the rocket will hit other nearby things and objects...careful not to use this while enemies are close, because you will damage your cover areas), and a powerful grenade, that you can lob over enemy obstacles!\n\nThe game was updated with an \"Easy\" mode where you can get life recovery items and you can play with keyboard and joystick (my joystick is generic though and didn't work...but nothing that JoyToKey couldn't fix, lol). The game is a lot of fun, and I actually like the cheesy voice acting, as it is so 90s (or 80s...or 70s, lol) and just feels right at home.\n\n- ADDITION -\n\nLike Us On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thegamingsanctuary/\n\nFollow Us On Twitter: https://twitter.com/GS_Vyse_and_Bel\n\nVisit Us At: http://www.gamingsanctuary.com", "timestamp_created": 1470884771, "timestamp_updated": 1470884771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546158", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24779808": {"recommendationid": "24779808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006276098", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477305902}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and challenging arcade style, fast paced shooter, presented in a 90's SNES visual style.  Bot Vice contains about 25 stages. Each level plays out on a single screen where you battle waves of robots until you reach the mini-boss battle at the end. Eventually leading up to the main story boss battles that progress the story line of the game. Some of the more hilarious bosses include parodies of Bebop and Rocksteady, as a bit of a TMNT fan tribute. The game also now features easy and hard mode. With the main difference being you receive health item drops while playing on easy difficulty. \n\nThe game can be a bit tough at times but with a bit of practice it's possible to overcome. You're not only trying to just complete each stage but also race to obtain the best time possible. In order to stop the plot you're only given a set amount of time to complete the game. It becomes fairly important to keep your level completion times as low as possible.\n\nThe voice acting and long winded villain speeches add a bit of charm, as a loving reference to all the awesome and silly arcade sounds of old. The music is not bad and it contains some decent sound effects and a few silly voice lines. Music wise nothing incredible. It works well for what it's meant to be at least. \n\nThe controls are very responsive, although the lock on system can be a little tricky at times. The power ups can also be a little tricky to cycle through. \n\nTheoretically the game is fairly short. But it still took me about 3-4 hours of actual playtime on easy mode to finally complete the game. It also gives you alot of achievements to shoot for which adds some replay-ability. I would say you're probably looking at 3-6 hours of playtime if you're as bad as I am at shooters, plus maybe another 1-2 hours if you're going for all the achievements. \n\nTo sum it up, I really enjoyed playing this game and felt a real sense of accomplishment and excitement after finally kicking the final boss in his arse!

El videojuego nos propone rodar, cubrirse y disparar a mansalva a un mont\u00f3n de bots rebeldes, que no nos lo pondr\u00e1n nada sencillo. Para ello, disponemos de 6 armas distintas y la espada, que servir\u00e1 para abatir a aquellos enemigos que est\u00e9n m\u00e1s cerca de la barrera. Su brutal dificultad puede ser un impedimento para muchos, y es que, hay algunas cosas que podr\u00edan mejorarse para facilitar la tarea (m\u00e1s abajo lo especifico). El uso de las coberturas es muy bueno, me gusta bastante c\u00f3mo hay que utilizarlas. Otro aspecto notable son los patrones de los jefes, originales y divertidos a rabiar.\n\nUna m\u00fasica que me ha enamorado, sobre todo esas que sonaban tan funky, preciosas. Unos gr\u00e1ficos cuidados hasta el extremo, donde todo est\u00e1 animado; cada enemigo, cada elemento del escenario, cada uno de sus ataques... Uno de los mejores trabajos en pixel-art que se haya hecho en Espa\u00f1a, imperdible, dignos de elogio.\n\n25 fases llenas de adrenalina, cada fase con un jefe y 5 grandes jefazos en medio de la aventura, qu\u00e9, por cierto; tiene una historia bastante buena e interesante. Para el que ame los beat 'em ups, esa historia le puede gustar. Buenas actuaciones en ingl\u00e9s y divertidos di\u00e1logos.\n\nEn resumen; un h\u00edbrido entre shmup y gallery que destaca.

It took me almost an hour just to beat the first stage alone. When it comes to games similar to Bot Vice, this is the closest game we have to Wild Guns on the PC as of today with a cover system and auto aim instead of manual aim because of the enemy bullets traveling as fast as your bullets instead of the usual travel speed of most bullet hell shooters which is fairly slow to say the least. Honestly the voice acting so far gives me a \"take it or leave it\" vibe since I find it pretty cheesy in my opinion. \n\nAs far as I can tell, you cannot rebind the keyboard controls and instead gives you 2 presets for you, but they constantly push the notion that the game is best played with a controller not only on the store page, but also the splash screen saying \" Winners don't use keyboards\". Despite the recommended control schemes, it's playable with a keyboard. Enemies are greatly varied and all have distinct attack patterns that are easily identifiable from one another. I would say the only negative thing I can say about Bot Vice is that the difficulty curve is extremely high meaning if you don't have the patience to get better, the difficulty will turn you off completely.\n\nBot Vice is geared towards the masochistic and for anyone looking for a Wild Guns game on the PC, but mainly the masochistic all for the low price of $10.", "timestamp_created": 1468281556, "timestamp_updated": 1468281648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24264062": {"recommendationid": "24264062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010513441", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507417577}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple arcade-style game with great visual and sound design.\nMy only gripe is its difficulty, which can only be described as \"excessive\" by modern standards.\nYou will likely die during the tutorial, which is the game's fault, not yours.\nIt simply doesn't give you enough time to learn, before it tries to absolutely murder you with lightning fast bullets coming from various directions.\nI am not at all against difficult games, but the pacing seems off.\nStage 1 is pretty brutal, and it only gets worse from there.\nIf you think \"Oh, all these people probably just suck\", expect a nice, painful reality check when you first launch this game.

I mention this because Bot Vice accomplishes as well what Super Star Path did before it: offering a satisfying arcade style shooting experience.\n\nBV is simple in its design: move along the bottom of the screen dodging enemy attacks while shooting upwards at every enemy that appears on-screen. A wide variety of weapons, enemy types, level designs, and bosses gives BV a great sense of variety. It's fast-paced with a decent challenge: BV took me about an hour and a half to finish in my first sitting, so there's  a fair amount of length to the game, not even considering the dozens of extra missions and stage challenges.\n\nI won't mention the story too much because it's an arcade game: it's not meant to be deep. The added voice acting is a campy touch, and the dialogue was appropriately dorky, but I mostly skipped through it. \n\nThe sprite work is fantastic, the graphics vibrant and colorful, with a very good frame rate to back it up. The music is solid and the game handles well.\n\nIf you're willing to bulldog your way through some spots of diffuclty sprinkled throughout you'll find a very enjoyable shooter waiting for you.\n\nOh, and this may seem a little out of left field, but I'm very happy DYA Games decided not to include profanity in Bot Vice as they did in Super Star Path.

Comprato al prezzo irrisorio di eurocent 49 (quarantanove!), onestamente le mie aspettative non erano propriamente alle stelle: sappiamo tutti che in questa fascia di prezzo - una terra di nessuno in cui la fregatura \u00e8 sempre dietro l'angolo - ciofeche amatoriali e s\u00f2le incomplete trovano il proprio habitat ideale.  \n\nE invece, con sommo stupore (e non poca soddisfazione) realizzo subito di avere tra le mani uno shooter arcade divertentissimo, frenetico e colorato, in grado di catapultarmi con violenza ai tempi in cui il SNES regnava sovrano e ci coccolava il palato con titoli come Wilds Guns. Non cito questo nome a caso: si da il caso che lo shooter di Natsume sia approdato recentemente su Steam in una versione \"Reloaded\", ampliata e \"rimasterizzata\"... per la modica (?) somma di 19.90 euro. Per quanto Wild Guns Reloaded sia senz'altro un gioco eccezionale (ammetto di andare sulla fiducia: sono fermo all'originale), facendo per una volta una considerazione di carattere economico il paragone con Bot Vice non regge minimamente: sul piano del rapporto qualit\u00e0/prezzo e durata/prezzo il titolo di DYA Games sbaraglia la concorrenza vincendo a mani bassissime.\n\nNella storia vestiremo i panni di Erin Saver, agente di polizia che ha perso il proprio compagno (e il braccio destro, sostituito da un'arma bionica) per mano dei WildBots. Spinti dalla sete di vendetta dovremo farci largo attraverso diverse decine di scenari, cercando di sopravvivere ai proiettili nemici con l'onnipresente dodge-roll e utilizzando a mo' di scudo ripari di vario genere; in ogni scenario dovremo affrontare e sconfiggere un mini-boss per proseguire, mentre un boss pi\u00f9 impegnativo ci aspetter\u00e0 al termine di ogni sezione.\n\nNella pagina del negozio di Bot Vice avrete senz'altro notato la scritta a caratteri cubitali \"Nota: A controller is strongly recommended to play this game\"; il concetto verr\u00e0 ribadito nella schermata iniziale che recita \"Winners don't use keyboards\", scimmiottando gli slogan anti-droga presenti in diversi titoli arcade degli anni '90. Fidatevi del consiglio: non sognatevi nemmeno di scaricare il gioco senza aver recuperato il fidato pad XBONE/X360. Ovviamente in line teorica il gioco sarebbe approcciabile anche con la tastiera, ma a meno che non siate una piovra, un pianista o un parlamentare italiano (c'\u00e8 differenza?) vi assicuro che lo schema di controlli risulterebbe troppo ostico da padroneggiare alla perfezione.\n\nAnche con il supporto di un buon pad, i controlli inizialmente risulteranno pi\u00f9 complicati di quanto sarebbe lecito aspettarsi da un titolo simile. Qualcuno storcer\u00e0 il naso nel constatare che Bot Vice NON \u00e8 un twin stick shooter: infatti lo stick destro NON verr\u00e0 utilizzato per il puntamento, che viene invece gestito con un apposito tasto dorsale e non \u00e8 libero, ma salta da un bersaglio all'altro, favorendo inizialmente quello pi\u00f9 vicino. Una volta metabolizzato lo schema di controlli - tra coperture, schivate, attacchi da mischia, cambio armi e chi pi\u00f9 ne ha pi\u00f9 ne metta - il gioco scorre che \u00e8 un piacere.\n\nPixel-art e OST sono di ottimo livello ma soprattutto risultano estremamente fedeli al periodo di riferimento: pensandoci bene, \u00e8 quasi un peccato che un gioco del genere sia uscito nei 201X e non negli anni '90 - sarebbe diventato istantaneamente un cult, su ogni piattaforma possibile e immaginabile.

Bot Vice is a rather difficult gallery shooter, where you control Erin the protagonist in her quest to avenge the death of her partner. It is a simple plot, but it gives the gameplay a purpose, and that is where the meat of the game is. Explosions and bullets are everywhere! You need to be good at crowd control, or you'll easily be overwhelmed in the later stages. The game just feels really good to play, due to the flawless (in my opinion) controls, well-designed hitboxes, and tight movement of your character. I never felt like a died because of clunky movement or cheap hitboxes. You move almost immediately and turn on a dime, which is required in a game like this. There are plenty of stages, and each stage has its own music track. The music is fantastic, the sprite work is equally excellent, the sound effects are really good too. There is also some nice screenshake that makes the weapons feel even more powerful, but you can dial that down if you wish. My only complaints are: The voice acting is pretty hit-and-miss (I don't expect amazing voice acting from indie studios anyways) and it can kind of grate on you after awhile. Secondly, I found little to no use for the cover system. I beat the entire game without touching cover at all. In my opinion, if you just keep moving and roll to avoid shots, you'll be fine. The only time this isn't viable is in a few stages which essentially require you to use your Sabre to stay alive. (it is a melee attack that hits enemies and destroys bullets on contact) overall this is a really fun retro shooter that I enjoyed from start to finish. The devs are also really active in my experience, and very friendly too.\n\nWhether you get it on sale for $1 like I did, or pay full price, it's worth it. The amount of work that went into the sprite animations and music is pretty insane. Support indie developers like DYA Games, they know what they're doing.

It's a bit short, but I think it's the perfect length, especially for the price you can get it for. There are 25 story mode stages and 25 extra stages. Each stage takes between 1-2 minutes, although you're likely to die a few times on levels. All in all, it takes a bit under 2 hours to beat, maybe more if you're not too great at chaotic action games, and if you're looking for your money's worth, you can get it with the challenges (rankings and beating stages with 4 hearts) and extra stages.\n\nI won't talk about gameplay much. The videos speak for themselves. I'll just say it's fun and rewarding, and it's actually more chaotic than the videos let on. Each stage is unique and has its own gimmick with tons of enemy variety, so levels never feel the same. I only have two minor gripes with the game: weapon powerups and taking cover.\n\nYour default gun has unlimited ammo but isn't special in any way, but you frequently get powerups that have limited ammo. The problem with them is only two are complete upgrades to the default weapon, and 3 others are very situational (one is short range, one is slow but powerful, the other is... slow but powerful). But you switch between the 6 possible weapons with one button in real time, so it's hard to 1. see if you even have the ammo that you want and 2. quickly and efficiently switch to that ammo type. I wish holding it would pause the game and bring up a weapon wheel or something.\n\nAs for taking cover, my gripe with it is it seems kind of useless. It seems like a big feature of gameplay with your cover being destructible even, but dashing seems superior in 95% of the time, so those times that you might actually benefit from cover instead of dashing, your instinct is to dash. I wish the game was built around possibly punishing dashing or something else to encourage use of the cover mechanic, which seems unique.\n\nMinor gripes and short length aside, this game is fun and feels unique, so I recommend you pick it up.\n\nAlso, one note. While the game claims to be ball-bustingly hard, I never felt it to be super hard (well the final level definitely took me the most retries). But that's apparently because difficulty levels were added after release. The original difficulty is hard, so playing on normal does not actually reflect the developer's original vision, but it likely made it more enjoyable to a wider audience. That addition added some quirks, such as not differentiating between hard and easy as far as level time (which is recorded) goes. The game has level rankings and even requires you beat all of the stages under a set amount of time (45 minutes I think? And time is based on your fastest run) to unlock the final level, but on normal difficulty, I got A rank on almost all stages without trying, and I reached the final level with 10 minutes to spare.", "timestamp_created": 1515424156, "timestamp_updated": 1515424156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39166473": {"recommendationid": "39166473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355527794", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1515364912}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Epicamente fascinate el juego estubo increible joder,tan epico que faltan palabras para describirlo :D\nes muy sensillo he adictivo,tambien tiene muchas referencias XD\n\n\nesta es mi puntiacion\n\nGraficas ______________10/10\nJugabilidad ____________10/10\nsonido _______________10/10\n\n<3 espero la segunda entrega ,':-)", "timestamp_created": 1515364922, "timestamp_updated": 1515364922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39155968": {"recommendationid": "39155968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036446642", "num_games_owned": 1771, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 142, "last_played": 1515340514}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, short but frenetic and crazy.

The game comes with 35 extra stages (I think these do reuse assets and music, they may have extract content though, I have not played all of them yet).\n\nThe gameplay is equally good imho. This is a \"simple\" cover-based gallery shooter. What can be less obvious is that:\n- you can move slowly behind the covers\n- ennemies can damage and eventually destroy the covers that you overuse\n- there is a very useful dash move that provides invincibility frames (from start to end, this might sound like it is too much but abusing it is risky)\n- you can *seamlessly* switch between cover and dash\n- you can cancel out bullets by hitting in front of you (with what looks like a sword but is Erin's arm I think ?), also very useful\n- ennemies come with all kind of attacks. Most will simply shoot towards you, but a few will reach you above your cover, set the ground on fire, etc. etc.\n- you can shoot in front of you or lock to the nearest ennemy (no analog in this game). You can keep locking an ennemy far away on purpose or re-lock to the nearest ennemy. The lock system works pretty overall, it is simple enough not to distract you from dodging / covering.\n- there are additionnal weapons (they use limited ammo), you can switch weapons back and forth anytime.\n\nOverall, the moveset feels pretty good and work well with the game, ennemies and bullets patterns.\n\nEach stage comes with its own mini-boss(es). Most (all ?) of them are unique.\n\nThe only negative to me would be:\n- it is really, really hard to \"accurately\" switch between weapons, even after the update that added the ability to switch weapons 2-way (using 2 buttons). I think there may still be more ways to make it a bit easier. Anyway, it is no big deal because the game almost never *requires* you to switch very fast to a specific weapon at a specific moment\n- the time constraint may not be severe enough. I had plenty of time left even in hard mode. To be honest, I think this is because I play too risky.\n- the game could track progress a bit better (by difficulty settings). There is a reason for that: initially the game did not feature difficulty modes. Since many people found the game too hard, the devs eventually set three difficulty modes (current hard mode is like previous default). Hard is perfectly manageable if you are into arcadey difficulty though, I have beaten games that I think are much harder (namely Dustforce and Cloudbuilt).\n- as you can see, only very minor \"issues\" (I can think only of one or two more).

What it comes down to is 'too much'. There's too much going on each round to be able to have a plan for each round. Bullets come from everywhere and coat your side of the field, guaranteeing that you're going to take hits when trying to fight back. Many enemies have little to no telegraphs (thankfully the mortar ones do), with at least one enemy type [i]coming out shooting at you[/i] if he spawns in while you're on the edge of the screen. So god damn much that it's not worth reading the screen, and instead just taking cover and rolling until you can get to a spot where you can shoot.\n\nThe aiming mechanic is bad also. It initially locks on to the closest enemy and sticks, but that might not be your intended target, and if it is then slashing or ducking will relock onto a nearby target. This is a game that could desperately use mouse support for proper aiming, but the developer is one who takes pride in mocking KBM players, so that's a thing. Frankly, moving to where you need to shoot straight ahead is far better than holding the aim button.\n\nIt's not a bad game presentation-wise, and it feels like there's meat to be had if the level and enemy design was better managed. The sheer amount of projectiles on screen turns the game into duck, roll, and shoot, with controlled weapon switching for when mooks and bosses are out. That's it.

Thanks!)\n\n[h1]These bots are MY vice! ...kinda![/h1]\n\nI should have heeded this game's warning.  A controller is STRONGLY recommended to play this game.  [i]Bot Vice[/i] is a nightmare (control-wise) to keyboard players, but it is possible...the tutorial is only written for those with controllers, though.\n\n[i]Bot Vice[/i] is a shooter that looks like a game where you can run and gun wherever you want, but really you can only move left or right and shoot upwards.  You can also dodge and use a large variety of weapons in this beautifully crafted retro game.  The graphics and animations are simply gorgeous!\n\nAs I said before, this game is NOT keyboard friendly, hence why I only have a small playtime you see as of the writing of this review (0.1 hrs).  If I could get my controller to properly work with my computer, then I'd probably have a lot less issues to worry about.  If you have a controller, dive on in...otherwise, get a controller before playing this game.\n\nDoes this mean I recommend it?  Yes.  Though I don't have a proper controller to work with [i]Bot Vice[/i], it's still not a bad game and you should definitely check it out.  From what I've seen, $5 is a perfect price given what you're getting from this game (a nice SNES age inspired game), but if you're a bargain hunter, then you'll probably jump on it when it's at $2.50-$3.  It's worth looking into.\n\n7/10  [i]Bot Vice[/i] is a throwback to SNES-age retro gaming, keeping that in mind, you should complete the experience with a controller.

Existe uma grande variedade de alvos, muitos deles tem suas peculiaridades e se movimentam de forma padronizada, isso quer dizer que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel decorar o comportamento dos Wildbots. \u2013 Ser\u00e1 que o nome deles seria uma refer\u00eancia a Wild Guns? \u2013 al\u00e9m disso, o recurso que achei mais \u00fatil \u00e9 poder rolar, isso ajuda e muito! J\u00e1 que inevitavelmente algumas partes da barreira que te protege acabam cedendo pelo dano recebido.\n\nOs cen\u00e1rios variam bastante, alguns inimigos at\u00e9 repetem, mas em geral at\u00e9 que varia bastante, um ponto bem interessante \u00e9 que mesmo sendo pixelado, tudo \u00e9 bem detalhado e em nenhum momento h\u00e1 perda de qualidade nos comandos, eles respondem perfeitamente \u00e0 todas as a\u00e7\u00f5es, confesso que nem tentei jogar no teclado, creio que deva ser MUITO desconfort\u00e1vel, uma vez que sua mec\u00e2nica \u00e9 ideal para jogar num controle \u2013 \u00c9 preciso mirar o tempo todo, imagina fazer isso num teclado - j\u00e1 que entramos no assunto, seus bot\u00f5es padronizados podem n\u00e3o agradar, mas isso \u00e9 facilmente customiz\u00e1vel nas op\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\nFalando em op\u00e7\u00f5es, para um jogo t\u00e3o simples como esse, at\u00e9 que existem muitas configura\u00e7\u00f5es que podem ser feitas e por incr\u00edvel que pare\u00e7a, elas fazem diferen\u00e7a. Se voc\u00ea tiver um computador muito antigo \u2013 Muito mesmo \u2013 ainda sim voc\u00ea \u00e9 capaz de rodar Bot Vice. Durante seu gameplay \u00e9 poss\u00edvel que tenha problemas e acabe perdido com \u00e0 quantidade de part\u00edculas na tela quando existem tiroteios intensos, j\u00e1 que os inimigos possuem diversos tipos de armamentos, natural que voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m tenha meios de conseguir, isso \u00e9 feito quando voc\u00ea acerta um pequeno robozinho que surge no cen\u00e1rio, ao acerta-lo ele solta vidas e at\u00e9 armas, basta alterar e continuar atirando at\u00e9 sua muni\u00e7\u00e3o acabar \u2013 Sim, s\u00e3o limitadas \u2013 ent\u00e3o \u00e9 bom ficar de olhos bem abertos quando ver ele dando sopa meio aos rob\u00f4s.\n\nO tempo levado em cada cen\u00e1rio n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito grande, principalmente quando voc\u00ea pega o jeito de jogar, cada um deles leva em torno de 3 minutos, alguns at\u00e9 1 minuto! Mas isso \u00e9 quando voc\u00ea j\u00e1 estiver familiarizado com os controles, al\u00e9m dos inimigos t\u00edpicos, sempre h\u00e1 um mini-boss \u00e0 cada fase e um boss no final do level \u2013 Cada level t\u00eam quatro cen\u00e1rios + um boss \u2013 caso ache que o jogo est\u00e1 muito dif\u00edcil, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel alterar sua dificuldade, assim como o idioma no menu principal, incluindo op\u00e7\u00e3o para legendas em portugu\u00eas.\n\nBot Vice \u00e9 extremamente recomendado! Tenho vasta experi\u00eancia com jogos desse g\u00eanero, gosto e sei muito bem onde procurar seus problemas e suas qualidades, posso dizer que se trata de um jogo quase completo, bem hardcore num n\u00edvel mais elevado, mesmo sua dificuldade padr\u00e3o \u00e9 um desafio para os menos experientes, posso afirmar que embora n\u00e3o seja um game longo, ele faz valer cada minuto jogado! Al\u00e9m das conquistas no Steam, voc\u00ea tem o incentivo extra de que existe um cen\u00e1rio que s\u00f3 pode ser habilitado de voc\u00ea \u201cvirar\u201d o game rapidamente, mas o qu\u00e3o r\u00e1pido... Isso voc\u00ea vai ter que descobrir.\n\n[b]Destaques:[/b]\n\n- Arte visual e trilha sonora;\n- Muita a\u00e7\u00e3o e dificuldade;\n- Exige muito reflexo;\n- Legendas em portugu\u00eas;\n\n[b]\u00c9 preciso melhorar e/ou adicionar:[/b]\n\n- Co-op local ou online seria muito interessante;\n\n[h1]Quer saber mais de outros jogos?[/h1]\n[quote][b]+ [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SimetriaLeague]Simetria League[/url]\n+ [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32110520/]Nossa curadoria[/url]\n+ [url=http://www.simetrialeague.com]Nosso site[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1519582238, "timestamp_updated": 1519582289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40393298": {"recommendationid": "40393298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351941265", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520032047}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Joguinho arcade divertido pra caramba! :)", "timestamp_created": 1519576584, "timestamp_updated": 1519576584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40385542": {"recommendationid": "40385542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220532600", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519614794}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[h1]\u300aBot Vice\u300b[/h1]\n\n[b]\u8bf4\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4fe1\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b3e\u6b7b\u5728\u6559\u5b66\u5173\u5361\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u3002\u3002[/b]\n\u719f\u7ec3\u7ffb\u6eda\uff0c\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6362\u67aa\uff0c\u51c6\u5907\uff08\u5f88\u591a\uff09\u624b\u67c4\u3002\n\u7136\u540e\u518d\u53bb\u73a9\u5427\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1519558909, "timestamp_updated": 1519558909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40385192": {"recommendationid": "40385192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103367744", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519557526}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game, just finished all achievements @ 20.2hrs on normal difficulty, not very good at these types of games but would think someone could do it abit quicker,  polished as hell well worth the 10$ \n", "timestamp_created": 1519557907, "timestamp_updated": 1519557907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40381084": {"recommendationid": "40381084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030620695", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519142003}, "language": "english", "review": "A really fun and challenging arcade shooter with a great soundtrack!

En effet il ne s'agit pas juste d'arroser tous les ennemis \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran sans r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir. Vous pouvez - et devrez : \n  - vous mettre \u00e0 couvert, ce qui vous immunise contre la plupart des attaques en dehors des grenades. Toutefois le segment du mur derri\u00e8re lequel vous vous abritez prend alors les d\u00e9gats \u00e0 votre place et risque d'\u00eatre d\u00e9truit.\n  - dasher sur la droite ou la gauche en faisant une roulade. Vous \u00eates alors invincible durant ce dash, mais attention \u00e0 la zone dans laquelle vous arriverez.\n  - donner un coup d'\u00e9p\u00e9e pour parer la plupart des projectiles ou pour tuer raidement les ennemis situ\u00e9s juste devant vous ou juste derri\u00e8re le mur protecteur.\n  - switcher entre diff\u00e9rentes armes (et \u00e9ventuellement apprendre \u00e0 bouger vos yeux comme les cam\u00e9l\u00e9ons pour voir quelles armes il vous reste). \n- apprendre \u00e0 se d\u00e9barrasser aux mieux des ennemis les plus retords, par exemple en trouvant leur faiblesse.\n\nLe tout donne un jeu tr\u00e8s vif, tr\u00e8s dynamique, sans donner trop l'impression de tourner en boucle.\nLe pixel art et l'animation sont tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ussis, la programmation me semble au poil : c'est fluide et les hit box sont bonnes m\u00eame quand \u00e7a p\u00e8te dans tous les sens.\nMentionnons le sc\u00e9nario qui, bien qu'anecdotique, a le m\u00e9rite d'exister (et dispo en fran\u00e7ais s'il-vous-plait !) et d'alimenter l'ambiance tr\u00e8s 90's du titre.\n\nPar contre attention, le jeu devient tr\u00e8s dur, m\u00eame en facile ! Heureusement, recommencer plusieurs fois le m\u00eame niveau ne devient pas trop rapidemment lassant : en effet chaque partie sera diff\u00e9rente grace aux nombreuses approches possibles (\"bon cette fois je vais plut\u00f4t essayer de tuer eux en priorit\u00e9, et d'\u00e9viter les salves de ces autres l\u00e0 en dashant...\"). De plus nous ne sommes pas dans un shoot'em up b\u00eate et classique o\u00f9 les ennemis reproduisent le m\u00eame pattern quel que soit vos mouvements.

Unfortunately, in tight spots the \"right\" doesn't always register before the \"roll\" so you end up rolling left into yet more bullets.\n\nIt's weird that they designed it this way when they could've used two separate buttons for left roll and right roll. \n\nVerdict:  Tentative recommend for solo play.

This makes it easy to pick up for a short session, but equally easy to get lost in the \"just one more try\" loop.  Games organized this way just work for me in general, and thankfully the actual gameplay competent is quite enjoyable and more rich than might appear at first glance.\n\nFun, fast, frantic, and unforgiving just the way I like it.  This game demands skill and you can't just hold the lock-on and fire buttons and expect cheese a win. You must use your invincibility dodge at the right times, remember to duck behind the cover in front of you, strategize weapon switching, incorporate the lock-on ability at the right times, use your sword to kill melee-ranged foes and cancel bullets, etc.  All around a really good game that keeps you engaged.\n\nIt took me around 2.5 hours to beat the base game, plus some time was spent idling in menu and some spent re-doing the first bunch of levels perfectly just for fun to bring me to around 4 hours to do so.\n\nWhen I beat the final boss I felt that little twang of sadness when you finish a really great game.  But I get to go back and get \"perfect\" on some of the levels I missed because they actually are worth playing, plus I was so happy to find that MILD SPOILER [spoiler]25 additional much more challenging bonus levels unlocked after beating the 'final' boss[/spoiler].\n\nThis game was well worth what I paid.  The main campaign is a little short so I would say to get this on sale, but I would also say you probably won't be sad to pay full price once you get a taste of the gameplay, if you like hard, fast, and very fair arcade-style games.\n\nThe story was long-winded and moronic, so I skipped most of the story scenes which went on forever.

You have guns, a melee attack, a dodge and a cover mechanic to take down waves of robots and cyborgs. Gameplay gets overwhelming in a hurry as you have to deal with bullet hell levels of suppressive fire unless  you can crowd control in a hurry. The game also incourages speed running as most levels can be completed in ~60-90 seconds and you're graded based on your completion time. Once you finish the 25 levels you unlock 25 harder bonus missions to take on as well. Toss in some achievements that require you to complete levels certain ways and there's a lot of challenging old school replayability here. Game can be frustrating due to some brutally hard enemy patterns and the autoaim mechanic not being able to lead targets that are moving or obscured by cover. Also if you play it for several hours you may experience pain holding RB+A the entire time so remember to take a break now and then. All in all a fantastic Wild Guns like game.", "timestamp_created": 1517783491, "timestamp_updated": 1517783610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39853708": {"recommendationid": "39853708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158407336", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517879589}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this game when it was super cheap and i've had a total blast with it!", "timestamp_created": 1517780404, "timestamp_updated": 1517780404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39801076": {"recommendationid": "39801076", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994593631", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517609140}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0413\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e, \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e, \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u041d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c!", "timestamp_created": 1517609324, "timestamp_updated": 1517609324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39757603": {"recommendationid": "39757603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002651559", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517440154}, "language": "french", "review": "It is good but it hurts !", "timestamp_created": 1517441418, "timestamp_updated": 1517441418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39718005": {"recommendationid": "39718005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013513985", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1521246506}, "language": "english", "review": "good arcade game,  just so you know it's one of those games that has hectic stages that only last about 1 min but it takes you 10 min to learn to survive and thrive (hell I think i spent that on an early lvl just remembering how to melee.

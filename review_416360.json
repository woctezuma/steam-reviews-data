I really like some aspects of it.\n++ The music is really good, to the point that I actually left the game open to listen to it while doing other things.\n+ About the first third of the game was good. The characters interacted well, the story was good, the jokes were alright (not personally my cup of tea, but fine), and the little investigation puzzles you did were a rather nifty.\n\nThere were also things I personally liked, but I think some people would be mixed on. \n+/- While I personally was not bothered with it, I can see some people really not liking the art in this game. The backgrounds are perfectly fine, but those characters. It's a generic animu style, complete with nonsensical proportions and bad shading.\n+/- The game also has some animations, which I find is another mixed point. The also has that animu style, except now instead of being poorly shaded, it has wonky physics and for some reason has Japanese voice acting. The Japanese is handwaved in game, but that doesn't make less odd. While it is rather cool that the developer included these scenes, I would have been perfectly fine with them being left out.\n+/- Another mixed point in this game is the player's input within the story. Your actions in the game don't change anything about the ending, they only change which character/s you end up with. However, to make up for this, the game has several puzzles, each increasing in difficulty. While I found the puzzles a nice tradeoff, I can see people really not liking the lack of player induced change. Also, while almost all of the puzzles were good, I found the very last puzzle more tedious then challenging.\n\nThere was even something that, while I personally didn't like it, I could see someone else liking it.\n-/+ The CGs in the game I did not like at all. They, for me, crossed that line from being animu but fine to looking like DeviantArt trash. Proportions were completely off, to the point that Max's spine looked broken in most of them. Sometimes the characters in the CG looks little to nothing like the characters that are meant to be in them. However, if you can look past those two things, then they are rather nicely detailed, colored, and shaded.\n\nHowever, there was one thing that made this game unbearable. [spoiler]Around the point that Max's apartment flooded/burned[/spoiler] or about 1/3 of the way through the game, the entire thing became completely unenjoyable. I enjoyed this part the game so little that everything wrong with the game at that point was a major issue.\n- What happened to the humor? It turned from a mix of deadpan, referential jokes with a mild hit of random/stupid humor to being [b]entirely[/b] random and stupid with the occasional deadpan joke thrown in. This got to the point where there is an entire sequence where the only thing going on and the only joke occurring is that Max thinks that a cardboard cutout is really a person. Why did you do this? I at least found the first part's humor harmless. Now I just want to hit all of the characters (well, mainly Max).\n- [spoiler]Also [b]why is everyone sexing[/b]? Max, Brad, and Ethen will no matter who you\u2019re going for, as do Holly and Ember, and Victoria and obvious villain number 1. I have no qualms with multiple relationships at once, no that's not the issue. First off, if you go for Brad/Ethen, you have to have a scene with the both of them, and if you go for Holly/Ember/Victoria, you have to have the scene with Ethen and Brad. So, I hope you wanted Max to get with Ethen and/or Brad. Second, while Max/Brad/Ethen was hinted at, and Victoria's was hinted at, Holly/Ember is not, leading me to believe that their scene was added as fan service. Thirdly, all of these events happen/ are repeatedly brought up at in the same sequence, which makes them all really off putting no matter what.[/spoiler]\n- Because of the two points above, all of the characters are ruined, as they do basically nothing else.\n- The entire story is also frequently derailed due to this.\n- The ending contains a not really twist that I predicted.\n- The very ending contains a stupid joke they decided to make an animation for because...reasons.\n\nDue to the latter portion of the story, I cannot recommend this game. The good parts are mostly ruined by the bad. If you can get the game for ten dollars or less, then it might be worth it, but even that's a stretch.", "timestamp_created": 1501136526, "timestamp_updated": 1504249831, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33736302": {"recommendationid": "33736302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160204240", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514713041}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "this game is somthing but i think need in my oppinon that it should show some charaters from the other game but overall it was ok wasn't the best but should have show wat happenes later  lets see if there a continuation hope there is this game is god grafic are good but animation need some work but its fine", "timestamp_created": 1500785854, "timestamp_updated": 1500785854, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33439709": {"recommendationid": "33439709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043807220", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500280212}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this game.

I use that term advisedly, because that's what it is. It's not a game, per se. It's a story with a set beginning and a largely concrete end. There are puzzles, and objectives, but it's only a question of doing them well or doing them poorly. You can't skip them.\n\nSo, what's here that's worth your time? The art is quite good. I understand it may not be to everyone's tastes, but I enjoyed the artistic direction of the project. The writing is excellent, though slightly slapdash at parts. The animation, when there is animation, is top notch. The characters are strong and well-defined, except when they aren't, which is usually for the sake of humor. \n\nThere is one gag towards the end that relies both on the static animation and the fact you probably haven't given a particular character much thought that I thought quickly redeemed whatever flaws there were here, so I'm certainly pleased. It's a fast game, if you let it be. You could easily get sucked into the writing and spend hours at each decision point, trying to obtain more of it.\n\nNow, a few words about the... let's say content, might not go amiss here. Yes, it involves a full-scale magical sex change. Two, in fact. The story, insofar as it takes a stance, could also be described as sex positive. There's a great deal of sexual content and innuendo. Outright nudity? That I didn't see, though that's not to say it's not there. You can tell at a glance  up therewhat the usual 'level' might be.\n\nSoundtrack is... basic? Very basic? It seems to be largely stock music, and it was probably the weakest part of the game for me. Since there's no speaking outside of the animated sequences, you could easily play with the speakers off and your own music on.

I watched all of her current episodes and I thought that this was the funniest game I've ever seen. I could not stop myself from laughing at all of the jokes. One of my favorite parts of the game was when Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme was referenced in the final trivia. I laughed my ass off. Though 'The boobcalypse' is probably the best name for an event such as what happened. [spoiler] I guess they are going to call the tentical monster attack 'The Great Groping'.\t[/spoiler] Anyways, I thought it was a great game with good art, good animations, and some of the best comedy I've seen in past few years. Well honestly though I don't play too many games with that much comedy in it, but that's besides the point. I would highly recommend this game.

I have, however seen enough to get a grip on the story and the way the game plays. I got this game for review exclusively for The Hidden Levels. The Publisher/Developer provided a review key. My opinions are, as always, my own.\n\nI'm recommending this, not because it's flawless (it isn't), or that I know the dev (I don't), or even because I think the anime girls are cute (I do). It's a well-assembled game that the Dev obviously cares about, and that's a Good Thing. It gets points for not doing the standard thing with the gameplay, having the cute animu style, and for a somewhat different take on the gender-bending thing. \n\nNow, about those flaws: The early part of the story, in which they establish the character of Max and the way he operates [i]before[/i] being turned into a busty blonde, can get more than a little confusing. Max and Brad are part of a tiny department of the local police force whose role doesn't seem to make a while lot of sense. There are already divisions of most police forces that do the things that this one \"elite\" force does-- why that sort of overlap? \n\nA couple of hours in, and I still don't have a solid answer to that. In a Crapsack World, one would expect that major drug operations would be undertaken by Vice, and murders by Homicide. \n\nSeveral other bits of story stand out in similar ways, all of which are dropped nearly immediately or handwaved away as Normal, or at least not out of the ordinary. Some things, like transformatives, are in fact common enough that there are methods available to reverse them-- albeit rather expensive ones. \n\nThe investigation game after that is rather interesting, and here's one of the places where the game shines-- you will want to use those neurons to solve the cases Max has to deal with during the bulk of the game. You CAN brute-force your way through, but a lighter hand and some logic will serve you in better stead. \n\nThe other thing that I really did like were the little animated cutscenes. They could have been rendered a bit better, I think, but they make for a nice touch to punctuate high points in the game. \n\nMuch as I was down on the story, there are several high points: Max's reaction to being transformed was hilarious, while seeming mostly natural-- He didn't like what happened to him, but appears to get over it... Eventually. Captain Nekorai, on the other hand, has been modified a-purpose with cat ears and a tail-- which he adores. He swears the story is about him, when in fact he's the occasional walk-on cameo and boss for the gang. \n\nI still want to know what exactly he does with that disco ball...", "timestamp_created": 1472953385, "timestamp_updated": 1472960467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518522", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25137597": {"recommendationid": "25137597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021819410", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497558439}, "language": "english", "review": "HAH, now I was bored.

a separate computer so I'm assuming it didn't keep track of it.\n\nI became interested in this game to do rpgminx's playthrough of it. After watching her, I knew I had to get my hands on it myself. Buying this is a decision I do not regret. I have not played (nor watched gameplays of) many genderbender games, but this one has lured me in and set the bar for any others I might play in the future.\n\nI played all the yuri love interest routes, being a lesbian, and each one I loved for different reasons. Ember's was sweet and somewhat amusing, due to Max's naivety. Holly's was surprisingly romantic, and her personality actually reminds me of myself (whether that is a good thing or not, though. . .). Victoria's was flat out amusing, but also affectionate when it came to the art. Speaking of. . .\n\nThe art is lovely. The animations surprised me when I was watching rpgminx's playthrough, and it made me want to play it all the more because that is not something you see in a typical visual novel, or so my experience of them says, anyways.\n\nI like how Max's situation with his/her flipped gender is dealt with. [i] He [/i] (and I say that for a reason, at least in the beginning) is very upset and resistant to being turned into a girl. It's not immediate acceptance, and it's actually his primary concern - he wants to turn back into a man. Even when he starts becoming more of a [i] she [/i], Max stills talks about returning to his original gender, although I believe she's actually embraced her new form (or at least I hope) and is now content with her body.\n\nThe characters are actually pretty far from bland, even the background characters. I have a fondness for all of them, even if that fondness mostly shows up in the form of irritation for a certain panda. . . They're pretty unique and can amuse you. Sometimes the situation can build and I'll be struck by how tense the scenario actually is.\n\nThe investigation scenes can actually require some thought, but they're not ridiculously complex or anything like that. Trivia is something I wasn't expecting, but I enjoy those parts too.\n\nThe only thing I would say that actually detracts from the game is the grammar - there are a few mispellings, typos, and what seems to be absent words, but in all honesty these are pretty far apart and don't interrupt the flow too much or confuse you, so it's easily ignored.\n\nIf I had to rate it, it's an actual 10/10 despite that little issue. I had a lot of fun with this and I'm looking forward to more as soon as more comes out.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1470882012, "timestamp_updated": 1470882012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500120", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24512919": {"recommendationid": "24512919", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994642454", "num_games_owned": 919, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484732536}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, for starters I would say that I have really enjoyed what I have played of this story so far despite the fact that I did end up playing most of it with Offline mode turned on. The reason being offline with it is that I'm pretty sure my friends would be a bit like \"What the heck are you playing\" or something along those lines. But I digress, for me it has been pretty fun so far and I admit that it was not really what I had been expecting. \n\nFor starters, there are parts of it where you are actually talking to characters and collecting information in order to solve number of cases, and to work your way through situations. I didn't know the game had this in it as a feature so it was a pleasent surprise for me. For me it was pretty simple to do them, but it was fun none the less.\n\nThe next part of it that I wan't expecting was about how wacky some of the characters and their personalities are. I got a kick out of how silly the Police captain is and I did find some of the bad guys you encounter to be pretty funny as well. \n\nSadly though, I have progressed to the current end of what is available to play so I am left in suspense as to what Max will \nencounter until more content updates come around. Luckily, there are mulitple numbers of story routes that I can play through to learn and find out more of what is going with the characters and how they fit into things. :)\n\nI do recommend giving this game a shot if you like visual novels with fun and interesting plot twists and a bit of mystery. So far not everything is as it seems.\n\nA little note to the developers if you happen to read this:\nI really hope there is more that is going to happen at Coffee Shrine, the things that go on there really make my day. :D\nAnd I really liked the hair color.

Im Gegensatz zu den Klassischen Visual Novels, gibt es bei diesen Spiel jedoch kleine R\u00e4tsel, welche das Spiel zus\u00e4tzlich auflockern.\nWie die meisten (guten) Visual Novels, hat das Spiel durch verschiedenen Entscheidungen, welche der Spieler im verlauf der Handlung f\u00e4llt, einen hohen Wiederspielwert.\n\nWer die Geschichte von \u201eLached up Games\u201c verfolgt sollte wissen, dass die Entwickler gerne mit den Narrativen-Elementen des Geschlechterwechsel und \u201eKemonomimi\u201c (menschliche Figuren mit Tiermerkmalen), arbeiten. In bester \u201eVisual-Novel Tradition\u201c kommen dabei auch Erotische Anspielungen nicht zu kurz. (sind wir ehrlich sie machen einen nicht unerheblichen Teil des Humors aus) \n\n\u201e Jedermanns Geschmack\u201c sind die Geschichten der Autoren sicher nicht. Handwerklich ist in meinen Augen wenig an der Geschichte auszusetzen. ( Wobei sie auch sicher keine Literaturpreise gewinnt). Die Geschichte ist Fl\u00fcssig erz\u00e4hlt, wobei einige wiederkehrende Charaktere noch etwas blass bleiben, was sich aber nat\u00fcrlich noch \u00e4ndern kann.\n\nIn \"Max\u00b4s Big Bust\" steht der Polizist Max, im Mittelpunkt der Geschichte. Max lebt in einer Welt, in der sich Menschen in Kemonomimi\u00b4s auf Medizinischem Weg verwandeln lassen, um aus der Masse hervorzutreten, z.b. um mehr Menschen in das eigene Cafe zu locken.\nBei einem Einsatz gegen ein Bande Drogendealer, kommt er durch Zufall in Kontakt mit einem kleinen runden Objekt, welches ihn in eine Frau verwandelt.\n \nAuch technisch, ist an \"Max\u00b4s Big Bust\"wenig zu meckern. Die Zeichnungen sind qualitativ gut, ebenso die (noch wenigen) Animationen, auch wenn sie sich noch nicht mit den gro\u00dfen Japanischen Studios f\u00fcr Visual Novels messen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nAktuell (14.2.2016) betr\u00e4gt der Umfang von Max\u00b4s Big Bust, ungef\u00e4hr 3 Stunden Spielzeit f\u00fcr den ersten Durchlauf, und ich habe gerne auch ein zweites mal das Spiel gespielt.\nDas Spiel wird aktuell Monatlich erweitert. \n30\u20ac sind eine Menge Geld, und ich kann das Spiel bei aller liebe nicht uneingeschr\u00e4nkt empfehlen, doch unterst\u00fctze ich in diesem Fall gerne die Entwickler. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1455477568, "timestamp_updated": 1455477568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21197090": {"recommendationid": "21197090", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994581058", "num_games_owned": 1441, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512007115}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game involving transformations, primarily focusing on guy to girl.  Though animal ears and tails are pretty prevalent too.  If you dont care for that kind of stuff you should probably just move on, because though there is more than that to this game it is the central theme.\n\nThe main character is a Police Officer working in an elite unit tasked with taking down a new drug, MinX.  Through a bit of stupidity, the character gets turned into a girl.  This is a world were people can buy drugs to alter their appearance so it's not considered a big deal.\n\nYou have the standard romance options with the people you work with.   You also have some detective type puzzles to work through, which i rather enjoyed.  Other than that there's alot of dialog to go through and it feels very well written.  I rather got to enjoy the characters in the story.  The game world itself is an extension of another game, \"Gender Bender DNA Twister Extreme\".  As a result the game worlds lore actually has some depth to it, though its mostly only hinted at here.  I'm not sure but i think this game picks up a year or two after the last one ended, and in a different city.  You will see some return characters though.\n\nSimply put, this game is better than its predecessor.  Or at least i think so, sure you don't get to jump around characters like before and see their different angles of the story.  But, this game seems like it will ultimately be larger and already has more variety of actions, namely the detective style puzzles and i'm hoping they do more with the mini game on your phone.  Regardless, if you liked the previous game get this.  If you thought it was lacking a bit, get this.  If you hated it, don't get this.  And if you have no idea about the other game ask yourself two questions.  Do i want to play a date sim style game?  Can i tolerate transformations that include gender change?\n\nThe only thing i didn't really care for was the serious lack of variation on the characters picture's.

Wow, I sure feel that I got what I paid for!\nSo after running the game from beginning to the current end, I have to say that I am not disappointed at all!\n\nThe plot (scroll down to my review below to avoid spoilers)\nThe plot is apparently set in the near-future, where it's been popular with transformation-gas and half human-half animal surgeries and stuff. The technology is quite similar to current, with taser-weapons as regular non-lethal weaponry, normal TVs, cars on wheels and trains still on tracks etc. The gender-transformation is apparently still in its early days with a few biproducts (like lactose-intolerance being a biproduct of cat-ears). Our protagonist however, is a young police officer with about three years of experience. He and his partner, Brad, are part of a department that deals with drugs and stuff and they are currently trying to deal with a new sort of drug called MinX. During their first dispatch, our protagonist ends up having a \"tiny\" bit of an accident and ends up as a woman. Now, for all of you that came here just for that par, I can promise you that he's not the only one that ends up having to deal with a female body... *giggle*\n\nNow, here's my veiw on other features in the series:\n\nMusic/sound\nI like the music and sound effects, but I miss being able to hear voices and possible have a on/off function of this. What I think would be great is if one could choose between having the characters speak or not. I like the game, but it's a shame when I have to read things 2-3 times because I can't seem to register what I read (this often happens when I'm feeling a bit tired, and that I do often). I also think this could help making the game differ more from other visual novels.\n\nAnimation\nThis part I feel should be separated in two parts: the animated scenes and the regular scenes.\n\nI have to say that I love the scene from the trailer. However I have been playing for 6 hours and only at the current end did I get to enjoy a new, short animation that looked quite similar to the last one. To be honest I feel a bit disappointed. I would very much love to see action or comedy-packed scenes receive even just a short scene now and then. Especially special scenes containing unique situations or characters. It would give the game more interesting content that adds to the regular content.\n\nFor the regular content I want to make one thing clear; NEVER use a picture of the character that doesn't fit in with the action. It's important with variation to ensure that it doesn't look cheap and poorly made. So if a character is bloody, it is bloody, and if a character got ther gender swapped and they have a belt to their pants, they won't try to hold them in place with one hand all the way to their boss's office and then all the way home. Besides,  a womans waist is wider than a mans, and hence it doesn't add up that the protagonist lose his pants (and not the underwear?) when turned into a woman. But enough of that pricky stuff. Overall aside from these few things, the content is good-looking and most of the time it fits well into the situation.\n\nTexting\nI've found some, but very few errors to the texting. So far I guess I have only found places where words are missing, so I just add them in my mind when reading the sentence a second time. It would be nice to see these minor errors corrected, but it's not something that would need to be prioritized at this stage. It may actually be a good thing, as the reader has to stop and read one more time to get the whole picture. It creates a pause and a difference, and it certainly gets the reader's attention back a little. As long as it's only happening 4-5 times in like 6 hours of content, it's not something to get all worked up about.\n\ninteraction with the game\nI simply love how one can affect the game with multiple choices and this should definitely have a continued focus throughout the development. Even though it's a story-based game it should give the player the possibility to interact and affect the game, and even though I haven't really got to test this out much, I have to say that it's still a bit funny. In my case I'm a justice-person so I have an issue with accusing the wrong suspect and stuff like that, in fear of getting both the hard-working protagonist and an innocent in trouble... But I did get an opportunity to run away from a certain cute-girl loving maniac that eventually stunned/tazed the protagonist and dragged her to a swimsuit shop... it was quite funny actually...\n\nAnd that's it for my review! Personally I don't think I'm the right person to set a \"grade\" on stuff, but in my case I would say 8/10. As the game is not finished yet, my estimate is only for the content so far, not for the finished product.", "timestamp_created": 1451571303, "timestamp_updated": 1451571328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20069491": {"recommendationid": "20069491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025683153", "num_games_owned": 815, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481179890}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay so this is a review as of V4.1, the bugfix version of 4.0. To start off, i'll admit part of the main reason I like this game so much is the theming, I find TG to be very fun, and when big boobs and long hair is involved? You know i'm there. Now, aside from that, my bias aside, this is shaping up to be a very solid game so far, it has the makings of what could be an amazing product easily. It has a ton of diffirent characters already and theres a pretty, admitedly silly, yet deep plot. The options you get are very varried. Despite only being V4, it already has many many many hours of replayability thanks to all the choices you can make. In further addition to that, it's not just a straight up VN Dating Sim style game, it actually lives up to it's name as a cop game. In V4 there is already two pretty intriguing puzzles, they're not exactly super complex, but they can take some figuring out and are pretty enjoyable. Overall, pre bias i'd give the game a solid 8/10 in it's current state of development, even if you're not really into the TG scene you can easily find things to enjoy in this game as it's comedy gold and has a solid plot with really interesting characters.", "timestamp_created": 1451399188, "timestamp_updated": 1451399188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554510", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19582849": {"recommendationid": "19582849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145055020", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487243591}, "language": "english", "review": "Max's Big Bust is a Life Sim/Visual Novel that begs to differ from others.

The progression of the story and the dialogues feel smooth and natural, and the characters' reactions feel understandable and not overly exaggerated or cheesy. I also love the variety of locations, background musics, and their transitions for different moods. I must say it's also quiet immersive and interactive with the puzzles and the investigation minigames and different choices for building love relationships with interesting choice of partners in a universe of fantasy filled with interesting anime characters in terms of both appearance and personality and TG possibilities men like me would die for.

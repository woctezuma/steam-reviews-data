On her great adventure she must make friends and enemies alike while overcoming various challenges by cooking and fighting/hunting.\n*Insert Shia Labeouf meme here*\n\nThe gameplay is a mixture of rpg/sidescrolling/platformer/poyopoyo/puzzler/beat'em up elements. Matches consist of hunting, gathering and cooking.\nHunting/fighting is really basic beat 'em up styled combat with various moves like neutrals and directional combos like up-X or down-Y. \"Beauty in simplicity\" as the game would describe. While hunting you gather incredients to make your dishes once enough you get to cook.\nCooking is a matching puzzlegame where basic rule is match 3 of the same to advance taste gems to bigger levels adding flavour and points to you dish. While doing all this you must have a theme incredient in your dish or points will be detucted from your dish also you must appeal 1 to 3 judges with diffirent tastes. All this under a timelimit, trust me you will be on serious pressure once you get to the 1-5 minute marks and you haven't even stared on the dishes. Just like in real kitchens where EVERY second counts.\nYou can buy cookware, cooking aids and combat aids to make your hunting and cooking easier. My favourite combo of cookwares allways included of a combopan, a cutting board and an slowcooker oven.\n\nOverall gameplay feels solid with customizable and tight controlls and matches are just enough difficult.\n\nThis game also features voiceacting on the main storylines, which is understandable. Not all sidelines need to be spoken. IMO voiceacting could've used teeny-tiny bit more depth.\n\nVisually Battle Chef Brigade is very pleasing to the eyes with hand drawn characters and backgrounds. Music in this game is also very good but nothing too fancy. Just enough of... that something.\n\nAbsoletulely great game with amazing visuals, music and gameplay elements with challenges and daily events.

Knees weak, palms were sweaty during the Final Three.\n\nAs is though, the game is extremely satisfying from start to finish, but it's hard to convince myself to play through it again. As I said, the campaign is very heavily story driven. There's a lot of obligatory puzzles and \"adventures\" you have to do which weren't as satisfying for me. And I don't want to slog through those just to get to the good parts again.\n\nThe Daily Battles are nice, but it's not the same as being in an actual elimination tourney.\n\nDefinitely try this game though. Seriously. Surprisingly cool and addicting, loveable characters, great art, fun and holy crap surprisingly challenging too. It starts all coy and shit, then suddenly the clock starts ticking and you've got 3 judges waiting for a perfect meal and you just got thrown into a map you've never been before with monsters and ingredients you've never seen before and it's like \"AAAAAAAAAAA--\"\n\nOn that note, an encyclopedia with all the ingredients you've encountered or will encounter would've been nice too. So you can prepare at least a little before being thrown into the ring again. There's a practice kitchen, but it only has one of the areas. But that's a minor gripe.

I do not think the game is currently worth full price, more on that below.\n\nThe core gameplay I really do enjoy. The mix of sidescrolling brawler and match-3 puzzle gameplay is very well done with decent mechanics on both ends that also come together very well. The game has a good selection of items used in both hunting and cooking, and the selection of theme ingredients, judges and hunting grounds for each duel keeps your tactics from going stale like might expect when you know what gems you get from what monsters. You buy some items for currency earned in mini-games between duels, and beating duels awards you items based on your opponents, the order of which you choose. The game's atmosphere and art style are well crafted and tie the experience together thematically. These are my reasons for choosing the \"positive\" review stance. I like the base game experience that much.\n\nThat said, the game isn't quite perfectly balanced to maintain proper diversity of gameplay. Towards the end of it, cheese tactics do emerge. Not ones involving actual cheese, the game is more about meat and plants, mind you. But a combination of a certaing cookware piece, inventory item and plant makes the final duel of the game (and the score-related achievements) incredibly easy on normal difficulty, which the game is balanced for. The \"adaptive\" rubber-banding aspect of the normal difficulty means that beating the game in general doesn't require very much skill, and indeed two achievements in the game require feats of self-sabotage that this system allows if you just overload it with defeats. And if you wish to just test yourself by taking suboptimal gear, the game's save system doesn't allow you to capture the moment, as the save is overwritten with every finished match (lowering difficulty but not advancing on defeats) and there are no in-game means of copying saves, so playing against the same opponent repeatedly will just weaken that opponent until you beat them anyway. The rigid save system and the rubber-banding difficulty stop you from challenging yourself unless you go to the hard mode, which is often just too hard to play suboptimally. This overall hurts the game's built-in replayability potential.\n\nAnd replay it you should, because beyond the campaign, which took me about 12 hours going slowly and watching all the plot bits, the game currently doesn't have much content. There's no endgame as such, your save will just point to the final duel. There's no multiplayer, though the game's mechanics would support a split-screen mode very well. There are no custom games. There are only a couple mini-game \"challenges\" and a daily duel mode with a single fully configured duel where all you get to choose is your character (one of two, and it only affects your moveset in the hunting parts). The main way to get more enjoyment out of the game after first beating the campaign is to just restart it and pick different opponents when the game allows you to. The story, while a very nice addition, is mostly there to tie duels together and doesn't really carry the game like its core mechanics do. In this state, the game is in my opinion not worth $20. If and when it gets a multiplayer update, I will immediately remove this review and get my friends to buy this, but as it is be prepared to get a bit less then you might expect.\n\nP.S. Played with a controller. Can't speak for default keyboard bindings.\n\nP.P.S. Beyond the prices just being generally lower in CIS, they're also not proportional to western prices.

Fortunately it's worth it as a puzzle-heavy cooking game with a light (well, kind of mediocre) set of action games.  Fun characters and a joyful spirit really bring it to life.\n\nSo Battle Chef Brigade is pretty much \"hunt monsters in a simple side-scrolling action setting, then cook up the ingredients in a puzzle type game.\"  I've summed up the game in its entirety, but it doesnt quite do it justice.\n\nThe core plot element of the game is simple - in a fantasy world overrun with monsters, people solved the problem by eating them.  Many chefs are now deadly ninjas, wizard, alchemists, warriors AND cooks.\n\nIt's when the two of these come together that the game comes to life.\n\nYou  play as Mina, a young warrior-chef who spends a lot of time cooking in her family's restaurant, and occasionally mass-murdering wildlife for ingredients.  She hopes to join the Battle Chef Brigade to cook unknown dishes, travel the world, and so on.  Of course nothing goes as plans, so as the plot ramps up Mina faces various challenges and hardships as dangers rear their head, monsters become aggressive, plans are afoot, AND worse of all, FOOD MAY BE RUINED.\n\nThe game is two parts:\n* You go into a side-scrolling area and beat up monsters for ingredients.  This is a simple actioner, mostly based on timing and abilities, and it can get mashy.\n* Cooking, which is a matching puzzle, but that varies with ingredients, equipment, and other factors.  This takes some thought.\n\nIn general, you go and mash monsters, then make stuff.  Sometimes you have to make multiple trips, murdering monsters while things cook in your slow cooker.  I am in no way making this up - you walk back into the kitchen with monster parts and then check on your souffle.  This is done with a total straight-facedness that is delightful.\n\nIn some levels you may wander around a town, take jobs to hone your skills, and buy equipment.  These introduce you to various fun characters and wild pieces of equipment like magical pots and mysterious cookbooks.\n\nAll of this is tied together with a truly interesting cast of characters, from a loveable Orc Dad cook to a cool and collected mystic - and again, with a straight face.  It feels like a playable manga or anime, down to the style and the ability to take crazy ideas and make them work.\n\nIf there's a flaw in the game its that some of it feels simplified or stripped-down, and I get the general sense a few things were cut.  It's an ambitious endeavor, so I can see why some focus was needed.  \n\nWho's it for:\n* Well again if \"Iron Chef meets Fantasy\" trips your trigger you probably bought it already.\n* If you like a fun actiony- genre fusion, you'll enjoy it.\n* If you like puzzles AND don't mind some actioner, boy this has got what you need (the game could probably have left the action out).\n* If you're into trying different stylish fusions of ideas.", "timestamp_created": 1514162960, "timestamp_updated": 1514162974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38629987": {"recommendationid": "38629987", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987741708", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 335, "last_played": 1514136087}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, combines genres that you dont expect to work.

The hunting is done in a brawler-style fighting system and the cooking is visualized through the aforementioned match-3 puzzle system.\n\nThe art style of the game is very colourful and sprightly and the animations of the various characters / monsters while occasionally feeling a bit sparse, are generally very well drawn and sometimes even good for a chuckle. The voices of the various characters are also quite well done; I especially liked whoever is doing the voice of Pontida, the main area's restaurant proprietor, which had a very charming accent.\n\nAll in all I would definitely recommend Battle Chef Brigade to anyone who is either a fan of brawlers, match-3 games or just likes the premise of the game as described above. I for one certainly have enjoyed my time with this game very much and it's not often that I find myself starting another run on a higher difficulty setting after completing a game, yet Battle Chef Brigade motivated me to do so immediately. Here's hoping we may eventually get another installment in this franchise, I would certainly love to see more of this game.", "timestamp_created": 1513711878, "timestamp_updated": 1513744597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38423356": {"recommendationid": "38423356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031356639", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1513656193}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an absolute blast, with the best mechanics I've ever seen in a cooking game, fun characters, and an engaging story.

Fun story \n2. Likeable characters \n3. Innovative backstory (Chefs who hunt monsters instead of monster hunters who cook) \n4. An easy-to-learn-rewarding-to-master 3 match system\n5. The whole game is beautifully hand drawn.\n\nthe bad:\n1. The controls are wierd and unintuitive (cant rebind them afaik).\n2. The game is fairly short (9-10 hours).\n3. The combat can feel pretty bad at times.\n\nIts flaws are mostly from a lack of polish, but if you can look past them you'll have a really fun time on your hands. Which due to its length is a shame because my biggest gripe with the game is that I just want to experience more of what it offers. It does have a daily cook-off challenge if you want to do those, but it feels like it lacks the same tension as the story battles.\n\n\nTl;dr: Fun game that is worth it at full price even if its a bit short.

with a videogame. But I get to say it this time!\n\nBattle Chef Brigade is very much more than the sum of its parts. Mainly combining match-3 puzzling with brawler platforming, BCB is clearly somewhat inspired by the cooking and alchemy sections of the PS2 game Odin Sphere, but... with a much tighter focus. Consisting largely of a linear series of cooking battles, you go out and slay monsters to collect their drops, which then become match-3 game pieces to use in the kitchen. The goal is to satisfy judges who prefer a particular ingredient type and color, though you can collect various other scoring goals based on cookbooks you unlock. There are two characters with their own techniques - Mina and Thrash - but you'll be playing Mina for the most part. There are also fixed match-3 puzzle segments, hunting levels where you're just assigned X monsters to defeat, and speed puzzling where you have to create certain color combos. There's special moves to unlock, and a limited number of slots for upgrades means you're forced to focus on a particular strategy or playstyle instead of just getting flatly better.\n\nIndividually some of these segments would be weak, but BCB is changing gears often enough that it's hardly a concern, since you're rarely focusing on any one particular segment. The 2D sprites and music are well-done, though the animation is more than a little lacking at points. While you're not likely to notice in the frantic cooking battles, it becomes startlingly obvious outside of them. While the voicework is generally strong, there are a few voices that sound more amateurish... though, once again, the game is often switching gears often enough that it's hard to dwell too long on the flaws. While the story is middling, the characters really do bring it to life, and I'd love to see more with this particular cast in a more engaging tale.\n\nLargely, it feels like a great start and proof of concept, and I'd love to see the team get a sequel to flesh it out more.

While it doesn't dive particularly deep into each of its aspects, the overall experience is enjoyable and plays better in shorter sessions. A little bit of platforming, a little bit of gem-matching quasi-puzzler, a little bit of VN-style interaction. It might be a little too casual for some, but this is more a moreish light snack than a heavy steak dinner. Not to all tastes, but a nice pick-me-up kind of game.\n\nFull Detail :\nAs the story goes, during a great famine that threatened the many fantasy races of the game, talented individuals with their collective frontier spirits decided to hunt and cook the hostile creatures of their realm, both protecting their people and sustaining them during the tragedy. Many years later, a great philanthropic academy had been erected and spread its influence through the lands, offering not only martial support, aid in justice matters and research into strange arcane subjects, but also in world cuisine and therefore cultural exchange even where the politics are raw and severe.\n\nYour character aspires to join that academy, but is a hopeless (if talented) layabout stuck helping in her parents cafe. The lighthearted and humorous approach works wonders here, and the game opens up with its more visual-novel aspect. Walking around, talking to NPCs, getting a few chuckles out of the interactions. It becomes a regular staple between action sections, and lets you cool off and save your progress.\n\nThe action itself is simple but surprisingly refreshing. Matters are frequently settled using cook-offs in the style of the Iron Chef TV series, using themed ingredients from the world around you. Your cookery is measured in a miniature match-puzzle game, where each ingredient added to your dish actually adds colored gems into the playing field, which you then stir by rotating them in a mobile 2x2 selection area. Matching them causes the gems to condense into a single gem of a higher level, and each gems color represents a different style of flavor represented by one of the elements. For example, fire elements are typically meaty, spicy and powerful flavors, earth elements are moreish, grounding, dense or uh... earthy, whereas water elements are refreshing, salty, lighter. The game also introduces some extra tiles for a hazard effect, but all of which can be converted into bonuses if you don't rush your stirring of them.\n\nThe collection of ingredients itself is a platforming segment that you can freely dip into during the cookery duels, where the monsters typically don't want to go down easy. That might not be such a problem for harmless little cyclopian chickens or even large carnivorous snapping plants, but if your themed ingredient is dragon... heh. Yeah.\n\nAll in all, the games elements come together nicely. While each part isn't particularly in-depth or as satisfying as other games which only do a single thing, Battle Chef Brigade has a cheerful heart and soul to it that would be perfect for those who don't like to spend consecutive hours in their gaming sessions. Heavy gamers might complain about the missed potential for really digging deep into the system they set up, and there are some tiny rough edges that let us peek into the games crowdfunded roots, but I can only give this game a thumbs up. Thinking back, I'm also certain it is family friendly, even if the difficulty curve wouldn't let the youngest gamers get anywhere.\n\nI really hope they patch in some more characters for the free play. Heck, I'd pay for story DLC just to see more of the characters. Though I did get this at a slight discount due to backing the original kickstarter, so my sense of value for this title is offset slightly.

A simple concept of cooking battles was taken to a wonderful extreme in this game. The fact that the game becomes something of a beat-em-'up/hack-and-slash as you go out into the wilderness and hunt for the ingredients you'll be cooking with is brilliant. \n\nThe act of cooking itself is simple, but in a good way. It doesn't feel like it's a mechanic that takes up any more time than it should. The match-3 style to get the perfect flavor out of your dish is easy to get the hang of, and fun from start to finish.\n\nThe artstyle of this game is simply beautiful, and I truly compliment the people in charge of the art. The soundtrack is perfect for this game, and the voice acting, while having a few hiccups here and there in my opinion, is extremely well done.\n\nMost of all, this game is addictive. The second I bought it, I couldn't put it down until I was finished with the main story. It does an excellent job of pulling you in and keeping you invested the whole way through. \n\nThe cast of characters is one of this game's best highlights, as they all feel unique from each other, in both personality and design. Mina makes for a wonderful protagonist who you want to cheer on the whole way through, and Thrash does just as well as the deuteragonist, as the classic tough guy with a soft heart.\n\nThe supporting characters shine just as much, from the calm and collected personality of Kirin, the gruff and standoffish personality of Cezar, and the jokester, creepy vibe of Ziggy.\n\nHonestly, I can't compliment this game enough, and I highly recommend that anyone who looks at this game with even a remote amount of interest pick it up immediately.

And I do not regret that decision because it was a very fun game to play!\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nThe story is about a girl named Mina from a small village whose dream it is to become a member of the battlechef brigade, an elite group of chefs who kill monsters for food and keep the world safe. She therefore runs away to the city to join the competition which determines who can join the brigade. You have to face-off against chefs to earn your place. And then there is some other storyline which I will not spoil. The story is fun for the biggest part, not too spectacular, but well executed.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nThe game is a sort of weird sounding mix between side-scroller brawling and 3-match game for the cooking part. It sounds weird, but it actually works very well. The 3 match is basically match gems of the same color and they promote to a higher level, match 3 of those again to get the highest level. The 3-match has been changed up a bit to make it more interesting, with fragile parts (cannot move to much or they break) poison parts and upgrading of tiles. Besides that there is several interesting cook-ware you can buy to help you with the game and change some stuff around. For instance there are 2-match pans that only work on 1 kind of gem, but there is also 4-match pans that skip to the highest possible gem quality. There is 3 types of gems and each judge in the competition has different tastes in what they want so that's another thing to keep in mind. The battle aspect it not all that hard, there is basically one challenging enemy in it as far as I'm concerned. I didn't mind that it wasn't overly complicated though I liked the focus to be on the cooking part. \n\n[b]Art[/b]\n\nThe thing that attracted me to this game most was the art. It is beautifully drawn with good character design as well as world design. And the food looks delicious! It is not all extremely detailed but I think that's part of the charm. It just looks colorful and vibrant and i absolutely love it.\n\n[b]Music/sound/voice acting[/b]\n\nThe music I think is well done. The main song is constantly hanging around in my head. It fits the atmosphere really well, and sounds kind off heroic during battles.  The sounds during the battle are also well done. Especially the clock when time is running out, very stressful! Voice acting is solid, voices fit the characters well.\n\n[b]Few things I would have liked differently[/b]\n\nNote that none of these are dealbreakers just little things I noticed. \nThe difficulty spikes in this game are a bit crazy. Basically it is all pretty easy until you encounter the first set of bosses and then it is a lot harder all of a sudden. I would liked it more to have a more gradual increase in difficulty, just each battle a little bit harder instead of this spike. Besides that it goes down again after these 3 bosses and up again with the final one. It is a bit all over the place. And it does not help with learning to get better.\n\nSecond thing is that they had decided somewhere along the way to make Thrash (one of the other game characters) playable. And they had to sort of implement that into the storyline. So one of the chapters you are all of a sudden playing as Thrash for no good reason. This chapter felt random and weird. Besides that you had lost all the stuff you bought cause it did not carry over. I am all for more playable characters but it would have been more logical to then make a complete seperate campaign for him. I know that may be to much time consuming and expensive but well I would pay for DLC for new storylines with different characters. Now it just feels rushed.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nBesides these two small issues I really enjoyed the game and I may replay it at some point. The art is amazing, gameplay is fun and the food looks delicious. I am a sucker for cooking games but I swear this game is amazing and would really recommend it. I hope they will add more content at some point, I would love a DLC about one of my favorite characters Ziggy!", "timestamp_created": 1512480160, "timestamp_updated": 1512480160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524770", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38072901": {"recommendationid": "38072901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117196622", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "last_played": 1514096194}, "language": "english", "review": "A gem of a game.

It looked like something out of an educational children\u2019s game. Despite that and the initial gameplay starting off simple compared to other puzzle games that I've played, it continued to build on the mechanics as the story progressed along and I realized that it was necessary for it to be that way so the players can properly grasp what it was supposed to be towards the end. To someone not sure if this is going to be fun based on the first few minutes of gameplay, I say don't throw in the towel just yet, because even if it takes it's time to start up, it\u2019s definitely going to be something you're going to be hooked on.\n\nThe gameplay is split into gathering ingredients and using them to create dishes. These two stages of the game gives it diversity and makes it very much layered, giving you many things to do and think about each time you play. Gathering requires you to platform and hunt monsters with your weapons and magic. The Cooking part of the game requires you to use the ingredients you gathered to puzzle out the best dish you can use with your tools and boosts. The customization involved with the items you choose allow you to decide which weapons and boosts to take into battle, what ingredients to gather, and what tools you use to get the job done. The combat is very smooth and feels clean, the abilities are appropriate for the characters and the combos they pull off, never will gathering feel like a tedious part of the game. The cooking part may get a little confusing at the start, but since it\u2019s a puzzle game one can say figuring it out is the fun of it.\n\nBuilt on the gameplay is a cast of characters wonderfully voice acted and taken across a story that fleshes out the universe, really getting you invested in the characters and their adventures in their culinary careers.\n\nThe only lacking part of the game, I feel, is the lack of things to do post-story mode. Surely the developers are working very hard to add more content and expand to this game. So in the meanwhile it\u2019s very worth playing the story mode a few times to satisfy your urge for another round of hunting, gathering, cooking, and the best part of all, serving your completed dishes, glowing with flavor gems to the judges who give you very high scores for your work.\n\nIn conclusion, this is definitely a game that has a little something for everybody. I don\u2019t write reviews for games at all, but I really would like to add one more positive review to this game so that I can make a difference in hopes that a few more people decide to purchase and discover it. People have to buy the game if we\u2019re going to have more of it, and I really do want more, you will too.

The short of it is, this is part platformer where you battle monsters and collect their parts as ingredients, and part match-3 game where you have up to 3 pots, each representing a different match3- grid where you can combine ingredients (colored gems) in order to transform them into more powerful flavor gems.  Some pots will have restrictions like only being able to match red (fire) gems, others will have special abilities like slowly increasing the potency of your gems.\n\nIt really feels like a cooking battle game, and the anime-styled scenes and art remind me strongly of The Legend of Korra (sequel to the Avatar: the Last Airbender series).  I found the story engaging and the characters sympathetic; the voice acting was well done.\n\nOnly downside for me was that I found the timed cooking battles rather harrowing, but you can always come back to them, and about 50-70% or so of the game wasn't under a time limit, so the pressure isn't constantly on.  You can always try a match again as well, if you lose, you're asked if you want a rematch.  Explore the stages and examine the ingredients you can get from the monsters, and the way the monsters interact with loose ingredients-- often they will eat them and then create another ingredient, or metamorphose into a form which gives you a new and better ingredient.

It has compelling gameplay, iteresting characters, and a memorable world.  8.5 out of 10, could use some Quality of Life Stuff.[/b]\n\nBattle Chef Brigade plays like a timed match 3 game, with minor combat and puzzle elements on the side. It has a basic combat system, with a small amount of combos to keep gameplay interesting, although I usually just wound up mashing attack except on the boss monsters like Hydras, Dragons, and that bird thing who's name escapes me. But it wasn't boring, and the combat stays out of the way of the match 3 and score puzzles, which are the game's main draw. Also features a hard mode for advanced players.\n\nThe match 3 itself involves you presenting dishes to the judges. Your dish can be made from fire, water, and earth gems, with the amount of lvl 3 gems of one type determining what type your dish predominantly is. There are also poison and bone gems that you must make sure don't make it into your final dish. The judges will always ask for either one type of gem to be dominant, or several types to have equal representation, and failing to grant their wishes loses you points. The judges will also include an ingredient that MUST be in your dish or you will lose points (although you must hunt the ingredient yourself). So basically, this game is iron chef in game format. Complete with \"Vive Brigade\" instead of \"Allez Cuizine\" as the 'go' phrase.\n\nThe one thing it could use improvement on is some quality of life features. There's no way to check what the combat combos that generate special moves are while in game. At least, not that I've found. I've also never figured out how to get one of the AIs to play a practice match with you (if it's even possible). One QoL feature that is in the game, is that the competitors you face will start to present lower quality dishes to the judges if you lose to them too often.

Mario meets tetris. There is strategy in picking loadouts, tactics in finding the right ingredients and engagging puzzling in making sure it all fits in the same dish.\n\nIt doesn't have a two player verses mode. That is the only thing I desperately want. If this had a matchmade online mode, I would likely give up and play nothing but this. The daily challenge helps with some of that, but I desperately want more. Just up the replayability and feeling of campaign progression and you will have a game that will still be talked about in ten years. Even as it, it made me smile more than any other game this year.\n\nTl:Dr; Best game this year. Genuinely made me smile. Must play.

This is a game that supports its story with its mechanics. While the story it has to tell is full of tropes it is still very enjoyable.\n\nTL;DR\n\n- Playtime: ~8 hours\n- Competent 2D Combat\n- Deceptively complex Matching Puzzles\n- Replayability: At least 2 times (once for Normal, once for Hard)\n- Story: Good enough that I'd have watched\n- It's only 20 USD\n\nCurrent Negatives:\n- Limited Keyboard support (fixes for that should be coming with the first major patch)\n- No versus mode for a \"cook-off\" game\n- No freeplay mode\n\nYou may see the following in other reviews: Sidescroller, Match 3, Anime... and rightly wonder why reviewers are gushing over this fairly short game with seemingly very little replay value. To which I'd suggest [b]watching[/b] any capable reviewer or player doing one cook-off. Like any good dish, if you just look at the ingredients you may question if it will be any good.\n\nIt is important to understand how all the systems mesh together to really understand what's going on. The first major components is the Time Limit. Time managment is constant pressure that impact performance in the other two aspects of play. [b]You need a plan in mind, and need to stick to the plan.[/b]\n\n2D Combat: Is competent. I'd leave it at that. It can sometimes feel a bit unresponsive, however that also feels like over zealous button mashing error. When you play it at a more techincal level it works just fine.

On incarnera \u00e9galement un autre personnage d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 Thrash par intermittence qui cherchera lui aussi \u00e0 atteindre le m\u00eame but. Financ\u00e9 par une campagne Kickstarter, le jeu vient tout juste de d\u00e9barquer sur Nintendo Switch, PC et PS4. Le principe est simple, il nous faudra aller chercher nous m\u00eame les ingr\u00e9dients de nos plats avant de pouvoir les cuisiner dans une partie jeu de combat pour ensuite faire mijoter tout ca dans un sorte de match-3 permettant de faire ressortir des ar\u00f4mes particuliers et des saveurs propres aux diff\u00e9rents membres du jury.\n\nBattle Chef Brigade nous fera vivre une aventure sympathique avec des phases de dialogues, de combats et de cuisine afin de devenir le chef supr\u00eame du royaume. La pr\u00e9sentation est magnifique avec une r\u00e9alisation superbe, une direction artistique au poil et une variation tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able des diff\u00e9rents gameplay qui constituent le moelleux du jeu. On commence par suivre la jeune Mine qui cherche \u00e0 s'\u00e9manciper de son village natal o\u00f9 elle aide sa famille \u00e0 g\u00e9rer un restaurant pour ensuite d\u00e9couvrir l'autre personnage principal du jeu, \u00e0 savoir Thrash. Chaque personnage dispose de son propre \u00e9ventail de coups et ses propres caract\u00e9ristiques ce qui offre un peu de vari\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le gameplay. L'histoire n'est pas fondamentalement rocambolesque mais on appr\u00e9cie tr\u00e8s rapidement les personnages et leur background. Il y a beaucoup de dialogues et pleins d'interactions avec les autres concurrents ce qui est vraiment appr\u00e9ciable, on apprend \u00e0 les connaitre mais aussi \u00e0 les combattre en dehors des ar\u00e8nes.\n\nVous reprendrez bien un peu de dessert?\nLe principe du jeu est assez simple quelle que soit la phase de jeu. Sachez que l'on dispose d'un temps limit\u00e9 global et qu'il faudra bien g\u00e9rer chaque partie afin de ne pas se retrouver \u00e0 court de temps \u00e0 la fin. Les parties de combats nous permettent de faire des attaques simples et fortes mais aussi d'utiliser la magie qui videra de fait notre barre de mana. Il y a des combinaisons de touches \u00e0 connaitre afin de faire le plus de d\u00e9g\u00e2ts possibles aux monstres que l'on va rencontrer. Il faudra \u00e9viter les coups de certains adversaires sous peine de prendre \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de d\u00e9g\u00e2ts et ainsi de ne pas pouvoir aller chercher les meilleurs ingr\u00e9dients du niveau afin de satisfaire l'app\u00e9tit de notre jury d'experts fa\u00e7on TopChef. Une fois les monstres tu\u00e9s, on r\u00e9cup\u00e8re leurs ingr\u00e9dients propres qu'il faudra ensuite amener \u00e0 la cuisine afin des les travailler. Chaque ingr\u00e9dient d\u00e9pend d'un type d'aliment et il faudra bien choisir ce que l'on ram\u00e8nera pour \u00e9viter des m\u00e9langes de saveurs trop originaux. On ne pourra prendre qu'un certain nombre d'ingr\u00e9dients \u00e0 la fois ce qui nous obligera \u00e0 faire des allers-retours entre l'ext\u00e9rieur et la cuisine pour \u00eatre pr\u00eat \u00e0 cuisiner le tout et ainsi passer \u00e0 la seconde phase de gameplay, la cuisine!\n\nLa phase de cuisine ressemble \u00e0 s'y m\u00e9prendre \u00e0 un match-3 mais avec quelques variantes comme des couleurs et ingr\u00e9dients \u00e0 respecter pour avoir un certain gout ou une certaine nuance dans notre plat. Si l'on cherche \u00e0 faire un plat \u00e9pic\u00e9, il faudra \u00e9viter de trop mettre d'ingr\u00e9dients bleu par exemple qui att\u00e9nueront le c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e9pic\u00e9 de notre plat par exemple. On dispose ainsi de plusieurs plats de cuisson dot\u00e9 de certaines caract\u00e9ristiques propres. Ils sont disponibles \u00e0 l'achat dans la boutique de notre g\u00e9ant \u00e0 deux t\u00eates pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 mais il faudra forc\u00e9ment gagner de l'argent pour les acqu\u00e9rir. On peut donc cuisiner 2 ou 3 choses en m\u00eame temps et finir par les m\u00e9langer afin d'obtenir notre plat principal. Chaque ingr\u00e9dient \u00e0 sa forme propre qui pourra rentrer ou non dans notre plat, du coup il faudra parfois jouer \u00e0 Tetris afin de tout faire rentrer en ensuite faire mijoter le tout. Une fois les ingr\u00e9dients \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur, on peut faire une rotation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments vers la droite ou vers la gauche afin d'en combiner 3 identiques et de les faire fusionner en un ingr\u00e9dient de qualit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure. Fusionner ensuite ces m\u00eames ingr\u00e9dients par 3 pour en obtenir un autre d'encore meilleure qualit\u00e9 et ainsi de suite jusqu'\u00e0 obtenir le plat id\u00e9al. Il ne vous restera plus qu'\u00e0 l'amener au jury avant la fin du temps imparti et ensuite voir si votre plat est meilleur!\n\nPetit chef!\nAjoutez donc a tout cela pleins de modes de jeux bonus et de d\u00e9fis quotidiens et vous obtenez une dur\u00e9e de vie \u00e0 point! La r\u00e9alisation est excellente que ce soit sur PC ou sur la Nintendo Switch avec de superbes illustrations et une bande son vraiment prenante qu'il est possible d'acheter \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9. La maniabilit\u00e9 est parfaite sur PC avec quelques b\u00e9mols pour la version Switch avec l'utilisation des boutons L, ZL, R et ZR qui demandera un temps d'adaptation. Le jeu est en fran\u00e7ais au niveau des textes mais les voix sont en anglais ce qui ne posera pas r\u00e9ellement de gros probl\u00e8mes vu que l'histoire est assez simple \u00e0 retenir et \u00e0 suivre. La difficult\u00e9 est assez bien dos\u00e9e avec des puzzles parfois complexes et des combats pas toujours aussi facile que pr\u00e9vu ce qui donne une l\u00e9g\u00e8re tension en fin de d\u00e9compte. Cuisiner est simple mais on a parfois du mal \u00e0 s'y retrouver avec les diff\u00e9rentes plats et leurs sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s. Heureusement on peut reprendre les ingr\u00e9dients et les remettre sur l'\u00e9tag\u00e8re nous permettant de reprendre comme il faut. Perdre un d\u00e9fi n'est jamais une r\u00e9elle d\u00e9faite car on peut recommencer et surtout mieux comprendre ce que le jeu souhaite que l'on cuisine avec l'exp\u00e9rience acquise.\n\nLe jeu p\u00e8se environ 900 Mo sur la Nintendo Switch ce qui est fort raisonnable compte tenu de tout ce qui offert directement sans DLC. Comptez environ le double sur PC. Je n'ai pas remarqu\u00e9 de gros bugs lors de mes nombreuses sessions de jeu mis \u00e0 part un plantage de la console apr\u00e8s avoir trop longtemps laiss\u00e9 le jeu en veille mais apr\u00e8s un hard reboot, tout est rentr\u00e9 dans l'ordre. La prise en main est excellente avec un tutoriel bien fichu et qui nous apprends tout ce que l'on a besoin de savoir pour ne pas \u00eatre ridicule lors des premi\u00e8res \u00e9preuves. L'univers du jeu est vraiment int\u00e9ressant avec un background complexe et des personnages hauts en couleur. Comptez donc environ 7 \u00e0 10 heures pour en voir le bout concernant l'histoire principale et bien plus pour peu que vous aimiez les d\u00e9fis.\n\nJ'ai beau \u00eatre matinal, j'ai mal!\nAu final, Battle Chef Brigade est une excellente surprise qui parvient \u00e0 rendre ses deux parties des gameplay int\u00e9ressantes et originales. M\u00eame si la cuisine est vraiment mise en avant, on passe un excellent moment \u00e0 combattre nos futurs ingr\u00e9dients qu'ils soient simple buffle ou v\u00e9n\u00e9rable dragon. Le challenge est l\u00e0 pour peu que l'on cherche \u00e0 parfaire ses plats et ainsi obtenir le plus grand nombre de points possible. Que ce soit la version Switch ou la version PC, il n'y a pas de gros p\u00e9pin technique qui vous emp\u00eachera d'appr\u00e9cier \u00e0 sa juste mesure ce d\u00e9licieux m\u00e9lange des genres. C'est donc une r\u00e9elle r\u00e9ussite \u00e0 suivre de pr\u00e8s dans cette fin d'ann\u00e9e vid\u00e9o-ludique folle.

Simple, efficace, avec plein de jolies bestioles plus ou moins difficiles \u00e0 tuer. Des am\u00e9liorations vous permettent d'augmenter votre vie, mana ou encore la place dans votre inventaire, et il est possible d'obtenir des skills (double saut, attaques de feu, etc.). Trois emplacements d'am\u00e9liorations sont disponibles, il faut donc bien choisir. C'est simple et efficace.\n\nSur ces monstres, vous r\u00e9cup\u00e9rez des ingr\u00e9dients constitu\u00e9s de gemmes (terre, eau, feu), d'os ou encore de poison. Vous placez ces gemmes dans vos pots, fours etc. pour cr\u00e9er vos plats. Le syst\u00e8me de base est un match-3 o\u00f9 vous pouvez faire pivoter vos gemmes \u00e0 volont\u00e9 (dans un carr\u00e9 de 2 sur 2) pour les aligner.\nAligner 3 gemmes en cr\u00e9e une de niveau sup\u00e9rieur (avec un niveau maximum de 3).

Vous avez \u00e9galement trois emplacements pour des ingr\u00e9dients pr\u00e9par\u00e9s \u00e0 l'avance ou des livres d'expertise, rapportant des points bonus quand vous r\u00e9ussissez un d\u00e9fi donn\u00e9.\nCe syst\u00e8me simple \u00e0 comprendre s'enrichit au fil du jeu par de nouvelles m\u00e9caniques et devient de plus en plus int\u00e9ressant.\n\nLe jeu est assez facile en difficult\u00e9 normale, les scores des adversaires \u00e9tant en partie conditionn\u00e9s par vos propres scores (autrement dit, un joueur mauvais fera face \u00e0 des adversaires plus mauvais qu'un bon joueur). Il est donc accessible \u00e0 tous. Pour plus de challenge, il y a des d\u00e9fis journaliers (\u00e9quipement pr\u00e9d\u00e9fini, classement mondial).\n\nEn dehors des duels de cuisine, il y a un sc\u00e9nario sympathique et des personnages attachants et bien doubl\u00e9s pour la plupart (quoique manquant d'animations... beaucoup ne marchent pas mais glissent sur le sol en entrant dans l'ar\u00e8ne) et trois mini-jeux facultatifs (sauf si vous voulez de l'argent pour acheter des trucs).\nLes puzzles de Belchior (obtenir un certain score \u00e0 partir de gemmes pr\u00e9d\u00e9finies) servent \u00e0 introduire les nouvelles m\u00e9caniques en douceur et deviennent relativement retors en fin de jeu. Les chasses de Thorn vous enseignent les rudiments du combat (et deviennent juste un moyen de se faire de l'argent facilement en fin de jeu... elles manquent h\u00e9las de vari\u00e9t\u00e9). Le restaurant de Pontida vous demandera de satisfaire autant de clients que possible durant le temps imparti (en r\u00e9alisant le pattern de gemmes demand\u00e9).\n\nAu final, il s'agit d'un excellent jeu. On sent que les d\u00e9veloppeurs, en \u00e9quipe r\u00e9duite, ont manqu\u00e9 de temps et de moyens pour faire de leur jeu le chef d'oeuvre qu'il aurait pu \u00eatre.

Playing the game was such a delight, and everything, from the gameplay to the music was beautifully created. It is a very short game. It took me a day to finish the story, but this is not a full priced game, and every minute of the eight hours it took me to beat the game was filled with fun and joy.\n\nIf you want a quick yes or no on whether you should get the game, get the game.\n\n\nReviewww:\nThe game is beautiful. Every character, even the ones you see for a very short time are full of personality, in the way they talk as well as the way they are dressed and posed. Their designs are all unique and interesting, making each character feel like they are their own individual, with a proper back story. The background and levels are on the same level as the characters, and my only complaint would be that they are so small that I'm sitting there wishing I could dive in and explore more. The animation is fluid and full of energy. You can really see how much care went into the animation and design when you look at the way the monsters move and attack. Everything makes sense, and all their attacks are well telegraphed. It really adds to their personality as well.\n\nThe voice acting is outstanding. Everyone has so much personality when speaking with you. I especially love the people you serve in the restaurant. Their little comments when you serve them always got me laughing and smiling. Everyone's voice and accent really fit their character as well. There was only one time where I thought the voice didn't really add up with the character and that was cause I thought the character was a girl, but the voice was... pretty deep. Who knows, maybe the character was a girl with a deep voice.\n\nThe music is beautiful. There were so many times while playing where I just got lost in the music that was playing, especially in the city. The music is so uplifting, it brings a cheerful mood to the game that otherwise wouldn't be there if absent. I feel like people forget how important music is, and only focus on the visuals, but I argue that music is just as important as the visuals, sometimes more. Think about how many games you know the theme songs to, or how easy it is for a melody to bring you back to a specific moment in a specific game. While there may not be any songs in this game that I would consider Legend of Zelda memorable, they are great nonetheless.\n\nThe story is cute. It's a world where people of different cultures and races bond over food and other culinary persuits, and you play as a girl who dreams of joining the Battle Chef Brigade, a organization that leads in the study of the culinary arts. No crazy nonsense drama. Just a feel good experience.\n\nThe gameplay is really nothing like I have ever played. Which is weird because the game has elements from a lot of games that I have played. But putting them together creates a whole new experience. You fight monsters in a side scrolling combat style in order to get their meat and other parts for cooking. Then it becomes a puzzle game, like a cross between tetris and  bejeweled, where you try to match up the same items to create a more powerful type of that element. And if that sounds boring, trust me, it is not. Time management is a factor cause you got a certain amount of time till you need to present your dish to the judges. And then there are minigames that I didn't even realize were minigames at first because they are surrounded by their own charming little story. Everything just works well.\n\nThere is only one thing that I dislike about this game, and that is the length of it. This is not because I feel cheated out of my money. I definitely feel like I have gotten my money's worth. Especially now when full priced games from AAA companies really leave you feeling disappointed and cheated when finished with them. The reason why I dislike the length of the game is that I absolutely want to keep playing. I want to see more the world, and explore the dishes you can make. It felt like the story was just getting started for the main character, and all of the sudden the game is done. And I can't say that this is a bad thing. A game that leaves you wanting more is a game worth playing.\n\nThanks for the great experience Trinket Studio.", "timestamp_created": 1511956886, "timestamp_updated": 1511956886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37923360": {"recommendationid": "37923360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085739085", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511780957}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044b\u0435, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. \u0418 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443\u0449\u0443\u044e\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f, \u044d\u0442\u0430\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0433\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u0430 \u043a \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0443 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u0438 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0435) \n\u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438)", "timestamp_created": 1511947170, "timestamp_updated": 1511947170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511111", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37922420": {"recommendationid": "37922420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055895287", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511943014}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm enjoy it! <3", "timestamp_created": 1511943174, "timestamp_updated": 1511943174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462687", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37920184": {"recommendationid": "37920184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086137165", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512437561}, "language": "english", "review": "Great spin on a cooking game, brawler + match 3, get the highest points to win.\n\nJust wish I had more control on what you cook because you normally just scramble around to get the colour the judge wants and dump it into the pan and wa-lah random dish you didn't know appears. \n\nStory pacing is pretty fast so a lot of things seem contrieved.\n\nOverall, a great gameplay, ok-ish story and I hope it does well enough so the devs can flesh the game out further.\n\n\nOther minor cons:\n\n-combat is a bit clumsy\n-backgrounds are very bare and characters don't seem to blend well with them\n-every chef looks unique but what they cook seems to be the same?

The characters have an abundant number of poses and expressions. The characters' personalities reflect well in how they carry themselves in both the artwork and the dialogue; it's been fun learning more about the characters in those regards!\n\nI was a bit iffy about the gameplay at the beginning... but after playing for a while, it makes sense! You add and mix the elements in the platform as you would add and mix ingredients in a cooking pot. The mechanics are well-integrated into the story as well with regards to \"carefully preparing\" the dishes.\n\n[b]So far I really don't have much to complain about:[/b]\n\nPersonally, the time limit for duels are a bit too short for me to amply prepare. I would say it's enough to keep things challenging for me, but it might push some more anxious and less experienced players away. Maybe adding an easier mode where time limits are a lot more forgiving and hunts are less punishing would be good.\n\nI echo another review's sentiment about cooking loadouts. It makes more sense to me to be able to prepare your tools [i]after[/i] knowing the stipulations of the challenge. There's a bit of frustration in knowing that you have the perfect tool for this particular challenge that you just missed the opportunity to use. If there were some context clues prior to the duels that can tip the players in on which loadout might be optimal, I think this could turn into a fun little guessing game of sorts.\n\n[b]Some other suggestions:[/b]\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I love going into the Practice Kitchen. Casually hunting (or practicing hunting) for the ingredients and cooking at my own pace, turning the dish into a delicious monstrosity for the history books... that's a very relaxing thing for me.\n\nIf it hasn't been done already, I would love the opportunity to be able utilize a mode like the Practice Kitchen and be able to choose the hunting location as well. And to add to that, a journal of sorts where you can record your best culinary creations I think would be a very cool feature.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\n\nIf you're a cooking game fan, if you're a hunting game fan... heck, if you're a cooking game [i]and[/i] hunting game fan, and if you like beautiful 2d visuals to boot, Battle Chef Brigade is right up your alley!", "timestamp_created": 1511859788, "timestamp_updated": 1511859788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37862223": {"recommendationid": "37862223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107905994", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511768534}, "language": "english", "review": "Battle Chef Brigade is a charming yet quirky hybrid of about 20% 2D platformer action game and 80% match 3 puzzle gem cooking battle.

To be honest, while I backed it because it looked very interesting, I wasn't sure how much I'd enjoy it personally.  I've never been great at sidescrolling fighters like Dust, and while I do enjoy puzzle games I wasn't sure how it would work with the actual cooking, but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nNeither aspect is especially challenging, at least not in my opinion.  Hard enough that caution and skill is warranted, but easy enough as to not be inaccessible to most players.  It took me a couple fights to get the hang of the combat system, but I quickly got into the flow and was moving with a great deal more grace than expected.  Similarly, how the cooking works also takes a couple battles to get used to, but is intuitive once you get into it.\n\nThe cooking really comes into its own later on, as new gem types are introduced and careful planning of the variety of cookware, using multiple pieces of cookware at once, and adding ingredients at the right time becomes highly rewarding.  It makes the daily cooking challenges an actual test of skill.\n\nUnfortunately, the combat never really evolves beyond its starting point.  There are three stages, each with a dozen or so monsters and a few harvestable ingredients, and they spawn in the same place every time.  The game tries to make combat more challenging later on, but it doesn't really succeed, so if you're looking for a good fighting challenge you aught to look elsewhere.\n\nThe soundtrack is definitely a treat to listen to; it's clear that great care went into it to make the audio fit both the mood of your task and the feel of the scene.  My favorite is The Chef's Resolve.  That said, there's not much of it; there are 30 songs, a good deal falling under 1 minute and 50 seconds.  Taking out the 30-seconds-or-less fanfares and jingles, there's about 55 minutes of audio there.  I can't recommend buying the soundtrack unheard; play the game and see if you like it first, or wait for it to go on.\n\nAs for the writing, I was amazed.  I hadn't closely been following the updates, so I expected \"Story Mode\" to be a basic premise to frame you fighting seven random people followed by a boss, but the game is significantly deeper than that.  There's complex intrigue, drama, and heartwarming moments, and they all feel natural in how they come about.  The tone expertly mixes a bit of silliness (expect a lot of food puns) and grandiose characters with a serious world with real problems.  In a lesser game, the tone would clash and detract from the other.  However, befitting a game about combat and expert cooking, the two blend together to make a compelling world that feels neither dreary nor absurd.\n\nFinally, I do a couple other issues.  It'd be really nice if we could have a \"Quick Battle\" feature, where you can choose your loadout.  Possibly the judge(s), location, and/or theme ingredient, too.  As it stands, when you finish the game, you're stuck replaying the very challenging final fight or starting a new game from scratch.  Alternatively, there's the daily cooking battles, but everything in there is pre-set; there's no real way to hone your skills or just have a casual battle for fun.  It would also be nice if we could use the non-competition practice mode to practice in all the stages, not just the first one.", "timestamp_created": 1511819287, "timestamp_updated": 1511819287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37824050": {"recommendationid": "37824050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052484838", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513022875}, "language": "english", "review": "i foud this game very fun but i would like  a multiplayer and custom chalange mode.", "timestamp_created": 1511816564, "timestamp_updated": 1511816564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37818362": {"recommendationid": "37818362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065576550", "num_games_owned": 501, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511902469}, "language": "schinese", "review": "kickstarter\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u6211\u5c31\u5df2\u7ecf\u9884\u8d2d\u4e86\uff0c\u7b49\u4e86\u5feb\u4e24\u4e09\u5e74\u4e86\u5427\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6700\u540e\u7684\u6210\u54c1\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u3002\u867d\u8bf4\u6211\u77e5\u9053\u6709\u4e9a\u88d4\uff08\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u534e\u88d4\uff09\u5236\u4f5c\u4eba\u5728\u91cc\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u4f24\u7684\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u9f20\u6807\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e5f\u662f\u5f88\u4f24\u7684\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adf\u65f6\u95f4\u7ecf\u5e38\u4e0d\u591f\u3002\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u8bddHard\u8fd8\u662f\u76f8\u5f53\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4f11\u95f2\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e5f\u80fd\u5f88\u5f00\u5fc3\u7684\u73a9\u3002\u753b\u9762\u548c\u914d\u97f3\u90fd\u662f\u8d85\u7ea7\u68d2\u7684\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u4e5f\u5f88\u5408\u683c\uff0c\u5973\u4e3b\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9519\u5c31\u662f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u767e\u5408\u3002\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdequate game with awesome graphic, outstanding voice act, decent story, good gameplay, nice challenge, and awful controls.\n7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1511812749, "timestamp_updated": 1511812749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37804608": {"recommendationid": "37804608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006665233", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511731508}, "language": "english", "review": "When the game was first revealed I was a little unimpressed.

The blend of action combat, clever puzzle design, and engrossing time management brought me fully into the world of the Battle Chefs. It's a frequent problem with game designers that they cannot stop analyzing a game, and they start to lose the raw passion they had for playing games that made them want to enter the field in the first place. With this game, I enjoy it so much my inner critic is over shouted by raw exhilaration.\nThat being said, Now that I've stepped back, had a night's rest (and a quick round of Battle Chef Brigade before work...) I want to actually take a step back and do that analysis. So, cards on the table, I played the hell out of the beta when they released it, so my impressions weren't completely blind going into the full version.\nIn Battle Chef Brigade, you're making anywhere from 1 to 3 dishes for judges with different tastes and desires out of monsters you murder out in the arena in the back of the kitchen, all in a time limit dictated by how many dishes you have to make. Your character gets different cookware with different abilities, new combat equipment, and cooking powers that give you special ways to complete your dishes.\n\nFirst, the easy part- the hunting. Combat feels very fluid in this game, with just a ton of combos and abilities that your character brings to the field. I'm playing the game on hard mode, and combat definitely feels like a challenge. Each enemy has different attack patterns, strategies, and rewards for taking them on, so you get a good mix of opponents in each round. The field also has interesting interactions, like birds picking up food items you leave around and turning them into eggs you can pick up. The combat does a great job of feeling fluid and natural, and the hand drawn animations are gorgeous.\n\nThat being said, I do have some minor complaints about combat. Enemies, if they telegraph at all, give only a few frames to react to the attack that's about to barrel down on you. That's fine if you're fighting the smaller beasties, but fighting the dragon, for example, just feels unfair. Luckily they could fix this pretty easy by lengthening the animation juuuust a smidge between wind up and attack. Also, Mina\u2019s Backstab ability lets you teleport behind enemies, but sometimes this is a little unpredictable- I\u2019ve teleported up like thirty feet to hit an enemy three platforms above me before. Overall, the combat flaws I see in the game feel like minor nitpicks in an otherwise incredible system.\n\nNow, onto the puzzle mechanics. The only things that genuinely annoyed me about the game came from the puzzle system, although these were dramatically overshadowed by how amazing the system was over all. It centers around a rotation match 3 puzzle system, where you rotate a square of four gems to get a line of 3, which condenses into an upgraded gem. There are also fascinating \u201cbreakable\u201d gem mechanics, ovens that slowly upgrade or duplicate gems automatically over time, poison mechanics, and wildcard mechanics. They do a lot to innovate over traditional match 3 puzzle games, including, essentially, building the puzzle yourself out of the monster parts you hunt down. The system is a lot of fun to play with, and the cookware offers interesting variations that let you build your own strategy. \n\nNow, the downsides- Some of the cookware have limitations that are not well explained. Take the poison mechanic- in the regular old dull pan, you can match three poisons together to safely remove them from your dish without harming your other ingredients. There\u2019s also a dwarven pan that lets you match four of the same gem to promote it straight to level 3, but it doesn\u2019t tell you that it doesn\u2019t match poison gems at all. There are some of those finicky edge cases that the game just doesn\u2019t have, which feel unfair the first time you run across it. Ultimately though, you roll your eyes, add that quirk to your understanding of the game, and then it\u2019s not a problem any more. \n\nAlso, you can totally screw yourself over with lack of care when it comes to picking your cookware, but resetting/rematching a game does not let you re-pick your equipment. To avoid this, just make sure you have the dull pan or the combo pan on you at all times until you fully understand how the tools work. Also, a practice mode can help you smooth out the edges in how the tools work.\n\nDespite the minor troubles I had with those edge cases, though, I enjoyed this match three game more than I ever thought I would. It\u2019s been the only game like it that I\u2019ve loved, spare only Puzzle Quest 1. If you\u2019re not a puzzle game enthusiast, don\u2019t let that deter you from trying this game out.\n\nThe concept is a fascinating one, but funny enough, it\u2019s kind of hard to sell people on with just an elevator pitch. I find myself saying \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s a million times better than the concept suggests.\u201d more frequently than I thought I would. The timing of making your dish is definitely what ties this whole concept together, and elements of both the puzzle and combat system play nicely into creating a rich and unified game, which was way more complimentary than it has any right to be.\n\nThe monster and veggie respawn rate is set perfectly so that you never lack for something to fight. At the same time, you can\u2019t just hunt the same monster for two minutes straight, you have to wait for the proper respawns. In cooking, the different ovens allow you to do some minor puzzling, and set it to bake for a while, incentivizing a blend of both hunting and cooking over time, rather than just doing all the hunting and then all the cooking. I was worried it would be very easy to figure out the fastest route to any particular dish, but the design\u2019s combination of its hunting and cooking makes each variety a challenge.\n\nOverall, this game is a fantastic title, and despite a few flaws here and there, it might well be my favorite game in recent memory. For $20 on Steam and Switch, it\u2019s worth the price and more.

All the soundtracks and voice acting are on point, and it has a distinct, colorful artstyle. Game mechanics are slowly introduced into the game, which was paced well.\n\nThe fighting mechanics are easy to understand and not too complex, while the cooking part, while also simple to understand, is much more challenging.\n\nMy only complaints are that this game clearly lacks a control scheme intended for mouse and keyboard, which took a while to get used to. That, and that the story, which I really enjoyed the writing and humor of, felt short. (10~ hours length)\n\nSome people say that the combat is too easy, but I feel that extremely challenging combat was not the intention of the game design, as the point of hunting the monsters is not to defeat them, but to defeat them as quickly as possible to harvest ingredients and return to the cooking station. \n\nThus, eventually you'll be able to defeat all the monsters on the map quickly. The penalty for being defeated in combat seem minimal, you drop all the ingredients you're carrying and get sent back to the cooking station. This gives the illusion that the combat is too easy. However, the game integrates both the fighting and the cooking into the \"duel\".

It doesn't have the move variety of games like Bayonetta or DMC, of course, but with both physical and magical attack buttons triggering a different move depending on which directional button you're holding and whether or not you're in the air, two playable characters with unique move sets, and a decent variety of equippable customisation items, the amount of depth is [i]just right[/i] for what this game sets out to achieve!\n\n[*]Putting all the ingredients you gather to use by preparing all sorts of wacky dishes in a deceptively simple gem-matching minigame. I say minigame, but given how much depth it gains through a gradually expanding set of rules and variables, there is actually nothing \"mini\" about it! You can choose to cook your dishes in a wide variety of different cookware, which completely alters the way taste gems interact with each other, opening up a huge potential for strategy!\n\n[*]Exploring a tiny hub area, where you can buy cookware and numerous upgrades that will allow you to customise the way you fight and cook, take on little side-jobs that expand your knowledge of the game's systems and fill your wallet with coin, have a small chat with your friends and and random people on the street, and challenge your fellow aspiring battle chefs to the game's main event - a cook-off!\n\n[*]And finally, you'll be following an incredibly charming, lighthearted and surprisingly well voice-acted story, which ties the aforementioned elements together, and is such a refreshing change from all the doom, gloom and grit permeating the modern game storytelling. Here you'll find no evil plots to destroy the world or enslave humanity, no vendetta missions against villains who killed your family. None of that tired old bollocks! There will be drama, there will be mystery and adventure, there will be friendships and rivalries, but at its core, this is just a story of one lovable girl's journey towards achieving her life's dream. And there ain't nothing wrong with that!\n[/list]\n\nThis game's presentation made me fall in love with it from the very first minutes. Every aspect of it - the story, the characters, the music, the artstyle - can be described using one simple word: charming. Sure, it's got its flaws and quirks, like having to choose your loadout [i]before[/i] you actually know which conditions you'll be facing in a duel (thank god for a rematch option), some music tracks drowning out the dialogue, and from some backgrounds you can see that the artist was kinda struggling to keep up with the deadlines.\n\nBut all of those minor complaints get relentlessly crushed under the weight of tremendous amount of pure charm Battle Chef Brigade radiates.

There are also mini games (jobs) in town to help you get more cash to buy more equipment and perks to help you on your journey. The game features great art, a stunning soundtrack and a wide variety of characters and monsters. This a game that is well worth the ride and journey to the end. There are 6 chapters and it was only the 5th one that dragged a little longer than it needed to. By the time the credits roll, you will feel like you just finished watching a movie or anime season/show. It's a full and memorable experience that is one of a kind and you owe it to yourself to play this game and see for yourself why it's so amazing.

I loved Iron Chef, and it sounded like an excellent premise. Though, I'd actually given up on it, seeing as how it took this long to release. The occasional snippets of gameplay and animation were janky, to say the least.\n\nThis game is way better than I gave it credit for. The animation (while sometimes janky) is quite nice to look at. The voicework is fantastic. The gameplay is, well, acceptable. It's not a particularly difficult game, even on the hard setting and playing on a keyboard (I recommend a gamepad), and it seems rather short.

Its greatest strength is the interactions between the loadout and the gameplay where what you bring and what you plan to do is actually very important.  The main weakness is the amount of re-used content, there only being three-and-a-half levels.\n\nThe combat is fluid and the levels are well designed but conversely the animations and hitboxes could be better and the same can be said of the platforming; it'll often look like you've gotten on top of something only to slip back through. The voice acting is very good even if there are a lot of animation shortcuts such as your opponents often not having run cycles and just sliding the other way at the start of the match.  Still, the backgrounds and monsters all look nice and ultimately it all gets the job done.\n\nI don't think I've ever played anything quite like Battle Chef Brigade and I thought it was worth the wait and beta testing.

There also seems to be parts of the map that aren't used, which makes me suspect that a DLC is incoming or they devs didn't manage to push out that part of the content in time.\n\nThe game is unbelievably beautiful though, and the music is melodious. The characters are cool, and I kinda wished I got to play Kirin. Trash is a damn good fighter and Mina is pretty dodgy, and I'm curious to see how Kirin fight. At the end of the story it's kinda hinted that our main characters went out on team missions, which is something I really, really wanted to see but unfortunately won't get in this game at least (maybe in a sequel, but it's also hinted then it'll be the next generation who will be the focus...).\n\nCombos can be easily chained, although I gotta complain that Mina's range is really short. I have to stand - on screen - maximum 1 ~ 2 centimeter away from the enemy or I can't hit anything. Personally I detest time limits but that's completely subjective; Practice Mode is always available if you wish to play without worrying over that.\n\nAgain, this easily could give Pyre a run for their money if it was longer.

Because if anything happens to her, the story is just going to make something up so it goes right for her again without her doing anything. Nothing in the story feels like it has any weight. If you fail a competition, you can do a rematch (which makes me wonder why even bother with the timer). If you don't serve everybody in the resturant for your side-job, you still get paid for just standing there. \n\nIts fun to try out, but I recommend waiting for the game to go on sale. I got this game by backing it on Kickstarter.\n\n- Update - \n\nNew update allows better key-bindings making it easier to enjoy the gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1511578779, "timestamp_updated": 1512597715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.412242", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37447630": {"recommendationid": "37447630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008676748", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511596165}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly in depth systems and a fun little story make this game a fun time in my opinion.

Battle Chef Brigade \u00e9 tudo aquilo que eu esperava e mais um pouco de um jogo com tem\u00e1tica culin\u00e1ria e a Adult Swim Games continua de parab\u00e9ns por descobrir e publicar t\u00edtulos t\u00e3o legais!\n\nO jogo \u00e9 basicamente um sidescrolling beat'em-up match-3-puzzle visual novel. Sim, ele inclui elementos de pancadaria e ca\u00e7a de ingredientes que voc\u00ea leva de volta para a sua despensa e depois utiliza para cozinhar atrav\u00e9s de um quebra-cabe\u00e7as por combina\u00e7\u00e3o de tr\u00eas. Toda a hist\u00f3ria do jogo \u00e9 apresentada como um romance visual e isso me impressionou porque ele \u00e9 bem escrito, na quantidade certa de di\u00e1logo e n\u00e3o \u00e9 massante como a maioria dos jogos desse g\u00eanero \u00e9. O ponto alto do jogo \u00e9 a escolha dos equipamentos para enfrentar os outros chefs e agradar os ju\u00edzes que tem gostos espec\u00edficos, al\u00e9m de que cada prato precisa seguir uma tem\u00e1tica para n\u00e3o perder metade dos pontos. Existem itens para melhorar/facilitar os combos (frigideiras), para mudar (temperos), remover (t\u00e1bua de carne) ou melhorar (panelas) as pe\u00e7as, etc. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel jogar com a personagem principal ou com o orc, cada um com o seu estilo (vento e fogo respectivamente).\n\nCreio que a soma de v\u00e1rios ingredientes num mesmo t\u00edtulo n\u00e3o estragou a receita (com o perd\u00e3o da piada), pelo contr\u00e1rio eles est\u00e3o distribu\u00eddos de tal forma e com uma progress\u00e3o t\u00e3o agrad\u00e1vel que o resultado \u00e9 uma hist\u00f3ria envolvente com mec\u00e2nicas divertidas e que ainda exigem estrat\u00e9gia e planejamento por parte do jogador para conseguir o m\u00e1ximo de pontos poss\u00edveis nas disputas do que essencialmente trata-se de um bel\u00edssimo simulador de Master Chef.\n\nO estilo manga de Battle Chef Brigade \u00e9 bonito e mostra que Chicago conta com artistas competentes do g\u00eanero. Existe uma grande variedade de pratos e ingredientes que se combinam no jogo formando as refei\u00e7\u00f5es mais bizarras que um cen\u00e1rio medieval fant\u00e1stico poderia oferecer. Parece que os \u00fatimos dois anos foram a era dos jogos culin\u00e1rios de qualidade e quem sabe at\u00e9 quando isso vai continuar?\n\nA m\u00fasica do jogo \u00e9 muito boa, mas \u00e0s vezes fica mais alta do que os di\u00e1logos e portanto eu recomendo que voc\u00ea j\u00e1 ajuste isso de imediato.\n\nO jogo conta com desafios e placares de l\u00edderes que como de costume incluem pontua\u00e7\u00f5es absurdas no topo.\n\nAl\u00e9m de uma disputa di\u00e1ria que coloca em teste suas habilidades, num jogo que no in\u00edcio voc\u00ea vai fazer em m\u00e9dia 250 pontos, ver um placar em que os l\u00edderes est\u00e3o com 800 pontos com certeza faz voc\u00ea repensar as suas t\u00e9cnicas.\n\nCONCLUS\u00c3O: O jogo vale cada centavo com ou sem desconto e vai te prender por horas (ou mesmo at\u00e9 o final j\u00e1 que s\u00e3o 6 cap\u00edtulos bem longos) de t\u00e3o divertido e desafiante que ele \u00e9.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[quote][i]Deseja ver mais an\u00e1lises?

The gist of the main part of the game is: you're given an enemy you must use or suffer a large penalty, you go out and hunt monsters in an action platformer, collect their parts to use as ingredients, and then cook the ingredients too perfection using a surprisingly in depth match 3 game in order to present them to up to 3 judges, each having their own preferences. \n\nThe action platforming part of the game is rough around the edges. The combat felt fairly unsatisfying, as monsters didn't have any sort of tell as to when they attacked, leaving the game to be all about timing when fighting a large monster such as a Hydra or a Dragon. \n\nThe cooking part, however, is very fun. While it starts off slow, it quickly becomes pretty hectic as you have to manage multiple ingredients together, while being pressured with a time limit that goes by faster than you'd think. This is accompanied by small taunts between you and your competitor which give the game a lot of flavor. The game also managed to stay fresh by constantly adding new items to the shop that can give bonuses depending on certain conditions being met. There's a vast amount of items you can use to change your loadout, making optimizing it very fun.\n\nThe game, however, seems to be fairly short, but this is mitigated by their daily cook-offs adding re-playability to the game. While playing on normal mode, I encountered a few difficulty spikes compared to the rest of the game, but never really felt frustrated, usually breezing through my opponents even when playing poorly. \n\nBattle Chef Brigade rewards experimentation, and presents a fairly open approach to the game. It's perfectly viable to exclusively cook with vegetables and never do any fighting. If you don't want to deal with some of the Match 3 mechanics, you can buy items to nullify them. It's very open in how you play the game.\n\nOverall though, $20 is definitely worth it for this title, and I'd recommend it if you find any interest in it.

The strengths of the game are in its charming writing, art, and in the cooking gameplay. Its weaknesses would be in polish: combat animations, saving, and characters outside of Mina being shallow archetypes. Given the price point and the resources that went into Battle Chef Brigade, I think these flaws can be overlooked. At the very least, Battle Chef Brigade provides a strong base to season later with DLC or updates. \n\nThere are also a few small, non-gamebreaking, bugs that I encountered throughout the game: performance occassionally dropped, a link to a Trello card was overlayed on the top of my screen, and during a certain event a super annoying buzzing sound starts playing. It does go away, however, and not too big of a deal. Also, achievements do not seem to track as well as they should. I have no idea when I missed a puzzle and given I'm at 0/30, I have no idea how many I missed either.\n\nDespite being a fan of the writing and art, I can't say there is much to write about. Characters had nuance when the writers could afford it, but most ended up being fun archetypes or personalities. The onesthat we spent the most time with were lovable and relatable. Nearly every character was grounded in some way and the dialogue felt real for characters that were expected to feel real, and out of this world for those that were obviously just cool designs. The narrative was less thought-provoking and more feel-good given the people you defeated were nearly always on your side to begin with. It reads like the third or fourth arc of an anime and achieves its goal of giving you people to root for and giving simple narrative conflicts to resolve through battle and cooking. \n\nAt the end of the day, what makes Battle Chef Brigade a fantastic game is the cooking. Throughout the game Battle Chef Brigade introduces new gem types, restrictions, and cooking utensils. Your restricted loadout meant that how you played was tied to what tools you decided to bring to that match. The progression system and having to purchase items at the shop meant that how you played consistently evolved until you reached your style of cooking. That keeps gameplay fresh. \n\nEvery match is also different as different judges have different tastes and you have to work with the theme ingredient on top of everything else. Given you choose a loadout before seeing the theme & tastes, it's also better to create a loadout that can work around these restrictions. Add in a time limit in Hard -- the timer is integral to a feeling of tension -- and you kind of create a sub-game of optimization within the main game.\n\nTo that end, I think Battle Chef Brigade manages to create a fresh core gameplay loop that rewards creativity and experimentation. I changed my loadouts multiple times until I eventually settled on a set of expertise books that were easy and consistent to trigger. Since the opponents were not super challenging (I only lost once and swept most of my opponents with ease), I was never really afraid of losing. Instead, I focused on how many points I could score in a given challenge. There is a strong sense of satisfaction that stems from having a dish that matches the flavour, theme, and triggers multiple cooking expertise conditions.\n\nMy main criticism outside of polish would be that the core combat loop felt unsatisfying. The animations for the monsters lacked fluid tells that I am accustomed to from games like Monster Hunter or Dark Souls. Fighting monsters became a lot of timing rather than reacting to their movements. Perhaps that was a design choice, but I felt frustrated whenever I had to fight a dragon or a hydra. Animations are less of an issue with monsters that you can combo and kill at your own leisure. You have complete agency as a player there.\n\nWhat is great about Battle Chef Brigade is that you have the choice to avoid the parts you do not like.

It's simply not that kind of game, and I'm okay with that. \n\nThere are some rough edges, to be clear--the game loses points for some flatness in the combat and storytelling--but it's made up for with the actual cooking challenges, which gradually increase in complexity and thus, difficulty.  \n\nAll in all, Battle Chef Brigade is like a warm, home-cooked meal shared in even warmer company; prepared with respect and care.

What this game does best is giving you limited time for doing it main purpose, in my experience, it's never a good thing yet this game proved me wrong. \n\nLimited time makes you plan ahead when a designated monster and main theme revealed. You have to learn quickly what monsters drop what kind of ingredients, and what are the elements of that ingredients... There are also RPG elements of the game with equipment your character uses but especially with the cooking gear what you choose and the main theme of the challenge must overlap just by chance. If they didn't then your job becomes much harder.\n\nFighting is good, I just saw one biome with contains 4 offensive and 1 thief type monster that you can attack (also there are berries and such type but they do not attack or defend themselves) for most of it you can just mash buttons for random hits and kill them, but some of it attack really hard and has different types of attacks. I hope other biomes have the different type of monsters that can challenge me more.\n\nGraphics are great. Both art style and animations are well done. As you can see from screenshots probably this game's main selling point is cute and colorful art style. Music is also good but SFX can be discussed. There is also voice acting in main story dialogues and the cutscenes. \n\nControls are good enough with a gamepad but playing with a keyboard would be hard I guess. \n\nI can play with my 2014 MacBook Air without having a problem after closing the vsync and there is no screen tearing for me with 1440x900 resolution.\n", "timestamp_created": 1511456730, "timestamp_updated": 1511456730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37127687": {"recommendationid": "37127687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015327809", "num_games_owned": 635, "num_reviews": 234, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511412065}, "language": "english", "review": "I was a Kickstarter backer for the basic game tier and I\u2019m really having a good track record with these. \n\nBattle Chef Brigade is a fusion of multiple genres, it\u2019s a side-scrolling action game crossed with a Match 3 puzzle game and some light RPG elements. This gameplay combination works quite well; the action segments where you hunt monsters for ingredients controls smoothly and are fun and the Match 3 parts where you cook your ingredients are good too.

I had to mute the game, but it corrected itself once I won the match.\n\nThe writing is quite good, mainly in that the characters are charming and they are bolstered by some real quality voice-acting. The game also has a conclusive ending too. The atmosphere is also great, it\u2019s lively and colorful. The game\u2019s art design is reminiscent of Miyazaki or Wakfu and it has that painting-like quality to it.

You gather ingredients from slaying monsters and then put the elements of those ingredients together in a match-3 style puzzle game. For anyone who has seen an episode of Chopped should be able to pick up pretty quickly that there are judges and these judges have certain requests and the overall host gives you a theme ingredient that he would like to see as apart of your dish. \n\nThe story is solid, if a tad disjointed toward the end as it flip-flops from one protagonist to another. That being said the voice acting and characters are excellent with each character looking and sounding distinct and having likable memorable personalities from each other. The music is also really solid with inspiration from both fantasy and French styles. The art is solid and hand-drawn but this occasionally will cause issues. Characters rarely ever \"move\" and some characters even lack a walking animation (some will slide off screen which is unintentionally hilarious to me). That being said it's well used in most cutscenes and the voice acting is superb enough to help overlook these issues.\n\nI streamed this game from it's launch and everyone who watched was absoluetly blown away by the level of quality this tiny team acheived on a small percentage of your typical Mighty No.9 campaign.

Battle Chef Brigade is best described as Monster Hunter meets Iron Chef meets Combo-based side scrolling.\n\nIn the game you play as Mina Han, a talented chef and fighter who is skilled with wind magic, who dreams of becoming a Battle Chef. A battle chef is basically a chef that uses their skills not only to fight dangerous monsters but to either research their ingredents or use it to cook with.\n\nThe story is well made with a full cast of colorful characters that each make the world feel alive and gives it a sort of charm. From the side characters like Master hunter Thorn or the cat-obsessed scientist Belchoir to the main cast like the brave Orc warrior Thrash and the intelligent Kirin, each one makes the world feel unique and fun to experience.\n\nNow onto the game itself, it's pretty story heavy which is a huge plus in my opinion but the mechanics are pretty simple. During matches you need to hunt down monsters in specific areas to harvest the ingredents you need to finish a dish, this is where the Iron Chef part comes in. The matches are judged by a panel of 1-3 judges and each have a specific element or mixture of elements they want and they have a theme ingredent. \n\nThe voice acting can feel a bit amateurish at times but overall it was really well down for an indie game, I kinda let that one slide because again, it's an indie game.\n\nMechanics of the game are extremely solid and it is really fun to play around with.\n\nMy one complaint is that the game is a little on the short side but I'm hopeful that we'll see more from Trinket Studios as this game is truely a gem.\n\nI highly recommend this game, again it is the most fun I've had in months and I think I will come back to replay this a lot of times.\n\nVive la Brigade Battle Chefs!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511413495, "timestamp_updated": 1511413495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36926354": {"recommendationid": "36926354", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976586269", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511401534}, "language": "english", "review": "Not reccommended for Keyboard and Mouse only players.

Like, when I battled knife, spoon and fork, I needed to go away on my 3'd round. And when I came back to the game, It started from the 1'st round instead of the 3'd one.\n- pretty mediocre Thrash gameplay. I'd prefer to continue playing as brigade chef Mina. Thrash story is really lacking and does nothing to the overall plot. Also, his combat feels much less dynamic and fun than Mina's.\n- lack of the end game content. Yeah, there are daily challenges. But it would be much more awesome, if we had something like Quick Game mode (where we can chose our items, unlike daily challenge) or Endless Run (where we'd battle endless rounds of enemies).\n\nOverall, this game is 9.5/10 for me. \nI hope, devs will consider communities' feedback and will continue to add new content and work on the game.", "timestamp_created": 1511362096,

No two NPC's look alike (save Luis and Louie but those two kind of have an excuse) and no two dishes will look alike either. The story- currently on chapter 3 of 6- has been far more than I expected it to be.\n\nIt's not simply- Show up and fight to make the best dish. The game is peppered with, dare I say, lore to entice. The backgrounds are highly interactable, the npc's all have little concurrent running stories and with the way the first 3 chapters are forumlated you'll be spoiled for learning more/less depending on how many times you challenge a certain foe. Replay value is most certainly there.\n\nAdd a dash of daily challenges, puzzles, matching games and new plot elements that make the match 3 gameplay change on the fly. Items matter, how you spend your meagre cash matters and just when you think you've figured it all out you'll run into a judge who isn't SWAYED by your ULTRA SPICY DRAGON WING SUPREME HOT SAUCE- prudes and fools i say- and you'll need to adapt on the fly.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of match 3 games but with the strange items you can get- only needing to match 2 of a colour in elemental pans, special sauces to change the colours of all your ingrdients, special crockery designed to turn a set of weak ingridients into high powered ones- I was kept enticed. Every time my dishes star rank went up I beamed and every time it went down I silently hoped my competition was murdered by one of the many delightful critters that populate the hunting maps.\n\nYet to happen sadly.\n\nIn case it's not obvious I've been bowled over by the strong mix of flavours and elements the game has- I'm stretching the food imagery here so let me wrap up with some criticisms.\n\nI confess that it's a little annoying to only get 1 practice map, despite there being more than 1 hunt arena. I'd have liked a little more chance to alter my items. As I said you can spec into fire ingridients, fire pans and fire sauces but when you go into the arena it's locked down and unchangable. It rather sucks to come in ready to be the next Guy Fieri, lord of Hot Sauce, only to find I'm serving an old lady who wants a WATERY dish.\n\nI dare say there's something to be said of making sure you can't insta-lock a judge 100% but it's a bit awkward to kit yourself out for a certain flavour and find out it's not showing up. I dare say if you memorize all the dates and all teh challenges you can get around this but that sounds a bit daft.\n\nLastly I remember reading there's supposed to be 5 playable chefs. So far there are 2 and others have mentioned the other characters lacking. I can only assume they will show up later, as their goals were met. This doesn't upset me personally but some people like to know they're getting everything they were promised.\n\nRegardless the game is very fun and an utter feast for the eyes.

Biggest issue so far is the Brigade challenge ramps up really hard (playing hard difficulty) \n\nOver all, if they refined the combat they could have easily made a game with that alone, but the match three portion adds a depth of keeping in mind of what you bother to kill, or keep on your outings.\n\n\n\n-SPOILERS BELOW-\n\n\nSo, having completed Mina's arc, I have to say the difficulty feels, weird. (on hard) Suddenly having 3 back to back challenges. And the fact you are sort of punished for preparing for challenge 1, into 2, then 3. But once I had my items properly set I did challenge 3 in my first run. Which made it feel awkward. \n\nAnd then bam, start all over, same rules, but now you're someone else. The chapter system is also a bit weird since it feels like the chapters should have been more like. Book1 Chapter 1-X.\n\nStill over all enjoying it, but I really dislike how the new character plays currently.

Las voces me gustaron. La m\u00fasica me encanto, tan de orquesta, hecha para un concurso, perd\u00f3n... \u00a1una batalla! (jaja). La traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol esta bien. Me asuste al principio (con los graficos), pero est\u00e1 muy bien presentado, disfrutenlo. Es un juego de estilo anime, con puzzles. Cocinas comidas cazando monstruos y juntando ingredientes, todo eso en tiempo real. Es s\u00f3lido, lo recomiendo.\n\n[h1][b]\u00bfQue bugs y errores encontre?[/b][/h1]\nHay una peque\u00f1a falla en la sincronizaci\u00f3n vertical, los FPS pueden fallar. Puede que corra mal o se vea mal. Yo encontre dicho error \"pasable\" \"no me molesto\" pero quer\u00eda mencionarlo. Tambi\u00e9n es cierto que hay un crash durante el cap\u00edtulo 3.\n\n[h1][b]Nota Final: 8/10[/b][/h1]\nPrecio accesible. Jugabilidad Flexible. Narra bien una historia que es simple y atractiva. Est\u00e1 traducido al espa\u00f1ol (voces en ingl\u00e9s). El texto se puede ajustar a tama\u00f1os m\u00e1s grandes. Y sin duda la mejor parte no es solo el dise\u00f1o de personajes o el arte del juego, pero sino tambi\u00e9n la m\u00fasica, la cual me trajo recuerdos del juego \"Princess Maker 2\". Yeah!!,\n\n[h1][b]Siempre quise ver la saga de Cooking Mama en PC[/b][/h1]\nPero ahora tenemos Battle Chef Brigade y es sensacional.\n\n[h1][b]El juego en detalle[/b][/h1]\n+Tenes el [u][b]MODO HISTORIA[/b][/u] con 6 cap\u00edtulos.\n+Modo de juego \"[u][b]DESAF\u00cdO[/b][/u]\" donde trabajas en un restaurante cocinando platillos para los clientes. Tiene modo de dificultad f\u00e1cil y dif\u00edcil. (Es raro que no tenga dificultad \"normal\")\n+Modo de juego \"[u][b]CONCURSO DIARIO[/b][/u]\" donde competis contra otro Chef (de evento).  Cuenta con una tabla de Ranking Online y un sistema de progresi\u00f3n para destacar el nivel de tu perfil. Empezas nivel Cuchara, luego Espada, etc, etc.\n+El tema de los Puzzles y cocinar puede ser abrumador al principio y el modo historia sirve justamente para ense\u00f1arte desde lo b\u00e1sico hasta lo avanzado. (Comida, Salsas, Todo bien explicado)\n+No solo cazas monstruos, tambi\u00e9n mejoras tu personaje. (al menos a Mina al principio) La podes equipar con diferentes armas y objetos que la ayudan no solo a combatir pero sino tambi\u00e9n a preparar la comida m\u00e1s deliciosa. No solo est\u00e1s cazando monstruos y recolectando ingredientes. Podes dejar cosas en la estufa y que se mejoren autom\u00e1ticamente. Es un sistema de puzzle \"b\u00e1sico\" que se vuelve m\u00e1s complejo pero divertido.\n+Cada batalla es en tiempo real. Es importante medir el tiempo entre cazar, obtener ingredientes y volver a la cocina a preparar la comida.\n+Tenemos un \"[u][b]Modo Libre[/b][/u]\" (Free Roam) donde podemos practicar libremente nuestros talentos como chef. El problema del Free Roam es que no hay jueces y es solo en el \u00e1rea del bosque.

I think the only aspect that might come as surprise would be the match three cooking gameplay, which will break your experience if it's not your cup of tea.\n\nFor a game this quality and with such replayability (not so much with storyline, but through endless mode and daily challenges), I feel that the price is quite fair.", "timestamp_created": 1511234612, "timestamp_updated": 1511234612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36668407": {"recommendationid": "36668407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098749809", "num_games_owned": 573, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1514349933}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego, desde hace tiempo estaba esperando para jugarlo, el sistema de juego es bien pensado, une los juegos puzzle con batallas, jefes, tipos de comidas, combinaciones y dem\u00e1s, el arte gr\u00e1fico es sensacional, los personajes estan bien dise\u00f1ados, sin duda un juego para pasar un buen rato.\n\nDe momento lo he jugado con teclado y se comporta muy bien, supongo que con mando puede ir mejor, tendr\u00e9 que probarlo.\n\nRecomendado 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1511233831, "timestamp_updated": 1511233831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36668332": {"recommendationid": "36668332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125602750", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511532439}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7b49\u5f85\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e48\u4e45\u7ec8\u4e8e\u73a9\u4e0a\u5566\uff01\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u662f\u671f\u5f85\u4e86\u597d\u51e0\u5e74\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u554a\uff01\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u753b\u98ce\u4eba\u8bbe\u90fd\u76f8\u5f53\u6ee1\u610f\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u7684PC\u6309\u952e\u4e2a\u4eba\u611f\u89c9\u6709\u4e9b\u522b\u626d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u624b\u67c4\u4f53\u9a8c\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u3002\n\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff01\u671f\u671b\u672a\u6765\u52a0\u5165\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u5438\u5f15\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u73a9\u5bb6\uff01\n\u5f00\u68ee\u5f00\u68ee\u554a!", "timestamp_created": 1511233346, "timestamp_updated": 1511233346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640523", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36656695": {"recommendationid": "36656695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037880259", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511256654}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "\u00c9lvzhet\u0151 t\u00f6rt\u00e9net , F\u00f6h\u00f6s\u0171nk is szimpatikus fordulatos versenyek sz\u00e9p grafika \u00e9s 60 Fps :D harcok meg  Kiv\u00e1l\u00f3ak.", "timestamp_created": 1511224359, "timestamp_updated": 1511224359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36656600": {"recommendationid": "36656600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085684806", "num_games_owned": 853, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511251251}, "language": "english", "review": "Adult Swim doesn't mess around when it comes to publishing quirky, original titles, and Battle Chef ranks among their very best.

it's more than a little refreshing to have a genuinely new and original title! While this probably will remind some of Food Wars or a similar anime, the presentation is fresh enough  to really stand on it's own merit. (Video Version of Review) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK4w5QhP53k&t=22s\n\nThe game is simple in it's parts: \n\n-Overworld Map\n-6 Chapters\n-Interactive Towns\n-Side Scrolling Combat \n-Ingredients and Gear Collection\n-Tile Matching Cooking System \n-Graded Cooking Duels\n-Charming Story and Character Interactions\n-Hybrid Anime Art Style\n\nThese components mix together as beautifully as you'll hope your first dish in the game turns out. The funny thing here is that most game want you to be invested in your character, but rarely does that ever happen for me. However, Mina is such a likable and relatable character that I found myself instantly drawn to her and her quest to become a chef extraordinary. The combat, while simple, is fun, fast, and varied, the cooking is simple in concept and execution, but ramps up nicely as more specific ingredients and compositions are required. There is also a daily challenge mode, as well as a cooking mode, and combat mode; all of which give nice distractions from the main quest line. Make no mistake this is an RPG at it's core, so if reading and character focus are a turn off for you then you may want to hold off on purchasing. At the end of the day this is a title that has been exquisitely crafted and will offer and engaging story matched by awesome gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1511205569, "timestamp_updated": 1511251923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796627", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36651455": {"recommendationid": "36651455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040251828", "num_games_owned": 788, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511378567}, "language": "english", "review": "Battle Chef Brigade is an interesting rpg/match 3 style game with rich backgrounds and fun mechanics. Originally a kickstarted game, it has some great gameplay mechanics.\n\nPlayers are control Mina, a contestant in the Battle Chef Tournament. You'll have to gather your own ingredients during matches by killing monsters or harvesting from bushes. Each item you collect has different qualities to it, which affect how easily it can be combined with other ingredients.\n\nThe match 3 part of the game comes into play when you start cooking, adding ingredients to the pot. Simply adding ingredients won't make them upgrade into tier 2 or tier 3 qualities, but moving the pot onto the fire and cooking/stirring the ingredients will. But certain pots will allow for easier combinations, like match 2 instead; though these pots are usually limited to only working on 1 type of color. The colors are blue, green, and red; so there isn't as much complexity as other match 3 games.\n\nMost matches have a time limit, and judges with specific \"taste\" preferences which will score more or less points depending on what your board looks like.\n\nThe background/environment is very soothing, and all the diversity in the character designs is very nice.

She can use wind magic and is a well known chef from her small village. She manages to get into the competition to become a chef brigade, and that is where your adventure really starts off.\n\nThis game takes place in a world that's like a chef-themed Hunter x Hunter. You will learn how to fight beasts, and then cook their remains like 5 seconds after slaughtering them. A world where people get overwhelmed by monsters and their biggest issue is apparently lacking food and don't think of just killing the monsters for food for a couple hundred years. So once they grow some balls, they eventually ate monsters and went \"oh cool lets make an entire society based on chefs that both kill and cook,\" and so it happened.\n\nOk as you can tell the story isn't very well thought out, but as a person who's overly critical about games, even I could let this slide as the game's strength is its gameplay. Like previously mentioned, you fight beasts, then cook with their remains as the main game. You go into competitions where you go head-to-head with another chef. If you win the competition, you become a hunter... I mean a chef brigade. Same thing, but a little less cool, and only about cooking really.\n\nThe cooking is very clever honestly. It uses match 3 games as a method to explain cooking and it does really fucking well. You can combine ingrediants up to level 3. Leveling up ingrediants gives you more points on each dish. There are 3 types of flavors, fire, water, and earth. So while just combining random ingrediants is easy, like the AI does most of the time, you won't get the max amount of points you would want to get if you don't focus on the judge's flavor and the theme ingrediant, which is selected at the start of every match. And obviously, you want the most points to win.\n\nNow flavors and theme ingrediants are important to how the combat works, as what you fight, and sometimes how you fight it, depends on what you need. This combination is amazing honestly. There is real tension in each match, and you are constantly trying to find out what to get next for your meal.\n\nIt's a great game, my only warning is that the characters and story is more than a bit bland at the beginning. Give it time and the game really picks up. Sadly it ends in around 10 hours, but it was a very fun experience that took this game into my top 5 games of 2017.

A non-story battle mode- Now before people get on my ass claiming that the game does have a non-story battle mode in the form of daily challenges, what I would like to see is a mode where you get to choose your character, loadout, opponent, and zones, where opponents and zones are unlocked after you beat/encounter them in the main story mode.\n\nOther than those four things I think that this game is very well designed both artistically and conceptually.

If you're reading this devs, please release a concept art compilation of this game DLC, I would gladly throw in some extra bucks on it. \n\nFor the gameplay, let's start with the puzzle aspect. The game's puzzle mechanic uses mainly a match 3 puzzles, and each puzzle range from easy to ball-bustingly hard. Each puzzle had some interesting twists including bones, taking out poison, and even fragile gems that break if you mismatch a number of turns. It took me a while to get around these, but all of them were all rewarding. Another mechanic is that you can improve your puzzles by equipping items, and upgrades on your loadout, to handle your style of cooking.\n\nThe brawler aspect kinda troubles me a bit, I'm 50/50 about this one so bear with me. While the beat-em-up part of the game plays smooth with simple yet stylish animations, I can't help but feel its repetitiveness at the later part of the game. Mostly the beat-em-up section's objective is to forage ingredients from Monsters and Flora, which was interesting enough to carefully pick your hitlist depending on the challenge objectives. If only the game also included character progression and skill trees and not just having to rely on your loadouts, the brawler section would have been better.\n\nAnd the story, I think the story, although simple, has some moments. Above average, I should say. You have a wonderful set of colorful, loveable and memorable characters; all professionally voice-acted. While the plot was simple, the characters really sold it for me. \n\nAnd of course, the grand high-fantasy setting was something to behold. Kinda reminded me of Dragon Age Origins or maybe Avatar: The Last Airbender with the way they handled the setting and characters.\n\nOverall, I could not recommend this game enough.

It's set in a universe where food was running short and monsters were taking over so they set up an institution of battle chefs who not only slay the monsters but then use them to create delicious cuisine. You play the part of an aspiring battle chef entering the tournament where the prize is becoming a member of the brigade so you need to beat various other chefs in cook offs, Iron Chef style, with the complication of you also have to go out and hunt for all of your ingredients and cook the meals within the set time limit.\n\nMechanics wise, both the combat and the cooking are relatively simple. It's the pretty basic combat style of spam attack for combos, you have a dodge with invisibility frames and a few special moves. The cooking is a match 3 game of 3 different coloured gems (flavour profiles) on a 4x4 grid representing the pot you're cooking in and rotating 2x2 squares (stirring) to match 3 gems. Matching 3 level 1 gems morphs them into a level 2 gem of the same flavour profile and likewise level 2 up to level 3. You get a ton of different equipment you earn over time and can use in the battles to interesting effects. There's a slow cooker than doesn't match any gems but simply very slowly upgrades what you put in it over time, there's a pot that only matches 4 level 1 gems but upgrades them to level 3 immediately, pots that match 2 gems to upgrade but only work on one specific flavour profile and so on. They do a really good job of varying the requirements to force you into using different equipments and bonuses for the tougher battles. Each battle you need to please up to 3 judges, each with their own preferred flavours and each battle requiring the use of a \"theme ingredient\" for the round or you suffer a heavy penalty.\n\nThe only real complaint I had about the gameplay is that there is one point that is just a completely absurd difficulty spike. All of a sudden the competitors are getting ridiculous scores, the time limit is lower and the theme ingredient is the toughest monsters on the map that can easily take up half your time just killing them for ingredients. After this it drops right back down again to where it was before, it's very odd, just came out of nowhere. I played on hard because I'd read it was recommended and this difficulty spike was the only time I ever took more than 2 attempts at a battle. The other issue is you go into the battle blind in terms of what the judges are after and what the theme ingredient is but if you lose you just have to rematch until you win and you can change your cooking loadout with the knowledge of the battle gained after your first attempt. Just makes it slightly irritating that they don't surface that before you choose your first loadout so you can end up going into a battle the first time around with absolutely nothing useful and really struggle.\n\nI think it looks great too, all of the backgrounds are sort of this washed out watercolour style of art with the characters and monsters done in slightly bolder colours so they really stand out in the environments. They do the same with the match 3 gems which I like much less as they look very much like part of the \"game\" and not just part of the world like the rest. It makes sense that they've done it, it's obviously important for the match 3 game to be clear and concise so that you can execute it as quickly as you need to but it's just a bit of a shame it doesn't fit in with the art more. There's so many different dishes in the game, all represented as incredible looking plates of food and all determined by what combination of ingredients you actually put in the dish to create them too.\n\nLastly the story, which is good, if not a bit basic. The real interest for me was the characters who are excellently written and each have a back story that I wanted to learn more about. There's a part of the main game where you stop playing as the main protagonist and control one of the other characters and play out more of his story, which was completely out of the blue and out of place chronologically, which was initially confusing, but welcome all the same. I don't think I missed a single conversation opportunity playing through the game, I always wanted to talk to the various characters hanging around town - [b]9/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1515173134, "timestamp_updated": 1515173134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39075834": {"recommendationid": "39075834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357646781", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 574, "last_played": 1515647333}, "language": "english", "review": "More people need to see this game.Ready for seconds!", "timestamp_created": 1515137506, "timestamp_updated": 1515137506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39074689": {"recommendationid": "39074689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093726039", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 165, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1066, "last_played": 1515206067}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc74c 2\ub9cc\uc6d0 \uc8fc\uace0 \uc0c0\ub294\ub370 \uadf8 \uc815\ub3c4 \uc81c\ud488\uc778\uac00? \uc2f6\uae34\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc18c\ud53c\uc758 \uc544\ud2c0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\uc758 \uc5f0\uae08\uc220 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \uc694\ub9ac\ubc29\uc2dd +\uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc5b4\ub4dc\ubca4\ucc98 \uac8c\uc784 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \uc0ac\ub0e5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubaa9\uc801\uc778\ub370 \uc778\ub514\uce58\uace0 \ud560\ub9cc\ud558\ub2e4 \uc218\uc900\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub9f5 \uc81c\uc678\ud558\uba74 \uc694\ub9ac\ud560 \ub54c \uc4f0\ub294 \ub9f5\uc740 3\uac1c. \uc870\uc885 \uac00\ub2a5 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\ub294 2\uac1c\uc774\uba70 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 6\uc2dc\uac04 \uc815\ub3c4.\n\n\uc5c5\uc801\ub3c4 \uac19\uc740 \uc694\ub9ac \ubc18\ubcf5\ud574\uc57c\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc5bc\ub9ac \ucfe1\uc624\ud504 \uad00\ub828\uc740 \uc9c4\uc9dc \ubcc4\ub85c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc694\uad6c\uce58\uac00 \ubb54\ub188\uc758 \ub204\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uc740 \ubcc0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c \ub178\uc7bc.\n\n\uc138\uc77c\ud560 \ub54c\uba74 \ubaa8\ub97c\uae4c \uc329\ub3c8\uc8fc\uace0 \uc0ac\uae30\ub294 \uc880 \uadf8\ub807\ub124\uc694.", "timestamp_created": 1515133405, "timestamp_updated": 1515159763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39074026": {"recommendationid": "39074026", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966986620", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 230, "last_played": 1515130474}, "language": "english", "review": "It's one of the best games to come out in 2017!

It\u2019s a unique combination and it\u2019s impressive how well each of the mechanics work together.\n\nThe story begins with you playing as a Battle Chef Brigade hopeful named Mina Han. She works in her family\u2019s restaurant but she thirsts to learn more in the ways of cooking. So, she decides to run away from home to join the Battle Chef Brigade tournament in the hopes of being accepted into their ranks. To win, she must challenge other chefs to cooking battles Iron Chef style.\n\nTo win a chef battle, you must incorporate the required ingredient in the meal as well as include the Judge\u2019s favorite magic element. Doing so will net you bonus points and make your meal that much more enjoyable to each judge. The game starts off easy with only one judge to please but as you progress you\u2019ll eventually need to make 3 different meals for each judge. You must do this within the time limit as well.\n\nTo get ingredients for your various meals, you need to fight monsters using the game\u2019s side scrolling beat \u2018em up style combat system. The combat system feels very fluid and you can chain together combos easily. There\u2019s a wide range of unique monsters for you to face during a battle and they each drop unique items to cook with.\n\nThere are a wide range of different cooking tools and sauces that you can utilize during a cooking battle as well. Sauces allow you to change the type of cooking gems you have in your food. Cooking tools include specialized pans, a slow cooker and frying pans to name only a few of them. These tools must be purchased from the shop in town.\n\nTo obtain money for the shop, you\u2019ll need to take part in various part time jobs which act as mini-games in between battles. It\u2019s highly recommended that you complete the part time jobs because they unlock new features in the game. There are 3 jobs to take part in. The first has you solving puzzles in order to unlock new cooking features, with the ultimate goal of acquiring ambrosia, the ultimate sauce. The second is based on the hunting of monsters and will allow you to acquire new combat abilities. And the third is a line cook job which has you cooking meals as quickly as possible.\n\nTo cook meals the game utilizes a match 3 style setup. The objective is to match 3 same colored cooking gems to create a more powerful version. This can be done twice until you have the best gem. The higher the level of the gem the more flavor you\u2019ll get out of it. So, if you want to flavor it with fire, having level 3 flavor gems throughout will flavor it with fire. If you have a specialized cooking pot you can move your dish to that and you\u2019ll be able to combine the specialized element with only 2 gems instead of 3. The slow cooker will also cook gems into higher level over time so it\u2019s a good idea to use it when you head out to gather more cooking ingredients.\n\nOverall, Battle Chef Brigade is an incredibly well put together game. From it\u2019s well written and voiced story to its fun combat system and addicting cooking mechanics, the game has quickly become a favorite of mine. The game is a highly addictive experience and the cooking battles were pretty intense. Especially when you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to come out the victor or not. If you have any love for Iron Chef or even cooking themed games, then I highly recommend this game, it\u2019s superb in every category.\n\nIf you're interest in checking out my full review or would simply like to see my final score, you can find the review here: http://www.endworldgaming.com/rpg/battle-chef-brigade-review\n\nThanks a lot for taking the time to read the review folks and happy gaming!", "timestamp_created": 1514928018, "timestamp_updated": 1514928018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38983839": {"recommendationid": "38983839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100583910", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514918403}, "language": "german", "review": "This Game is so beatiful.

As a chef attempting to battle her way, Iron-Chef-style, to join the Battle Chef Brigade, you fight monsters to gather ingredients, each with a particular flavor profile, and use these ingredients in a Candy Crush-esque mode to reduce the ingredients down to the best flavors possible -- all according to a given theme and within a time limit, of course. \n\nIt's everything I wanted, from beautiful graphics, a delightful soundtrack and voice acting, mixed in with a heartwarming tale, buoyed by your friends, old and new. \n\nThe downsides are that chapter 5 (out of 6) in particular is stilted and awkward -- the storyline, which built up suspense and an undercurrent of potential tragedy, forgoes that tension and thereby loses the suspension of disbelief, and the actual transition into this chapter is awkward and unexplained, leaving the player disoriented. It also doesn't help that the ending battle is slightly anticlimactic, being one of the easier battles. I'll also add that some of the playing mechanisms don't make a lot of sense i.e. not being able to change your equipment after hearing what the theme ingredient and flavors are.\n\nI'm a self professed casual gamer, rarely finishing games, particularly RPGs, preferring to give up rather than tough out another boss battle, but man oh man, did I play this game. I finished this in 2-3 days and have no regrets for any of those hours spent, restarting battles even when I might have won that round, trying to cook up that perfect dish. And rarely do I feel such a sense of bittersweetness when finishing a game -- pride for Mina and her friends, and sorrow, that our story together had already ended.", "timestamp_created": 1516257998, "timestamp_updated": 1516258256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39487146": {"recommendationid": "39487146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064243672", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 253, "last_played": 1516502415}, "language": "english", "review": "HECKIN ANIME IRON CHEF.

Somehow it managed to achieve so much depth in both the hunting, which is the metrovania-esque side-scroller combat, and cooking, which is a match-three syle puzzle mini-game that feels so satisfying, even for someone like me who is not the biggest fan of puzzle games. This kind of strategic and mechanical depth really scratches my itch in this kind of game.\n\nImagine being in one of those stressful grocery store cooking shows, only instead of shopping from the store, you are slaughtering monsters in the your backyard and gathering meat, and instead of cooking with pans, salt and pepper, you are cooking with poison, elemental pots and all the cool gear. How cool is that?\n\nThe combat feels responsive, the sound design makes it so everything you do feels satisfying, and the art is fantastic.\n\nStory is such an america-nime tropey feel-good story.

All I'll say is that I usually avoid the Match-3 genre like the plague, so that should put my praise for Battle Chef Brigade into context. I enjoy mindless destruction as much as the next guy, but there's something ever so alluring about the prospect of creating a thing. This game combines two sets of simple gameplay mechanics to bring you the best of both worlds - smash stuff, then collect the scraps and make a delicious meal out of them. \n\nSome moments that stuck out to me in this wonderful little game: \n\n- Even quite a while into the campaign, tutorials are nicely woven into the story. There is a narrative framework for everything that happens on screen. \n- I am often considered a cynic by my peers, yet this game's presentation of something as simple as a joyous family reunion made me tear up hard. \n- Juggling various timed orders during lunch rush made me reflect and develop empathy with fast food chefs. \n- Some of the things you cook during the competitions look so mouth-watering I have decided to improve my own cooking skills in order to create at least one such culinary wonder. \n- I am pleased to see Adult Swim continue to reinforce the notion that games can be challenging as b*lls without being grimdark and miserable all the time. \n\nNot the best game I've ever played by a long shot, but Battle Chef Brigade is a very unique thing that is well-made and well-presented, and if you're willing to move outside your comfort zone a little bit I'd say it is absolutely worth your money.", "timestamp_created": 1516401049, "timestamp_updated": 1516401049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

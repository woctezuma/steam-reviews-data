The game gives you some sentence starters and random phrases to put into your sentence.\n\nThis game made me want to fall asleep, and it's only 4:47pm.\n\nThe sentences are weird and if someone was to say them to me in real life, I would probably say something like \"Seriously? That's the best you could come up with?\".\n\nThe \"cutscenes\" before and after are not even related to this. The guy on the right comes in, says his parrot is dead, feels sad about it, then the game starts with the cringy comebacks, then afterwards, you say \"Go to my brothers, he'll give you a parrot\" and the other guy says \"Ok, I will go to your brothers\".\n\nThe game isn't even multiplayer, it's pretty much split-screen, as you can't play this game with friends on different computers, even though that would be awesome.\n\nThere's also a points system, which isn't really a points system, as it knocks out your opponents \"health\" bar. The points system is really stupid. I could say \"Your parrot is dead\" for 8 points.\n\nBut I do have to give kudos for the voice. Any sentence you put together will be read aloud.

Is a hiarious turn based linguistic puzzle game of sorts. The storyline is like something straight out of a Montey Python bit, whereas a constumer has returned to the show from which he has purchased an ex-parrot, it is no more, it has ceased to be. Players take turns exchanging insults piece by piece. A turn is completed when a player has selected a short phrase from a joint word bank or a personal work bank or when their time has run out. A round ends when both players are ready to insult eachother or when there are no more phrases left to be had. The game ends when one of the two player's HP bars reaches zero. The game is actually rather fast paced with limited time to read options and decide on the best course of action before time expires on your turn. For a game completed in 42 hours it's actually pretty awesome. I would have liked a handful of more phrase options through which to cycle for subsiquent rounds of play, but again, 42 hours.

So the game is actually more about \"forming correct English sentences\" rather than finding the best insult, because the options you get to pick from are entirely random.\n\nE.g. You may be given \"and\", \"is a hamster\", \"still uses Windows Vista\", \"your mother\", \"your favourite Bond actor\", \"the African swallow\", \"is interested in photography\", etc. If you're just starting a sentence, you have no choice but to select either \"your mother\", \"your favourite Bond actor\", or \"the African swallow\". And if you've already selected a noun, the next option you pick can only be \"is a hamster\", \"still uses Windows Vista\" or \"is interested in photography\".

I risultati veramente eccellenti fanno arrivare alla conclusione che in questo mercato sia pi\u00f9 deleteria la troppa ambizione rispetto alla mancanza di tempo, che costringe l'uomo a circoscrivere le proprie idee e razionalizzare i propri mezzi. Oh...Sir! \u00e8 un piccolo gioco multiplayer in locale arrivatoci da un team slavo. Il titolo prende diretta (direttissima oserei dire) ispirazione da \"The parrot sketch\" tratto dal Flying circus di Monty Python: consiglio veramente a tutti di cercarlo su youtube e goderselo (sono 5 minuti) prima di avviare questo prodotto. Il concept \u00e8 abbastanza simile a quello di Last Word di Twelve Tiles: occorre sconfiggere il proprio avversario a suon di parole, in questo caso decisamente... offensive. L'offesa in Oh...Sir! \u00e8 limitata da un set precostituito di carte, che andranno parzialmente distribuite in tavola e in minima porzione (due) in mano a ciascun giocatore. Obiettivo \u00e8 formare frasi sintatticamente plausibili (i coordinatori andranno a ruba!), possibilmente con un bell'enfatizzatore finale (da qui il titolo); il danno che l'avversario ricever\u00e0 se completerete una frase corretta sintatticamente sar\u00e0 proporzionato alla coerenza semantica dei costituenti. In questo senso Oh...Sir! \u00e8 un gioco molto interessante dal punto di vista linguistico e capisco perfettamente perch\u00e9 il set di item usabili sia abbastanza limitato. L'effetto comico \u00e8 comunque assicurato, con sintagmi adatti a un'atmosfera assolutamente pi\u00f9 \"contemporanea\" rispetto al contesto da gentlemen britannici di altri tempi che viene proposto a schermo; stessa comicit\u00e0 di contrasto si ricaver\u00e0 dalla prosodia decisamente slava dei doppiatori che si sforzano un po' goffamente di essere il pi\u00f9 \"British\" possibile. Un piccolo bug (o \u00e8 voluto?) confonde a volte i turni dei due giocatori, con il pappagallo stecchito che indica una persona diversa rispetto a quella evidenziata dalla luce: questo per\u00f2 \u00e8 senza dubbio un non-problema in un gioco in cui una spallata in pi\u00f9 al vostro avversario che inavvertitamente ha scelto qualcosa di poco adatto rispetto ai vostri piani non \u00e8 altro che un motivo di divertimento in pi\u00f9. In definitiva, ben consci delle limitazioni strutturali di un gioco che sembra ricercare un certo grado di coerenza, mi piacerebbe veramente vedere questo sistema di combattimento esteso a una campagna single player con tante situazioni e parole in pi\u00f9. Nel frattempo, Oh...Sir! ha una longevit\u00e0 direttamente proporzionale non alla quantit\u00e0 dei suoi contenuti, ma alle persone disposte a farsi due risate per una mezz'oretta in vostra

Gerade hat man sich in der Tierhandlung seines Vertrauens einen neuen Papagei geleistet und kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter ist dieser tot. Logische Konsequenz: Nichts wie zur\u00fcck zum Verk\u00e4ufer und diesem ordentlich seine Meinung geigen. Aus einem kleinen Pool an Satzst\u00fcckchen basteln wir uns nun die perfekte Beleidigung zusammen, bis wir unser Gegen\u00fcber durch unsere Sprachgewalt in Grund und Boden getreten haben. Das Spiel ist dabei ausschlie\u00dflich im lokalen Multiplayer spielbar. Die Rolle unseres Kontrahenten muss also in jedem Fall ein Freund \u00fcbernehmen. \n\nGRAFIK:\nDie Grafik ist in Oh...Sir! absolut nebens\u00e4chlich. Trotzdem wirkt der charmante Pixel-Stil durch und durch stimmig.\n\nLEVELGESTALTUNG: \nAbwechselnd w\u00e4hlen beide Spieler ein bis zwei Satzbausteine aus dem Pool, um eine m\u00f6glichst pfeffernde Beleidigung zu kreieren. Das Spiel bewertet dann die Beleidigungs-St\u00e4rke und zieht nach und nach Punkte aus der Lebensleiste ab. Au\u00dferdem gibt es noch einige weitere kleine Features, die etwas mehr Komplexit\u00e4t in die Sache bringen. Durch die gut gew\u00e4hlten Satzbausteine lassen sich einige bl\u00f6dsinnige und witzige Beleidigungen erschaffen.\n\nUMFANG:\nLeider enth\u00e4lt das Spiel aber nur wenige Satzteile; dadurch hat man nach einigen Durchg\u00e4ngen schon alles gesehen. Schade, hier w\u00e4re noch mehr drin gewesen. Au\u00dferdem sind Runden, wie schon erw\u00e4hnt, nur im lokalen Multiplayer m\u00f6glich.\n\nBALANCE:\nDie Bewertungen der Beleidigungen und die damit verbundenen Minuspunkte f\u00fcr die gegnerische Lebensleiste fallen \u00fcberraschend plausibel aus. Nur selten habe ich mich hier ungerecht bewertet gef\u00fchlt. Auch die Bedienung durch eine einzige Maus funktioniert gut. \n\nATMOSPH\u00c4RE:\nDie fertiggestellten Beleidigungen werden durch eine Person mit starkem russischen Akzent vorgetragen. Das ist in diesem Fall aber nicht weiter schlimm, sondern eher belustigend und tr\u00e4gt, zusammen mit der auch sonst etwas fragw\u00fcrdigen Soundkulisse, zur trashigen Stimmung bei.\n\nWEITERES:\nDas Spiel ist komplett kostenlos.\n\nFAZIT:\n[h1]Komisches, witziges und kurzweiliges Spiel mit interessantem Spielkonzept und wenig Umfang f\u00fcr eine unterhaltsame halbe Stunde mit Freunden ![/h1]\n\nWERTUNG: [h1]70[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1451670822, "timestamp_updated": 1504449613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525904", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20185777": {"recommendationid": "20185777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085304235", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451828229}, "language": "english", "review": "Your favourite Bond actor worked with the Nazis and still uses Windows Vista, and I have proof!", "timestamp_created": 1451668854, "timestamp_updated": 1451668854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20171028": {"recommendationid": "20171028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049444934", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470971673}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774\uac8c \uc544\ubd80\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud584\uc2a4\ud130\uc778\uac8c \uae4c\ubd88\uc5b4!\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1451630485, "timestamp_updated": 1451630485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20169672": {"recommendationid": "20169672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095180069", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451566136}, "language": "english", "review": "Damn this game is the best!

share the same mouse (or whatever you use) or two mice, either way allowing for tons of cheating.\n\nMajor Things:\n\n1: The scoring system. It's broken. Really, really broken. My opponent insulted me by saying \"That dog is a english dog pig, I bet!\" (which would actually harm his own health) and I insulted him by saying \"You are vile, sir!\" and he scored a ton more than me. If you don't see what's wrong there...\n2: Some word combinations that should work don't, such as \"Your hovercraft talks to strangers and your hat, mate!\" doesn't work because it wants a verb after \"your hat\", so when I tried picking \"mate!\" it damaged me for making a bad choice... what!?\n3: You know what I said about the airplane this game was made in?

gentlemen arguing about a dead parrot. A 2-player game where the winner is determinated by the one who has the best insult. The better the insult, the higher your chances to win. For example: \"Your mother still uses windows vista, sir!\" or \"Your father is stone dead\". It's not anything revolutionary, but it's funny. It's a game developed in a very short time, so don't expect anything with superb quality, specially because it's a free game. And this aspect is notably cheap in terms of voice acting. But, thinking about it, the cheap voice acting is part of it's awkward charm.\nIf you have someone to play \"Oh...Sir\" with, you will have a lot of fun. And by a lot of fun, I mean you will play it for about 15 minutes, and then probably you will delete it from your Steam library. Not because it's bad, just because it doesn't have a lot of content (or any content at all), and after this 15 minutes you will notice that the insult options are very limited. But still, give it a try. Those 15 minutes will be awkwardly funny. \nBut make yourself a favor, if you are going to play it alone, don't even think to download it. Or the gameplay value will reduce to 5 minutes. Because trying to insult yourself isn't very fun. But maybe you have a different definition of what's \"fun\".", "timestamp_created": 1450799049, "timestamp_updated": 1450799049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19844805": {"recommendationid": "19844805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013600577", "num_games_owned": 1147, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450798629}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Your favorite bond actor worked with the nazis and has butt cancer, nudge nudge!\" \n\nthis insult needed to be posted somewhere for future reference", "timestamp_created": 1450798877, "timestamp_updated": 1450798877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556571", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19844684": {"recommendationid": "19844684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080993332", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450839113}, "language": "english", "review": "This simple, but fun game teaches you about scentence creation and many common day phrases such as:\n\nYour hamster has butt cancer and is getting fat!\nYour father smells of elderberries and still uses windows vista!\nThis parrot worked with the nazis, and I have proof!\nYour maths teacher is an english dog pig and was a platipus, nudge nudge!\nThis conversation is vile and your hat is not interesting, and I have proof!

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the new Free-To-Play game on Steam, Oh...Sir! Oh....Sir! was released on Steam on December 21st, 2015 by Developer Vile Monarch and Publisher Gambitious Digital Entertainment.\n\nVideo Review: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/lDp48htyflc\n\nThe \"Too Long, Didn't Watch\" Review:\n\nIt is Free, it was made in 42 hours. Funny concept, could use more lines. 2/5\n\nThe \"Meat & Potatoes\" Review:\n\nIt take a second to realize the turn-patter/rhythm of the game. It is actually a pretty cool and funny concept that could very easily be developed into a fantastic game. As is, the dialogue is SEVERELY limited. Do keep in mind, this game was made in a mere 42 hours and is also quite free. It is worth a try. Go give it a few clicks, spend about 5-10 minutes with it. Hell, I could even see it being a fun drinking game as is. Great concept and I would LOVE to see a fully fleshed out, online-multiplayer version. Maybe even with a random partner drawn for each round. All things considered, 2/5 simply because it's likely you'll try it, love the concept, but not play the game again.\n\nHappy Gaming!\n", "timestamp_created": 1450761148, "timestamp_updated": 1450761148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554610", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19837128": {"recommendationid": "19837128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046353121", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450760445}, "language": "english", "review": "Roasting simulator 2015", "timestamp_created": 1450760662, "timestamp_updated": 1450760662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19837116": {"recommendationid": "19837116", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970711811", "num_games_owned": 887, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450760512}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an intriguing little piece, and readily punishes any grammatical errors.\n\nI look forward to seeing its development into a fully fleshed out title in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1450760618, "timestamp_updated": 1450760618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19837094": {"recommendationid": "19837094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091807703", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450746151}, "language": "english", "review": "Gets very repetitive soon afterwards.

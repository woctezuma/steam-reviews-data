The game looks amazing in Tate(vertical monitor orientation). The game features working leaderboards and the ability to save replays, which is great for chasing high-scores.\n\nThe only downside to this steam version is that it lacks the enhanced Judgement Silver Sword games that were included on the Xbox disc.  The publishers/developers seem to have decided to split these great games off into a seperate steam purchase(also an excellent port now that they've finally added leardboards that were initally missing).\n\nIf you like shooters/shmups support this game, it's great!", "timestamp_created": 1480105708, "timestamp_updated": 1480106060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27289234": {"recommendationid": "27289234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027987317", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480015351}, "language": "polish", "review": "Jeden z lepszych shmup\u00f3w z jakimi mia\u0142em ostatnio do czynienia.

Cela paraitra peut \u00eatre excessif aux yeux de certains mais c'est en tout cas   le titre qui m'aura le plus accroch\u00e9 parmis toute la vague de shmups jap' sortit \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque sur la XBOX 360. Effectivement j'ai d'abord connu Eschatos dans sa version original sur console, un jeu que je connais donc fort bien pour l'avoir en plus 1CC (en original normal du moins !). Si au d\u00e9but graphiquement on est plut\u00f4t surpris par le minimalisme de ses graphismes, on comprend vite que ce d\u00e9faut apparant et en v\u00e9rit\u00e9 une force du jeu tant la lisibilit\u00e9 est parfaite en plus de lui conf\u00e9rer une aura particuli\u00e8re et unique ! La musique met l'ambiance et est tr\u00e8s accrocheuses (Sweep Record inside !) mais ce qui rend ce jeu absolument g\u00e9nial, accrocheur et extr\u00eamement addictif est la mani\u00e8re dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit ! \n\nLe jeu est construit en vague qui s'enchaine sans temps mort du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin, servis par une bonne mise en sc\u00e8ne dynamique, la difficult\u00e9 est extr\u00eamement bien calibr\u00e9 quelque soit le mode de jeux (et la difficult\u00e9 sur 4 degr\u00e9s) et les vagues (placement et nombre d'ennemi, vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des pi\u00e8ges etc) sont la aussi extr\u00eamement bien calibr\u00e9. La grande force d'Eschatos \u00e9tant clairement son level et game design, sa jouabilit\u00e9 et son ambiance d\u00e9licieusement arcade teint\u00e9 de retro   tout en \u00e9tant unique.\n\nIl faut vari\u00e9 entre un tir \u00e9vas\u00e9 ou un tir concentr\u00e9, on a aussi un bouclier qui est une boule se formant \u00e0 l'avant du vaisseau et ne prot\u00e9geant que cette partie ! Les vagues sont con\u00e7us de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 trouver la meilleur fa\u00e7on d'utiliser son \u00e9quipement et on est tr\u00e8s vite pris au jeu de trouver la fa\u00e7on la plus efficiente de passer les niveaux pour accroitre son multiplicateur de point !

Those familiar with the predecessors will find many aspects of this game more than a little recognizable.  Sadly, gone are all the judges and sins.  The story line of ESCHATOS can be summed up in about two sentences: Aliens have invaded the earth and captured the moon!  It is your mission to save the Earth! \n\nIt's about the depth of story one might expect from a shoot 'em up.  One might say it's even preferable to have a bare bones story.  After all, if you're playing a shmup do you really want to see things like dialogue and cut scenes?  Having said all of this, I would have liked to see them build a little bit more on the judges that they introduced in the previous games.  It would have been more unique than an alien invasion.  While the judges themselves may be things of the past, it isn't entirely fair to say that they're gone.\n\nMany of the enemies in ESCHATOS are recreations of the ones in Judgement Silversword.  Not only are they similar in appearance, some of them even have the same attack patterns.  When a mirror shield showed up I didn't recognize it, but as soon as it started firing I knew exactly what it was.  I was prepared to fight it too, as the ship in this game works almost exactly the same as it did in the earlier games.  It has a straight shot, a spread shot, and a shield.  The main differences are the shield being far more useful and the spread shot having significantly less reach.  It's also no longer possible to combine the straight and spread shots through rapid button tapping.\n\nThe game has three modes of play: original, advanced, and time attack.  Original is a very traditional mode that features screen clearing blue bombs that can be picked up without penalty.  Time attack is what it sounds like, you try to clear the game as fast as possible.  Advanced is a little more complicated than normal.  Your ship starts off very weak and can be strengthened via pickups.  The power ups will raise your attack power, lower your shield power, and increase your score multiplier.  There are two screen clearing bombs in this mode, but picking up either does the exact opposite of a power up.  A blue bomb will simply destroy everything on the screen, but a gold one will transform bullets into purple shards.  The shards can be picked up for points or transformed into temporary damaging orbitals by activating the shield.  It was a little tricky for me to figure it out without any instructions but it's a lot of fun once you get used to it.  Original and advanced have the following difficulty options: easy, normal, hard, hardest, and endless.  Whether you're completely new to the genre, or an arcade veteran, there will be something here for you.\n\nThere has been a major update in graphics since the days of the Wonderswan.  This is easily one of the most cinematic games I've ever played.  The stages flow into each other so effectively that it almost feels like watching a movie about a lone ship taking down an alien invasion.  Unlike many games there aren't really breaks between stages, the whole game is continuous.  It is handled very well, however there were a few perspective changes that I initially found to be very confusing.  After playing a few times I got the hang of it, but I can imagine some players finding it frustrating.  In addition to the  perspective changes, there is one bullet type I had trouble with at first.  I didn't find the semi-transparent green homing ribbons to be as visible as they probably should be considering their danger level.  Much like the perspective changes I was able to get used to them eventually, but I believe the developers handled these projectiles better in Judgement Silversword.  Aside from the visuals, it would be remiss of me not to mention the audio.  The soundtrack is so outstanding I've found myself listening to a few of the tracks on repeat.\n\nWhen I first started playing ESCHATOS I wasn't so sure about it.  As cool as the cinematic game play was, the perspective shifts in several stages really had me questioning the style.  After putting some time into it, it has really grown on me a lot.  The scoring system is based around killing every enemy in a wave to increase your multiplier.  I found it to be straightforward, challenging, and a whole lot of fun.  It's a shame that this game doesn't seem to be very popular. It's a very solid shoot 'em up.  M-Kai and Qute have done a great job here. I'd certainly recommend it to fans of shooting games.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review?

It's basically a spirtual successor to Judgement Silversword which is also awesome. \n\nThe aesthetic and OST have a great Dreamcasty nostalgic feel which is very fun. The gameplay is a perfect example of easy to learn, difficult to master which I love--unlike some crazy Cave game where you have to search for hours of poorly translated Japanese websites to decipher the BS, overly-complicated scoring/chaining system. (Looking at you, Espgaluda II. I'm not bitter though. Ok, maybe a little bit.) You just shoot every little thing zipping by on the screen to build a multiplier. Miss a little missle or die, lose the multiplier. Simple, fun, addictive.\n\nNo bombs in this one, but you have something arguably better: a shield that regnerates. It doesn't make you invincible but it can cut through like 90% of the crap this game throws at you. So if you suck at scoring (like me) and are focused on survival at first you can just whip out that trusty shield. Good stuff. \n\nLike JSS this game doesn't both with overly long transitions or breaks between the actions--instead of 4-5 big levels there's 26ish stages that break up a bunch of mini sections and bosses. Like JSS, this gives the action an amazing flow and makes you feel like you're also pushing forward. There's also a generous amount of stocks so that the game usually feels fair apart from a couple weird camera angles that take some getting used to. \n\nSo yeah, buy it. You'll like it. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467621068, "timestamp_updated": 1467621068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24050592": {"recommendationid": "24050592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076484810", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509627413}, "language": "english", "review": "Initially released in 2011 for Xbox 360 and then ported to PC (Steam) in 2015, Eschatos is a modern vertical shoot'em up that is a spiritual sequence of the classic Judgement Silversword but with much more modern production values. The gameplay and control scheme is very similar to its predecessor: you have two types of weapons, being one more concentrated and long-range and other more spread shot, but short-range as well as the shield. Both the weapons and the shield are activated by pressing buttons on the controller. The gameplay offers good challenge and it's fun. The graphics are ok, but the great highlight of this game in my opinion is the great soundtrack beautifully crafted and pleasant to hear, making this game a truly immersive experience.  Eschatos is therefore more a good shmup born in the harvest of the seventh generation of consoles.

First of all, this game is rather casual-friendly. Even those who struggles on Easy will be able to unlock more content in the game by accumulating score and some of the unlocked features includes access to more continues and raising the starting amount of lives. On top of that, the player has access to a shield which allows to block enemy projectiles with ease if it's not overused. There's more unlockables and while most of them are simple, they're a neat addition.\n\nFurthermore, the other modes such as Time Attack (losing a life results in losing time while gaining one gives time) and Advanced (different features such as leveling up your weapon in exchange of shield power) allows for different experiences that are fun on their own as well. The game is fairly short but all of these little features ultimately gives a very fun casual experience. JUDGEMENT SILVERSWORD -Resurrection- is another great addition despite it's age and it's a good pick for fans of Shoot Em' Up games.\n\nHowever, the game is more about getting a high score and losing a continue will wipe out all points that were accumulated when all lives were lost. Losing less lives also grants a big bonus when the game is completed since each of them are converted in a large amount of points. Advanced mode also gives points in different ways than Classic. The other difficulty modes quickly gets much harder but they feel balanced and they're a good challenge for more experienced players.\n\nThe game ran rather well on my computer but as stated in some other reviews, the game lags indeed in certain points. The most notable moments are after destroying certain mid-bosses later in the game while the gameplay continued. Fortunately, it indeed hasn't been too much of an issue.\n\nA special note should go for the soundtrack of the game by Yousuke Yasui. It is easily one of the best soundtrack in a Shoot Em' Up ever (I'd go as far as to say in general) and the arranged soundtrack is really worth it. The music is literally the reason why I was ever introduced to this game and why I got it.\n\nI actually have a physical version of this game and I swore to myself that I'd get it on Steam to support Qute if it ever popped up and I'm really happy that it did. I really hope that Ginga Force will be ported to PC as well a translation would be wonderful (there's actual plot in the game) and that Natsuki Chronicle also shows up on PC at some point when the game gets released on Xbox One.", "timestamp_created": 1448587151, "timestamp_updated": 1448587151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19206200": {"recommendationid": "19206200", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996799433", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504937822}, "language": "english", "review": "A great shmup with lots of replayability and one of the best soundtracks ever.

Don't be too proud to play on Easy; taking aim for a one-credit clear (1CC) on Easy will set you up with many of the skills you'll need to survive the more challenging difficulties, which hurl more complex bullet patterns at you and have fewer instances of enemy waves you can clear by sitting in one place on the screen firing.\n\nThe game comes with two main modes as well as an addictive Time Attack mode. Personally, I prefer the simplicity of Original mode, since the upgradeable weapons and multiplier mechanics in Arrange mode are a bit distracting. You have the choice, though, and there are separate leaderboards for each.\n\nDon't be fooled by the relatively unremarkable-looking screenshots; this is a game that looks glorious in motion, with dramatic, sweeping changes in the background perspective and one of the most wonderfully thrilling \"little moments\" from any shoot 'em up I can remember: the ascent into space in the second stage. The music -- in both its original FM synth style and the more modern-sounding Arrange version -- complements the action perfectly, and the high-speed, vomit-inducing rollercoaster ride of the final stage really brings things to a suitably epic climax.\n\nI hadn't touched this game before its Steam release, despite owning the 360 version; now it's one of my favourite shmups of all time.

Wherever there is an alien menace or a war, there is always that one ship, that one person, who with no shields or health meters or a chance in hell, will singlehandedly destroy everything in thirty minutes. Eschatos is the hyper-kinetic story of mankind's struggle against invaders from space in the year 21XX. It's certainly a familiar plot, and long-time shmup fans will notice many similarities and references to other classics. Even the Eschatos logo is a call-back to [i]Xevious[/i]. However, don't mistake this game as a mere nostalgia-fest, it does more than enough to stand on its own.\n\nEschatos works with a philosophy I like to call \"choice and sacrifice\". You're given two weapons, and can choose between the two of them at any moment. The forward-shot reaches all the way to the end of the screen, while the side-shot doesn't go nearly as far, but does cover two angles on both ends of your ship. Now in the thirty minutes it takes to save the world, you're going to switch between those weapons constantly. The situation is changed not just by the enemies you face, but also by the weapon you use to deal with them. The sacrifice comes from what you're giving up, in order to achieve your goals. Scoring and survival are tied to how you adjust to the decisions that you make.\n\nFirst off, let's take into consideration the side-shot. When using this weapon, you can deal with adversaries that spawn from multiple locations, and cover a wider area. However, you can't affect what's directly in front of you. An enemy ship could barrel right into you and that'd be the end of that. In order to deal with this possibility, you have to move around, making absolutely sure that every enemy is appropriately dealt with. In simple terms, the scoring system is based around \"no survivors\". Your multiplier increases at various set points, but every enemy that makes it off-screen causes it to decrease. \n\nSecondly, we have the forward-shot. This tends to be a go-to weapon, with its long reach and high level of power. Due to its lack of spread, you have to make up the difference through your maneuverability. This is where the speed-setting can come into play. By switching to faster speeds, you can cover ground (or air) quickly, moving to intercept everything that crosses your path. When the bosses and certain enemy configurations start flooding the screen with bullets, you'll want slower speeds to safely weave in-between the nastiness. \n\nThere are times where you will make the ultimate sacrifice. No, I'm not talking about dying. Upon completion of the game, you receive a hefty bonus for every player-ship that survives the onslaught. What I'm speaking of is your score, or rather, the decision to put survival over everything else. By holding both fire buttons down, you produce a shield. It's not often you get one of these babies in a traditional 2D shooter. By using this shield you can absorb a great many projectiles, or slow them down enough so you can move out of the way. Also, the weakest enemies -- the ones most likely to ram you -- are easily dealt with. However, if you're using the shield, you're not firing, and a handful of enemies flying away could take the entirety of your multiplier with them. \n\nNow there are other factors to consider, such as the screen-clearing bombs that spawn every now and again, but for the most part, you're going to be making decisions, weighing the pros and cons of them, and reacting to how these decisions change the game. It's a lot to think about, especially for a game packed with aliens trying to destroy you, at every possible moment. Eschatos is also very situational. While it can said that the game is 5 stages long, it's really divided into 26 areas. Within each area you can expect everything from swarms of minor enemies, to a mini-boss, to some behemoth of a UFO, or something unique. Again, this is a thirty minute game, so the pacing is breakneck, and in a way it moves quicker than similar shooters. All in all, it makes for an awesome experience, as well as (more importantly) a challenging and very entertaining game.\n\nYou may also want to try the Advanced mode. This isn't a harder difficulty per se, but it adds another layer of complexity. The first thing you'll notice is that the weapons have changed, they've become much weaker. Now, you have to grab power-ups. Power-ups have the added benefit of increasing your multiplier, so naturally you'll want to be fully powered as often as possible. Now this is where it gets interesting; the power-up pods can also drop bombs. They have the same effect as in the Original mode, but with the added benefit of turning all enemy bullets into delicious point-filled crystals. However, by grabbing a bomb, you lose one level of power, along with the subsequent multiplier. Do you grab the bomb for the extra points, expecting another multiplier in time for a bigger bonus upon the defeat of the next boss? Or do you AGGGGGHHHHH! ...Oh I mean do you crash head-first into an enemy while mulling over the long-term affects of your score? This is why I consider the Advanced mode to be more difficult. It requires that you think more often, and thinking can be a distraction in itself, when you're dealing with the constant threat of UFOs and their many bullets.\n\nOne of the subtle, but very smart decisions by Qute for this game is the level-up system. Upon the end of a game, your score is counted as experience, which results in unlockables. This includes everything from extra credits, to new backgrounds, to an assortment of other goodies. Incentives to replay a game are always nice, since they give the player more opportunities to get better at it. [i]Mars Matrix[/i] had a similar system, where you used points to buy everything. I prefer the way it's handled in this game, since there aren't particular stages that can be grinded for a higher pay-out. I played a lot of stages 5 & 6 of [i]Mars Matrix[/i], and let me tell you, I am still awful at that game. Since I start every game of Eschatos from the beginning, I have a much better chance of actually improving. Additional difficulties as well as Endless and Time-Attack modes round out this release. \n\nAs far as the port-quality goes, you've read it in most other reviews, and you'll read it in this one. There are some slight frame-rate issues at various points in the game. For what it's worth, I never died when those incidents occured. I've died a great many times elsewhere, but never when the frames took a hit. Hopefully those can get ironed out at some point (both the frame-rate issues and my deaths). Otherwise, I don't have any complaints. For the price, this is a very solid port.\n\nEschatos is an altogether remarkable entry in the 2D shooter genre. Needless to say, there are far more shmups than anyone could possibly have time for, but this game does enough to stand out. It marries traditional aesthetics and game-design, with a more modern approach. The scoring system is easy to grasp and immensely rewarding. It also understands the tricky balance that can come from appealing to its roots. All to often we get these throw-back games that are so buried in references that we don't see anything original or creative. Eschatos keeps the name-dropping to a minimum, and delivers on what matters most, a clear, concise, and enjoyable 2D shooter for gamers of all skill levels.\n\n[i]Disclaimer: For the purpose of this review, a key was provided by the publisher.[/i]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1444054303, "timestamp_updated": 1444481487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704176", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18239297": {"recommendationid": "18239297", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972290549", "num_games_owned": 1456, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446318491}, "language": "english", "review": "Here's my video of the 360 version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5cSwB2i9SE\n\nGreat shmup with an amazing OST (don't skip the OST, so worth it).

I played it a fair bit on the 360 and it compares favourably to many of its contemporaries on that platform. This means it's a huge cut above the average shooter, and a shining example of what true \"arcade quality\" is like. Indeed, though it did not to my knowledge receive an arcade release, it's very much an arcade experience. \n\nThis is a game you come to because you have some spare time and you want to ride a rollercoaster! It's all about in-the-moment take-nothing-for-granted high octance action. When you start the game up, you don't know if you're going to crash and burn by the first boss, or blaze a trail of destruction straight to the enemy's front door. It all depends on you, and that's what keeps it engaging when time after time you come back to it.\n\nThat being understood, there's lots to like about this game. The 2.5D graphics, exquisite music and cinematic camera work give a real sense of drama to the game. Like, \"oh my god now I'm facing the real boss!\" But it's when you look at the gameplay, mechanics and design that things get really interesting.\n\nIt's not your typical shmup so it's hard to compare it directly to others in the genre; on the one hand, the level of bullets is certainly par for a bullet hell game, but the game also encourages you to  destroy entireties of enemy waves - and it's designed to make this challenging and fun - so it's not a dodge 'em up - it has a much more classic, visceral feel. (Though I suppose the references to Space Invaders and Galaga also play their part!) Add into this the particular weapons loadout (the shield being the most notable part) correct use of which demands more than typical shmup tactics - and you've got quite a distinct experience.\n\nThere's a good amount of content too. This comes in the form of different variations on \"the game\" which let you play and replay it again and again in different ways. These are Original, Advanced, Time Attack and Endless modes. The meatiest of these are Original and Advanced, which differ in scoring mechanics and weapon power ups. But they also each have four difficulty settings. \"Easy\" is of course only named so in relation to the others, and while clearing the game on this mode is a manageable challenge, it is distinctly non trivial. \n\nWhat I find particularly pleasing is how the different difficulty modes are balanced so that each step up really feels like \"a different beast\" It makes playing each of them a distinct experience that's fun in its own way. As your proficiency with the game increases, you can always go back to \"Easy\" mode and focus on the Original and Advanced scoring systems - or you can crank it up and surrender yourself to a whirlwind of bullets for that pure survival \"I can't believe I've got this far!\" experience. It's really just a matter of how far you let it take you!\n\nLastly, a word on the \"Wonder Pack\". This includes the OST (DRM free and ACE) and \"Judgment Silversword - Rebirth\" which has its own store page and is actually a compilation of the two games that came before this one. They come recommended, too, so the Wonder Pack is great value if you're interested in the older games.  \n\nThanks for reading!", "timestamp_created": 1443213660, "timestamp_updated": 1443213660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18188587": {"recommendationid": "18188587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002510306", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507906142}, "language": "english", "review": "Releaced back in 2011 for the Xbox 360 by the company Qute, Eschatos was a SHMUP/STG that would end up doing a lot with very little. It's a game that rewards those who strive to shoot every single target that shows up, in the fastest possible manner avalable. \n\nTo go into greater detail, the game's scoring relises on two aspects that go hand in hand. First is your multiplyer, that grows in turn with every wave ( 2nd wave on normal, 3rd on easy ) you clear out fully, but drops for EACH foe you in turn fail to kill. Not only that, but there's also a timer for each wave, and with it a massive score bonus in turn that keeps ticking away the longer it takes you to kill-em-all. With these two factors pushing you forward, the game already leads itself towards a very 'agressive' playing style, far more then even things like DoDonPatch would suggest given how it's chain system works. \n\nThen again this game gives you every tool you would need to acheave this goal as the Eschatos comes well equiped with 3 diffferent weapon types. Your standered shot goes full screen height and deals moderate damage. Your spread shot in turn only goes 1/3 height but covers your sides in full, and your final weapon is the Shield, able to null projectiles, more less useful as a direct attack dealing the most damage of all. \n\nYour ablility to make use of all 3 weapon types, more less to keep them vaired, is really put towards the test wave after wave of foes, that never quite work the same way twice. There's a fair amount of randomness with each wave, and this gets compounded in turn based off of how you use your weapons, and gain in score, with the game ramping up in difficulty to match you in skill. \n\nHonestly, if you're a fan of the SHMUP/STG style gameplay, this game will give you a great time, and is perfect for replaying in turn. With fuctions like replay saving, Leaderboards with replays, a mass of unlockable options like new boarders or ship styles, and at least 3 different game modes and 4 difficulty settings to train yourself on, this game's worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1443201819, "timestamp_updated": 1443201819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18181631": {"recommendationid": "18181631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016859256", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497115272}, "language": "english", "review": "Eschatos is a 2d bullet hell shmup that fuses oldschool design fundamentals with newschool depth and polish. Unlike many modern shmups, which focus entirely on dodging and esoteric scoring mechanics, Eschatos prioritizes balancing offense and defense with its unique weapon and shield mechanic against unpredictable enemies who's quirky movement makes them as challenging to hit as they are to dodge against. \n\nPlayers have the ability to shoot a long ranged and powerful straight shot, or a short range but blind-spot covering wide shot. Combining these two attacks allows you to create a shield that destroys bullets and enemies alike, but that must be recharged whilst not in use. Enemies come in waves, and the faster and the more completely you destroy these waves, the higher your score climbs and the faster the games pace accelerates.\n\nEschatos's weapons are double edged swords. Fire straight too much, and enemies will charge you from the side. Cover your sides for too long with the wide shot, and long range attackers will litter the screen with bullets. The shield itself is as much a weapon as it is protection, not only blocking bullets but allowing you to thrillingly charge straight through enemy attacks to more effectively shoot them, or even ram them. Using it too much however, will result in enemies piling up and overwhelming the player.\n\nEschatos's unique  weapon balance, varied and unpredictable enemies (who's attacks and positions are frequently semi randomized, to encourage fun improvisation and nervy reaction), endearing and innocent sounding soundtrack, rapid pace, and deep scoring system make it a game brimming with personality and fusing the best of both worlds from classic shmups and modern bullet hell.

Your ship is equipped with two weapons, a low velocity spread gun and a higher velocity forward laser. In the thick of the battle you will find your ship's shield extra useful too, as it absorbs most of the enemy projectiles, at the cost of energy and can also be used to ram small fliers.

I like to think of it as a modern day Zanac (which is one of my favorite games of all time), where underneath the mediocre aesthetics and muted presentation, lies a game full of depth and complexity. A shmup that was crafted with such quality, it became one of the standout examples of excellence in the genre.\n\nOn top of that, much has already been said about the high quality of the soundtrack.

Lower end laptops will need to drop the settings back and might get some framerate hiccups occasionally, but nothing that would make it unplayable. Keys currently aren't fully remappable, but Degica seems to have a good track record with addressing player concerns.\n\nBeyond that, I just want to run through some of the things that make Eschatos stand out to me.\n\n- The game is forgiving. It's not an easy game, but extra lives are fairly plentiful. You never really feel like you need to restart after losing a life, or that you end up in an unrecoverable situation. There's no getting sent back to checkpoints or getting reduced to an unusable power level.\n\n- The scoring mechanics are straightforward. Essentially, you increase a multiplier for killing entire enemy waves, and your multiplier drops when enemies escape the screen. There are some other considerations, especially in Advanced mode, but the multiplier's most of it. There's no barrier for entry to playing for score.\n\n- This isn't the kind of game where you can just memorize the levels and get through it. You need to learn how the enemy patterns work and react to what you do, especially if you want to keep your multiplier going. \n\n- Enemies all feel unique. Even the popcorn enemies. The scoring mechanics emphasize not letting any enemies escape alive, enemies are built around being inconvenient to kill, and they achieve this in a variety of ways.\n\n- You have three attack types -- a wide shot, a frontal shot, and a shield -- available at all time. They're all have distinct purposes and they're all useful.\n\n- Bombs are used as soon as you pick them up -- there's no bomb stock.\n\n- The game is as much about managing your shield as it is about dodging bullets. \n\n- The game likes throwing weird camera angles at you and it actually works. Weird camera angels in SHMUPs do not usually work.\n\n- Time Attack mode isn't a time-limited caravan mode like you usually see in SHMUPs, but instead is more like Outrun. You get the whole game here, and you have a limited amount of time to finish it. Clearing areas/beating bosses/picking up 1-ups gets you more time. Getting shot makes you lose time. \n\n- The way the music is used is noteworthy. The soundtrack itself is excellent, yes, but in game, it's almost like the enemy waves are choreographed to the music?

I have been waiting a while to be able to get a chance to play this game, and so far in my first couple of trial runs it has not disappointed one bit. Eschatos is a spiritual successor to the Wonderswan STG Judgment Silversword and as such is a vertically-scrolling wave-based shooter, with a hectic pace and lots of cool boss fights. There is a long-range straight shot for dealing with more powerful enemies, and a short-range spread shot for dealing with the waves of weaker enemies (popcorn, \"zakos\" or whatever else you would like to call them) which will swarm at you from all directions. The game is fairly high in its bullet count however the game goes lengths to not feel like a \"generic\" bullet hell title that you may see from other developers.\n\nAll of this is backed up by a sharp presentation with hectic perspective changes and a stunning retro-inspired soundtrack by one of my personal favourite videogame OST composers - Yousuke Yasui.\n\nSo overall I would recommend this title based on my experiences thus far.", "timestamp_created": 1442620223, "timestamp_updated": 1442620223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542679", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18091166": {"recommendationid": "18091166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018973696", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513861362}, "language": "english", "review": "Dont normally write reviews for games but i'll make an exception for this game.\n\nIf you love Shmups then this is an instabuy, never got a chance to play this on the 360 but was really happy when I heard that it was coming to steam.\n\n10/10 fantastic game and easy to pick even for non hardcore shmup fans!", "timestamp_created": 1442618940, "timestamp_updated": 1442618940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 73, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 77}}

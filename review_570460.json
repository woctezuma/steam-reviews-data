Given the current size of the community (some say the community is dead), I honestly struggled a bit to get to just under 75 hours of gameplay. I'm trying my best to will my way to prestiging in the game versus pretty much all AI. It's a slog.\n\nWhen the community was bustling during beta and the early days of early access, I was extremely happy. This game is so frantic and fun, I honestly enjoy it more than other arcade-y sports games like Rocket League. Where with Rocket League I feel like I'm always fighting with my controller, Laser League has very natural movement that make me feel in complete control. When I die in Laser League, it's usually due to a stupid mistake or an outstanding play by the other team. In Rocket League, I feel like I miss shots because, well, it's not exactly easy to control a flying car and hit a ball perfectly (though I still do love Rocket League!).\n\nAnyway, people ask me if they should still buy this game right now. There's just no way I could possibly recommend it to anyone until one of two things happen: the developers pump massive money into marketing - we're talking advertising on a pretty massive scale catered towards sports enthusiasts and esports fantatics. Say, like during the NBA finals, World Series, Super Bowl all the way in 2019, or release this game on PS4 and other consoles, but make it a PS Plus game for a month to rope people in for free and give the game a much needed shot in the arm player base-wise. As it is right now, I'm seeing only 6 people playing the game at 8:30pm on a Saturday night (pacific time). That's tragically sad.\n\nI will keep playing this game for as long as I can stomach it. Do I recommend this game? ABSOLUTELY! If you can get a free code or something. It's a ton of fun, especially with friends. But I just can't recommend a $15 purchase of this game - a heavily multiplayer dependent game - until the player base increases.

There's no pay 2 win elements, and no matter how advanced a player gets they get no boosters or abilities based on how long they've been playing.\n\nThe only thing is, if you start playing and get beaten alot in the first 1-2 hours playing, stick with it.

Arenas follow pre-established patterns in terms of barriers and power-ups, while players select their classes as they see fit, and can also change them between rounds. This, combined with \"wall-wrapping\" (running towards a wall teleports you to the opposite one), makes gameplay agile and fast-changing: tables might turn in seconds and players can work together coordinating their class abilities. In addition, controls are very simple and can be played both with keyboard&mouse (my case) or a controller (WASD to move around, LeftShift to walk, Spacebar to use your ability, mouse to aim skillshot abilities, and that's it). \n\nArt style is just gorgeous, with heavy Tron and cyberpunk influences and hard-light constructs: if you liked the film Tron Legacy, you will love playing this game! This combines with an awesome OST and tell-tale sound effects that ease-up gameplay. There are unlockable cosmetics for your character (gear, laser barrier style, emojis and portraits) that are unlocked by simply playing the game and the different classes. However, during matches, both the class of your character and other player characters can always be easily identified by their neon tools and visual effects. Energy levels (needed to use abilities) can be seen by all players at all times, so you can quickly tell if an opposing player might be about to try to pull out a trick.\n\nIn terms of performance, the game runs very smoothly, with no crashes so far (I haven't even seen them in the bug reporting subforum), and very good framerate. Most bugs or \"areas to improve on\" seem to be so far limited only to matchmaking and UI design (which is not difficult to read but could benefit from some improvements in the placement oof some buttons). In my personal experience, I have seen the matchmaker sometimes setting me on the wrong region (easily fixed in the Settings menu; I have also reported this as a bug), and against higher level players. However matchmaking seems to be one of the main priorities for the devs right now.\n\nSpeaking of devs, they seem to be very dedicated and in touch with the community, with a positive yet humble/feet-on-ground attitude towards priorities. From their latest blog, they are listening to player suggestions/requests and want to add ranked matches and tournaments and make the OST accessible, among many other ideas. They are also not in a hurry to make it full release, which is great as it gives lots of room for making the game as best as possible. \n\nFor a game that entered Early Access just a week ago, after having a closed beta, it feels very much finished in almost all areas, with only some tweaks left to do and still having room for additional content such as more arenas, classes and cosmetics.

As you progress, these values will reverse.\n\nPros:\n1) Relatively quick matches\n2) Excellent cooperative multiplayer\n3) The only thing that distinguishes a low level player from a high level player is their cosmetic gear and skill.\n4) Although some may argue, I feel that the classes are relatively well-balanced - IMO\n5) Great Replayability \n6) There's still additional content to come (maps/cosmetic gear/classes?/etc.)\n\nCons:\n1) You can't skip the starting scene of ranked games (as of 2/20/18).\n2) For my friends and I, we occasionally run into network errors during ranked games where everyone is kicked from the match. My estimation on this is probably 1 out of every 8 games or so, give or take.

As soon as you see a player with one of those CSGO website adds in his name, you have a 99% certainty that he is going to be salty.\n\nGameplay & classes:\nIt's a nice mix, once you get into the game you clearly notice that for some maps some classes are better, or more neede, then others.

Great mix of abilities, diversity in the classes, simply yet effictive and some harder to master then you would imagine.\n\nMatchmaking:\nI don't agree with the devs on their report from 15/02. The matchmaking DOES need work, and ALOT of it. Games take longer then 30 seconds to find, 90% of the time it takes quite the wait. about 50% of the times there are 1 or more AI bots in your team. Most of the time the game feels like it only has 10 players playing because of this. I can't count on 2 hands how many times I have been in a game with 2 bots against 3 actual players or visa versa. Also games on end with and against the same players. Atm I am lvl 12 and I have been grouped up with two lvl1 guys against 3 guys lvl15+ before, so their explanation about players skill being the main factor makes my eyebraws go up.... how can 2 lvl1 guys even compete against 3 lvl 15+ guys, cheer experience here rapes them.

I looked upand I had already put 4 hours into the game, it's incredibly satisfying to play.\n\nDue to the unique nature of the game it can feel very bewildering and even unfair at first, but I wholeheartedly recommend sticking with it, once you get a feel for how simple the game is, you start realising how complex it can be at higher levels of play. I'm only rank 7 (at the time of writing) but I've encountered high-level players pull off the most incredible things, things i wouldn't consider.\n\nI'm a very sceptic person and I think this game has a lot of potential, all the upgrades are purely cosmetic, everything is available to use as soon as you launch the game and it runs really well.\n\nHowever, as an early access title there are limitations and improvements to be made.\n\nThe matchmaking to find games can sometimes be very long and match me into a 3v3 game with me, an opponent and 4 bots.

Players must also dodge the opponent\u2019s lasers and abilities at the same time. These simple and unique mechanics create an action filled multiplayer match which doesn\u2019t usually take longer than 10 minutes.\n\n[h1]Game Breakdown[/h1]\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\nIn Laser League the player is part of 3vs3 team or a 2vs2 team. The team\u2019s goal is to defeat all three of the opponents and then win two out of three rounds. To do this, players must capture long, white posts called \u201cnodes which will shoot out laser walls. These walls aren\u2019t claimed forever and will time out eventually requiring teams to try and predict when nodes will be available to capture again.  While players of the same color can walk through theses laser walls, players of the opposing color will die if they touch the wall. Laser walls aren\u2019t the only thing players can walk through! Players are able to walk into the wall which will allow them to warp to the opposite side which can help to avoid death. Players who touch laser walls don\u2019t die permanently however as players leave behind a hexagon when they die which can be touched by teammates to revive them. This simple gameplay is easy to learn and pick up but is instantly an adrenaline fueled dodge fest. This isn\u2019t the only tool in a player\u2019s arsenal. \n\nPlayers are able to choose classes before they start the match and if they lose a round. These classes include Smash, Ghost, Thief, Snipe, Shock, and Blade. The Smash ability makes the player\u2019s character move forward, knocking an opponent down if they hit them. Ghost can become invincible which makes it the medic class. Thief lets a player steal enemy nodes. Snipe has a teleport ability which kills any player between the teleport point and the player using the ability. Shock stuns in an AoE for a while. Finally, Blade works similarly to Smash, but if the player runs into an enemy they kill them. Each of these classes has an energy bar which must be filled to activate their ability. This helps to balance the classes as the lethal Blade class has the slowest recharge time. Classes each have their own two subclasses which can help define their role on the team even further. The class system adds a strategic layer to this game which really makes it shine. It makes the game require timing and allows individual skill to shine. Classes can also be changed at the end of a round by the losing team.\n\nTeam play is important also. By combining two or three teammate\u2019s builds the game once again becomes more strategic. Smash can throw players into laser walls which Thief will steal. Blade can kill enemies knocked down by Shock, which helps because Blade has a small hitbox.  The amount of combinations is crazy and makes no match feel the same.\nAnother aspect which adds diversity to the mix is the fact that the game is played on multiple stages, each with their own node effects. One stage has the teams recreating classic shoot \u2018em up gameplay by making nodes move at enemy teams which are separated by laser wall captured early on. Another stage has teams slowly capturing nodes to create inescapable traps, unless one is playing Ghost. The diversity is welcome and I\u2019m glad the developers made the stages each feel completely unique.\n\nFinally, there are power-ups which effect the laser players have captured. Reset allows players to remove possession of every node on the map, great for the team that is losing. Another power-up is divide, which creates gaps in both teams laser which makes them easier to dodge. Every power-up has a purpose and often helps the losing side make a comeback. This requires coordination for the opposition to guards a power-up.\n\nOverall, this is great game for players who want quick action that requires reflex, skill, and teamwork\n\n[u]Sound:[/u]\nThe sound in this game makes it feel like a real sport. The crowds cheer when a huge play is made and the laser make satisfying swoosh like sounds as they extend. The sound enhances the gameplay and isn\u2019t distracting in any way. Audio cues in this game give great feedback too. There are unique sounds for a player\u2019s death, resurrection, and ability use. These all help with the reflex portion of the game since it allows players who are nimble enough to quickly react.\n\n [u]Music:[/u]\nThe music is subtle and sci-fi in nature. There aren\u2019t many instruments playing in the compositions which allows the music to blend into the gameplay and enhance it instead of distracting from it. The music, while subtle, is full of energy and can help pump the player up for their matches even further.\n\n [u]Graphics:[/u]\nThe graphics use a lot of neon colors so each element of a stage is instantly recognizable. The player also has a small triangle directly above their character to help identify which member of the team they are. What I enjoy about the art style is that it uses a matte graphical style so these bright colors don\u2019t hurt player\u2019s eyes. This is a smart design choice that I felt worked very well to, once again, keep all of the focus on the gameplay.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[u]Pros:[/u]\nGreat, unique gameplay\nPleasing art style\nEnjoyable music\nGreat Audio with audio cues\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\nStill has a smaller sized player base.\n\n[u]Rating[/u]\n[b]9/10[/b].\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1518738805, "timestamp_updated": 1518738805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657294", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40110995": {"recommendationid": "40110995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108124625", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "last_played": 1521742048}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, I'm having loads of fun with it. You'll love it if you are competitive and enjoy fast paced games.\n\nLong story short it's a \"tron-themed bullet hell-like competition\" 2vs2 or 3vs3 in which you have to activate lasers to kill opponents while dodging theirs. It's easy to jump into but hard to master: there are 6 different classes (each with 2 skill modifiers) to choose from, each of them has its own ability, offensive or defensive, and if a single combination of classes could be great on a certain map, it could be suboptimal on a different one so you'll have to coordinate with your team mates for an effective setup. If you lose a round, you can still rework your strategy and try countering your opponents with different classes, it's not all about reflexes.\n\nPlayer population is still low (hard to find a match if you intend to play after 3 am or something) and there are still a few network hiccups here and there, but you can expect that since it's early access.

Und man trifft sie auf Leben und Tod. Das werdet ihr mit Laser League oft genug erfahren. Und die Entwickler wohl auch. Denn die haben einen reinen Mehrspielertitel erschaffen, der Casual-Gamern glatt die kalte Schulter zeigt. Und das wird Laser League entweder zum schwer erarbeiteten Erfolg oder ins j\u00e4he Verderben f\u00fchren. Aber der Weg ist bereitet. Es kommt auch auf euch an![/b]\n\n[h1][u]DARUM GEHT ES[/u][/h1]\n\nLaser League ist euer Trendsport der Zukunft. Im Jahr 2150 k\u00e4mpft ihr als Duo oder Trio auf dem Spielfeld futuristischer Arenen um die Vorherrschaft \u00fcber bewegliche Laserbarrieren. Das Ziel ist, eure Gegner mit diesen Laserbarrieren zu r\u00f6sten und gleichzeitig darauf zu achten, nicht von gegnerischen Barrieren ger\u00f6stet zu werden. Jenes Team, welches zuerst alle Gegner zu Boden ringt, gewinnt einen Punkt. Wer zuerst drei Punkte holt, gewinnt die Runde. Wer zwei Runden gewinnt, gewinnt die Partie und geht als Sieger vom Platz.\n\nDas sind die Regeln. Mehr gibt es nicht. So einfach ist die Welt. Oder auch nicht.\n\n[h1][u]SO SPIELT ES SICH[/u][/h1]\n\nDenn so schnell ihr die Grundregeln auch intus haben m\u00f6gt, so sicher sorgt eine ganze Reihe von Spielmechaniken daf\u00fcr, dass ihr auf dem Spielfeld ganz schnell von einer vertrackten Situation in die N\u00e4chste getrieben werdet.\n\nZun\u00e4chst w\u00e4ren da nat\u00fcrlich die namensgebenden Laserbarrieren. Die werden aktiviert, indem ihr \u00fcber deren Knotenpunkte lauft. Das f\u00fchlt sich wegen der eher winzigen Hitboxes zur Zeit noch etwas unpr\u00e4zise an. Mir w\u00e4re es lieber, die Knotenpunkte best\u00fcnden aus physischen Objekten, die ihr via Tastendruck aktivieren k\u00f6nntet. Aber sei es drum. Wichtig ist, dass ihr m\u00f6glichst viele in m\u00f6glichst kurzer Zeit aktiviert. Das wird euren Gegner ins Schwitzen bringen. Oder euch. Wenn der Genger schneller ist.\n\nNach kurzer Zeit f\u00fcllt sich das Spielfeld mit allerlei fies rotierenden Barrieren. Denen des Gengners sicher auszuweichen, wird dabei manchmal schon zur Kunst f\u00fcr sich. Um es noch fordernder zu machen, sind die Arenen-Grenzen durchl\u00e4ssig. Bedeutet, wenn ihr in die Begrenzung lauft, kommt ihr am anderen Ende des Spielfelds wieder raus. Wer diese Mechanik gut beherrscht, kann sich so schnell einen Vorteil verschaffen.\n\nAu\u00dferdem erscheinen in bestimmten Abst\u00e4nden Items auf dem Spielfeld, deren Einsammeln bestimmte Ereignisse ausl\u00f6sen. Beispielsweise kann so die Team-Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit aktivierter Barrieren umgekehrt werden. Auf diese Weise k\u00f6nnen sich die Machtverh\u00e4ltnisse auf dem Spielfeld oft dramatisch \u00e4ndern.\n\nSchlie\u00dflich verf\u00fcgt ihr dann noch \u00fcber eine klassenspezifische Spezialf\u00e4higkeit, mit der ihr beispielsweise Gegner bet\u00e4uben, rammen oder t\u00f6ten k\u00f6nnt. Oder ihr stehlt damit gegnerische Barrieren und macht sie zu euren eigenen.\nZur Zeit gibt es sechs Klassen mit je einer F\u00e4higkeit. Da sollte schon f\u00fcr jeden was dabei sein. Wichtig ist nur, dass ihr eure Klassenwahl auf die eurer Mitspieler abstimmt, denn das ist spieltaktisch h\u00e4ufig entscheidend.     \n\nUnd ach ja, Laser League spielt sich zur Zeit mit nur einer einzigen Taste. Plus Analog-Stick. Das wars. \u00dcber Tastenbelegungen m\u00fcsst ihr euch also null Gedanken machen. Und das ist auch gut so. Denn das Treiben auf dem Spielfeld wird sehr schnell hyperkomplex und erfordert damit eure ganze Aufmerksamkeit.  \n\n[h1][u]DAS GIBT ES ZU TUN[/u][/h1]\n\nIn Sachen Spielmodi sieht's zur Zeit noch sehr mau aus. Entweder ihr spielt in 2er- oder in 3er-Teams. Mehr steht noch nicht zur Auswahl. \n\n[h1][u]SO SIEHT ES AUS[/u][/h1]\n\nLaser League ist vom Men\u00fc bis zum Spielfeld konsequent im futuristisch-abstrakten Grafikstil gehalten, bei dem sich grelle Farbakzente vor einem dunklen monochromen Hintergrund abheben. Das passt nat\u00fcrlich gut zu Thema und Setting des Spiels und es sorgt au\u00dferdem f\u00fcr die n\u00f6tige \u00dcbersicht auf dem Spielfeld. Wenn die mal verloren geht, was durchaus vorkommt, liegt es also nicht an der Grafik.\n\nEin kleines Sahnest\u00fcck des Spiels ist die tolle Pr\u00e4sentation, f\u00fcr die die Unreal-Engine mal ein bisschen ihre Muskeln spielen lassen darf. Die Arenen und Spielfiguren sehen einfach klasse aus. Match-Intro und Podium-Sequenz stehen dem in nichts nach, vor allem, weil das alles auch wirklich super animiert ist. \n\n[h1][u]SO H\u00d6RT ES SICH AN[/u][/h1]\n\nWeniger gelungen ist dagegen die akkustische Kulisse. Die Hintergrundmusik ist der Rede nicht wert und die Soundeffekte k\u00f6nnten aus meiner Sicht durchaus hochwertiger sein. Vor allem, wenn es darum geht, ein bisschen spielerisches Feedback zu liefern. Das gilt besonders f\u00fcr den Arena-Sprecher. Der k\u00f6nnte mit mehr und zeitlich besser abgestimmten Kommentaren helfen, das Spielgeschehen durchsichtiger zu machen.\n\n[h1][u]SO F\u00dcHLT ES SICH AN[/u][/h1]\n\nLaser League bietet euch oft sehr spannende und taktisch fordernde Partien, die euch in Sachen Geschicklichkeit und Konzentration eine ganze Menge abverlangen werden. Umso mehr freut sich deshalb euer Belohnungszentrum bei allem, was ihr\nrichtig macht. Zu viele Partien hintereinander werden euch aber, als logische Folge eurer erbrachten mentalen Leistungen, deutlich sp\u00fcrbar erm\u00fcden.\n\nF\u00fcr l\u00e4ngerfristige Motivation sorgen im \u00dcbrigen die Unmengen an freischaltbarem Zeugs, mit dem ihr eure Spielfigur individualisieren k\u00f6nnt.\n\n[h1][u]SO L\u00c4UFT ES[/u][/h1]\n\nZur Zeit gibt es doch noch eine Menge feinzuschleifender Ecken und Kanten im Spiel. Das Matchmaking ist langsam und fehlerbehaftet. Hin und wieder treten, wie beispielsweise bei der Podiums-Sequenz, lustige Glitches zu Tage. Vor allem aber ist nicht alles, was auf dem Spielfeld passiert, immer so richtig nachvollziehbar. Das merkt man nat\u00fcrlich am ehesten im Falle des eigenen unerwarteten Ablebens und sorgt hin und wieder f\u00fcr Frust. Vor allem die Hitboxes der Spielfeld-Objekte scheinen entweder noch recht fehleranf\u00e4llig oder einfach unzureichend an die visuelle Darstellung angepasst zu sein. Da besteht auf jeden Fall Verbesserungsbedarf!  \n\n[h1][u]DAS IST GUT[/u][/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]Erfrischende Spielidee\n[*]Mutiges Spielkonzept\n[*]Tolle Pr\u00e4sentation\n[*]Oft hochspannende Matches\n[*]Sehr simple Steuerung\n[*]Hoher Anspruch an den Spieler\n[*]Erm\u00f6glicht und belohnt viele taktische Vorgehensweisen\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]DAS IST SCHLECHT[/u][/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]Nur zwei Spielmodi\n[*]Hat noch viele Macken\n[*]Belanglose, wenig hilfreiche Soundkulisse\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]ZIELGRUPPE[/u][/h1]\n\nAuch wenn Spielregeln und Tastenbelegung auf die Umrandung eines Bierdeckels passen; Gelegenheitsspieler werden mit Laser League nicht lange Freude haben. F\u00fcr einen expliziten Mehrspieler-Titel eine sehr mutige Design-Entscheidung! Umso mehr profitieren alle Core-Gamer, Geschicklichkeits-Junkies und Taktik-Enthusiasten. F\u00fcr euch ist Laser League n\u00e4mlich wie gemacht.\n\nUnd wer wei\u00df? Wenn die Entwickler es schaffen, der Spielmechanik ihre Ungenauigkeiten und Fehler abzugew\u00f6hnen, dann ist durchaus vorstellbar, dass Laser League zum Geheimtipp der E-Sport-Szene wird. Denn ausreichend bef\u00e4higte Spieler k\u00f6nnen der Spielmechanik ohne zweifel wirklich spannende und dramatische Partien abringen.

Only game review.\n\nPrice: (9.5/10) \nThis is a bit tricky. Some say that a 10+ dollar game for a top-down isn't worth it. But the graphics and visual eye-candy negates that 10+ dollar comment. For the price of 15 dollars (At full price, and the fact it's in EA), ehh it's quite tough to say. The game develop has some history with completed games, as you can see from Roll7. So you can be assured that the game dev is capable of finishing game development. 505Games also published ABZU which was also, in my opinion, a great novel/story, with soothing graphics. So, there are evidence that this game would fulfill similar accomplishment as their history says so. So for your 10-15 dollar payment, I think it's fair to say that you'll receive a fully finished game.\n\nGameplay: (8/10)\nThe game is a quite repetitive. I like various maps this game has to offer. Modifiers are great, classes are great as well. There are so many places to develop more. 6 classes is a bit small, maybe 10 would be nice. Some powerups are Overpowered, while others are useless. The reason why I put 8 out of 10, is MAINLY BECAUSE CONTROLLERS ARE INFINITELY BETTER THAN KEYBOARD USERS. When you breakoff and chase toward the center of the map for the node, a controller user will always outpace a mouse/keyboard user. \nThis game is very flexible when it comes to multi-user play, from multiplayer, online, LAN, online coop, LAN coop, etc. No to cross platform, as I dont think there are any other platform this game allows. Although I would like to see a MAC compatbility of this game. Half my friends use MAC, but can't play this game. This game is very fun when you play with friends, and of similar skilled players. This game said that there would be ranked matchmaking, which I'm very excited about, but it doesn't exist yet.\n\nVisual Option: (5/10)\nSure the game looks great, but there isn't much choice of option about graphics setting. I'm not sure whether or not the game devs actually need to allow users more choice of graphics setting option, but just two choices seem quite restrictive. \n\nE-sports ready?: (7/10)\nI see potential, but I don't see it going for millions of players. Maybe 25,000-40,000 players, at most.\n\nStory: (3/10)\nWhy are players even participating in this tournament? Why are there so many things to unlock? I feel like we'll unlock everything before EA is finished. A season mode against AI would be great. \n\nWhat I would love to see:\n- In-game Tournament mode. Where teams can sign up for tournaments Bo5 matches with 8 teams. Single Eliminations. A trophy case profile for tournament history. This game's background and audience can support a tournament theme.\n- Season mode matchmaking. An in-game tournament held every end of season, where it supports like 32 best teams. All done through the game's menu, and maybe on the weekend (Fri-Sun).\n- First Person Perspective. First Person Mode would be epic to see.\n- A zoom-in function would be great. Not everyone has a 27+ inch monitor to see things going on in the game. If a 14 inch monitor user can see like a 27 inch monitor user, that would be great. Sure zooming in may cut out the rest of the arena, but it's something players can choose to decide.\n- In-game chat feature, is very buggy. It doesn't always work properly or at all, if that's the case.\n- I would love to see a feature option that allows users to choose whether or not they would like to play with competitive settings or casual settings in game, casual would be Best of 3, while competitive would be best of 5 (with 5 rounds), or using 5 different maps in competitive mode.\n- Visual option that would support color blind users, difficult to see your own player unit, when it looks like your ally's.\n- Player indicator would be nice, like brighter than allies, or something like that.", "timestamp_created": 1518460809, "timestamp_updated": 1518460809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40029365": {"recommendationid": "40029365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241434948", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520046478}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game that replaced Rocket League for me and my friend.

For example, I go to play a bot Match, and I'm a bit dissapointed that there isn't a custom match option. Whatever, so there is 3 options for different arenas, and once you click those it shows options for gamemodes, and the descriptions of them are quite confusing to a new player. Not to mention that nearly every screen is way to filled with random confusing crap. A cleaner UI would be much nicer, and an addition of custom bot matches. \n\nThe amount of gamemodes right now, is a bit scarce as there is only 2v2 and 3v3. I would think that maybe a capture the flag esque gamemode would be a nice additon. \n\nAlso a final criticism is that the actual characters feel kinda slow and clunky when moving. I think giving each class a speed level like the blade class could be the highest speed, and the shield one the lowest.\n\n\nOverall I would definetly rate this a 7.5/10 as of now.", "timestamp_created": 1518453165, "timestamp_updated": 1518453165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40027153": {"recommendationid": "40027153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006854358", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519422182}, "language": "czech", "review": "Nice game !", "timestamp_created": 1518451854, "timestamp_updated": 1518451854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40027122": {"recommendationid": "40027122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193002491", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518935711}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u80fd\u591f\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8fd9\u4e48\u4e00\u4e2a emm \u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u6e38\u620f \n\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u9519\u7684\u8bdd \u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5e94\u8be5\u53eb\u956d\u5c04\u8054\u76df\uff1f\n\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u590d\u6742\u4f46\u662f\u786e\u5b9e\u5f88\u597d\u4e0a\u624b\n3v3\u8fd8\u662f\u6ee1\u6ce8\u91cd\u961f\u53cb\u7684\u914d\u5408\u7684\n\u4e2a\u4eba\u89c9\u5f97\u96be\u5ea6\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u5e7d\u7075\u5e26\u533b\u5e08\n\u53ea\u8981\u4e2a\u4eba\u610f\u8bc6\u591f\u597d \u57fa\u672c\u90fd\u80fd\u6551\u961f\u53cb \n\u9664\u975e\u5bf9\u65b9\u5b9e\u5728\u5b9e\u5728\u914d\u5408\u7684\u592a\u5f3a\n\u4e2a\u4eba\u6280\u5de7\u96be\u5ea6\u5927\u7684\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u662f\u72d9\u51fb\u5427\n\u72d9\u51fb\u73a9\u7684\u597d\u5206\u5272\u6218\u573a\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u9177\n\u5927\u56e2\u961f\u914d\u5408 \u95ea\u7535\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u7f3a\u5c11\u7684\n\u8fd8\u6709\u90a3\u4e2a\u7a83\u53d6\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u53eb\u4ec0\u4e48\u6765\u7684 \u4e5f\u5f88\u5f3a\n\u4e2a\u4eba\u504f\u7231\u86ee\u738b\u51b2\u649e\u548c\u5e7d\u7075\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u804c\u4e1a\n\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\n\u961f\u53cb\u4e0d\u6551\u6211\u771f\u7684\u597d\u6c14\n\u6211\u53ef\u662f\n\n\n\u5168\u573a\u6700\u9a9a\u554a\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1518451757, "timestamp_updated": 1518451757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40025859": {"recommendationid": "40025859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096389888", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518365756}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc544\ub2c8 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub294 \uc788\ub294\ub370 \uce5c\uad6c \ud55c\uba85\uc774\ub791 \uac19\uc774 \ud050\ub3cc\ub9ac\ub2c8\uae4c \uc800\ub791 \uce5c\uad6c\ub791 AI\ub791 \uac19\uc740\ud300\uc774\uace0 \uc0c1\ub300\ud300\uc5d0 AI \uc14b\uc774\ub124\uc694\n\ub3d9\uc811 2\uc778 \uac13\uac9c \u3145\u3145 \uadf8\ub7ec\ub2c8\uae4c \uc5bc\ub978 \uc0ac\uc138\uc694\n\nAI \ud0c0\uac9f\ud305 \ub108\ubb34 \uc798\ud558\uc790\ub108.. \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130\ud55c\ud14c \uc84c\uc790\ub108..\u315c\u315c", "timestamp_created": 1518447476, "timestamp_updated": 1518447476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40025556": {"recommendationid": "40025556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026544872", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518882223}, "language": "french", "review": "Fun, nerveux, intense et qui tourne sur toute les machines \u00e0 un prix plus qu'abordable.", "timestamp_created": 1518446456, "timestamp_updated": 1518446456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438272", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40024863": {"recommendationid": "40024863", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999855100", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519120200}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh look.

I was a little concerned my eyes would hurt after 5 minutes of gameplay after looking at screenshots but Roll7 have done a great job in making laser league look sublime.\n\n=============\nGameplay 9/10\n=============\nThe gameplay in laser league is smooth, fast, fluid & exciting. Load up into an online matchup to see you stood side by side with your random teammates gives you a real sense of togetherness. With no time to wait, this game has your adrenaline pumped from the start in this futuristic sport of cat and mouse. You will Dodge, dive, speed up, knock, slash or steal your way around the arena with your chosen class as you battle it out for control of nodes enabling your team to light up the arena in as many of your team\u2019s coloured lasers as you can whilst denying your rival of the same objective. Laser league is a high-octane experience that will have your heart pounding as you look to weave & negotiate through many tight spots fully immersing you from start to finish. You gain a real sense of pride as you either bash an opponent into your laser or quickly beating them to activation of a node & watching as your teams bright coloured laser slice\u2019s right through them. We Love it! \n\n===========\nValue 10/10\n===========\nUpon release laser league is priced a \u00a310.99 & currently with a 30% discount on steam. We believe laser league is fantastic value for money. This is especially for a game that is as complete and as optimised as it already is for an early access title. Great value!\n\n==========\nAudio 8/10\n==========\nAs expected the soundtracks and various in game sounds are of an electronic theme. This of course falls in line with futuristic feel of the game. With a very cool voiceover announcement every time a power-up is activated the whole sound content works very well.\n\n============\nContent 7/10\n============\nThe balance of content at launch is just about right. For me, Roll7 hasn't tried to bite off more than they can chew, meaning, they haven't overloaded the game with so many modes & options thus causing a higher potential for issues upon release. Currently you have 2v2 or 3v3 online match ups with the chance for character customization upon completion a match. We feel in the near future more content needs to be added, which we will come to next...\n\n==============\nPotential 8/10\n==============\nLaser League has the potential to be a very good sports title on the market. We believe though, in order to survive, Roll7 has to add a competitive element to the game very similar to league of legends ranking system. Also I believe another cool feature to add, would be an offline career mode where you can rise through the leagues with your chosen team, buying selling players, managing finances with promotions & relegations.  \n\n==================\nReplayability 6/10\n==================\nWe feel this is where their is a big question mark over the title. Without a competitive element & other features added, Laser league is a game you could quite easily get bored of quickly. I have been taking note of responses by the Roll7 and it seems they are happy to listen to the community for suggestions of how to move the game forward. Of course, only time will tell how they develop the game, but i really hope they continue to add content into what is already a solid entry onto the sports genre. \n\n===========\nSocial 9/10\n==========\nThe whole game revolves around online match-ups as mentioned... but what i really like is, the emojis you can unlock & use in game. Light up a happy face as you smash into your opponent. trigger  a wave emote to grab a teammates attention when you have fallen. From my experience so far laser league has a friendly community. A simple \u201cGG\u201d typed in chat at the end of the game by players, instead of the usual flame & abuse you can receive playing other games. With the option to team up with friends or side by side with randoms laser league has a great social element to it.\n\n==============\nTechnical 8/10\n==============\nFor an early access release we have been very impressed how optimised, stable and complete laser league is. Over the weekend since release I have seen some grumbles of connection issues, personally the game has run just fine but I have read this is something Roll7 are working on. With the release of many early access games on the market in an unplayable state Laser league has done a great job in giving us a game with very few bugs & glitches. \n\n===============\nDevelopers 8/10\n===============\nI will always say, as with any title, especially an early access title you can determine how well a game is received & progress\u2019s when it is clear how active & enthusiastic developers are. Of course, we will have a clearer picture of this as the game develops but from what I have seen so far Roll7 are very active across social media. Most notably for me on twitter where they are very active in engaging in the community and more than happy to listen to suggestions & feedback.\n\n==============\nOverall 82/100\n==============\nSo what do we think of laser league overall? Well, For a niche game, laser league has made a very solid entry into the sports genre. Offering a cool fast, fluid experience with an original futuristic feel that looks and plays fantastic. With great value... laser league offers something different to your game collection even for those who wouldn't normally look to purchase a sports title. If roll7 add a competitive ranking system & an offline career mode as mentioned the game will be around for a long time. With similarities to the highly successful Rocket league, there's nothing to stop laser league standing side by side with them. We score laser league a fantastic 82/100 so go & give your piggy bank a shake and grab it! \n\n\nGraphics - 9\nGameplay - 9\nValue - 10\nAudio - 9\nContent - 6\nPotential - 8\nReplayability - 6\nSocial - 9\nTechnical - 8\nDevelopers - 8\nOverall - 82/100", "timestamp_created": 1518442892, "timestamp_updated": 1518442924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.420738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40023548": {"recommendationid": "40023548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301422967", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518798514}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay:fast &exciting.

The classes may seem imbalanced, but people just haven't learned to play them well. The maps aren't random so there's a pattern to learn in each, but that's only a good thing! There's no other way to allow teams to plan their strategy if the patterns/powerups are random each round.\n\nLaser League has more buttons reserved for quick chat and emotes than actual controls, but it works really well. There's quite a bit of customization and a ton of skins to unlock but no loot crates, which is a plus IMO.\n\nIt's a bummer that the online play doesn't support local parties but so far I've had a lot of fun solo queuing. Matchmaking is the biggest con currently. It's possible that there aren't enough players yet (steam charts shows about 100-500 during the day, more at peak hours) so you're often playing with or against bots, sometimes both. I had a few matches yesterday where the opposing team had 2 bots and 1 human player against our full team of humans and it didn't seem fair at first (since we pretty much 2v3 hard bots with my non-gamer girlfriend) but somehow the match was quite even. Maybe Roll7 saves the hardest bots for online matches?\n\nBut! It's kind of too early to say anything. It's a fun game, that I can say! There's a lot to unlock and achievements are probably enabled soon, since I already see them on my library. The soundtrack and crowd cheering gets me really pumped but also kind of tires me fast as well. There's a lot of [i]\"holy &\u00a4#t I am bad...\"[/i] and [i]\"What did I just do, wow that was cool!\"[/i] moments which leave me laughing out loud or facepalming hard, and I can't really ask much else from a game these days.\n\nAll in all, do I recommend it? Absolutely. It's a shame it's not more popular but anything can happen in early access. Once Laser League gets a few streamers and youtubers to try it, people will pour in, but in it's current state it doesn't offer enough competitive gameplay (ladders and ranking) to make it really interesting. I'd love to play it but it's hard to get friends to buy it, which would probably double the fun. \n\nBuy it!

It's like a neocyberpunk style with tron/bomberman fusion. Except instead of bombs, there are grids that move in distinct patterns in each arena.\n\nThere are different character styles that have attributes that you must adapt to the arena solo or with a team. The combos matter greatly and it is difficult when you can't communicate during this selection process (it pisses me off a bit).\n\nAs much as I love this game, one thing irks me so bad. THE NETWORK CONNECTIONS ARE BAD. I matchmake with god knows who since there are no regional servers to select from (as far as I can tell) and I get disconnected from matches on the regular. I can finish a handful and have fun, but when it happens it sucks because you are balls deep in a match trying to win, or are about to snag a win and then everyone just suddenly starts to run in a linear direction, infinitely. Disconnected. That needs to be fixed ASAP.

The only difference between this E. Access game and others is Laser League actually has a working, fun foundation to build upon, rather than the buggy alternatives prevalent in the E. Access market. So far, no DLC or microtransactions - it is just buy-to-play - which is how games should always be monetised.\n\nThe only downside is lag for Canadian players, which is game-breaking. Server stability (i.e. forced disconnects) is its own issue that will be inevitably fixed over time, but latency is a big problem for Canadians. I'm not sure what the exact numbers are, but it feels like the game is running over 100ms ping at times (based on my experience with MOBAs and shooters), and 100ms is way too high for a game that depends strongly on precision. It's something as simple as an enemy beating you to a point at the start of a round. Or something more complex, like running over a downed teammate, seeing them revive, but then finding out a second later that apparently you hit an enemy laser. Local matches are plenty evidence that the game is almost bug-free, which is impressive, but seeing as online play makes up the majority of this game, the developers really need to work on improving latency for several regions globally.", "timestamp_created": 1518383294, "timestamp_updated": 1518383294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40010303": {"recommendationid": "40010303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008775440", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1520776184}, "language": "english", "review": "I dont often write reviews, but I'm gonna give a review based on the 3 matches I've played on Laser League so far.

My only complaint with the game, given it's only came out three/four days ago, is that as games go on the intensity does get scaled up, but not nearly as much as I believe it should. WInning sets of three is a great way of extending the rivalry, and being able to change up whats working and whats not (whilst the team who just won the round cannot change) makes for fun countering play, finding the weaknesses and exploiting them... and then the other team may well do it back to you.\n\nMakes for great gameplay, I know I'll be playing this a lot more and as it develops through time, I think this has potential to be the next spectator eSports out there.

I've had in a competitive game, in a very long time.\nI dont think any of the trailers do the best job at explaining how simple the game is, so heres my shot.\nEach class has 1 ability, that you can apply 1 modifier to. The goal of the game it to eliminate all enemy team members, Either through making them run into lasers that you can activate, or through your ability, and sometimes a mixture of both. The matches I have played were extremely fun. Sometimes I would get completely destroyed by the Snipe class and think 'WOW! This class is broken.' But then I would go and attempt to play the class and not nearly be as good. Skill is reqired. I would like to see an ability indicator so that I could see which way the attack would go, in specific for the smash and blade classes. I strongly recommend a control to play this game, mouse and keyboard works, but if you have the option, controller is the way to go. In my opinion, this game is extremely polished for an Early Access title, that could definitely become a big game. I look foreward to more classes being addded in the future, as well as more cosmetic options. Hopefully us Early Access backers could get an in game bonus. My one complaint deals with the smash class, which feels a little unfair to be hit against. I would suggest removing the stun and decreasing the knockback distance, while still keeping it sizable. All in all I think its a great game, but I'd probably go for a free to play approach with this one. The larger the player base the better for this game IMO. And if not free, then maybe 5 bucks.

So if two players are out but one is still up then they have a chance to revive their team and keep the round going. If they fail then they lose.\n\nFirst team to win three sets wins the round and the first team to win two rounds out of three wins the match. This makes some games go fairly quick with only lasting around 10 minutes but if the teams are fairly even on a low laser count field it could last slightly longer than 20 minutes.\n\nThere are a few different arena to play in but they really just determine the team colours (Red v Blue, Neon Green v Neon Purple, Neon Blue v Neon Orange.) As well as the background colours. What does change between them is the layout of the laser pylons. Each arena has about 3-4 different layouts that could be chosen from which helps keep the game fresh.\n\nRight now the only modes are 2v2 and 3v3 with plans to add other modes down the line. With the community being small at the moment you will tend to run unto the same players every now and then but that's no different than Rocket League.\n\nThe few personal negatives I have right now is not having team side voip to help plan things at round start or during the match. There also doesn't seem to be a back out button once you select match making thus locking you on that screen until you find a match and then select quit. Though doing ao doesn't free your spot for anither player so your team now has an AI in your place. And finally the cosmetics pool seems a little shallow. Yes, it gives 250 some odd options but they are just full suits with several different decal variations. I'm assuming its to make it easier for the colour changes with teams so I'm super upset by this. The games has also only been out for three days at the time of this so I would think that number will either go up or they will add more in-depth customisation.\n\nPros outweigh the cons on this by far so I would definetly recommend picking it up \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1518302172, "timestamp_updated": 1518302172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39988073": {"recommendationid": "39988073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109895242", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1520781807}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00c9 um bom jogo, as horas passam e voc\u00ea nem nota.

Als Klassen stehen zur Verf\u00fcgung: \n[list]\n[*]Blade: K\u00e4mpfer, der Gegner mit seiner Klinge ausschalten kann\n[*]Ghost: kann sich selbst f\u00fcr kurze Zeit Unverwundbarkeit verleihen. So kann er Laser passieren und sonst unerreichbare Verb\u00fcndete wiederbeleben\n[*]Shock: erzeugt ein elektrisches Feld um sich herum, welches Gegner f\u00fcr einen kurzen Zeitraum bewegungsunf\u00e4hig macht-die Laser erledigen im Idealfall den Rest\n[*]Smash: besitzt ein Schild, welches aber nicht zum Blocken, sondern dem Angriff dient. Gegner werden in Sto\u00dfrichtung geschleudert und fallen hin. F\u00fchrt sie ihr Fall durch einen Laser, so sterben sie. Am Ort des Aufpralls sind sie ebenfalls kurze Zeit bet\u00e4ubt.\n[*]Snipe: markiert einen Punkt auf dem Feld, zu dem er sich zur\u00fcckteleportieren kann. Dabei kann er unbeschadet Laser auf dem Weg passieren. Gegner, die seine gerade Linie zum Zielpunkt kreuzen, werden ausgeschaltet\n[*]Thief: feindliche Laser kann er bei Einsatz seiner F\u00e4higkeit in eigene umwandeln\n[/list]\nDiese F\u00e4higkeiten haben jeweils einen Cooldown. Dieser ist zwar nicht sehr hoch, aber man muss sich trotzdem \u00fcberlegen, wann und wie man die eigene F\u00e4higkeit am gewinnbringendsten einsetzt.\nZiel des Spiels ist es, als Team den letzten \u00fcberlebenden Spieler zu stellen. Dabei k\u00f6nnen Gegenspieler entweder durch F\u00e4higkeiten ausgeschaltet werden (z.B. Blade) oder sie werden von den Lasern pulverisiert. Die Laser sind auch der Aspekt, der dem Spiel seinen besonderen Reiz verleiht. Wir sind als Spieler nicht nur vor feindlichen F\u00e4higkeiten auf der Hut, wir m\u00fcssen vielmehr das sich stetig ver\u00e4ndernde Spielfeld im Auge behalten, da die Laser die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Gefahr darstellen. Jede Arena kommt mit eigenen Lasermustern daher. Manchmal sind es Laserw\u00e4nde, die einen zu zerquetschen drohen, ein anderes Mal schie\u00dfen die Laserstrahlen von einem Punkt der Karte in Sternform in alle Richtungen. Diese Laser werden von den Spielern aktiviert. Jeder Laser hat dabei einen Knotenpunkt, der f\u00fcr das eigene Team aktiviert wird, sobald man diesen passiert. Die Dynamik auf dem Spielfeld sucht ihresgleichen. Rocket League ist dagegen ein Spiel zum Entspannen. Abseits der F\u00e4higkeiten bewegen wir uns \u00fcber das Spielfeld und versuchen Laser zur aktivieren und feindlichen Lasern auszuweichen. Ein Kniff ist hier, dass man von einer Seite auf die gegen\u00fcberliegende springen kann, in dem man gegen eine der W\u00e4nde l\u00e4uft. So kann man den Gegnern in den R\u00fccken fallen oder Lasern ausweichen.\nWer einmal von Gegner oder Laser getroffen wird ist aber nicht automatisch raus aus der Partie. \u00c4hnlich wie die Laserknoten, kann man auch gefallene Mitspieler durch das Passieren der Todesstelle wiederbeleben. So ist das Spiel ein einziger Adrenalinsto\u00df...achso, habe ich schon erw\u00e4hnt, dass es auf der Karte noch Powerups gibt? Werden diese aktiviert, so teilen sich Laserw\u00e4nde in Abschnitte und erlauben ein Durchkommen auf die andere Seite. Die Geschwindigkeit der Laser wird erh\u00f6ht oder deren Bewegung komplett angehalten. Die Laser der zwei Parteien werden umgedreht, so kann man durch ein Powerup das komplette Spielfeld ver\u00e4ndern oder man aktiviert mit einem anderen Powerup alle Laserknoten f\u00fcr das eigene Team auf einmal.\nWen das Spiel auch nur im Entferntesten interessiert und wer durch diese kurze Review auch nur Ansatzweise Lust auf das Spiel bekommen hat, dem sei gesagt, dass das Erleben all dieser Elemente so viel besser ist als jeder Flie\u00dftext. Durch Videos kann man den Spa\u00df erahnen, aber wenn man den Controller (der wirklich empfehlenswert ist) dann erstmal in der Hand hat, dann bleibt es selten bei einer Runde. Das ist aber auch kein Problem, denn an einer Partie sitzt man selten l\u00e4nger als 5-10 Minuten, so dass Laser League auch ideal f\u00fcr Zwischendurch taugt.\n\nEin wirklich herausragendes Spiel.", "timestamp_created": 1518284350, "timestamp_updated": 1518284350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39982170": {"recommendationid": "39982170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327166501", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518470650}, "language": "english", "review": "Excited to have this game in early access, I played the open beta and it was loads of fun.

Overall, I'm going to say this is a positive review, but I have some thoughts/concerns hopefully these devs and future devs consider and take to heart.\n\nSo, first off, the game is fun. That's simple enough. Any game that releases needs to be fun. That was accomplished.\n\nHowever, I have legitimate concerns about the longevity of the game and how the game will feel in even a week.\n\nFirst off.. The game is dead on Twitch already. That's bad. What happened to the advertising for the game? The #1 rule of advertising is it costs money to make money from it. There aren't nearly enough big streamers (if at all?) playing the game. You guys should have paid some big time streamers to show off your game. You can't launch a game that already feels like it's dead on arrival on that perspective. Worse games than this have had more viewers on Twitch, so there was an advertising fail here.\n\nSecond.. Obviously, no ranked playlists on launch. I think every multiplayer based game should launch with a ranked playlist. People want that carrot on the hat to chase. And currently, cosmetically, there is none. So I'm Level 14, I've done 4 of the 5 mastery ranks for Shock, and I can hardly tell a difference between anything. So there isn't even a cosmetic chase, so for those thinking maybe at Level 10 the skins get a lot cooler -- They don't.\n\nThird, now for some gameplay. Meta wise, I think every 3's team is required to have a Thief. Thief is really strong and really dominates especially in premade teams. The chain rezzing really needs to be nerfed. There are games where you feel like you have it wrapped up, but one guy is just chain respawning on another to stall for time for a convenient laser node to protect them, or a lucky powerup like switch/steal to spawn on them. \n\nThe map that has Four Y shaped lasers on top and bottom that all spawn at start is probably the worst map in the game. Switch and Steal are both really awful powerups as well in the sense that you get punished for playing really good to that point. And Switch and Steal always seems to conveniently spawn near the team that is losing so even when you have map control, you can't stop them from getting there safely. The other map that has Switch and Steal in their powerup rotation is basically a coin flip, and you can almost make the case you should play that map around intentionally letting the other team dominate the laser nodes early so you can switch/steal on them.\n\nAt the games core, it's fun. For it's price, I'd say it's worth it even if you only get 5-6 hours out of it. But I find it hard to believe this game will be thriving even in two weeks with how little advertising and precense it has on Twitch. But if the goal was at its core to make a fun game, a fun game was made in my opinion. But there was a huge missed opportunity and hopefully my review along with my gameplay feedback is noted by these and future devs.", "timestamp_created": 1518235345, "timestamp_updated": 1518236173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39967985": {"recommendationid": "39967985", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989148768", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520464589}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite the fun little gem for such a little price.\n\nEasy to learn, but with a surprising level of depth in terms of strategy.\nQuick matches that you can get in, have a great time then leave (why would you tho?)\n\nIs a buy!", "timestamp_created": 1518235137, "timestamp_updated": 1518235231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39967963": {"recommendationid": "39967963", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995626857", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518402119}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS IS LASER LEAGUE... \n\nJoin us[->>>-]", "timestamp_created": 1518235014, "timestamp_updated": 1518235014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39967822": {"recommendationid": "39967822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002427904", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518189048}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3088\u304d", "timestamp_created": 1518234404, "timestamp_updated": 1518234404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39967690": {"recommendationid": "39967690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116814883", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518239719}, "language": "english", "review": "vry good", "timestamp_created": 1518233769, "timestamp_updated": 1518233769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39967383": {"recommendationid": "39967383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275006084", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518232014}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great concept, and it will get your blood pumping.

Definitely has a massive futuristic sports feel to it and I love it!\n\nFor the peeps who want more technical and involved review; The various classes all bring something very specific to the table and all have been very well thought out. Each one feels very powerful and useful for the team. There are some very powerful combinations, but also almost always a way to counter them with your gameplay skills, rather than just class A \"counters\" class C, for example. Despite the actual arenas all being very similar, it is the laser node mapping that is the real environment you need to pay attention to. Each laser map has different spawn timers and locations for different laser node types. Learning these and utilising them at the best time is the best way towards victory and feels bloody awesome.\n\nThere are always going to be bugs and issues with games, but Laser League is currently fairly well polished, with only one or two bugs noticed thus far after playing through the beta test and now early access. The bugs do not detract much from the overall experience, as they are usually brief and are not 'game-breaking' as such. Kudos to the devs for all the polish evident in this title and I have high hopes they will continue to refine LL as they go towards full release.", "timestamp_created": 1518228151, "timestamp_updated": 1518228151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39966542": {"recommendationid": "39966542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010013007", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1520539234}, "language": "french", "review": "Gros potentiel en premade, Jeu de r\u00e9flexe et de strat\u00e9gie \u00e0 \u00e9tablir tr\u00e8s rapidement.

The special abilities makes for some really interesting gameplay and makes each game feel new and exciting. \n\nHowever, just like any game there's always a but. In this case it goes something like this: \n\nThis game is A LOT of fun, great performance, very intense and thrilling gameplay, at a fair price, BUT it suffers from a low playerbase. As of writing this there are somewhat over 500 players in-game, which isn't ideal for a multiplayer game the day after release, on a Friday where a lot of people has got paid.\n\nMost of my games end up with at least 1 AI player, if not all players besides me. And when you find other players it can be people from anywhere in the world, for example I'm in Sweden and has gotten put into games with Korean players.\n\nNow luckily as I mentioned there are AI players, and they aren't bad. If it weren't for the \"AI\" names they're given I wouldn't have doubted that they were real players, so even if you can't find any multiplayer games, the single-player experience is also a lot of fun and challenging. \n\nI really hope the game will manage to keep at least a decent playerbase, as it's one of the most interesting games released in a while.

The game is great but missing some key features in my mind. They have no report player options, this may ruin the game for a while as toxcity levels rise and that hacker levels may rise, Im not sure whats happening here for Anti-cheat ect but havnt come across anything sketchy thank god as there can be things that will just ruin the game. Other than that hiccup which im sure will be added in the future.\n\nWe are also left with only 2 gamemodes a 2v2 and 3v3 with few maps but good ammount of modes with makes up for that. The playerbase is nice and generally friendly with its few cancerous players like anygame. \n\nGreat Customisation and leveling process i dont want that to stop! Worth buying and im happy with most things.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1518199574, "timestamp_updated": 1518199574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787594", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39957806": {"recommendationid": "39957806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035991420", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519227844}, "language": "french", "review": "So much rage !

Built around the concept of an extreme contact sport set in the year 2150, players on one of two sides of a battle arena must scramble around the area once the match has begun in order to active nodes that emit beams of light that stretch out and sweep the area, killing any enemy player it touches instantly. There are several battlefield nodes such as Speed, Switch, Reverse, Divide, etc., that can change the course of the match in an instance due to the overwhelming influence these nodes have upon created and existing beams of light on the battlefield. Players have several classes to choose from with two individual modification options per class that can give you and your teammate(s) a bit of an advantage. The game is well balanced and truly relies on your skills, ability to stay focused, and to stay one step ahead of your opponents. You must maintain this level of focus while maintaining awareness of your surroundings and teammate activity.\n\nRoll7 has done a magnificent job in making a video game that captures the authentic themes of the cyberpunk genre. Everything from the environments to the distorted voice of the announcer is very much appreciated by true fans of cyberpunk. There are dozens of customization options for your character that allow you to change their appearance, (outfit), via different in-game brands, emoticons, designs for the laser beams of light that you activate, (individualizing you from your teammates), and your portrait. Roll7 also did a superb job of creating an absorbing atmosphere that gives personality to the world that surrounds you. A world in which the risk of competing in this sport is life or death. A world that rewards the players of this extreme sport with glorification and admiration. Giving off this gladiator-like  sense of pride and determination. This game is a MUST HAVE for gamers and I strongly recommend it to anyone that is interested in anything I have mentioned during this review.\n", "timestamp_created": 1518142920, "timestamp_updated": 1518142920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39943488": {"recommendationid": "39943488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198224271736", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518727823}, "language": "turkish", "review": "\u0130lerde e-spor kategorisinde g\u00f6r\u00fcr\u00fcz", "timestamp_created": 1518140658, "timestamp_updated": 1518140658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39943304": {"recommendationid": "39943304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145186196", "num_games_owned": 728, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518133390}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: As of March 19th, the devs banned me from the game for this negative review and for discussion topics highlighting the dead player base. As of today, THREE players are online. \n\nDevs ban person for criticism in the forums. LOL. Enjoy your dead game.\n\n--------\n\nGreat gameplay and concept. Everything in-game is very fun and I recommend that part of the experience.\n\nIt's a GOOD game but the thumbs down means I don't recommend it based on the following:\n\n- 60 fps lock. Keep in mind that by buying this, you're investing in this game's future since it's in early access. No competitive game will even be considered by the masses if it has an fps lock. An fps lock on a competitive game in 2017 is inexcusable. Not mad about it but it's a very poor decision. This game is built in Unreal the same as rocket league which has a 250 fps lock. \n\nAgain, you must realize that this game will eventually die if it has an fps lock. It's predicated on getting the competitive playerbase and ppl wont play this if its fps locked. See Disc Jam.\n\nFull disclosure: com manager said he \"forwarded my concerns\" to the devs. To me, this means nothing although the effort is appreciated. I've been around early access games long enough to know that dev/manager promises mean nothing (features such as multiplayer are always teased/hinted at by devs but no concrete answer is every given)\n\n- Low player base. On launch this had 650 players on steam charts. No players at all in OCE or SEA. I queued both for hours during beta and for a bit on launch and no human players at all. All AI matches the entire time. So I guess all players are EU/NA. \n\n(EDIT Feb 14th 1 week after launch the current player base is 72 players. Proof: https://imgur.com/a/ZvCUX)\n\nWhat the game needs is a console release with crossplay. Would be amazing and instantly make the game huge. I highly recommend WAITING to see how the devs respond to this. I was told a console release is \"planned\". Again, it's early access so waiting and seeing is fine. \n\nAgain, this is what killed Disc Jam, which had a very decent launch on twitch among rocket league pros and others. There just isn't enough PC steam players to keep it going. It needs console or something else. \n\nTLDR: Great game but two major hurdles to you getting your full money's worth: fps lock in a competitive game & lack of playerbase upon launch. These may be remedied in the future. Since it's early access, I recommend waiting and seeing.", "timestamp_created": 1518139782, "timestamp_updated": 1521471489, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.403758", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39943178": {"recommendationid": "39943178", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972160987", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1520843346}, "language": "french", "review": "Top, top, top !", "timestamp_created": 1518139167, "timestamp_updated": 1518139167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39943127": {"recommendationid": "39943127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047541818", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518618215}, "language": "english", "review": "Its mashup of some different styles but its done very poorly...

The longer you go the more intense it will get, you have 5 classes to choose from. \n\nShock being my personal favourite because you dont really need any skill to use it, its an aoe stun, that stuns(obviously) your enemy in place ready for them to get fucked by your lasers. \n\nThief as I said can steal nodes from the enemy team, \n\nBlade can dash and insta kill 1 enemy. \n\nSniper places down a point anywhere on the arena, if you decide to teleport to it while an enemy is walking through your line of sight you will kill your enemy (if they are inbetween you and your teleport point). \n\nGhost allows you to hover through the enemies lasers and makes you pretty much invunrable to there attacks too.\n\nSmash, you weild a big fat shield that you can tackle enemies sending them flying hopefully into a laser, its pretty funny to see.\n\nThe Customisation is really nice, there are a totaly of 60 characters to choose from and 5 factions, each having there own style. Emotes you can use (1, 2, 3, 4 keys) in the arena.

Nonostante Laser League assolva a pieno la formula \u201cEasy to learn\u201d, grazie ai pochi input e alle semplici regole di gioco, destreggiarsi abilmente nello stadio \u00e8 un altro paio di maniche (\u201cHard to master\u201d). La dicotomia perfetta per un titolo che punta al competitivo.\n\nUrla del pubblico, esultanze ad ogni vostra vittoria, musica elettronica che aumenta gradualmente d\u2019intensit\u00e0, il telecronista che non parla a VOI giocatori ma lo si ascolta tramite saggio uso dell\u2019equalizzatore, la sua voce rimbomba in lontananza per tutto lo stadio. Fattori che infondono visceralmente nel player lo spirito agonistico: siete l\u00ec per il giubilo del pubblico, soddisfateli. E se un videogioco sportivo riesce a trasmettere queste emozioni con il suo level design, ha gi\u00e0 compiuto il suo obiettivo.\n\nA tutto questo, si coniuga correttamente l\u2019Unreal Engine 4: motore azzeccato per il tema trattato. La buona riuscita del sistema d\u2019illuminazione e degli effetti particellari \u00e8 dovuto proprio a quest\u2019ultimo, infatti, viene fatto uso di quelli che sono gli elementi pi\u00f9 classici di un\u2019opera futuristica: la gamma cromatica varia dal nero ai colori molto intensi, mediante l\u2019uso di luci a neon. Un\u2019ottima resa grafica con requisiti di sistema non elevati.\n\nCome gi\u00e0 accennato, le regole di questo sport sono incredibilmente semplici. All\u2019inizio della partita i giocatori dovranno scegliere la propria classe (in tutto sono 6: Lama, Scossa, Sfonda, Etereo, Killer e Ladro), ognuna con la propria abilit\u00e0 che \u00e8 possibile personalizzare a sua volta con uno dei due modificatori disponibili, che variano per ogni classe. Chi perde un round, ha diritto a cambiare assortimento. In visuale isometrica, le due squadre dovranno accaparrarsi i laser nell\u2019arena ed evitare quelli in mano agli avversari in una struttura simile ai bullet hell.\n\nIn aggiunta, sono presenti i power-up che appaiono a fasi alterne, in grado di ribaltare le sorti della partita. Attenzione per\u00f2, non sempre apparir\u00e0 un power-up che sar\u00e0 utile alla vostra squadra in quel dato momento (ad esempio, se si prende \u201cResetta\u201d mentre i laser saranno in mano vostra, li annullerete tutti e concederete agli avversari di recuperare). Si vince un punto ogni volta che eliminerete l\u2019intera squadra avversaria (per mano vostra, nel caso siate una classe offensiva, o per mano dei laser da voi presi). Con 3 punti si vince un round, la vittoria andr\u00e0 a chi vince due round.\n\nImportantissimo \u00e8 il wall wrapping, feature automatica che permette di teletrasportarsi da un punto all\u2019altro della mappa semplicemente avvicinandosi ai bordi, utile come escape o per tendere trappole agli avversari ed eliminarli. \u201cSfonda\u201d con questo potr\u00e0 addirittura scaraventare gli avversari dall\u2019altro lato della mappa, nel caso i laser si trovino l\u00ec.\n\nLe arene per ora sono 3, tutte di forma rettangolare. A cambiare sono il tipo e la posizione dei laser, spingendo le squadre a cambiare la combinazione delle classi. Gli scontri per il momento si limitano ad un 2vs2 o ad un 3vs3 in multigiocatore online e ad un 4vs4 in locale. Degne di nota le animazioni, la cui cura sacrifica l\u2019immediatezza dei movimenti esigendo un timing pi\u00f9 stretto, pensateci bene prima di invertire il senso di marcia con un laser alle calcagna.\n\nAmpia la personalizzazione, \u00e8 possibile cambiare il vestiario del proprio personaggio (salendo di livello o sbloccando i ranghi maestria completando gli obiettivi richiesti. Non sono presenti microtransazioni), le emoticon, le livree dei laser e il proprio avatar. Peccato non sia possibile modificare le esultanze, che invece sono randomizzate ed automatiche alla fine di ogni round.\n\nOltre ai tasti per muoversi e a quello per usare l\u2019abilit\u00e0, Laser League richiede altissimi riflessi. Pi\u00f9 la partita va avanti, pi\u00f9 i laser aumenteranno, \u00e8 necessario dunque concludere i round in fretta. Se molti laser sono in mano avversaria dovrete piroettare per lo stadio e schivarli, ma non basta. Nel frattempo, dovrete essere abbastanza rapidi nell\u2019elaborare una strategia per mandare al tappeto i nemici. E se i vostri compagni muoiono? Dovrete andare sul punto in cui sono morti e farli respawnare, stando bene attenti a non rimanerci voi secchi. Lo stesso vale per i nemici, quindi cercate di eliminare in fretta quelli rimasti in vita, evitando cos\u00ec che rianimino i caduti. Nota negativa per\u00f2, va alla visibilit\u00e0 del personaggio in uso: nonostante sia presente l\u2019indicatore sopra il vostro alter ego (di colore nero, in tinta con lo sfondo. Molto meglio sarebbe stato il colore bianco), nella frenesia dell\u2019azione potreste perderlo di vista e ritrovarlo diversi secondi dopo, probabilmente una volta morti.\n\nLe partite in media durano 5-10 minuti, contribuendo all\u2019assuefazione del giocatore.  D\u2019altra parte per\u00f2, l\u2019oneroso sforzo mentale porr\u00e0 dei limiti al numero di partite giocate. Dopo qualche match i riflessi cominciano a calare, conviene quindi trattare il titolo a dosi moderate.\n\nIl prezzo di lancio \u00e8 di \u20ac14.99, ma per festeggiare sar\u00e0 scontato del 30% per un breve periodo di tempo (quindi sar\u00e0 disponibile a \u20ac10.50). Un prezzo onesto per i contenuti e il notevole spessore tecnico. Mi auguro che riscuota il successo che meriti e magari, perch\u00e9 no, di ritrovarlo agli ESL. Non esagero quando affermo che Laser League, tra tutti i titoli sportivi esistenti fino ad ora sul mercato, \u00e8 l\u2019unico a toccare davvero l\u2019apice dell\u2019esperienza di gioco.\n\nwww.ilbosone.com", "timestamp_created": 1518109292, "timestamp_updated": 1518285059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549180", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39933930": {"recommendationid": "39933930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009748523", "num_games_owned": 618, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518174004}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442.\n\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f.\n\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f\u043c\u0438.\n\u041c\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0433\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e.\n\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b\u0439, \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0437\u0430 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432.\n\u0415\u0449\u0435 \u0438 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0430 \u0432 30 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 - \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0436.", "timestamp_created": 1518109097, "timestamp_updated": 1518109097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580562", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39933892": {"recommendationid": "39933892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006907982", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519221711}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is solid.

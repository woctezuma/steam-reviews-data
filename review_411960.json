He wasn't pulling my leg. It was a thing. So for the first time in months, i deposited money into my Steam Wallet to buy a Steam game with which the price would be WAY higher due to conversion rates. But i didn't care, i wanted to play this shit and relive the memories i once had as a kid.\n\nAnd boy, it all came flooding back, which each update to the port only getting more and more better. Normally, PC ports of games aren't as stellar as the console version, but Krome made sure that the PC port of their game would be spectacular, and it fucking is.\n\nThe levels, the rangs, the characters, the collectables, everything... It's bloody brilliant. And now with the ability to refight bosses, use the beloved Doomarang outside the final fight and with Steam achieves and trading cards, there's no way i couldn't not recommened this game.\n\nHonestly, buy this and play this.

When I saw it was getting a Steam port, I just had to get it. I've played it for quite a while now, and I must say there are a couple of things that do bug me. \n\n1. It's not exactly aged well. The animations are kinda cheesy, the game itself is quite a bit shorter than I remember it, and a few other minute things gameplay-wise. \n\n2. It's very tedious. This may be a personal thing, but it's got a lot of collectibles (and I mean a LOT). This is not a problem for most people, but as large as some of the worlds feel, it's quite annoying trying to collect them all. (even though I did).\n\nSo, in terms of my reccomendation, I'd certainly say that if you were an OG Ty player back in the day, then absolutely get this game. It's pretty much just as it was on the original console (I mean, obviously. It's a port). As for people who've not ever even seen the game before, I say you should still try it.

Some games seemed to change for the worst with some decisions made. I remember hoping to see the Ty trilogy released as a HD collection, but I never did believe that anything like that would happen. Looks like I was wrong, and when I bought this game I was not disappointed at all. \n\nI wasn't disappointed because there were no obvious graphical glitches. It just looks like a smoother version of the original. Not only that, but some minor things were changed which made a big difference to players familiar with the game, and these changes are ones I applaud. For example, holding down triangle displays the boomerang menu. This was a feature originally introduced in Ty 2, and by adding this to this HD remaster it makes it easier to transition controls from the first game to the second, plus it makes selecting a boomerang easier. There are also little things like changes to sound effects, most notably the gliding sound effect (which again was introduced in the second game). The reason I appreciate these changes greatly is because as a kid I found the second game difficult to play after playing the first, so its good to see that the first game has been slightly changed to seem connected to its sequels.\n\nRegarding the game itself, for people who are not interested in the original and are simply looking to play it for a new experience, this game has a lot to offer. The story is unique and quirky. Not only that, but everything is just a great big nod towards Australia. Exploring the Great Barrier reef and the Australian outback while meeting cockatoos and dingoes and cassowaries and hearing about stories of Bunyips and the Dreamtime. In a way it's educational, but it's also lovely to see a game which defines its location beautifully. Who doesn't want to learn a few Australian phrases?\n\nThe colours are beautiful and appealing. Not too bright and not too dull. The lighting effects in some areas are also pleasing, especially in the level \"Bridge on the River TY\". The voice acting sounds natural and the lines aren't cheesy, which is surprising since many child-friendly games include cheesy  quotes. The characters are all unique in their own way. Overall I think only one character has major development throughout the game, but honestly this isn't a game which needs overwhelming character development; we see the rest of the cast develop over the trilogy. In this game it's just fun to see the characters interact with Ty without needing to see them develop majorly.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack. I love the soundtrack. I used to have it on my iPod before it bust. Ty just has this soundtrack which you can hear and then say \"Yup. This is from Ty\". Not only that buts it's catchy, and certain leitmotifs are repeated from the main theme into certain levels, which I find most effective in the final battle. \n\nLastly, I like to appeciate the animations, from Ty's idle animations to the four different movement animations depending on how hard you push the control stick. Even in games today some companies only do two animations for a character moving, maybe three if they're trying hard. And some games have dropped idle animations completely; either that or there's only one idle animation which barely does anything.\n\nSo overall, this is the sort of game I would force upon anyone who wants a new platforming experience. We live in an age now where anthropomorphic animals are growing rapidly in popularity, so this game would surely appeal to that audience. I love this game and I appreciate so many things about it. The only issue I have is the Infrarang not being as accurate as it was in the original, but honestly that doesn't hinder the game at all.

Its goofy and fun and keeps you entertained for hours. The characters are quirky, the music is excellent, the levels are beautiful, and there's plenty to collect and explore for! I'm such a fan of collect-a-thon games, because they give me a motive to explore every corner of this virtual world and appreciate the design the developers had in mind. Level objectives are laid out for you, and sometimes even marked on the maps, but they still leave plenty of room for analyzing and creative thinking.\n\nThat being said, this game isn't difficult by any means. There are moments of frustration splattered in, but it's nothing to sweat over. The levels are fairly linear, if and only if you aren't looking to 100% complete the game. End world bosses aren't painfully difficult, but I also understand the intended audience for this game isn't looking for Dark Souls rage bosses. [spoiler](My exception being the second world boss, anything that involves sharks is too intense for me)[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, this game makes my child-like heart happy.

The voice acting is a little bit chessy tough, but you still cant help ,but laugh or smile from time to time, still i actually had fun with it as it is game that doesnt take it self to seriosuly in it story either witch is pretty  average . Anyway i had fun with this game and finishing ty 2 afterwards will be a trip down childhoodm memories as i havent play the second one for 12 or so years.

I remember coming back from school one day and pops had a bought my brother and I an Xbox (fun fact I was scared shitless by the ambience in the main menu on the Xbox so I hurries as much as I could to start a game or have a game inside it when starting the console). The games we had were Halo CE and this game, I liked halo but this game was just so much more enjoyable for me, the simplicity but still the depth it brought forward was enough to satisfy my childish self to continue and play and grind to get all those golden cogs and eggs so I could test out all those different varieties of boomerangs and I simply had a blast.\n\nNow when I look back I can still feel the joy I once felt purely from nostalgia, but with growing up and getting wiser and more perceptive, I also notice the games flaws. I felt it could get a bit too repetitive and some worlds were too large without really any way too get from point A to point B without running and feeling time consuming. \n\nGameplay wise it feels satisfying to throw the boomerangs, you can feel the weight behind the biting attack and the enemies are mildly difficult depending on your experience of these kind of games. Bosses felt original and fun to fight against (for the most part) and most levels are fun and original (except the hog riding level, that shit is fucking trash). The movement is good mostly but the parts where you need to walk slowly eg. Over thin ice it can feel frustrating because it is inconsistent. But the core gameplay is good for the most part. And the positives outshines the negatives. \n\nThe charming Australian caricature is funny and gives the game a sense of originality because if it didn't have the boomerang gameplay and the quirky accents it would pretty much be a rehash of every other plarform-type game that was consistently made during that time. And I think that's an strong plus.\n\nHonestly the whole genre of platform games are old and don't really fit my taste in games anymore. I may try to pick them up to give my inner childishness some respect but I more easily get drawn to more modern games. But that doesent remove the enjoyment that I will have from these kind of games under smaller gaming sessions. So I will simply say that if you have played this game once when you were younger pick it up and play it for the nostalgic effect, and those that haven't played this game (furthermore even heard of this game) try to pick it up as I dare to say that it truly is a hidden gem of it's time when it washed released.

Either way, it gave me a nice little dose of nostalgia while also offering solid gameplay, controls, music, and beautiful graphics that are remastered from their original PS2 version and amped up with adjustable effects synonymous with PC-originated games like water reflection and anti-aliasing. The water in this game is gorgeous. The game is also very easy to run at 60 FPS with decent video settings.\n\n\nThe platforming in this game feels good and sometimes varies with needing certain mechanics like using different boomerangs to activate platforms or recognizing patterns and figuring out timing. It uses the game's resources very well and tends to keep a good balance with its mechanics. When you get a new tool, the next level makes good use of it like how most games do, but it also makes plenty of use of all your other tools too. It makes nothing feel wasted or added in just for filler. Some of the bosses are counterintuitive to figure out how to beat them, but most are fine. Boss fights are more like puzzles than combat, but a lot of games from the PS2 era had similar mechanics. Each level looks really nice and has a lot of small places to explore, making it really fun to run around the world and seek collectibles and secrets. There aren't any terribly difficult parts in this game, but there is still challenge in it as well.\n\n\n\nIt's a really fun game and I definitely would recommend it, especially to gamers who are fans of PS2 era games or people who like 3D platforming and games like Spyro, Croc, and Banjo-Kazooie.

I probably spent the better part of one thousand hours wearing down my old PS2 disk years ago. I came back to it with the port here on Steam, and I can conclusively say that this is the best port I know to have been put on Steam, ever. The devs (the same studio from all the way back in 2002, though maybe not all the original staff) really put their hearts and souls into getting this classic to work on PCs. As near as I can tell, they even managed to convince the decade-and-a-half-old ORIGINAL GAME ENGINE to accept such modern amenities as adjustable graphics settings and, get this, re-bindable controls for keyboard. If that doesn't speak to the quality of both the game and the team behind it, then nothing does.\n\nOn to the game itself. The plot surrounds the eponymic character Ty, who is on a quest to save his family after they were imprisoned by the main antagonist, Boss Cass. The story makes somewhat little sense, but given the game's premise (anthropomorphic tiger collecting balls of light to save his family), I'll forgive it for that. Compare it to the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and you'll see that story generally came second or third to gameplay at the time this game came to be.\n\nThe game handles just like I remember from when I was young. It certainly isn't perfect; the camera can be mildly wonky and the jumping behavior is inconsistent at times, but Ty handles well and the biggest factor in the platforming is player skill, as it should be. One thing the game most certainly is NOT, is difficult. I 100%'d the game, at least as far as progress on the save is concerned (there's some extra stuff that doesn't count towards the total), in under 10 hours. But it was a blast the whole way through. I was brimming with so much nostalgia it gave me goosebumps at times.\n\nIf you liked the game when it was originally released, I can't recommend it more (at time of writing, it's even on sale!). If you're looking for a laid-back classic platformer, look no further. If you want to gallivant across a fictional Australia through worlds full of spirit filled with characters full of, well, character, then it doesn't get much better than this.\n\nYou don't get the single highest user satisfaction rating on Steam by making a bad game. Both the game itself and the quality of the port are absolutely outstanding, and the developers should be (and probably are) very proud of their work.

Normally a game doesn't physically make me nauseous, but this one did. \n\nFor starters, the game is very poorly optimized. I have a good PC that should be more that capable of running this piece of shit, but the framerate drops constantly, even on low settings.\n\nBut the thing that bothered me most was the sheer amount of annoying cutscenes, dialogue and tutorials. First of all, the game starts with a 15 minute pre-rendered cutscene that looks like garbage. Then during the game, these stupid, forgettable characters will never shut the fuck up even for a second. Literally the first level has like 15 tutorials in it. And they just pop up, you can't avoid them. Normally I'm not the kind of person to skip tutorials or cutscenes but good god, it really got out of hand and I started having to skip everything so I wouldn't puke. Of course, not doing the tutorials means I had no idea what most of the things in the game were for so it just seemed like I was picking up useless objects.\n\nBut probably the worst part about this is that they can't just say something like \"This here is a checkpoint. If you die, you restart from here.\" No. They have to have this fucking senile cockatoo go \"OY MATE ONE TIME I WAS DOWN AT THE BARBY AND THIS BLOKE CAME UP TO ME AND STARTED BLOWIN' ME MATE, BUT CRIKEY I WAS DAFT AS A WALLABY AND DIDN'T REALIZE THIS BLOKE HAD DRUGGED MY MARTINI AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW I WOKE UP IN THIS DODGEY SHACK, MATE!\" Yes, I get it, the shack is a checkpoint now shut the fuck up. They have the most long-winded lore-friendly ways to explain every tiny fucking game mechanic that's commonplace in every platformer. No, I really don't need to have a lore reason to collect five bonus blue koalas in every level. I really don't. And I sure as hell don't need you to explain it to me.\n\nYou might say that I didn't spend enough time with this game, and that the amount of tutorials and annoying bullshit cutscenes go down as the game progresses, but it doesn't matter how good a game gets if the beginning of the game makes you want to blow your brains out. You wouldn't stab an active soldering iron into your eyeball just to get an ice cream cone afterwards.\n\nI wasn't going to mention this at first, but now I'm on rant so I may as well: The visuals look like they were drawn by a fucking 12 year old on DeviantArt. I'm sorry, but you know it's true. If you told me that Ty was designed by a third grader, I would honestly believe you.\n\nMy last gripe is that the bite move makes a sound effect that makes it sound like Ty is literally biting into his lip. It's the grossest sound and it makes me want to puke.\n\nThe only positive things I can say about this game are that picking up the gems is satisfying and the music is alright. I thought about it for a while, but those are literally the only compliments I can give to this piece of trash.\n\n\nThis game is literally shovelware, and it's really no different from any of the other failed platformer mascots like Bubsy. I could probably find this game in the $1 bargain bin at WalMart. The amount of people calling this game a classic makes me lose so much faith in the gaming community. Everyone is either nostalgia blind as fuck, or have no clue about game design, or even what fun is. This is the reason so many shitty games have such high ratings. The only way a game will have a low rating on Steam is if it has a technical issue that prevents the game from running, or some popular YouTuber says it's bad so all these kids give it a bad review to try to fit in. \n\nFuck this game.\n\nEDIT: I don't get why this game coming out 15 years ago is an excuse for it to be terrible.

TY was a huge part of my childhood and I remember stumbling across this game in one of my local game stores. I must have been around 9 years old when I first played it back in the day and I have so many fond childhood memories of this classic childhood gem. When I found out sometime last year that the developers of the series wanted to remaster and revamp the game up to today`s modern day and age technology, I couldn`t have been more thrilled and excited to see one of my favourite childhood games comeback to life. I only just got a brand new PC a few weeks ago and I couldn`t wait to buy it on Steam and sit down with this gem to take a nice stroll down memory lane. \n\nThe game feels like exactly how I remember it. The developers have done a smashing job on making this an amazing port of a classic. The visuals in the game look beautiful, the soundtracks to the levels are still the good old same fun rocking tunes that I love and remember. There`s been quite a few improvments though that I have noticed which make this port even more of a perfect hit such as the loading times which have been dramatically improved over the original game. Taken no more than 2 - 3 seconds max to load up a single level or your saved game file which is fantastic. I love how they have enhanced and revamped everything in the game and the developers have certainly put alot of hard work and effort into making this a solid good tremendous port that is well worth the valueble purchase of your wallet. \n\nTY is a beautiful gorgeous 3D platformer that is well worth investing your money in if your a huge fan of many other great platformers out there that were great back in the day from the likes of Ratchet and Clank , Jak and Daxter , Sly Cooper then you will most certanily love this. If you`ve already played the original back in the day in your childhood then by all means this is without a doubt worth another round of replaying through. If your a newcomer to the series but are a fan of platfomers then TY is a game definitely worth giving a shot and I highly recommend it to all those platformer fans out there who have yet to discover the series as well as newcomers out there who are willing to give it a try.\n\nFor those who are new to the games TY is more of a open ended 3D platformer game that is very easy to pick up and enjoy though the game is quite linear as well. The storyline of the game is pretty much simple, you guide TY through a number of levels collecting a variety of different collectables on your travels such as opals , thunder eggs and bilbies that help you progress through the game. The main plot of the game for background purposes is to retrieve back all the talismans from the evil boss Cass who plans to use them for his own uses to rule the world. \n\nFeatures in the game as a small breakdown \n- Open ended charming 3D platformer with a fun cast of characters to meet\n- A huge variety of boomerangs that help aid you in your quest \n- Run . jump , swing and glide through 17 amazing levels full of great platforming and challenge \n- Offers a nice variety of mini games\n- Beautiful and updated enhanced graphics\n\nThe performance of the game is very good. It runs pretty much smooth with very little hiccups. The design of the levels are stunning and have been reworked , revamped and polished very well to golden standards. It`s amazing to see that even 15 years on after it`s release that TY still has the power of showing how good and strong the 3D platformer genre is. This is a worthy port and a prime example of a how a great port of a classic should be done. It`s been handled with great love and care by the developers and I couldn`t be more greatful and thankful to them for making this happen. It`s such a warm feeling inside and feels good to have this classic childhood franchise back in my life again. Everytihng in the original is on par with what they have done with the port. \n\nWhat I will also say is as well is that TY is one of those platformers out there that is more forgiving than other hardcore platformers such as Crash Bandicoot. You will find that many parts of the game can be forgiving at times making this ease of accessible to newcomers out there who may not be familiar with the core of the game`s mechanics. Just as an example  to show how forgiving the mechanics are to those who are new and unaware the checkpoint system within the levels of the game are quite frequent and there`s quite alot them placed through out the levels which is nice since it can benefit those who may struggle in later parts of the game whereas compared to the hardcore platformer types out there such as Crash Bandicoot, you`ll find checkpoints are place very far out in between. Also the gamepad controls for the game are very easy to pick up and learn and there is no need to hassle around with controller configuration as the game has full integration support of controller gamepad`s which means all the controls are all automatically set up for you and ready to use when you boot the game up. \n\nMy conclusion summary and my final thoughts on the game\n\nA beautiful and very well crafted port that I couldn`t recommend more. If your a fan of the old school 3D type platformers then TY is a another one of those childhood revival classics that you will love and if you have yet to dip your feet into this series then by all means give it a try if you have some cash floating around because it is a blast to play and I would recommend this to any newcomer who is just looking for a relaxing, casual and fun game to pick up. On a final note I want to say a massive thank you to Krome Studio`s for brinigng back one of my all time favourite nostalgia classics of all time. So many great childhood memories with this game and it feels so great to take a nice trip down memory lane to relive this classic. Absolutely stunning and amazing game that deserves another chance at getting rebooted in the near future. A great game with great value at a great affordable price.\n\nBONZA! You still got the magic KROME Studio`s\n\nScore - 9/10\n\n( PROS )\n- A solid well hand crafted 3D platformer with smooth and responding controls\n- Great cast of characters each with there own unique fun personalities\n- Epic and awsome soundtracks for each and every level\n- Great variety in weapon choice of the number of boomerangs on offer which each define many different types of damage and wondeful effects that lead to great and fun gameplay when using them\n- Good camera controls and cut-scenes render very good\n\n( Negitives ) \n- A few minor bugs and little frame rates clipping from time to time but overall runs very smooth in most parts of the game.\n\nThat concludes my review and my very first review for a Steam product.", "timestamp_created": 1504452295, "timestamp_updated": 1504453264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34649397": {"recommendationid": "34649397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125515112", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499751713}, "language": "english", "review": "A great refresh of an old 2000's classic!

I never played it back in its original heyday with the other mascot games, but it does compare favorably to games such as Spyro the Dragon, Sly Cooper, and Jak and Daxter. There are nine environments, with one hub world and one boss world, with plenty of stuff to do that allows for exploration and decent combat and puzzle solving.\n\n The only 2 problems I had that were of any substance were \n1) TY literally only saying 1 liner catch phrases, with an occasional dumb question to progress the dialogue (seriously, every other character had some personality, while TY would be better off as Gordon Freeman), and \n2) seemingly random patches in the environment that you aren't supposed to enter, but can anyways. Going up on that snowy mountain? Hope you don't hit a patch of rock that isn't covered in snow, because you're about to go for a slip n slide ride!\n\nOtherwise, there was some minor stuff that is just pedantic, so I won't go over them. There is plenty of stuff to collect. You don't get punished a multitude of times for the same mistake (e.g. if you jump into a flamethrower, you take damage once and then either get knocked back to your starting position or keep going, with a short immunity, instead of getting knocked off a cliff and having to run all the way back). Most NPCs are interesting, the game doesn't unnecessarily drag on, and the boomerangs and their many varieties are integrated well enough that it is worth using most of the upgrades for a variety of situations.\n\nOverall, it's a solid mascot/3D action platformer from the PS2 era, a rarity on the steam platform. It doesn't have much to set it apart from other mascot games, other than an Australian theme, but there are very few if any major drawbacks. If you like Spyro, Sly Cooper, Crash, Jak and Daxter, etc etc this is a solid nostalgia trip but won't be anything terribly new. If you haven't, it's a solid entry that showcases what these types of games are about.

Unlike a lot of contemporaries it doesn't shove garbage awful minigames down your throat constantly. Yeah, there are a few but they're usually both brief and really easy and the vast majority of the gameplay (95%+) is platforming and collecting.\n\nThe game does feel a little archaic at times - the camera isn't great, the glide/jump mechanic is a bit weird and inconsistent, and the boss battles are all kind of rubbish. But Ty controls decently and the game gives you all the tools you need to complete the game & find everything should you be willing to put in the effort.\n\nThe game also runs out of ideas for the last third of the game, with the three levels in the third tier of levels all reusing scenery and ideas from the first six levels. There's kind of a fresh spin on it to some degree, but it still feels kind of like filler, especially that second water level which is just... pointlessly spacious. As well there are some really annoyingly hidden things in the first water level that I wasn't a fan of (probably spent more time there than any other level). I think the length of the game is just right for this kind of game though, I got 15 hours out of it and felt pretty satisfied with that, not really craving much more but not feeling like I didn't get enough either.\n\nIt is a bit dated of a game but, honestly? I found this more enjoyable than Yooka-Laylee on the whole, even with its problems. It's just a nice, refreshing dose of 3D platforming & collecting the way I like it, without the pointless fluff that drags down a lot of contemporaries (Spyro 2 & 3 and the first Sly Cooper game both come to mind). And for $15 it's a pretty solid deal (though I got it for cheaper). Definitely pick it up if you're interested - I have zero nostalgia for this game as I'd never played it before but I can decisively recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1499414030, "timestamp_updated": 1499457002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33331200": {"recommendationid": "33331200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282852686", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499789777}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is everything I could wish for and more.

I saw it on steam and figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nBoy I'm glad I did.  This game was one of the many \"early 2000's\" platformers / collectathons that were oh so popular back then.  Some others of note being the Jak and Daxter series, ratchet and clank, hell, even spongebob battle for bikini bottom.  A bunch more too.\n\nAnyways, the movement is a little bit faster than you'd expect at first, but you get used to it.\n\nNine levels to explore with a bunch of different boomerangs to collect.  You could probably blaze through the game pretty fast if you wanted to, but it's well worth grabbing as much as you can along the way.  The maps are fairly large later on.\n\nThe game is very forgiving with some mechanics that other games are much more blunt with.  For example, you can swim underwater for a LONG time before drowning, which is really nice.  Checkpoints are frequent and deaths do not interrupt boss battles.  The boomerangs are essentially infinite ammo ranged weapons with some strings attached depending on the set you are using.\n\nThe game has a very nice flow with the animations used.  SMOOTH AS BUTTER!  The game runs pretty well on low to midrange systems, so you shouldn't have to worry about lowering settings.\n\nStory wise, it's a little all over the place, but that's OK given it's a platformer with multiple different levels with very different settings.  The cutscenes have a sort of TV-show quality that seemed \"OK\" but didn't really detract from the overall experience.\n\nto summarize:\n\n+ 2000's era platformer, find the things to get to the next place to find the things, etc.\n+ BOOMERANGS!  Fun as hell to use.\n+ Diverse levels with mixed platforming and combat.\n+ No major glitches of note.\n+ Interesting boss fights\n+ Looks fantastic, some subtle graphical updates really make this 15-year-old game shine.\n+ Voice acting is great.  Get used to australian accents and words that leave the uninitiated confused.\n\n~ Music is good, but gets repeditive.\n~ Camera can get a little wonky in some areas, but is overall fine.\n\n- 100% can be a grind if you miss certain collectibles on your first run through. There is a cheat code that reveals collectibles that you can use if you really need to.\n\n\nIf you are looking for that authentic early 2000's platforming experience, I highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1498941280, "timestamp_updated": 1498941280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33096650": {"recommendationid": "33096650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071742206", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499437673}, "language": "english", "review": "Only played the second one as a kid, this game is great and actually (kinda) hard for being a kids game. 10/10 buy it, but only if you have a controller.", "timestamp_created": 1498935514, "timestamp_updated": 1498935514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33082786": {"recommendationid": "33082786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027327538", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499172700}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good and funny.

It would need to be a game that has secured a special place in my heart, and resonate with me on multiple sentimental levels.\n \nTy the Tasmanian Tiger can lay claim to this feat.\n\n[b] TLDR at bottom [/b]\n\nTy the Tasmanian Tiger was released in 2002 for the PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube. My copy of the game was for the PS2 system. Being released alongside contemporaries Ratchet, Sly Cooper, and Jak, I saw Ty as part of this hypothetical Sony mascot tetrarchy of heroism. Wicked Australian accent? Boomerang slinger? Cool character design and art style? Ty was totally awesome. Being around 6 or 7 years old at the time, it was a flourishing era of elementary imagination and exploration. I would daydream about my video game heroes teaming up, indulge in make-believe adventures with them during recess, and make poorly-scribbled doodles on my spelling tests. It was great.\n\n[i] 15 years later, the game is still great. [/i]\n\nThere is a decent number of \"nostalgia\" reviews. Which is just fine, but I wanted to give a little more information on the game and why one should check it out, especially if you are younger, and have not grown up with this game or its sequals.\n\n[u] Brief Overview [/u]\nFor those that are more unfamiliar with this game, or have heard of it and simply not played it before, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger game is an action/adventure collect-em-up game similar to other titles such as Jak and Daxter, Banjo-Kazooie, and Super Mario 64.\nTy is a young Thylacine who discovers that an evil cassoweary (weird bird/ostrich thing) named Boss Cass has stolen a handful of mystic talismans and banished your parents to the Dreaming. The talismans are now scattered across the Outback and it is up to Ty to track them down, defeat Cass, and rescue his family!\n\n[u] Straight-to-the-point Review [/u]\n[b] Graphics: [/b] The game is beautiful. The colors are bright and vivid, the remastered textures look excellent, the water looks refreshing, and the dynamic shadows are just the icing on the cake. Avid players of the original will also notice additional decorations and foliage in the levels as well. The FPS is superb. Never dropped below 60. It's pretty crazy remembering that the game came out 15 years ago.\n\n[b] Gameplay: [/b] The platforming in the game is very fun and diverse in nature that differs between the various levels in the game, with different tasks in these levels that provide some variety in the odd jobs you need to complete for the game's primary collectable, Thunder Eggs. There are also secondary, optional collectibles: Golden Cogs. These are acquired in order to create \"techno rangs,\" which are separate from the boomerangs you obtain through story progression. Controls are tight and extremely refined for keyboard and mouse, making the platforming more enjoyable, and the combat fluid.\n\n[b] Weapons: [/b] Guns, swords, spells, miracles, ninjutsu, runes... those are pretty neat and all.\nHowever, there is a certain satisfaction that can only be achieved through hitting something in the face with a boomerang that explodes.\n\n[b] Levels: [/b] Ty the Tasmanian Tiger features the popular World Hub mechanic. This certainly isn't a bad thing when it works well, which it does. There are 10 primary levels, 9 of which are the levels you explore to retrieve Thunder Eggs. Each level is unique. Though some do indeed share similarities, they are very distinct from one another in design, and are all quite memorable and fun to explore.\n\n[b] Characters: [/b] They are all enjoyable and goofy. Some a bit more odd than others. Some may give you trust issues. They may not be super fleshed-out with deep backstory, but they have their charms, and that's enough for me.\n\n[b] Cutscenes/Animation: [/b] This is the primary area in which this game shows its age. The animations for some of the enemies and NPCs look very dated, especially during the in-engine cutscenes within the levels. However, this is forgivable understanding that the game was released in 2002, and that it doesn't subtract from the gameplay itself.\nOn the flip side, the intro cutscene and primary story cutscenes are rendered and animated at a much higher quality, and look pretty dang awesome. They invoke a sense of \"Indie animated movie\" style.\n\n[b] Music: [/b] Ah yes. This is one of those games. One of those few games that you play the full soundtrack on YouTube while playing other games. The music is one of the most memorable, nostalgia-trip-inducing aspects of this game. The reason that there is a soundtrack available for purchase with this game. It's style is simple, satisfying, and has a very distictive Australian twang to it. Many of the tracks delve into quite a wide range of genre styles, but come full circle and include catchy motifs in the tunes.\nUnderstand that the soundtrack isn't the next revolutionary soundscape, and some of the enjoyment may be nostalgia-fuelled, but it is certainly catchy, addicting, and definitely worth a listen.\n\n[u] Conclusion/TLDR [/u]\nTy the Tasmanian Tiger is as solid a adventure/platformer title now as it was 15 years ago. The remastered graphics and textures are awesome. 60 FPS. Tight controls even with keyboard and mouse. The in-engine animated sequences look quite dated, but are forgivable. Story cutscene animations are excellent. The characters are charming and goofy. The music is very catchy and addicting.\n\n[u] Overall Rating [/u]\n[h1] Totally Wicked! [/h1]\n\n(For those curious, I did indeed derive part of my name from this game. You'll [i] never [/i] guess where the other half came from.)\n\nWould recommend this game to anyone. It is a must-buy for fans of the original that grew up with it, as well as those seeking a classic platforming, collect-em-up Outback adventure.\n\nVery much looking forward to the future remasters of the sequels!", "timestamp_created": 1498664948, "timestamp_updated": 1511718202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32914649": {"recommendationid": "32914649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202345020", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493949571}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Game Ever!", "timestamp_created": 1498630505, "timestamp_updated": 1498630505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32902369": {"recommendationid": "32902369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039910883", "num_games_owned": 473, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490844441}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Early 2000s 3D platformer game glad its fially getting some more attention!

I missed out on it because I didn't own any \"nextgen\" video game consoles back then. That's a shame, 12-year-old me would have loved it way more than I like it now, and I do. This is a game that's good and worthwhile, but features some problems common to 3D platformers from back in its time which make it not as good as it had all the right to be.\n\nThe game follows the story of Ty, a Tasmanian tiger (well, duh) who is supposedly the last descendant from a proud tribe that fought off evil avian fiend Boss Cass, foiling his ultimate plan of obtaining the five talismans of unfathomable power in his attempt dethrone mammals from the top of the food chain to honor his dinosaur ancestry. The game itself kicks off with Ty casually playing hide and seek with his adoptive family of bilbies when, suddenly, he falls into a hole and meets the spirit of an odd sage of sorts. The spirit tells Ty about his ancestors' deeds, and that Boss Cass is trying to gather the talismans again, and that Ty is the only one who can stop Cass's evil plans. There's something rather charming and nostalgic about the pre-rendered cutscenes used in this game instead of in-engine cutscenes that are more common nowadays. I really enjoy those, if only for the retro feel alone. As a main character, Ty strikes me as an awesome, enthusiastic, energetic and brave marsupial that is always ready to run around, hop on difficult platforms and land his boomerang on every baddie's face.\n\nTo aid Ty in his quest, he counts with a roster of endearing NPC friends, all based on Australian animals, each with their own charmingly exaggerated cartoon-esque personality. In fully voice acted (take note, Yooka-Laylee) cutscenes, they tell Ty about small missions he has to accomplish in order to gather special tokens, as well as hints about the controls and the game's mechanics, and warnings about the evil fiends and hazards that Ty may need to face ahead of him. Every character has an awesome Australian accent which adds even more charm to this radical outback adventure, and every cutscene and dialog in the game is rich in silly yet endearing humor. Among the roster of characters, there's the aforementioned titular character, plus an old cockatoo named Maurie who sounds like a wise yet slightly crazy old man, a koala scientist named Julius who acts in a stereotypical nerdy way that's rather endearing, and an awesome handful of others. I particularly like the mysterious Sly, and it saddens me that the game's story didn't explore this character in more detail at all.\n\nSpeaking of outback, the overall graphical design in this game is spot on, in spite of the low tech nature of it. Sure, they may look way too polygonal, pointy and unappealing for today's standards, but they're nothing if not effective in capturing that neat Australian feel, in both the scenery and the characters. Rainbow Cliffs looks and feels like a spot on Australian scenery, and every level represents, in one way or another, some kind of landscape that one may encounter in Australia, except with awesome platforming and treacherous traps thrown in for good measure. In his journey, Ty will go through rainforests, the outback desert itself, snowy mountains, beaches, and many other kinds of natural landscapes that occur in Australia, and that makes for an epic thematic experience I really enjoy. \n\nAs far as sound goes, I like the voice acting and the sound effects, they're appropriately comical and cartoonish, and fit well with the atmosphere of the game. The dialogs are particularly funny, always featuring some comedic exchanges and overall endearingly cheesy personalities. The music is nice as well, going for a mix between relaxing guitar music and some Australian tribal instruments (like the didgeridoo), always sounding appropriately upbeat when needed, and more calm and contained when the situation calls for it. It's always catchy, though, and that's a plus in my book. As I write this, I have the Rainbow Cliffs song stuck in my head.\n\nSpeaking of Rainbow Cliffs, I find the way this game deals with level design rather interesting. Rainbow Cliffs serves as an \"open world\" area of sorts, full of tiny secrets to be uncovered and serving as a hub area to enter the levels as well as a safe, open space for you to test out your movement skills. The levels themselves are an interesting beast: while some 3D platformers from the past went for straight-up linear levels with maybe a few secret passages (like the original Crash Bandicoot or the PS1 Pac-Man game) and others went for the open-level fetch quest style (like, say, Super Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie), this game goes for a mix between the two approaches. Every level has a linear-ish path that the player may follow from beginning to end, but along the path there are some more open-ish places that players may want to explore in order to find special tokens, discover shortcuts and special areas, accomplish certain missions assigned to them by the NPCs or rescue some bilbie friends. This semi-linear approach is effective because you hardly ever feel lost (and even if you do, every level counts with a map that you can look at by pressing the menu button) but it still gives you something more to do than simply going straight from start to finish. The movement mechanics themselves work fine, and the individual sections of the levels are well designed to the point where it's fun to run, jump, battle, swim, glide and do whatever else you need to do to get them Thunder Egg thingies.\n\nThis semi-linear design, however, comes with a price that I can't overlook: it sometimes tries to force the player to follow the predetermined path in the cheapest ways possible, like invisible walls and twisty, redundant paths. It feels realy cheap to not be able to jump to something that's right in front of you because of a stupid invisible wall that's disguised as a handful of foresty-looking sprites. This kind of thing was way too common in platformers back in the day, limiting the player's exploration possibilities, and it throws me off a bit.\n\nNow, one thing I really like about this game's overall mechanics is the \"key-and-keyhole\" aesthetic of acquiring new skills and applying them to open new paths. Whether it's gliding with two boomerangs, swimming, or any other skill that Ty may get to learn during the game, learning new skills in a level always opens up new possibilities, both in previous levels where something may have been out of reach (or just hard to reach) in your first visit, and in Rainbow Cliffs, where you're finally able to access a rainbow scale that you couldn't get to before, or a new set of levels to play in order to obtain some Thunder Eggs. The feeling of satisfaction you get when you obtain a new power that allows you to get to a place that you previously located but couldn't reach is one of the things I like the most in games, as it gives the experience a sense of progression that no other form of media has. I do feel like this aspect of the design should have been explored more than it was, maybe adding some extra secret stuff that you can only open with the right 'rang, but that could have alienated portions of the target audience that prefer their games to be straight-forward, it's okay that they chose not to do that.\n\nNow, I know I complimented the level design a lot, and while it's definitely good, it is far from perfect. One huge problem I have are the bosses which, while mostly fun, may sometimes be pretty close to impossible to figure out on your own if you're dumb like me. I had to look up walkthroughs for three of the bosses, including the final battle one, and I can't help but assume this is a flaw of the game itself. I mean, I never had problems figuring out bosses in any other 3D platformer, so maybe this one didn't care to make the bosses intuitive to figure out.", "timestamp_created": 1494916848, "timestamp_updated": 1494917464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694437", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31777200": {"recommendationid": "31777200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040725491", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494895014}, "language": "english", "review": "Great nostalgia trip. way easier than I remember. about a 10 -15 hour play dependent one your skill at video games.", "timestamp_created": 1494885521, "timestamp_updated": 1494885521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31765476": {"recommendationid": "31765476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060128039", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499648714}, "language": "english", "review": "arguably the definitive version of the 6th-gen-era Australia Simulator. still has the iffy controls of the original and the annoying caveats of the collectathon genre (good luck trying to get all the opals), but it's a damn fine port and worth a pickup if you're into collectathon platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1494841221, "timestamp_updated": 1494841221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31710557": {"recommendationid": "31710557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040823405", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510542291}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't tell you what a good feeling it was to find out I wasn't the only person who loved this game as a kid.

Diese Neuauflage des tasmanischen Tigers ist trotz des Alters, eines der besten Jump and Run Spiele seit langem. Ich hatte einen riesigen Nostalgieboom und Erinnerungen an meine Kindheit, als ich dieses Spiel gespielt habe. \n\nTy der junge tasmanische Tiger erlebt wohl die beste [b]Geschichte[/b], die das australische Outback je gesehen hat. \nEines Tages begegnet Ty dem Bunyip-\u00c4ltesten, welcher ihm erz\u00e4hlt, wo dass Tys Verwandten und Artgenossen geblieben sind. Der b\u00f6se Kausar namens Boss Cass wollte die f\u00fcnf mystische Talismane in seinen Besitz bringen, um \u00fcber das Land zu herrschen. Doch die tasmanischen Tiger machten ihm einen Strich durch die Rechnung, worauf hin er sie mit den Talismane in die Traumzeit verbannte. Die Talismane wurden dabei jedoch \u00fcber das ganze Land verstreut. \nTy erh\u00e4lt bei der Rettung seiner Familie Unterst\u00fctzung von deinem Freund dem Koala, ein unglaublich guter Wissenschaftler mit dessen Maschine er die Talismane finden kann, um seine geliebten zu retten. Diese Maschine ben\u00f6tigt jedoch sogenannte Amulettsteine, um betrieben zu werden und so macht sich Ty nun auf die Suche danach. \n\nDas [b]Gameplay[/b] verteilt sich auf mehrere grosse Levels, welche alle durch eine Oberwelt miteinander verbunden sind. \nJedes Gebiet ist sehr abwechslungsreich gestaltet und unterscheidet sich stark zu den anderen. Urwald, Schnee, Wasser, Strand, fast alle Szenarien wurden implementiert und jedes ist detailreich mit Vegetation, Tieren, Felsformationen, Geb\u00e4uden und nat\u00fcrlich vielen R\u00e4tseln gef\u00fcllt. Immer gibt es neue Mechaniken, welche das Gameplay auffrischen, sei dies das Reiten auf einem gigantischen Bullen, das geniessen einer Wasserrutsche oder das bedienen eines Gesch\u00fctzes. \nZu sammeln gibt es unglaublich viel. Jesdes Level h\u00e4lt Opale, Amulettsteine, goldene Z\u00e4hnr\u00e4der, duzende Bilderrahmen und Tys gefangene Freunde versteckt. \nJedes dieser Items hat auch eine Bedeutung. So dienen Amulettsteine dem Spielvortschritt, Bilderrahmen um die Galerie freizuschalten und die Zahnr\u00e4der um neue Bumerangs zu erhalten. \nBumerangs sind neben zahlreichen F\u00e4higkeiten, welche Ty zum Meisterathleten machen, die Hauptwaffen unseres Helden. Mit unz\u00e4hligen Variationen wie einen Feuerrang, Eisrang, Aquarang usw. k\u00e4mpft man sich durch die Levels und verklopft jeden Anh\u00e4nger von Boss Cass. Von denen gibt es nach jedem Abschnitt auch eine grosse Variante, welche zwar relativ einfach zu besiegen sind, dennoch ganz sch\u00f6n Spass machen. \nDas beinah beste am Spiel ist die Art bzw. den Humor der Charaktere und den Charm, welche die Entwickler hineingesteckt haben. Unglaublich witzige Dialoge zieren das Spiel, auch wenn leider viele Witze ins deutsche \u00fcbersetzt nicht mehr ganz so gut sind, wie sie urspr\u00fcnglich w\u00e4ren. \n\nDer [b]Soundtrack sowie die Soundeffekte[/b] sind sehr gelungen. Die fetzige australische Musik untermalt jedes Level mit einer passenden Stimmung. Auch wenn nicht alle Titel einen Ohrwurm ausl\u00f6sen, sind sie dennoch \u00fcberaus gut.\n\n[b]Grafik[/b] ist nat\u00fcrlich f\u00fcr heutige Verh\u00e4ltnise weit unter dem Standard. Es ist ein altes Spiel und trotz leichten Verbesserungen wie Ambient Occlusion oder Bloom sieht das Spiel nur leicht besser aus, als das Original. \nWiedergegeben wird das Spiel \u00fcbrigens mit maximal 60fps. Trotzdem sieht das Spiel unglaublich stimmig aus und nach sp\u00e4testens ein paar Minuten wird man vergessen, dass es schon weit mehr als ein Jahrzehnt alt ist. \n\n[b]Optionen[/b] fehlt es dem Spiel nicht. Grafik, Soundlautst\u00e4rken, Untertitel ist alles einstellbar vertreten. Die Steuerung l\u00e4sst sich leicht konfigurieren, d.h Tastenbelegungen sind fix jedoch hat man die Wahl zwischen Tastatur oder Controller und kann mehrere Presets nach belieben benutzen. Das komplette Spiel unterst\u00fctzt mehrere Sprachen, sowohl Text als auch Ton ist komplett auf deutsch verf\u00fcgbar. \n\nDie [b]Spielzeit[/b] l\u00e4uft f\u00fcr Neuzug\u00e4nger wie mich f\u00fcr die 100% inklusive [b]Steam Errungenschaften[/b] auf ca. 20 Stunden heraus. Man wird also eine Weile spass haben. \n\n[b]Performance (Problem?... Nein!)[/b]\nDies ist ein Problem, welches laut Recherche nur mich betroffen hat und ich auch nicht l\u00f6sen konnte. Die Performance scheint ansonsten bei allen Nutzern gut zu sein. \nTrotz erf\u00fcllten Mindestanforderungen mit einer GTX 760 GPU und einer i7 4770k CPU und aktuellen Treibern, konnte ich das Siel nicht auf h\u00f6chsten Einstellungen fl\u00fcssig Spielen. Empfohlen wird eine GTX 770, was f\u00fcr solche Grafik eigentlich sehr hoch ist. \nIch hatte das Problem, dass ich massive fps Einbr\u00fcche bis auf die niedrigen 10er hatte, sobald mehrere Gegenst\u00e4nde im nahen Sichtfeld angezeigt wurden. Nach deaktivieren der Kantengl\u00e4ttung und von SSAO sowie Bloom wurde dies zwar besser, drops hatte ich jedoch immer noch bis auf 20fps. Mir blieb schlussendlich nichts \u00fcbrig, als die Grafikeinstellungen bis auf die Sichtweite komplett ins Minimum zu stellen, wodurch sich meine Probleme praktisch l\u00f6sten. Wirklich schlechter sah das Spiel dadurch aber nicht aus. Ich lasse dieses Problem jetzt nicht in meine Spielewertung infliessen. \n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\nTY the Tasmanian Tiger ist ein grandioses altes 3D Jump 'n' Run f\u00fcr alle Fans und liebhaber dieses Genres. Das Spiel zeugt von unvergleichlichem australischem Humor und bietet die volle L\u00e4nge Spass beim Zocken. Es ist mit einem Preis von momentan 15 CHF/Euro perfekt im Preis-Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis und ein Must-Play f\u00fcr alle, welche sich von einem guten 3D Platformer mit grossen, detailierten Levels und abwechslungsreichem Gameplay begeistern lassen. \nVon meiner Seite aus eine [b]klare Kaufempfehlung[/b]!", "timestamp_created": 1491415976, "timestamp_updated": 1491417245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540583", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30952339": {"recommendationid": "30952339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067674592", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490366980}, "language": "english", "review": "Awsome port!\nRuns very well,just like the game used to be!More and better textures!\nDespite the weird menu it's still awsome game,and I recommend for anyone looking for a plantaform game in this days\n\nMusic-9/10\nGameplay-10/10\nStory-6/10\n\nOverall\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1491351932, "timestamp_updated": 1491351932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575415", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30929437": {"recommendationid": "30929437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035595681", "num_games_owned": 735, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491228611}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic Port.

In the game, you play as the Thyracine named Ty, who stumbles upon a cave of paintings depicting the destruction of the Outback by one known as Boss Cass, a Cassowary, who threatens to revert the Outback to prehistoric times, putting cold-blooded lizards at the top of the food chain once again. It is up to Ty and his band of fauna to put a stop to the stubborn bird's plans.\n\nHaving sunk 15 hours into the game, I was able to complete the game at 100%, including all Steam achievements (and this was at a relaxed pace, and knowing what to do due to previous experience).  I would say that a newcommer to the series would be able to beat the game to 100% in 24 hours. For the nice price of twelve dollars USD, I would say that it is money well spent, moving up and about the Australian Outback with a small Arsenal of boomerangs.\n\nParental Advisory: Ty's girlfriend is a Dingo, whilist Ty is a Thylacine. Interspecies relationships exist in this game. Be forewarned. If your child plays this game and expresses wanton for interspecies relationships, sit them down and explain why such things are frivilous.\n\nStory: 7/10 \nYou know what you are doing most of the time and you are given direction.

This is everything an HD conversion should be, as not only does it feature properly enhanced graphics for modern systems, but load times are blisteringly fast and both menus and controls have been significantly improved over the original release.\n\nTY itself is an easy but enjoyable platform game with well-designed levels, tons of visual flair, and lots of stuff to collect.  There isn't much story and the game isn't terribly innovative, but it's crafted with enough polish to satisfy casual gamers looking for a few laughs over 5-10 hours depending on your acquisition  OCD.  It was infamous for rather twitchy controls which normally would not age well, but this update has addressed most of the serious control and camera problems.  I highly recommend playing with a mouse, though you'll need to tone the sensitivity way down if you value your sanity.\n\nMy major gripe is that the boss battles can be very confusing and have no continuity with either the character development or the story, but thankfully there's not many of them and they're not terribly difficult.  There are also some jumping puzzles that require pixel precision (par for the course in the early 90's).\n\nOverall, well worth the entry fee and a wonderful nostalgia kick updated by the original development label.  Every classic game should receive this kind of treatment if a re-release is being considered.\n\nTY 2 is currently in development, and hopefully the entire trilogy will be released eventually.

It runs smoothly even on the lowest ends of pcs, in low settings. Also the soundtrack is charming and very nice to listen to!

However that didn\u00b4t stop me from fully enjoying the game, it\u00b4s very simplistic and someone that don\u00b4t even play video games on a regular basis can play this game with no problems.\n\nThe Story:\n\nThis story takes place in Australia and you play as a Tasmanian tiger called Ty. Ty\u00b4s family has been trapped in the spirit world by the evil Boss Cass (The Main Villain of the story). It is now up to Ty to save his family and friends from Boss Cass who wants power from the ancient Talismans that trapped Ty\u00b4s family in the spirit world. You will be travelling across multiple different enviroments of Australia to find them including the forests, the outback and the great barrier reef. Along the way you will be facing Boss Cass\u00b4 goons that include kangaroos, frill lizards and blue tongue lizards as well as mini bosses like a bull, a cyborg shark and a massive mountain monster.\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nThe gameplay isn\u00b4t too advanced. Combat consists of you throwing boomerangs and techno boomerangs at foes as well as biting them. You will also be gliding, swiming and jumping a lot since the game is a 3D platformer after all. In each level there are different tasks that include finding and saving your friends, collecting all opals and collecting all golden cogs that will unlock technorangs. Each level all have a main quest that can be something like escorting someone to safety, finding lost children or finding someone of interest.\n\nThe characters:\n\nTy: Ty is the main character and he is the typical hero and doesn\u00b4t really have to much to say but still have a rich personality and is very \"Australian\"\n\nMaurie: Maurie is your guide throughout the game. He tells a lot of jokes and introduces you to each level and gives you a general idea of what you\u00b4ll be facing in the levels.\n\nJulius: Julius is a tech genius and is the character that allows you to travel to different levels and gives you the technorangs if you collect enough golden cogs.\n\nBoss Cass: Boss Cass is the antagonist of the game and uses his minions to fight you. He doesn\u00b4t have a lot of depth besides that he wants the talismans to elliminate the tasmanian tigers.\n\n\nThe design:\n\nThis game has incredible design. The atmosphere is incredible and you feel like you\u00b4re in Australia and the music only solidifies this. The graphics have a special charm that you will find in other games from that time as well. I had no performance issues with the game and it ran smoothly. I also did not encounter any bugs or glitches so kudos to Krome Studios.\n\n\nGenerally this is the game that i remember from my childhood and i am so thankful that they managed to bring the magic of the game over to PC from Consoles.", "timestamp_created": 1486301718, "timestamp_updated": 1486301718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29707383": {"recommendationid": "29707383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022099773", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491466654}, "language": "english", "review": "Brings so much memories,never gets boring :)", "timestamp_created": 1486258067, "timestamp_updated": 1486258067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536647", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29705013": {"recommendationid": "29705013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154346744", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510432132}, "language": "english", "review": "After replaying the whole game again after it left early access to become the full version, I'll now rewrite my review, whether that changes much or not, to represent the final product.\n\nTy the Tasmanian Tiger is a game for fans of platformers. It's a classic collectathon game with not a lot of emphasis on story or graphics. In terms of difficulty, it's quite frankly a game for kids, as it is for the most part very easy to progress through. Somes bosses may stump you unlike the rest of the game due to a lack of guidance combined with very unobvious tasks you must do (Particularly the Fluffy's Fjord level).\n\nFor the most part, Ty's level design is done quite well. Many levels are very linear, but with enough twists and turns to make them fun to play, while several are very large and open. One might call the larger levels rather empty, but this is expected given the limitations of the time this game was made in. So for what they did accomplish, these levels are still impressive, and even beautiful in some cases.\n\nGraphics are obviously nothing to write home about. They're kept relatively basic as the game is focused on gameplay instead. None of the textures, effects, etc are pixilated or unnecessarily blurry, so they're really not a cause for concern. Lighting and shadows are nicely done in the remaster, and the remastered version allows you to see things MUCH further away than in the original, which makes for some amazing views and nice spotting points to search the map for collectables you might be missing.\n\nTy the Tasmanian Tiger's soundtrack is excellent, featuring mostly great songs and some that are just downright amazing (Two Up). There are a couple odd balls, mainly the boulder minigame theme, but you'll rarely find yourself immediately hating a song (Only after you've spent an hour trying to find the last opal).\n\nThe occasional quirk you might encounter might include the infra-rang sound effect or camera trouble. The infra-rang is just down-right annoying, and as for the camera, there are settings you can use to adjust it closer to your liking. If you still have trouble after that, it's probably more your fault than the game's, being that I myself never had problems with the camera as bad as others might describe.\n\nRegarding bugs or oddities of any sort, I've found only two things so far while playing the game. I'm unsure whether this is the game's fault or not, but it seems to have potential for slight incompatibilities with some computer settings. I changed power usage settings at some point before finishing my second playthrough found that the lighting effects were too strong and some particle effects had boxes around them. While these errors are not at all severe and won't distract you much, they are still errors nonetheless. However on the level \"Lyre, Lyre Pants on Fire\", there is a possibly gamebreaking bug. It is possible you may comb the level and still be missing a few opals. This is because there Y coordinates can glitch out (Or are just flat out incorrect, I'm not sure), making them impossible to reach and/or find. Fear not though, for they can also glitch out again by reloading the level (Or this is Krome's idea of a fix), and spawn in a respawned crate, from which you can acquire the missing opals. Finally the weird landscape at the end of \"Beyond the Black Stump\" isn't bugged out or anything. It's just lazyness or a lack of time for polishing.\n\nFor what the game is trying to be, it's very well crafted. It's certainly nothing less than at least a descent game.

You took your time!\n\nTY the Tasmanian Tiger. Where does one even begin with this beauty? My earliest gaming memories are of TY, exploring the Barrier Reef, and searching for lost koala children in the snowy mountian tops. I'll go more in depth about this little ripper.\n\n[h1] STORY\t[/h1]\n\n\nTY the Tasmanian Tiger has a simple story: \n\nYou are TY, the last of the Thylacines (that's \"Tasmanian Tigers\", by the way). \n\nYour family disappeared years ago, lost in a dimension known as \"The Dreamtime\", after the nefarious Boss Cass, a cassowary with dreams of world domination, sought to steal the five magical talismans which open a portal to said dimension. Luckily, they were spread across Austrailia after the Thylacines were lost, much to Cass' dismay.\n\nBut how do you learn about all this? Well, one day, when you were playing out in the forest with your Bilbie friends, you fell into a hole in the ground and met with a mystical Bunyip Elder. He told you the whole story, and so, with Murray the Cockatoo and Julius the Koala by your side, you set out to save your family.\n\n[h1] GRAPHICS\t[/h1]\n\nThe graphics in this game are truly something to behold, even for a game like this. The truly breathtaking, sandy plains of the Outback, the lush rainforests, the beautiful beaches. If you're looking for a game with beautiful, cartoonish levels, give this one a try for sure.\n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY\t[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is some of the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. I'll lay this one out in sections.\n\n[b] LEVELS\t[/b]\n\nThe levels are so beautifully thought out, some wide open, with lots of area to cover, and even more places to search for collectables, and some narrow, but still very large, leaving multiple pathways for you to explore and many areas to visit and revisit, making for a great reason to backtrack and play the level again.\n\n[b] PROTECTION\t[/b]\n\nTo protect yourself, you're armed with a pair of wooden boomerangs, which are only one pair of a large number of 'rangs that you'll be able to unlock throughout the course of the game, as well as your good old pearly white teeth. Bite and 'rang your way through those enemies!\n\n[b] COLLECTABLES\t[/b]\n\nThe main section of gameplay is searching for collectables. These include:\n\nThunder Eggs:\nBy the end of this game, you'll have seen so many of these sparkling gemstones that you won't be able to think of anything else. They're the main collectable in the game, and are neccessary to access and defeat each area's boss level and acquire the magical talismans.\n\nGolden Cogs:\nThese items will be necessary for the 100% completion, and to unlock new boomerangs to use in the many levels of this game. After you collect so many, a new boomerang is added to your arsenal.\n\nOpals:\nOpals are the rings, coins, wumpa fruit or gems of the TY universe, a whole 300 to collect per level. Don't you worry, though! They're not too hard to find, if you know where to look! Collecting all of them will... well, I'll let you figure it out.\n\n[b] CONTROLS\t[/b]\n\nThe controls are pretty decent, when you use a Keyboard and Mouse, but I recommend using a controller. Either way, both styles can be fully customised, allowing you to find what controls work best for you.\n\nTY can do basic functions like running, jumping and attacking, as well as being able to learn to swim and glide later on. The movement is quite smooth, and the jumping will almost never be a problem for you.\n\n[b] QUESTS\t[/b]\n\nAll of the aforementioned \"Thunder Eggs\" are acquired via a sort of mission system. In every level, there are a number of Thunder Eggs to collect, each obtainable through either completing a time attack mission, doing jobs for people, finishing minigames and collecting them whilst traversing each level, as well as saving your Bilbie friends (mentioned earlier, who raised TY after his family.\n\n[h1] CONS\t[/h1]\n\nAs great as the game is, there are some problems with it.\n\n-It can be confusing at times, not knowing where to go now and then.\n-One boss, namely [spoiler] Fluffy\t[/spoiler], can be pretty confusing if you don't know what to do. It's not made very clear at all.\n-LENNY THE LYRE BIRD\n-[spoiler] Beyond the Black Stump, and Rex marks the Spot\t[/spoiler] are not very memorable or enjoyable levels, imo.\n\n[h1] FINAL THOUGHTS\t[/h1]\n\nOverall, TY is a fun, charming little game that a lot of people can just pick up and play with little to no issue, and honestly, if you like character-based collectathons, you should definitely purchase this game.\n\nYou Ripper/10", "timestamp_created": 1485645987, "timestamp_updated": 1485648816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29549089": {"recommendationid": "29549089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134760046", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513118162}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

A very, very Australian game, to the point where if it wasn't actually made by Australians it would come off as grotesquely racist. The main character, Ty, speaks almost entirely in stereotypically Australian exclamations like some kind of tourism board mascot, which given that everyone else in the game speaks mostly-normally leads to him coming off as a touch surreal, like he was originally written as a silent protagonist who had dialogue hastily added into conversations held more at him than too him.\n\nStory-wise, the game is as thin as it gets. I almost get the impression that the game was based on some sort of Saturday Morning Cartoon, the way the backstory is vaguely alluded to, characters come and go like we should know them already, and side characters go through cliche story arcs at breakneck pace. It's not that I didn't know what was going on - everything about the story was incredibly by-the-numbers - but it felt like somebody wrote a story twice as long and had it edited down.\n\nGameplay is basically passable, if annoying. You only gain two new moves throughout the game, aside from your ever-growing collection of boomerangs with increasingly redundant functions. The boomerangs themselves are fairly clumsy to use, despite being your primary weapon, as their range is extremely vague and their targetting is inconsistent, leading to many situations where you can throw one at an enemy five feet away and it'll whiz harmlessly past him and leave you unarmed for the next few seconds. However, the game's difficulty is almost nonexistent - the hardest achievement in the game is the one where you have to lose all your lives - largely due to Ty getting nearly 10 seconds of mercy invincibility every time he takes damage, meaning it honestly takes effort to lose a life to a single threat.\n\nUltimately, though, the game is honestly inoffensive. It was a functional timekiller, but I'm not going to give it a recommendation on the grounds that I wouldn't actually suggest anyone else go out of their way to play it.

That says something about the sound design.\n+ The gameplay is actually solid for a collectathon title. Hell, even the swimming controls were pretty good, from a genre that generally has crappy water levels...\n+ The dialogue is witty, and screams Austrilia. Also, NEVER play Ty without sound, because you might miss some of the adlibs the characters make separate of the subtitles.\n\n~ While not a major concern, the game doesn't run all that well on low end PCs. If you are worried about performance, just reduce all graphics options to their absolute minimum, then lower the resolution. Lowering the resolution only shrinks the screen, not the resolution itself.\n\n- The controls can feel floaty at times, and it may take some time getting used to.\n- If you end up missing anything in a level, it is a pain to find out what exactly you missed. Fortunately, every level except the first can be completed in one go, so don't feel as if you need to backtrack later in the game.\n- I didn't test the game with Keyboard and mouse, but the game wasn't designed with this in mind.

I got this game back when I was roughly 9? 10 years old? Back then, it was around the time the PS2 era had hit a spike in popularity, so naturally, I got this game as a Christmas gift, and I fell in love with it. Maybe it's because furry animals are a guilty pleasure of mine, but that's a story for a different day.\n\nNaturally, when I saw this game was on sale on Steam, nostalgia got the better of me, and I bought it in a heartbeat. Playing it as an adult, as one would expect, is certainly different from how it was when I was a kid, and that's putting it lightly. This is both a good and a bad thing, and I'll go ahead and break it down so I don't waste more of your time with unimportant backstory.\n\n[h1]Gameplay. 6/10[/h1]\n\nIt's... About what you would expect from a platformer on a PS2 at the time. You jump around, collect stuff, complete objectives to move on to the next level, kill enemies, and has some side missions on the side. It doesn't necesarrily deviate from the 3D platformers at the time like Spyro, Crash Bandicoot and other games,  so if you're looking for something revolutionary, this definitely isn't it. \n\nI would say that in terms of gameplay, this game is pretty close to Banjo Kazooie, in the sense that most of the game revolves around collecting stuff to get more stuff. \n\nThis isn't to say that it's BAD, or COMPLETELY unoriginal. One thing that does set this game apart is a few things, such as replacing double jumping with gliding, using Boomerangs as weapons rather than fire or, well, your fists, and the fact that there are very few levels with \"unique\" mechanics that change the gameplay a bit.  \n\nThere are times, however, where the objective is not clearly communicated. For example, in one level, you are supposed to use coconuts to get across some quicksand. This is not properly explained or hinted it unless you decided to just randomly throw some boomerangs around. The game stops nearly all hand holding about halfway through, so if you don't understand how to do something, you're on your own in that regard. \n\nI give the gameplay a solid 6/10. It's nothing really special or out of the ordinary, but it's by no means boring. The game has just enough for you to do and kill so you won't be left wandering aimlessly and figuring out what to do. \n\n[h1]Story. 3/10. [/h1]\n\nThe story is cheesy, that's all there is to say about it. It's a pretty by the book \"you're the chosen hero that has to save the world\" scenario that's typical of games around this era. \n\nThe story also relies on a lot of ex-machina scenarios (An antagonist showing up when you least expect it, falling into a hole at the very beginning and finding out the entire backstory completely out of the blue, and so on), so at times, it does feel like things happen out of the blue without any reason. \n\nReally, there isn't much to say about the story. It's fairly predictable despite things happening seemingly out of no where, character development is near enough nonexistent, and... That's it. \n\n[h1] Graphics. 5/10[/h1]\n\nFor a PS2 game, the graphics aren't bad. They aren't GREAT, but they aren't abysmal, either. Much like its gameplay, it's what you would expect from a PS2 era platformer: low renders and flat angles. \n\nAt times, the game does feel a little empty, but that's only in the first couple of levels. Nothing is really boring to look at, and aesthetically, the game is pretty pleasing. You have rainforests, snow areas and ocean areas, and each level has pretty good lighting and scenery that gives it the feel it's going for.\n\n[h1] Overall: 6/10[/h1]\n\nThe game is definitely much better as a child than as a fully grown adult. While it does have enough to keep someone interested in terms of gameplay, and it doesn't really get stale, it suffers from playing things a little too safe. Nothing about it is extraordinary or revolutionary in any way, which isn't necesarrily a bad thing, but it makes the game ultimately forgettable. \n\nI recommend this game for younger audiences, since I am sure that younger folks will find a lot more enjoyment out of it than older. If you are an older person looking for a good PS2 platformer, I can't really say that this is what you're looking for. If you want to try it out, by all means, go for it-- it's not a bad game by any means. There are just other PS2 games that do what this game does but better. \n", "timestamp_created": 1483424056, "timestamp_updated": 1483424056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28927268": {"recommendationid": "28927268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176418607", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485312183}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a great game.

It took me nearly 20 hours but I did it. The gameplay for Ty consisits of fighting enemies and collecting items to help you move on to the next level. Ty can throw boomerangs and bite his way through enemies. I love the cheesy writing as well. None of it is cheesy to the point of annoyance just to the extent where you can laugh at it while still enjoying the experience. I did however find it really annoying trying to get all of the collectibles in the game. Some of them were in really sneaky hiding places which  T R I G G E R E D at some points. The story of the game however is not that good. It's really generic and doesn't offer anything unique. The game is not optimized very well though, I found myself experiencing frequent FPS drops which did hinder my enjoyment of the game. This made me angry because the graphics aren't even that good, I was still reduced to about 20 FPS for most of the game.

The fact its a PC port now makes me so happy that I as a fully grown man, actually freaked out in excitement. I got the game shortly after it came out of Early Access as a small present from a friend.\n\nThis game is just as amazing as I remember it and have loved playing through it again, this time armed with a good head on my shoulders so I know what to do.\n\nThis game isnt hard, I wont lie, its actually pretty easy to beat. Though if you like treasure hunting and collecting, this is the game for you. The core of this game basically is trying to 100% it, which takes some legit effort in the end. The story is honestly not the best in the world, but it doesnt need much more than a motivation to get you going anyway. The short version is: Grab Thunder Eggs, Snag Talismans, Put your boomarang up Boss Cass's *** and you win. The rest is you scowering the land for the rest of the collectables to 100% the game and prove your weight in salt.\n\nSome things I should note *potentially light spoils btw* \n\n-Grab those golden cogs!\n-You will never use the Infarang unless you plan on 100%ing this game.\n-The Kaboomarang is LUDICROUSLY Over powered.\n-The Doomarang is useless tbh due to limited range and the fact it only serves as a trophy of you beating the boss\n-Collecting all the rainbow scales doubles your HP (it helps if you're clumsy)\n-The Megarang is kinda pointless because its bounce range is very short\n\n\nSomething else that should be noted:\n\nThe bosses are hard if you dont know what to do. Sometimes its not clear because they rely on concepts you havent worked with before which is a BIG negative in some sense. The only one you get remotely told roughly what to do is the 3rd boss, and even then its not super helpful.\n\nHowever, once you figure out what to do, well.... the bosses just basically become a click and survive fest. Not much challenge to it. This causes kinda a rather jagged dificulty spike in the game. Which simply can be annoying untill the awnser staring you in the face is realized. For those who wanna know:\n\n[spoiler] To deal with Bull, you have to bait him into running into the large mound pillars, these are presumably termite dens or some kind of fire ant nest. You have to do this 4-6 times before he drops. [/spoiler] \n\n[spoiler] To deal with ye old shark you have to knock the chum into the water, and while he's distracted (i reccomend knocking two buckets in so he will be distracted long enough just in case you goof) you go under water and shoot the air tanks to get them to float up. Once they do hit them with the Flamearang to explode them (this will not work with any other Rang) while he chews on them. You only need to do this 3 times [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] To deal with Mecha-Yeti whatchamacallit you have to burn all the fur off with the Flamearang, the hitbox for the torso does NOT extend to the back from my testing, you MUST hit it from the front and even then it can be a little wonky sometimes. Once this is done the pilot lights on the ground will come on. You must THROW your flamearang through the flames so that it causes the rang to burst into flames and hit the Mech. Do this a few times and then it will sink into the water. You will get a cutscene of fluffy, then switch to your Freezyrang to freeze it into the water (just basically keep spamming the throw button at it) and you will emerge victorius. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] For Boss cass it doesnt seem straightforward at first. So heres some help: The first thing you do is freeze the flame throwers (watch out there is literally NO safe spaces when you first drop in) and then you actually bite them to blow them up. Destroy all 12-16 or however many there are on the deck and the force fields will drop on the pannels. Destroy these pannels by tossing your rangs at them and basically just take the hit from the flame throwers because honestly they dont seem to turn off for very long. When down in the lower sector of the mech take out your Flamarangs and destroy all the ice looking cores and their wires (you have to hit each core twice!) till the head of the machine for some reason explodes off and you get a cut scene of Sly turning all good on you and giving you a family heirloom known as the Doomarang. Toss it into the glowing green throat chute and begin what I honestly have to declare as: [i] THE MOST LAME ENDING TO A BOSS FIGHT EVER!!!! [/i] You dont run around and fight cass. You literally have to sit through and fly a rather overly sensitive boomarang through a twisty and turney gauntlet before ultimatly you reach the end and it somehow blows everything to smithereens. Congrats you beat the game! The ending cutscene will play and you get to do as you please afterward [/spoiler]\n\nNow that you got past all those spoilers on how to beat the bosses if you get stuck.\n\n[h1] My final verdict on this game: [/h1]\n\nThe game doesnt have much story to it, I wont lie. And what it does have isnt greatly explained in the game.\n\nIts got solid controls and responsive actions that feel good to play on my Xbox controller (despite the fact I orginally played this on PS2)\n\nThere are some glitches that do occur, but nothing seriously game breaking, Except for one where: [spoiler]  the miniboss in Cass's Crest who would happen to be that bat lady, I landed in the lava and tossed a rang at the same time, so I was shot back to land at the same time the bats attacked me and I grabbed my rang after it hit something all while being on 1 HP. This caused my game to softlock in a situation where I presume it canceled the death animation so I was set as \"dead\" but since the death animation was cancelled by me grabbing my Rang (the bats should have finished me off while i was in a get up animation too) it just caused some kind of error where it didnt reset me back at the last dunny. [/spoiler]\n\nThere is some humor in this if you like that sorta stuff and its not out of place thankfully\n\nThis game for one has what most games these days tend to lack: An atmosphere. It actually has a feeling to it that no other game can have besides its sequal Ty 2. And that is honestly something thats hard to do so props to Krome\n\nThe game has the old time PS2 era charm where the dialouge is [i] REALLY clunky, and I mean almost cringe worthy at times [/i] \n\nHowever, despite all the negatives and the sort it has alot of positives and quite frankly, the game has aged really well. The gameplay is amazing for a port, I honestly dont think I would be able to tell a differance between the orginal and the port by control responsiveness. There are some animation quirks in the port and of course the occasional glitch but otherwise, this is an amazing game still in the end of 2016 and brings back alot of good nistolgia. \n\nPlus they released a cover photo for the amazing sequal Ty 2: Bush Rescue. Which I am [b] HYPED [/b] for and will Buy it the second its ready.\n\nI must say, Krome really did outdo themselves with this port, and im looking forward to the sequal which was the game that defined my childhood and honestly with the Bunyips and all the boomarangs it really got me into a polethera things ranging from actual boomarangs to mecha anime and robot fighting (i was also a big transformers armada fan as a kid) \n\nSo credit where credit is due. Thumbs up krome.\n\n[u] But also I MUST give flak where its due, and I just have to say: Ty 3 was the game that ruined my childhood. The game took such a left turn with the atmosphere and story to the point where I straight up hated it. Its Gunyip segments were kinda confusing, the color pallete went from vibrant to dull, the story was god awful, it destroyed everything Ty 2 built upon, the ending was just tragicly bad and honestly kinda weird, and to top it all off the boomarang customization system while inovative kinda just seemed out of place. However, I doubt you will see this, but I just had to say it.

(TL;DR at the bottom)[/u]\n\n[h1]NOSTALGIA LIVES![/h1]\nAt 6 years of age, while my mother was manning a food stall with her siblings at a funfair, my cousins and I explored the foyer where Microsoft was marketing and showing off the original Xbox. Of the many games they set up to let players try out for free, Halo was a staple and of course my cousins brought me to play it. \n\nBut right next to Halo was another console station, where an older boy was manoeuvring a strange orange rat-creature through wooden bridges and collecting red glowing balls. Not to mention, the rat thing was throwing something that whacked green lizards and flew right back to him. It was outright fascinating. I got my chance to play after watching the boy. As a child of that age, I didn't fully understand what to do, where to go, or even [i]how[/i] to play it.. but I had fun. A bit too much fun, in fact - I spent the rest of the day at the foyer, testing out all the games but ultimately coming back to the orange rat thingummy.\n\nI was 7 when my parents gifted me an Xbox of my own. Along with Halo and Star Wars, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger was part of the 'Console + 3-game bundle' they were offering way back then, and you can imagine the absolute JOY I felt when I recognised the character on the cover of the game case - it was the orange rat! Whose name I then understood as Ty, who is a Tasmanian Tiger (which is extinct in the real world. Thanks mankind :c). Needless to say, for the next 6 to 7 years of my life and ownership of the Xbox, I always went back to TTTT, even when I wasn't able to buy the sequels.\n\nMy Xbox took its last breath in 2009, the same year I began living without console gaming. Yeah, I went to PC some time later, but never really played any games (I didn't know what Steam was back then). Fast forward to 2016, more mature and having a Steam game or two under my belt, random memories popped up and I decided \"Hey, let's search that game I always played as a kid..\" So I did. *scroll...scroll...scroll...* \n\nThat's when I saw it. \"...as of March 2016, TTTT being remastered for Steam\". HOLY MERRY MOTHER OF JOSEPH. MY CHILDHOOD WAS COMING BACK.\n\nImmediately searched for their Facebook page, reading through all their updates regularly. It was just sheer excitement! And the best part? It released while I was in AUSTRALIA, the HOME of Ty (p.s I was sitting in Parliament as a guest when I bought the game. Lel). The child in me pretty much took over.\n\nWhen I finally flew back home 2 days later, sleep was nowhere in existence; I spent the entire night playing through all the levels and worlds, collecting every single thing I didn't collect befoer, and most importantly [i]savouring every bit of detail I first saw as that little child at the foyer[/i]. I was even happier when I got to the final world and boss, because that was the one thing I never got to do before my Xbox died. Simply... Simply magical... \n\nAnd now I hear they're planning to remaster the other two games? Krome Studios is fulfilling the wishes of the child in me. I'm elated. Excited. Grateful. Insertotherwordshere. Just.. thank you so much, Krome, for bringing back our childhood!\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR = Had this game with original Xbox. Super happy when they remastered for Steam.

As this is a collectafon this can be quite concerning as there are 300 opals and missing one can cause me 20 -30 mins of in-depth back peddling and searching.\n\n\nThe second problem is that some smaller levels ('like snow worries' on high platforms) can allow you to view outside of the map into a black void. This probably due to the 16 : 9 aspect ratio and these maps weren't necessarily scaled for widescreen displays.\n\n\nAs you can see this is a very small list of complaints, and that is because I believe that these Devs have made something truly great and worth your time! All I can say is I wish the Devs my most thanks as it has rekindled something I thought was long dead from my childhood.\n\n\n\nKeep Up the good work guys!

But they've really fixed it up in this version without making it feel like a totally different game.\n\nIf you've never played this game before but like the genre (or wanna get into the genre), this will make a nice addition to your library.\n\nOnly con I can really think of is that, if you're expecting a game on the scale of Crash or Spyro, then be aware that this is a short but sweet game. Nine basic levels, plus 3 bosses and then the final level, which is a gauntlet and then a boss. But the collectiables and objectives in this game will certainly make those levels last.\n\nAnd there's barely any loading time, too :D", "timestamp_created": 1477172269, "timestamp_updated": 1477172269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26137955": {"recommendationid": "26137955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305539541", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476917435}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, I hope Ty 2 and 3 get remastered too!", "timestamp_created": 1477011189, "timestamp_updated": 1477011189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26117631": {"recommendationid": "26117631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047391997", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476774535}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly; this game was amazing.

I can't believe I missed out on this early access of Ty having a HD remaster on PC in Steam. While the Xbox ports were the best, the PC outshines all the ports! I should have bought the game back in March! But now I know and due to many updates the game now runs smoother and looks beautiful than before!\n\nThis is how a 14 year old cult-classic platforming game should be ported and released on PC! I love funny animals or you call them anthro animals. While the Crash Bandicoot series, Sly Cooper series, and Ratchet and Crank series are more well known and popular compare to Ty. Those who played those games will also enjoy Ty the Tasmanian Tiger series since it was remastered for the first time, which was needed for a long time. \n\nThe Ty series were hard to access due to being on legacy six generation of home video game consoles: PS2, Xbox, and GC at that time. Each and every year, the games are becoming more rare and harder to find in physical hard copies in great condition. But, I am a proud owner of the original Ty trilogy on the original Xbox in mint condition. Because I still love the original Xbox and still play the console along with the exclusives, I've a decent collection of Xbox games with most that will never be released on PC or remastered to the current generation of consoles. \n\nPlay as Ty and help his friends out to defeat the evil Boss Cass who threatens his Australia outback home!\n\nThe original ports of the game have bugs and some annoying things, but they're going to be fixed on this release.\n\nI do hope the Ty series will be released for the PS4 and Xbox One as three games in one!

Performance was a little wonky at times, especially if you enable some of the newer settings recently added; however these will likely be addressed with time. The developers seem quite responsive and eager to continue to improve the game. They are also supposedly planning to port the second game, if this one sells well.\n\nThe game's combat is simple, mostly revolving around you choosing which type of boomerang for which situation. Exploring the maps is fun for the most part, however I wasn't a fan of the beach levels personally. \n\nThe game's setting is rare so it is really enjoyable to hear Australian accents and see the wildlife that is more common there. \n\nAll in all an enjoyable experience if you're looking for a good collectathon on PC and don't want to fret with emulators.", "timestamp_created": 1474916703, "timestamp_updated": 1474916785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500669", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25701165": {"recommendationid": "25701165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107466106", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512250935}, "language": "english", "review": "childhood.. but where is number 2?!!!", "timestamp_created": 1474841076, "timestamp_updated": 1474841076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25686191": {"recommendationid": "25686191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264029510", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477825074}, "language": "english", "review": "You're likely here looking at reviews due to the game currently (at the time of this review) being in \"Early Access.\" If you're curious about the game and its stability, read part 1. For the actual review - read part 2. Enjoy!\n\n1) I'd like to immediately shut down those fears by saying this game has very few bugs or issues that will deter you from enjoying the game wholeheartedly. I recently 100%'d the game (excluding all achievements - but that's another beast) and only faced two 'big\" glitches throughout the entire playthrough (which admittedly weren't all that troublesome). \n\nWithout spoilers - the first was being stuck on a rock on a certain level where you ride a familiar-looking \"friend\" the entire level. I simply did the \"charge\" attack and ended up being stuck on top of a rock, but that was easily fixed by just reloading the level. The second one was a bit of a bummer, but not a big deal either. While watching the ending cutscene, my game crashed. Upon loading in, i spawned underneath the main hub only to fall for eternity (until exiting the level and going back in again). To me, these weren't very impactful to how much i enjoyed the game. Now for the review.\n\n2) This game is fan-f***ing-tastic! I bought this due to nostalgia, as I'm sure most did - but even IF you never had a chance to play this game as a kid - I'd highly reccomend it. It has fun, rewarding gameplay that's not too difficult - but also adds in a challenge to each level by hiding collectables very cleverly. Sure, there are a few repeated tropes here and there (TY HELP ME I LOST MY 12 CHILDREN A >SECOND< TIME!), but nonetheless it's an amazing game to just sit down and relax with. Keep in mind that it has full controller support, which, in my opinion, is the best way to revisit this classic - but keyboard and mouse should do just fine as well if you aren't able to snag a reasonable gamepad. As for the graphics the devs are trying to improve upon - don't expect Battlefield 4 style'd graphics or anything - but in my experience they've been a nice touch. If you don't particularly enjoy them - there's always the option to switch them back to the good ol' pixels included in the original PS2 release (it's really not bad looking, if I had to be honest). \n\nAll in all, this game is DEFINITELY worth a purchase if you're looking for something fun and relaxing to play, and can also satisfy those looking for a bit of a challenge (completionists who want to get ALL the things!). I would wholeheartedly reccomend it to just about everyone, and have already happily purchased this game for a friend or two already. \n\nCheers!", "timestamp_created": 1474788170, "timestamp_updated": 1474788170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25679095": {"recommendationid": "25679095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038591092", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458785452}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty Damn good, plays just as good as the ps1 version and has regular updates.", "timestamp_created": 1474751963, "timestamp_updated": 1474751963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25678105": {"recommendationid": "25678105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079659710", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474605044}, "language": "english", "review": "Australia simulator 2016\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1474748303, "timestamp_updated": 1474748303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25660629": {"recommendationid": "25660629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152796748", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482596638}, "language": "english", "review": "This is how people should bring older games to steam you guys are amazing and so is this game just hearing the music makes me so [b]happy[/b]!", "timestamp_created": 1474678417, "timestamp_updated": 1474678417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25658039": {"recommendationid": "25658039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096991868", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486227368}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like to kill stuff with boomerang's and bite this is the game for you. \nIt has a good gameplay (at least I liked it) and was full of stuff to do.\n", "timestamp_created": 1474665629, "timestamp_updated": 1474665629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25650147": {"recommendationid": "25650147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031173636", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474881146}, "language": "english", "review": "A pretty good PC port and the game aswell (I only had TY2 as a child)\nAn enjoyable adventure.\n\n100% in 12.1hours", "timestamp_created": 1474636306, "timestamp_updated": 1474636306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649258", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25647538": {"recommendationid": "25647538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157928926", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505497767}, "language": "french", "review": "Le revoir sur steam alors que j'y est jou\u00e9 sur gamecube c'est juste g\u00e9nial.\nJe le recommande a tous ceux qui ont pas pu jou\u00e9 auparavant", "timestamp_created": 1474621839, "timestamp_updated": 1474621839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650007", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25646297": {"recommendationid": "25646297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062430263", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487007148}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed this game years ago expect the same quality if not better because it has aged very well.

It doesn't experience any gamebreaking issues like random crashes or whatever, its very easily playable without too much problem.\n\n[b][h1]Negatives:[/h1][/b]\nRepetitive: Honestly, the game can feel a tad samey after awhile. Alot of the tasks to get Thunder Eggs and whatnot are pretty much the same across each level, which can be a bit of a killer to deal with.\n\nFPS: The game seems to have rather large and unusual drops in FPS which can be a huge nuisance to deal with. It can in some cases cause the game to slow to a crawl which can really ruin the experience.\n\n[b][h1]Closing Remarks:[/h1][/b]\nThe game is very well done so far.

This includes Opals, Golden Cogs(Which unlock boomerangs),Bilbies, and the lesser known portraits which if all are collected unlock a movie. If you 100% the game you will unlock a secret level. The game is easy as it's meant for kids but it still has many fun mechanics such as how the boomerangs interact with the enviroment. The combat consists of throwing 'rangs or biting your foes.\n\n[b]Art[/b]: The game is old but it has an artistic charm and the new fancy effects of this remastered edition help bring it up to speed. What more can you expect? It's an old game meant to run on Xbox, Ps2, and Gamecube. As for as graphic fidelity, the devs are doing a splendid job updating it regularly with little tweaks here and there. Although they could replace textures to enhance it even more but it is fine.\n\n[b]Music[/b]: Best soundtrack for a kid's game I have ever heard. This game nails the Australian theme by adding tunes that use authentic Australian instruments(or emulates them) that make each level a joy to play on. Plus the Australian accents on the characters is cheesy in a good way.\n\n[b]Entertainment[/b]: You will 100% this game and be done with it maybe only returning for funsies or to compete in the leaderboards to see who can complete each level the fastest.\n\n[b]Score[/b]: The nostalgia goggles are off. Ty is a kid's game that succeeds by giving an experience that is not totally braindead but charming and memorable. It is my favorite game from my own childhood near Crash,Ratchet,Spyro and Jak. It deserves to be listed there. The port is damned good too. Ty 2 and 3 will be an insta-buy for me.\n\n[h1]4/5[/h1]      [h1]\"YOU BEAUTY!\"[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1473911770, "timestamp_updated": 1474432936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25474664": {"recommendationid": "25474664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065574712", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474178405}, "language": "english", "review": "AH the childhood is back!

The characters are well voiced, the graphics are beautiful, the levels are very well designed, and I have to play a level through multiple times to find everything because of how well they are made.

This game is more complete than most AAA titles, and its certainly more complete than its original console release, with better graphics, tighter controls, and more feature. -PR0XIDIAN", "timestamp_created": 1473172092, "timestamp_updated": 1473172092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25381041": {"recommendationid": "25381041", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999454954", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512829366}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1473172016, "timestamp_updated": 1473172016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25375900": {"recommendationid": "25375900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212049375", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473828410}, "language": "english", "review": "What a nostalgia trip!

Colors are vibrant, and it looks pretty good at 1080p. The soundtrack is solid. I found the dialogue and voice acting to be very charming and Australian. I played with an Xbox 360 wired gamepad. Controls felt natural and easy to use. My criticisms are few. The game can be too easy now that most of us returning fans are older, and the level designs / aesthetics are a bit repetitive. Still, I enjoyed my playthrough. Clearly worth $12. Looking forward to T2.\n\nWhat did I play: Entire game. 100% game save with only two achievements left to unlock (I don't want to purposely die to run out of lives). \n\nAnd yes, nostalgia.", "timestamp_created": 1471732216, "timestamp_updated": 1471732216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504237", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25036531": {"recommendationid": "25036531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068926461", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496287074}, "language": "english", "review": "I dont know how much people like this game but this is a classic to me and a nostalgic overload :)", "timestamp_created": 1471713349, "timestamp_updated": 1471713349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25034818": {"recommendationid": "25034818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068723363", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471924336}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game and fantastic PC port!\nI grew up with TY2, so I never got the chance to play 1. \nTY1 is a fantastic 3d platformer with beautiful level design and lovable characters.

I looked high and low and everywhere and I needed that cog for the next boomerang. I couldn't find it at all. I spent hours on that one map looking for that cog to no avail.

Short Answer is Yes, Beyond Yes. I dont go though the effort of writing reviews for most game, but I feel like TY the Tasmainian TIger deserve one. I'm not going to review the gameplay, as the is is a game you're only going to play though nostiglia tinted-glasses, I'm not an exception to that. But I think the more important thing you can say about is point is how is the PC-Port? It was what I was spektial of when I bought the game. I have to say this is one of the best PC-port I have ever encounted, Its a shining example of why with a little actual effort to port the game to PC. Its the best of Early Access aswell, Looking though th epatch notes you see that the Krome 2016 cares and intersted in polishing the game. I'm a bit cynical about the game indusrty these days and I fully expected for this to be a shitty port and mostly unplayable without a controller. But it was not that. I choose to play the game using a Keyboard/Mouse and I just enjoyed myself all away though, there was no need to use a controller! The option menu supports a robust amount of control options (I used default) and graphic options. Impressivly They add High res textures, Shadows, and View distance.

Congrats Krome!\n\nTHIS IS A GREAT GAME!\nHeck freaking yea I reccomend this! Why you ask? Well let me tell you...\n\nPositives:\n\n+ A classic brought back from the dead! This game is (considered by me and others) a classic from the PS2 era! And you can tell this by the graphics. Even though they have been improving them. but it is still lots of fun, even to this day! :D\n\n+ It's a solid platformer! Nice tight controlls, nothing to horribly hard, and good level design!\n\n+ Quirky characters! From Shazza, to Maurie, to even Ty himself! They all have there own personality and, sometimes they are even funny!\n\n+ Good sound/music! From the didgeridoo's, to hearing the wild animals, the sound is overall pretty good! And they are adding better sounds as it's updated! The music is nice and catchy and sounds very nice!\n\n+ Lots of rangs! Boomerangs to be exact! From the simple Boomerang, to the Flamerang, to the legendary DOOMerang! And you will need these! You might need the Flamerang to melt some ice, or the Zoomerang to hit a button far off. Whatever the case, there are plenty of rangs to choose from!\n\n+ One of the few good Early Access games! Krome Studios have done an AMAZING job with porting this game over from the PS2! They have been fixing LOTS of bugs, improving the camera controls, and improving the graphics and sounds!\n\n+ They have improved this from the PS2 version! They have improved the graphics, camera controls, (they are going to be) improving the pre-rendered cutscenes, as well as adding Steam achivements, Steam Trading Cards, and leaderboards for the time trials!\n\nMixed:\n\n= May feel familiar to those who have played Super Mario 64 or Crash Bandicoot. Ty shares a lot of similarities with other platformers. But this I consider a good thing because it does it well. But I can see how some would consider this bad.\n\n= Is a collecta-thon. Again this in my eyes, is a good thing because it makes the worlds MUCH more enjoyable and explorable, but if you don't like that then you might not enjoy this game as much.\n\nNegitive:\n\n- Has bugs. These can be expected of Early Access Games. But fortunatly, as I mentioned earlier, Krome has been doing an AMAZING job at fixing and improving the game!\n\n- Everytime you enter a level, it always wants to play the same cutscene with the same dialogue. This is just a minor annoyance as you can skip through it and it does not affect anything negativly but it is still annoying.\n\nConclusion!\n\nThis truly is a great game from the PS2 era! I'm so glad that Krome has ported/HD-ified it on over to the PC! If you like a good platformer, enjoy classic 3D platformers like Super Mario 64, or Crash Bandicoot, then you will enjoy this game!\n\n9.5/10\n\n(By the way, this is my first full review for a game on Steam so let me know how I could improve!) :D", "timestamp_created": 1468523736, "timestamp_updated": 1482219651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24317414": {"recommendationid": "24317414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133952353", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483390716}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was one of the main parts of my childhood and seeing it be put on Steam really made me happy, this was worth the $12 and I would pay the same for Bush Rescue.

Fans of collectable based games will feel right at home, since this game is based around collectable items to help progress story, and also unlock many extras, one such helping you increase your boomerang arsenal to take down the baddies. All in all, the game stays true to being a platformer at heart, and with plenty of lovely Australian scenery to take in. In one level you can be trudging through a dense rainforest, and then the next you could be riding through the wide open outback, or exploring a billabong.\n\nFans of platforming games such as Rayman, Mario, Sonic, Crash Bandicoot and other iconic characters will love to give this game a go. With the current modest price of 12 dollars, it is a steal given you have plenty of packed to the brim levels, an amazing cast of characters, and most of all a development team that is here to make a game that everyone can love.

Ty the Tasmanian Tiger was originally released on Gamecube, the original Xbox, and the PlayStation 2. I spent countless hours getting lost in this game as a kid and I was ecstatic to see that they decided to port it over to PC.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the game in still in Early Access. Let me tell you for a fact, it feels far from it. This game is an excellent console to PC port. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story is pretty accessible, but you have to pay attention to some of the NPCs' dialogue and cutscenes if you want to really follow along. It can be easy to miss. If you accidentally skip a cutscene, you can watch them from the main menu.\n\nThe NPCs in this game are amusing and somewhat inept. You might feel compelled to call child protective services on one of them as she keeps losing her children, but thankfully you're there just in time to step in and save the day.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nTy is a 3D platformer. You can do mostly what you'd expect with a game of this genre. You can jump, swim, glide, and climb your way through levels. The movement mechanics are tight, so any issues with falling off or missing a jump is probably your fault, as it should be. \n\nIn every level there will be enemies for you to take down, items to collect, and friends to help. Thankfully, you will be growing an arsenal of boomerangs to help you accomplish these tasks with style. I really enjoy the variety of boomerangs to collect. Some are more utilitarian to help you find hidden items, and others can set your enemies on fire or slow down time. There's a 'rang out there for just about everyone.\n\nOnce the story is said and done, there's quite a few collectibles to find if you're up for it. They don't take a shocking amount of time to find, but if you don't look closely or consider alternative approaches to finding them then you may find yourself wandering a level for a couple of hours. Some of the levels are [i]big[/i].\n\nFor the competitive gamers out there, you can try to climb the leaderboards for each level! I personally haven't looked too far into these, but they appear to be working just fine.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nI don't currently have a USB gamepad, so my entire experience with this on PC has been with the keyboard and mouse we've come to know and love. Let me tell you, they feel [i]great[/i].\n\nI have only had a few minor issues with the controls:\n[olist]\n    [*] Some menu UI elements cannot be clicked on, forcing you to use the keyboard rather than the mouse. (The developers actually have a disclaimer for this one and I trust they'll get around to it before the game leaves early access).\n    [*] In the level \"Beyond the Black Stump\", [spoiler]aiming Ranger Ken's snowball launcher with W, A, S, D is pretty hard as it kind of jerks around by a certain distance. Rather than aiming for the frills I had to aim where I knew their path would take them and spam the fire button to take them down.[/spoiler]\n    [*] When rapidly jumping up the small cliffs that form stairs for Ty on levels like \"Snow Worries\", the camera will jerk unpredictably and somehow bury itself beneath the terrain for a second or two, obstructing your vision entirely. \n    [*] You might have to dial the mouse sensitivity down, I know I sure did.\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe Developers have been hard at work remastering the game to make it feel more at home on modern systems. I played through the game at 2560x1440 (I saw lots of resolutions in the menu too) and its a definite improvement. They're continually releasing graphical improvements while keeping the game minimum-spec friendly.\n\nThe story-line cutscene videos are still low-res, but the developers are working on updating those as well. You can stillsee and understand what's going on in the cutscenes though.\n\nThe color palettes are bright and varied. I don't like to place much of an emphasis on a game's visuals because there are more important aspects to it. Keep in mind this is a game originally released in 2002. Don't expect Crysis and you'll be fine.\n\nBased on the hardware reports, it looks like the game runs fine on Integrated Intel chips. If you're rocking a laptop without a discrete GPU, you should be good. \n\nI haven't noticed any graphical issues like artifacting or textures not loading.\n\nI would comment on the audio but I don't think there's anything wrong with it and I can't muster much of an imaginary comparison from my past because I'm pretty sure the last time I played this game was over a decade ago (oh my god). It's also worth noting I'm a bit hearing impaired so I don't pick up on much of the audiophile stuff. The game sounds great to me, so that's all I've got.\n\n[h1]Conclusion & other thoughts[/h1]\nLike I said before, if you've played Ty in the past and you liked it, you owe it to yourself to pick this game up. It's more than a compulsory nostalgia purchase as the game continued to entertain me while I played through it and collected everything (I didn't 100% it when I played as a kid, 'cause I was stupid).\n\nIf you've never heard about Ty the Tasmanian Tiger before today, I hope this review alongside some of the others may have convinced you to try it. It's a great game, developed by people who really care about it (you'll frequently find the Developers in the discussions, responding to feedback, watching the Summer Games Done Quick speed-run).\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing where the developers take this game. I know they have a few more improvements in the pipeline but the game feels like a finished product to me. They did a great job.\n\nThe more copies they sell, the more reasons they have to port Ty 2 and Ty 3.

It's a blast and better than it was when i first played it those many years ago.\n\nI've completed the game to 100%. So and i didn't experience any crashes, missing items or anything. The only thing that i did notice with this game was that a few spots you lost a bit of framerate in. Otherwise, the game is great, controls have been perfectly ported and binded for PC, they've added neat features like being able to fight bosses again without having to restart the game and of course upped the graphics of the game.\n\nIt's hard to say wherther this game would fit someone right now with all games these days being much scavange survival, building and First person shooters. But for a nostalgic value or simply if you're someone who enjoys classic platformer games where you collect stuff. This game is gold.\n\nI don't know if you should get it now though, since they do warn you that since they are keeping the game in early access to get feedback on functions that are broken and trying to optimize the game further, there is a chance that save files can be corrupted from updates that are made. And i don't think anyone would like spending hours on maps collecting everything only to have their save file lost and have to restart the game.\n\nI played this game so much when i was a kid that i know practically everything by heart. So it didn't take me long to complete the whole game. But i'd say.

To see it being ported over to the PC is a great thing to see. It may not be as awesome as I remember it, with some levels later in the game that are huge but empty (Ex: Snow worries having a barren mountain to climb and Rex marks the spot has an empty ocean that really doesn't effect anything besides the time it takes to get from point A to point B) and that makes collecting everything a pain. The game still has some solid platforming. If you bought this game in the early 2000s, buy it here. The keyboard controls have been well intergrated so no gamepad is needed. \nThe graphics (While dated in some parts) still hold up with the cartoony artstyle. And even with the over sized levels in the later stages, the levels are really fun to play and collect items to get new boomerangs. The game's greatest strengh is the Outback setting that's rare to see in games. This give the game an identity The only thing I 100% hate in this game is the characters. Ty is a cardboard cutout of a boy scout and picks one out of the same three lines when finishing a mission, Sly (Not the racoon) is the ultamate edgelord made from the mind of a 13 year old and comes off as annoying, and all the other characters as well as the bosses are completely forgetable.\nOverall it is a good game. I'd say the only thing that's holding it back is the developers and being in early access. I feel like the developers won't add anything major to the game or provide any real overhalls that can benefit the game at the cost of nostalgia from the fans. Also I'm willing to bet that a lot of Ty fans won't buy this game because it says it's in early access. The game is finished, you can play it from start to finish just as it was in the Ps2, gamecube, and Xbox. It's in early access for patching the game and porting it.\nI want you to buy this game, not only to get a good game but to also support the devs so that they can maybe port Ty 2 to PC.

This is no cheap PC port or cash grab though, no sir. This port, or small remaster if you will, is an example of what PC porting should be. Giving the game a small touch up in small places (such as the shadows being more sharp, some textures showing some polish, ect.) but still keeping what made it great in the first place.\n\nAs this is still early acess, there are a few hitches, but they're so far and few between you won't be complaining much. Overall, on my system, the game ran steadily at about 60FPS in most areas, baring the ocassional hint of lag in the more open levels. Again, very minor.\n\nGameplay is solid as ever, but I don't know about keyboard controls since I used an Xbox controller. There was a slight bug or issue with the camera at times where if I manually moved it with the right analog stick, it'd get stuck like that and not re-center itself. There's no button to re-center the camera either. Only way to correct it was to enter an area where the camera would fix itself back to follow behind Ty automatically. Small issue and didn't really cause any major problems as you could still move the camera around manually until it corrected itself, but it's worth noting.\n\nEach area is unique, wonderfully detailed, and ripe with fun level design. All with memorable Australian-like music and colorful characters. Though if you're short of patience or don't like collecting random items, this may not be the expirence for you. You'll find yourself at many points in the game having to graze over the levels with a fine tooth comb looking for the last opal or cog, but finally finding them is a rewarding feeling, especially for OCD afflicted.\n\nOverall a well made port of a classic platformer that's great for all ages.

It always surprised me how lukewarm the critics were towards it (most dismissed it as a soulless, but serviceable Mario or Banjo-Kazooie clone). Nothing could be farther from the truth than that.\n\nPros: \n+Unique, almost comforting atmosphere. This game is beautiful. No other way to say it. The levels/environments you explore are varied and detailed. ranging from the Outback desert, quiet rainforests, the Great Barrier Reef (probably my favorite), snowy mountains, etc. \n+Phenomenal soundtrack helps set the mood for each environment and is jam-packed with catchy, memorable, relaxing, intense, and even uplifting tunes (it's that good).\n+Boss fights are intense, creative, and challenging.\n+Gameplay can be addicting. Think of it as something like Donkey Kong 64, only much more streamlined and less tedious. It's an adventure platformer with collectathon elements. The large, beautiful environments really inspire you to go exploring.\n+Great controls.\n+Balanced difficulty. It's just challenging enough to avoid feeling like a cakewalk.\n\nCons:\n-Some of the more hardcore players might find it too easy. \n\nPort quality: Really nice so far. The visuals benefit from a nice upgrade, with improved resolution, a maxed out draw distance (climb to the tallest point in the level Ship Rex and you'll see what I mean), a silky smooth framerate (locked 60 FPS), improved shadow effects, better use of color, and more to come. Very responsive controls too. The game feels vastly more playable and comfortable on PC than the original PS2  outing. The only cons so far are a few very minor frame drops (and stuttering) in some levels as well as brief graphical glitches here and there. Also, it would be really nice to see some more improvement on the textures as they look almost identical to the PS2 version (albeit with a higher resolution). Also, the cutscenes are locked at a somewhat choppy 30 FPS for some reason. Can't wait to see how the finised product will look and feel, seeing as the devs are constantly updating the game to fix any bugs or glitches (as well as improve the graphics further).\n\nOverall: Worth a purchase.

Never got the chance to play TY2 in my childhood but look forward to when it comes out!", "timestamp_created": 1465439619, "timestamp_updated": 1465439619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23441747": {"recommendationid": "23441747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069536270", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465992755}, "language": "english", "review": "For those of you who played Ty in the past, consider buying this port and supporting these developers to add more content, fix more bugs, and port the Ty sequel games to PC in the future. They've so far showed devotion and hard work towards getting this game out of early access with the best quality they can manage. And there are some new extras that are a treat to old Ty fans.\n\nFor those of you who haven't, this game is basically one of the old classic platformer collectathons of the past, but with cool, unique features like the boomerang weapon, which is very satisfying to throw and glide with. Not to mention some collectibles are actually really hard to find at times, so there adds and extra layer of challenge for treasure hunting.\n\nSpeaking of difficult, I will admit this game wasn't too difficult so far, maybe that's just me having played this 12 years ago, or I've played many platformers. I'm more leaning towards the latter, so if you're crazy about platformer collectathons, expect Banjo Kazzoie levels of challenge from this game besides the ocassional speed-run challenge or wild turkey chase. But I will say the heart of this game is not for its difficulty but its diverse and somewhat open-ended levels. Just exploring the levels and finding all the things to collect while you glide, swim, look around corners and ditches and hige rooftops, it's quite fun. \n\nThis PC port of the classic game has been optimized to work at the highest of framerates on the lowest graphic settings, trumping the PS2 in terms of performance. And the highest graphic settings add so much more detail and scenic beauty to the original, but is only recommended for high-end PC's.\n\nOverall, a must buy for fans of Ty, and a good pick for those looking for a good platformer collectathon while you wait for Yooka Laylee. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1465332666, "timestamp_updated": 1465332870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23435454": {"recommendationid": "23435454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137468353", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504528185}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Lovely this game.10/10", "timestamp_created": 1465308493, "timestamp_updated": 1465308493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23425066": {"recommendationid": "23425066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035580529", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480174009}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game but it is mostly nostalgia, if you enjoyed this game in childhood you will enjoy it now, nice music and decent visuals.

The bosses are completly forgettable and boring, the camera could do with some work but they might fix that later in development. on the positive the platforming is decent, the swimming is decent (but the water levels are badly designed) and a lot of awesome boomerangs to play with (except the zaporang that you will use once and then never again unless you are achivement hunting) now that they turned the price down since i bought it its an good enough time to be an recommend from me and an easy pickup if you have the need for nostalgia", "timestamp_created": 1465247588, "timestamp_updated":

the prime of video games. Jak and Daxter, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Seek & Destroy, etfc. I played many, many games in my time. But this game personally takes the cake as my all time favorite game from my childhood. Sure, it's outdated. Sure, there isn't much real plot and the gameplay isn't spectacular. But it's still an amazing game nontheless. The uniqueness of playing as a sole surviving Tasmanian Tiger throwing boomerangs in the great Down Under really stands out against games that all seem to involve one thing nowadays; guns and war. This game gives a feeling of actual meaning to your actions, if you watch and listen to the little plot there is. You are trying to save your family from the Dreamtime, where the evil Boss Cass imprisoned them. Every Thunder Egg you collect makes you feel one step closer to acquaring a talisman, which is what is absolutely necessary in the task of freeing your family. Collecting every item is not necessary to beat the game, but it does unlock a nice bonus that I will not spoil. If you're beaten the game 100% on the PS2, Gamecube, or XBOX. And for all the veteren players, there's a VERY special surprise for you after you have beaten the game 100%, too. Trust me, you will LOVE it. The Steam version comes with various new features, such as the ability to replay bosses, map your controls, camera-oriented throwing instead of in front of TY, leaderboard support for time attacks, and the special surprise I mentioned above. Since it is still in Alpha, many things can be added or removed. I personally hope there is some sort of player vs. player time attacks where you can race against each other in real time. Maybe even add in new bosses that can be taken on with two players. This game IS worth the money. I was going to buy a game I had wanted for MONTHS, but then I saw this game on Steam and I HAD to buy it. It is my childhood.\n\nTL;DR - Awesome, fun, amazing source of nostalgia, happiness, childhood memories, new features, awesome secrets\n\nThe only cons I can think of are the ocasionally wonky camera angles, and the fact that it crashes often. You can play a full level 100% through, but it will likely crash on the next one.\n\nAll in all, I rate this remaster a solid 9.8/10. The only reason it is not a 10/10 is because of the crashes. I can't wait to see the end result of this masterpiece!\n\nP.S. If you DO get it, go to Extras and check out the \"HD Test\", or something like that.

Although this may differ from other people's accounts, my playthrough was flawless and 100 percenting this game again was a blast.\n\nI hope Ty 2 is ported as well as this game was, since it was my favourite. I recommend this to fans of the series, and maybe even fans of classic collectathons like Banjo-Kazooie and Jak and Daxter. I rate the game 9/10 - A nostalgic blast from my past.", "timestamp_created": 1460660392, "timestamp_updated": 1481584661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22407852": {"recommendationid": "22407852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036850024", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460608837}, "language": "english", "review": "A remaster of a more obscure latter-day platforming mascot game, I recall renting TY during those weird Junior High days. So...does the game hold up?\n\nWell...yes, actually. If you can get passe dthe game's \"Australian Stereotypes: the game\" You'll find a platformer that doesn't really reinvent the wheel but boy does it polish the mechanics of it's genre to a mirror shine. TY controls great, and somehow even makes water and swimming portions FUN! I know colour me shocked someone  figured it out.The level design is also pretty open, giving you a lot of options on how get around and collect all the things. The game is still fairly nice to look at even for remaster of game from the early 2000s that (As of this review) is still being worked on. From what I played TY is surpsingly smooth, well crafted platformer that Krome is clearly very proud of to try and remaster, and I'd say that pride is warranted.\n\nThe closest thing i can say to bad things is, again, the \"Australian\" theme is a bit of an aquired taste (though Krome is based out in Brisbane for what it's worth), the pre-rendered cutscenes look a bit murky on modern hardware (Something that for techicaly reasons can't really be helped but the in-engine stuff looks fine BTW) and for some reason the game's frame-rate is blisteringly fast which is a bit disconcretaing at first bug you get used to.\n\nIf you're nostaglic for this game, or like me really miss this style of game that has become rare in 2016 I'd recommend TY The Tasmanian Tiger.

As of this review, Krome updated the swimming controls on KBM from the controller-tuned WASD for movement to a more natural mouse-based style. These new controls feel very nice and are a great step up from the older controls.\n\nThe game does have its rough and unpolished pieces as the HD process is gradually applied, but it is perfectly playable in its current form and I highly recommend this game to everyone, especially if you enjoyed and miss 3D platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1460443525, "timestamp_updated": 1460443525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556237", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22366744": {"recommendationid": "22366744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152125544", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459401140}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: It's one of my favorite childhood games\n\nPros:\n-This game will run well on a toaster \n-Great game for people who like to 100% games\n-Variety of boomerangs that will change the way you fight enemies\n-Resolution and shading makes the game more appealing to look at\n-Objectives are clear and to the point\n-Level designs and bosses are all unique \n-Easy game for anyone to play\n\nCons\n-Tasks in the game are pretty repetitive \n-Story is nothing to get yourself wet over\n-short game that you could beat in less of a day\n-Frame rate can sometimes dip\n-There's some lag when transitioning to different areas in the game\n\n(Issues like frame rate, lag, etc...are getting fixed as we speak.

The level design, the music, the voice acting, the overall atmosphere of this game is phenomenal. \n\nThe story of this game is a simple 3D platformer story, where ty's parents are sent to an alternate world and ty needs to rescue them by collecting 5 tallismans. Overall very simple, but this simple story allows for the gameplay to really shine as it was meant to. Imagine banjo kazooie, mixed with basic mario platforming from sunshine, combined with a unique take on fast paced ranged combat. THAT is Ty the tazmanian tiger, and its brought together really well. The rangs within the game allow for the player to challenge combat in whatever way they deem right. The game doesnt hold your hand either, and I still had challenges with obtaining some of the thunder eggs. The level design is mixed between open levels, where you can go anywhere. And linear levels, where the goal is to get thunder eggs as you go through the level. These mix really well with each other and allow the player to never get bored since all levels are unique. The water levels in general are amazing in this game, and allow for a \"taste\" of what an open world ty game would be like. The platforming it solid and smooth, allowing for brilliant maneuvers to be done that get the player where they want to go. \n\nNow in terms of bad things for the game, there are some glitches here and there, but thats to be expected of an early access title and it never BROKE the game so I forgot about them. In terms of story, it could have been more fleshed out, but this is a 3D platformer from the early 2000's and the gameplay makes you forget all about that. The character of Sly within the game felt kinda....eh now that I think about it. He implys certain things within his dialouge that is never actually fleshed out, which, if done correctly, could have been AMAZING. However these kinda story problems are fixed with later installments in the series such as ty 2 and ty 3, which I can say had some of the more interesting, serious stories of any 3D platformer i've played. This is ty 1 however so that can be annoying to anyone who nitpicks that stuff. Controls are being improved constantly and I've had the liberty to play this with the xbox one controller, the steam controller, and mouse and keyboard. The xbox controller is the most standard and probably the best one to use as of right now if you're not accustomed to the steam controller. IF YOU ARE however, the steam controller is the way to go as it allows precise aiming during Ty View. Keyboard and mouse is also ok, but that has some bugs that are still getting fixed.\n\nHonestly this game is worth the money JUST for the investment. Ty 2, was better than Ty 1, and I for one really want this game to succed to down the road I get 2, 3, and Ty 5.

Where do I begin...\n\nSo this game was made by a company called Krome Studios and was originally released on the PS2, Xbox and the GameCube and was quite popular for the company being relatively unknown at that point. I personally started playing on the PS2 when I was just a young lad, and is one of the games I remember most about my childhood, it just pressed all the right buttons for me. Anyway to the actual review.\n\nGameplay:\nSo this game has been completely remade in HD... well kinda. Right now most of the game is in HD though Krome Studio are still releasing updates with new up-res textures. The game though at this stage is still far better looking than the orignal counterpart.\n\nSo the gameplay, is it worth it as a whole, 100% yes. You play as TY and start with 1 boomerang which turns into 2 after the tutorial area. Boomerangs are the main premise of the game and all attacks revolve around them. As you continue playing the game, you will unlock more by just playing the game, though even more, and much better ones can be obtained by collecting cogs in each of the areas.\n\nCollectibles:\nSo in each area, there are a multitude of collectibles which can be obtained by searching (some of them can only be gotten with other rangs which you will get later in the game, so going back into old area's definitely happens). The main collectibles are Cogs, Opals and Bilbies. The other collectible are paintings which are invisible in crates unless found accidentally and can only be seen through the use of another rang later in the game. This means overall, there are a lot of collectibles to be found and its actually very fun looking for them all, though missing one opal is pretty annoying and can take a while to find.\n\nPerformance:\nSo because this game is in early access, this means performance issues are going to be a thing, especially with lower end rigs, I personally don't have any type of problem performance wise though I know some people have stutters and slight freezes now and then. In general if you love the TY series, please remember that this game is in early access and is bound to be a bit weird now and then; just bear with it, the devs on this game are working very hard to bring the best TY experience to desktop.\n\nMusic:\nSexy riffs, a real outback feel mixed with the didgeridoo makes this games soundtrack so memorable and one of the best parts of the game.\n\nDrawbacks:\nSo now onto the bad things, which surprisingly, there is not a lot of stuff in this category. As I have said above, this game is in early access and is bound to have some weird quirks, and all depends on your rig. Saying this though, some people have reported weird V-Sync issues and stutter, though if you go on the forum and tell the devs what the problem is, they will gladly help and have been for a while now. Another drawback is that the game is quite a lot shorter than I once thought it was (100% will keep you going for a while however). This also might be the case because I played it a lot as a child, so I know the what is where ect.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nIs this game worth it after all this... YES!!!

Ein gro\u00dfer Fokus des Spiels sind die Sammelaufgaben, und davon gibt es enorm viele.\nDie Overworld ist in 3 \"Segmente\" unterteilt, welcher jeweils 3 Levels fasst. In jedem Level gilt es 8 Aufgaben abzuschlie\u00dfen, welche jeweils mit einem Amulettstein (Englisch: \"Eggs\")  belohnt werden. In welcher Reihenfolge ihr an die Aufgaben geht, bleibt euch \u00fcberlassen. Um in das n\u00e4chste Segment zu kommen, ben\u00f6tigt ihr eine bestimmte Anzahl dieser Amulettsteine, ihr m\u00fcsst allerdings nicht alle Sammeln um im Spiel vorranzukommen.\n\nDa die Levels mit Feinden gespickt sind, m\u00fcsst ihr euch nat\u00fcrlich auch wehren k\u00f6nnen.\nEinem Australischen Klischee nach bekommt ihr daf\u00fcr einen Boomerang in die Hand gedr\u00fcckt, welchen ihr eure Feinde ins Gesicht schleudern d\u00fcrft. Und ihr erhaltet noch viel mehr einzigartige Boomer\u00e4nge f\u00fcr das Sammeln der Amulettsteine und der Zahnr\u00e4der. F\u00fcr Amulettsteine gibt es die Elementar-Rangs, welche ihr u.a. auch braucht um in neue Segmente zu kommen, da diese (ganz zuf\u00e4llig) immer mit etwas Blockiert werden, welches sich mit einem passendem Elementar-Rang zerst\u00f6ren l\u00e4sst. F\u00fcr die Zahnr\u00e4der bekommt ihr die \"Techno-Rangs\", das sind einzigartige Boomer\u00e4nge welche alle eine einzigartig coole Funktion haben. Lasst euch da \u00fcberraschen, es lohnt sich die zu sammeln!\n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad des Spiels ist sehr einfach, das k\u00f6nnte einige \"Hardcore Gamer\" etwas unterfordern.\nDadurch ist es aber auch f\u00fcr jeden leicht zug\u00e4nglich und auch f\u00fcr Kinder geeignet.\nMal etwas entspannendes f\u00fcr zwischendurch, nehme ich gerne an.\n\nGrafisch ist das Spiel sehr gut gealtert, und sieht auch in der Originalfassung noch sehr ansehnlich aus.\nKlar sind einige Models etwas unsauber geformt, klar sind einige Texturen matschig, aber zumindest bei zweiteren will der Entwickler noch ausbessern.\n\nNicht nur f\u00fcr alte Fans des Spiels, welches Urspr\u00fcnglich am 10. September 2002 ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, d\u00fcrfte der PC Port ein Nostalgischer Gef\u00fchlsritt werden.

The Characters are enjoyable and their Designs are well done. Level design is pretty good better then I thought they were after watching Nitorad. The Two Water and Snow levels where actually my favorite probably because its so much fun swimming in them and going Super fast on ice. Now for Opal collecting I didn't find them too bad aside from one Opal glitching on me. Which by the way if you collect 100 Opals you get a Super Bite by holding down the bite button and its never brought up in game and its not really that useful aside from the first level with the kill eight Frills Thunder Egg mission. The Zappyrang does have another use in a Bonus Level and it one hits the enemies with the riot shields which are only in the third set of levels. The Flamerang can be used to burn those cricket bats meaning you don't have use your bite to beat them which is nice. Ice can make ice platforms you can stand on which is also pretty cool. The Overworld while big its not pointless to explore you can find rainbow scales collecting all 25 let's you have double the hit bar which is nice for the final level. I really enjoyed three bosses the shark, Fluffy and the Final boss though the boss before the final had an interesting idea of being a platforming challenge rather then a full out boss fight like the others. In the HD port you can change the Camera controls which is nice that aside not much is changed. Now for the rest of the rangs Zoomrang Multirang Kaboomarang and Megarang are all useful. However the Infrang and chronorang are not as useful the Infarang does let you SEE hidden boxes which have art in them but nothing else and the Chronorang slows down enemies which is useful for the runaway bird thunder Eggs which I did before I got the Chronorang. With that I think I've gone over everything it just missed being a great Platformer by a little bit I compare it to Banjo & Kazooie and its almost there what its missing idk maybe better level design while it doesn't brother me its pretty simple but its organic so that goes with it.

Many times my rig could only push 60fps out of it. However it never dipped below that.\n\n-There are quite a few small but noticable visual bugs, mostly from the UI and the Opals. \n\n-Sound design. I can't quite remember if these are quirks from the PS2 and Gamecube releases, but there are several noticable sound problems. Such as moving characters not having their voice 'follow' them and several things not making noise that definately should. Such as Boss Cass' giant mech, or the huge mechanical gates leading to him being completely silent as they opened. Not a big issue tbh but I still noticed it.\n\n-Biggest issue here, a bug prevented me from completing the Frill Boat Battle and getting 100%.

The game is as great as I remember it being, and then some truthfully. Although Ty the Tasmanian Tiger appears as though it is a derived collectathon clone, a la Super Mario 64 and others, it offers a firm foundation of what has already been set in stone while adding in its own flavor well enough to make things interesting. One point that the game prides itself on, is the fact that you are Australian among other things, and you love your boomerangs. Throughout the game, you will receive a plethora of interesting boomerangs to up your arsenal and they are well implemented. The game isn't too long to simply never be beaten, especially for someone with a short attention span as I beat it 100%, besides picture frames, in around ten hours of playtime, yet those hours are never squandered. The graphics look incredibly similar to the original graphics of the PS2, but the remastering of the graphics and environment  is quite clear, with lighting wrapping around the trees onto Ty among other things. Music in this game is interesting to say the least to anyone who isn't familiar, combining easy-listening with aboriginal with drum and bass depending on the level and context of the situations you find yourself in. Overall, the quality is certainly there in the very early version of this remastered port, but I can't finish without touching on the single minor issue I had. Camera positioning is vital in 3D platformers and in the original, the camera worked incredibly well. The camera in this port does as well, but it infrequently gets caught on terrain when exiting water, but that never seemed to affect my playthrough more than make me repeat a race for an Egg at most.\n\nPros:\n\n*Good stylized graphics, now with more polish and detail.\n*Great and original music\n*Interesting level design\n*Great voice acting\n*Comedically well-written\n\nMileage may vary:\n*Short, but long enough to be a ride. \n\nCons:\n*Still EA so there might be bugs (such as my camera one)\n*There's nothing else to write about this great game.\n\nWould I recommend this: Yes. I'd even buy this remaster in it's current state at twenty dollars for its quality. I hope that the sales work well to get Ty 2 and 3 on Steam as well.

If you have played TY before, then this is definatly worth picking up. I'm not so sure for someone who had never played a game inthe series before however; this rerelease is more of a nostalgic trip down memory lane rather than trying to add more gameplay mechanics and features.\n\nOnly found two downsides to this rerelease: - You get a massive LAG spike when walking by the gumtrees on your way\n                                                                            to the first 3 levels (although I beleive they've release a temparary patch\n                                                                            while they find a perminant one. This will probably be fixed at a later date).\n                                                                         \n                                                                         -  I don't know if it's just for me, but during the cutscenes the audio and\n                                                                            video becomes out of sync.

Lots of things that constantly hit me right in the childhood.\n\nPositives:\n-I wasnt exactly afraid that this remaster would absolutly change everything, but I'm glad that you guys drastically improved things while still maintaining the art style the game has. It was an absolute nostalgia trip!\n-Some added effects that I dont recall seeing in the previous version of the game (the PS2 version at least) caught me off guard with the lighting on boomerangs such as Frostyrang and the Zappyrang which were really good. THE WATER!!\n-Resolution was handled really well. Didnt see much texture problems occur from running the game in 1920 \u00d7 1080 which is impressive. At points I stopped to take in the scenery because it looked so awesome.\n-Small things like the sound effect for completing/ obtaining new rangs were a nice addition and change from the old jingle, but I personally feel it could be changed into something more fitting maybe.\n-Eveything is obtainable (not sure about the picture frames). Didnt find any bugs with being unable to 100% a level due to a item not spawning or being unreachable.\n-Didnt experience any crashes, even when playing over a long period of time.\n-The game ran really well with my average PC. Snow levels in particular ran very well!\n\nNegatives:\nI didnt really find anything wrong with the game that doesnt classify as a minor bugs but...\n- The mission with the bombing boat Frills in Rex Marks The Spot it bugged to the point were you might not be able to complete it since the Frills that you defeat arent registered. However when I started the race mission it fixed it but interupted the race, causing me to lose the race.\n-Some missions like the snowball turrent mission felt cluncky to use with keyboard controls. Maybe the controls could be moved over to the mouse instead?\n-Some medium frame rate drops in some areas, which are more prevalent in the rainforest levels.\n-The draw distance in some areas make surrounding areas look a bit broken.\n- The shadows in some areas flicker on and off. Specifically In Beyond The Black Stump\n-Camera control take some getting used to.\n\nOverall I would definatly reccomend this game to anyone whos played the previous game as it is a great trip down memory lane and those who are curious too, as long as your not too put off by minor bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1459121323, "timestamp_updated": 1459121412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22094779": {"recommendationid": "22094779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084052636", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500728176}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved this game as a kid! my computer sucks though! so i have to play in windowed mode and low settings ,   \nLove the higher textures and HD Quality   my main problem is the major slowdowns on fullscreen mode", "timestamp_created": 1459120028, "timestamp_updated": 1459120028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22093731": {"recommendationid": "22093731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103486592", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460999958}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought for nastalgic purposes but it it realy fun", "timestamp_created": 1459115514, "timestamp_updated": 1459115514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22092098": {"recommendationid": "22092098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009058675", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463686460}, "language": "english", "review": "whip out a can of fosters and a barbie, unless your a petrol huffing noonga", "timestamp_created": 1459109837, "timestamp_updated": 1459109837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22091979": {"recommendationid": "22091979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085154866", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488065256}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful.", "timestamp_created": 1459109442, "timestamp_updated": 1459109442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22091451": {"recommendationid": "22091451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212719692", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459310815}, "language": "english", "review": "Brings back old memories from when I was a kid!

The game clearly takes inspiration of those and even wears some of the design decisions on its sleeve. Ofcourse there is absolutely nothing wrong with that when its done well.\n\n[b]And well they did![/b]\n\nLet's look at the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n-------\n- Fun and varied gameplay\n- Great and fitting soundtrack for each individual level\n- Cute characters and simple story\n- Varied and well designed environments\n- Fairly good port from the PS2\n- Addicting to get 100%\n\nCons:\n--------\n- Framerate drops in certain areas (Early Access)\n- Sometimes questionable level design (example: certain spikes emerging out of the ground are unavoidable)\n- Most boomerangs you get throughout the game are pretty much worthless as they get overshadowed by others.\n- Sometimes janky camera which can make you miss your jump \n(i got used to it and actually didnt mind the camera in the long run)\n\nSubjective Cons:\n--------------------\n- Awkward dialogue from time to time\n- I've noticed people have been annoyed by the recurring \"introduction talk\" of \"Maury\" the bird, who is essentially your guide, much like the fairy \"Navi\" from \"The Legend Of Zelda\" who keeps on annoying you with her \"listen\"! While i personally wasnt irritated by it, i can see why others where. Almost every 10 meters the game comes to a halt, throws in a cutscene and \"wants\" you to listen to what you need to do (you can skip it though). The frequent cutscenes only happen in the first level and it does make sense to put them there but they could have went about conveying information in a different way. On the other hand you have to keep in mind that this game was initially directed towards a younger audience.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n-----------------\nIf you enjoy/enjoyed 3D platformers like Super Mario 64 (or, for the newer generation, Jack & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank etc.) then this is one you should definitley pick up.

It felt so nostalgic to play this in 2016. But I ain't gonna lie, I mainly got this in hopes that they will also add the 2nd and 3rd game to the PC. Can't wait for that happen! \n\nAnyway, about this game. It is a bit of an old game, but older games normally tend to be fun, if not more fun than games from today. The story is rather simple, and though many know the story already, I will avoid spoilers. You play, as the title says, a tasmanian tiger named Ty. Ty explores many different terrains and weather in search for thunder eggs, golden cogs, opals, his bilby friends, and most importantly, talismans.\n\nGameplay: The game offers about 4-6 hours of gameplay. You are given many different levels to explore, take what is available in each level, and progress. The difficulty of the game is rather easy, in all honesty, the most likely thing that will kill you is the stuff on water slides and fall damage. Most the bosses are rather easy to beat, but that doesn't say the bosses aren't a battle to forget. \n\nCharacters: This game does have some memorable characters with some interesting personalities. Ty himself, in my opinion, didn't seem to be the most interesting character in my mind, but I will remember him only because he was the character you played as the whole time.\n\nControls: I understand they are still working on improving the PC version of this game, but the controls at the moment are really sloppy. The camera oftenly got stuck, the sensitivity for me was pretty low, even after I turned it up, and movement, espacially around corners, felt real awkward and oftenly costed me while fighting or sliding. I have only used the keyboard and mouse. I can't say for controller.\n\nGraphics: Obviously, for an old game, this game kind of lacks textures and effects. But I will say that the lighting (for at its time of release) is really not bad. Though obviously, you should never judge a game by its graphics. 2D or 3D\n\nPrice: For 4-6 hours of gameplay, some replayability, and maybe a few memorable moments and characters. The price of 12 dollars isn't to bad. But if it ever is on sale, highly consider it.\n\nRating: For people who played this back when it first released, it will be a trip down nostalgia lane. For people who are new to the game, it will prove to be a good experiance. For a price of 12 dollars, and all that I said above, I think it is a fair 6/10\n\nMake sure to support Krome Studios to help them improve this game and hopefully get Ty The Tasmanian Tiger 2 & 3 moved to PC!", "timestamp_created": 1459061908, "timestamp_updated": 1459061908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22077513": {"recommendationid": "22077513", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991306157", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494824239}, "language": "english", "review": "You're a Tiger who throws boomerangs.... 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1459052944, "timestamp_updated": 1459053518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22077245": {"recommendationid": "22077245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089990520", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 325, "last_played": 1514454362}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't recommend until issues are fixed w/ keyboard and mouse controls unless you have a controller.

I, along with many others, had TY the Tasmanian Tiger as my entry into 3D platforming games. Aside from my nostalgia, the game has remained competent if nothing else. Time has been generous to TY by how a once oversaturated market of 3D platformers feels refreshing nowadays by its scarcity.\n\nHowever, let's be honest about TY: You won't find anything groundbreaking if you've played plenty of Collect-A-Thons before, and if you haven't played TY since the GC days then you'll probably find a lot more problems than you would as a kid.\n\nIt's the style (both artistic and musical) are what transform the mediocrity of TY's substance into a platforming zen-like experience. Nothing brutal for challenge, yet nothing too dull to bore you. That is what might interest new players who are curious to give the game a try.\n\n[h1]An Honest Playing-Possum Game[/h1]\n\nTrue to their word, KROME studios has managed to launch two Ty games so far with all content available since launch with performance boosts and quality-of-life fix-ups to make these games fit for the PC. The main difference between the console versions and the PC is the performance boost and \"remastered\" (not remake) visuals. Wide-screen support (no black-bar boxes), improved textures, shadows and other visual details and the 60 FPS change are what the PC port offers, and if this system of bringing old games to Steam for modern audiences has shown anything that even finished games can be done better on PC as a result of an early-access system with competent developers.\n\nTY 2 is currently available on Early Access with the same plan of a few months of polish and optimization to bring it up to par with TY 1, and Ty 3 will also follow this plan once Ty 2 is complete. It\u2019s a shame there is no bundle option to buy all three as of right now for fans to make the most of these games while in development, but hopefully with the launch of Ty 3 there will be a series sale to help bring Ty back from obscurity with a new fanbase borne from the goodwill of these ports.\n\n[h1]Touring the Outback in Style[/h1]\nAs another Collect-A-Thon, TY derives a lot more from what worked in the past rather than innovate the genre. This works to the game's favor as it avoids forcing you to play everything. You explore nine levels from various locals to collect a general collectable for progress. Each level contains 8 Thundereggs--5 are level-specific objectives, one time-trial challenge, one collect 300 Objects goal and collect 5 caged friends--and you'll need 17 to advance to next area of the HUB. \n\nThe benefit of this system that Mario 64 capitalized on was if you don't happen to like one type of side-objective you can avoid doing them so long as you collect enough tokens for progression. (You only need to collect 5 or 6 in each stage to get by.) This is especially useful if you hate collecting 300 Opals in some of the more larger areas that can result in wandering aimlessly for a meaningless reward.\n\nAnother reward for exploration outside of the Thundereggs are Golden Cogs. Collecting 17 of them will reward the player with a non-essential boomerang to your arsenal, which tends to be combat-focused. Some of which are so absurdly over-powered they become amusing distractions to break up the monotony of fire, ice and shock boomerangs such as the Kaboomerang.\n\nHowever, if you are the type of person who enjoys going for 100%, however, Ty suffers the genre\u2019s issue for scavenging for the last remaining collectable that Yooka Laylee has addressed. It\u2019s difficult to suggest the amount of content available in games like this but if you go as a completionist you'll get a dozen hours minimum. If you go for only the Thundereggs as well as the Golden Cogs to progress the storyline, then you'll get 7 to 10 hours worth of content. \n\n[h1]Kids These Days Need Something More[/h1]\n\nAfter playing Ty 1 and Ty 2, which I never had the chance to play the sequels, it\u2019s a shame how these games squander the potential for more skilled gameplay of TY 1 for a unique platformer experience. It\u2019s easy to dismiss this issue because these games were intended for a younger audience; however, if the appeal of complexity behind Minecraft and survival games shows anything kids enjoy overcoming adversity in games that treats them with respect as an adult rather than being treated as children.\n\nThe biggest disappointment of TY is the rang-system. Similar to the issues I found in TY 4, the variety of rangs are either superfluous in combat as visual differences or the essential rangs are used in one or two instances with no complexity or ingenuity beyond their limited scope. Shock rangs can only work on generators; fire rangs can only burn ice and wood; ice rangs can be used to freeze fire or the water. This last one showcases the potential of a unique tool as it can be thrown on water to create infinite platforms, and this mechanic is used ONCE in the entire game. Had they utilized all the rangs for unique platforming challenges and obstacles, the variety in Ty 1 (as well as Ty 2) would improve the overall experience to make Ty a more versatile character. \n\nInstead of exploring the possibilities of Ty\u2019s boomerangs, the game rather stays within the scope of his mobile abilities for basic platforming, gliding and swimming challenges. On top of these limited challenges, the game also adds a \u201cspirit\u201d form that serves no purpose in the puzzles or challenges other than making combat even more simple to overcome, which could have utilized Ty\u2019s arsenal to a greater effect than making a needless mechanic that will rarely ever seen any usage by the player. Ty 2 also weirdly stuck with this idea with the BunYips, the Australian equivalent of those mini Metal Gears from MGSV (D-Walker) with their own abilities to expand upon Ty\u2019s arsenal, sometimes to the detriment of the platformer focused gameplay of the original.\n\nExploring these ideas is not for the personal clout of an arm-chair critic, rather to illustrate how if KROME studios wants to bring back this series they\u2019ll have to adapt these games in the future with the expectations of their audience. Whether they are kids or adults, the potential of Ty to engage with audiences has always been apparent in Ty 1 but never seized its opportunity to stand out in future sequels; instead, the focus has been on how to remove more of its platforming roots with each game when the focus should be on expanding them with the mechanics they have already established. As I mentioned in Ty 4, the possibilities of the rang-system for more creative means of exploration and skill-level has always been the one misused opportunity of Ty, and I think if KROME wants to step-up their game they will have to examine the strengths of each game they are revitalizing to learn from their legacy\u2019s mistakes and to create new ideas for a sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1458943515, "timestamp_updated": 1500740454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560936", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22051312": {"recommendationid": "22051312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138013136", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482428946}, "language": "english", "review": "So far, the game feels nostolgic.

I'm so glad to see it's coming back into the spotlight. \n\n**NOTICE** This is a port of a game that is over a decade old. It's in aplha/early access at the time I'm writing this. (3/24/16). In it's current state, it may be buggy or rough around the edges. Keep that in mind. I myself hardly ran into any major issues except for the dodgy camera. It performed solidly for me, though not to it's full potential. Not everyone has been as lucky as I have with performance though..  \n\n**UPDATE** As of 4/12/16, the game has had several great patches that have really improved the game. It's coming along amazingly!\n\nAnyway, this is a great collecting platform game set in Austrailia. \n\nBEST FEATURES:\n-Beautiful setting. Level designs are beautiful and the environments are very vibrant and pretty to look at.  \n-Amazing (ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!) music. I love it all, and the nostalgia factor makes it 10x better.\n-Fun characters, very imaginative. They're quirky, and this game has a good sense of humor.\n-Very satisfying collecting all of the items. \n\nI fully recomend getting this game. It's a great throwback to when platform adventure games were thriving. If you want to get it in early access, you'll save some money and have a voice in helping the game reach it's completion, i.e. report bugs, suggest improvements... The devs are very involved and active, which makes any game better.

Its a really good port in many aspects; visuals, sounds, gameplay. The keyboard controls are actually very well done. The visuals look great, and the sounds are nice. Its also nice to see Krome didn't replace any voice overs! Lately many game remasters change the voice overs because the original voice actor refuses to allow their voice in the game.

I never played this game though since I never managed to get my hands on it when I was young but I played the second game Bush Rescue religiously and even then this game managed to make me feel super nostalgic with the Australian themed soundtrack, the sound effects I recognized from Bush Rescue and to just see Ty on my screen once again.\n\nNow there are some things you need to know before purchasing this game. Ty the Tasmanian Tiger was originally developed for the PS2 so this game is a port and since the PS2 differs a lot from todays computers and modern day consoles there are some issues plaguing the game. First, the game lacks a lot of options you expect a modern day PC game to have, there are right now at the 24th of March 2016 only three options and those are shadows, reflections and render distance. Second, the game has performance issues sadly but according to the developers that's because the game was originally locked to 30FPS and with updated graphics and unlocked framerate the game suffers from severe frame drops here and there. The option that tanks your framerate the most is the shadows so if you want 60 all the time then turn off shadows completely, but on some levels you can still have 60 with shadows on so you can also switch back and forth on the go. But all these issues is why the game is in early access, the complete game is here, I've already beaten the game but the developers need funds to upate the game so it will match modern day games with a bunch of graphics options and fixed performance so expect this game to be pretty darn great in the near future if enough people buy the game. And if this game sells well then they will port and update Ty 2 and 3 to Steam as well.\n\nThe gameplay is your standard collect-a-thon platformer with a bunch of stuff to collect like cute small imprisoned Bilbies, Opals, Golden Cogs that you use to get different types of Boomerangs, Thunder Eggs which is the items you collect to drive the story forwards, Rainbow Scales which will give you more HP if you collect them all and Picture Frames which unlocks concept art and if you collect them all you unlock a movie. There are several types of boomerangs for you to unlock and use, ice boomerangs which freezes enemies and lets you create ice blocks on water for you to walk on, explosives boomerangs that will annihilate your enemies and a boomerangs which bounces from enemy to enemy. The combat is pretty solid as well, enemies die from one to two hits and it's always fun to throw your boomerangs on the enemies while jumping around on platforms and collecting a bunch of stuff.\n\nThe story, like the gameplay is pretty simple too. You play as Ty who is a young brave Tasmanian Tiger whos parents got imprisoned by Boss Cass while they where defending the Talismans which are the MacGuffins of this story since Boss Cass wants them to take over the world and Ty and his friends wants them to restore balance and peace. You travel around from level to level collecting items like Opals and Bilbies to earn Thunder Eggs which your Koala friend Julius needs to power his Talisman finding machine so you can find the Talismans before Boss Cass does.\n\ntl;dr\nPositive:\n+Nice fluid gameplay\n+Pretty great soundtrack that matches the Australian feel of the game\n+A bunch of different weapons\n+Tons of collectibles\n+Great level design\n+Fun characters\n\nNegative:\n-Limited graphical options and performance issues as of 24/3 - 16\n-Pretty easy final boss\n-Shazza's race on the Outback Safari level\n-Game does not include Batarangs", "timestamp_created": 1458782184, "timestamp_updated": 1458782184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645858", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22014528": {"recommendationid": "22014528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038388495", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489201217}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome to see TY on the pc.

So many games these days promise nostalgia but fail to deliver a fun or genuine experience, but Ty delivers on almost all fronts. This is largely due to it's 2002 roots, a much different age in gaming. I grew up playing Ty (and its subsequent sequels) and still fondly remember it. When I heard that it was being ressurected, I couldn't believe it. \nThis port delivers, despite still being in Early Access. It stands up beyond nostalgia- offering a bright, fun and engrossing experience. Despite it releasing only a day or two ago, I couldn't help but play through and complete the entire game. However, the length of the game might be the title's biggest downfall; To complete the game at 100% (Which does NOT include the hidden art) it took me between 9 and 10 hours. While my playtime might have been influenced by prior knowledge, it's important to keep in mind. \nBut for the price of about $9 to $12 it delivers a worthy experience.

Playing through it now, I can see a few issues that I may not have noticed back when I was younger but overall this is still one of my favorite platformer games I've played. I have to say I am kind of surprised how well this game holds up, but its music, art, and gameplay all manage to still captivate me. The music especially so. Once I heard the first level's theme I was instantly transported back in time to when I first played this game. On the negative side, there are a few slow downs and audio desyncs here and there, but I would attribute that to it being an early access game. Hopefully by the time the game is fully out these issues will be fixed. As well, there are a few relics of its time that still cling to this port such as low res cutscenes and an occasionally wonky camera. As well, this game can be a bit on the easy side. Overall however, the pros vastly outweigh the minor cons that I pointed out. This is one of my favorites of the 3D Collect-a-thon subgenre and if anyone has been wanting for such a game this is absolutely one I would have no issue reccommending. With some work for optimization, I can easily see this game as an 4/5. It's not perfect by any stretch, and the challenge mostly comes from collecting everything 100%.

For example the chronorang, which can only be unlocked after finding all (90) golden cogs, the only chance I had to use it was in Cass' Pass (even then it wasn't useful). One solution I can think to this is to involve the boomerangs more in the levels, by having puzzles/challanges that involve boomerangs in a certain way. For the later boomerangs, because not all players will want to collect everything to get them, why not have challenge levels that are unlocked after the final boss battle?

I love the water texture personally and the shadows are actually really well done. The controls for Ty's movement are actually really nice. Something about the feel \"faster\" for lack of a better word, but I actually really like it. Preformance wise, I was really happy. For the most part my fps stayed at 60 but occasionally dropped to 30 or 40 for seemingly no reason. It was never really an issue though as it never went below 30 and even when it did go that low it very quickly went back up. I probably wouldn't even have noticed only for the steam fps counter.\n\nStarting up the game's story, the cutscenes look the same as the old versions which takes away from the HD part of game completely. For some reason I can't move the camera when Ty is mid-air for some reason. I'm able to do that in the old versions so I really can't understand why I can't do it here. The last negative thing I would say here is only annoying more than anything. Whenever I get an item like a thunder egg or golden cog, the tune for getting them plays along with the main music of the stage. In the old version the music stopped to let the tune play and then resumed. As I said it's just annoying, not game breaking by any means. Also I did notice that it really doesn't like alt-tab at all which can be very annoying if I want to do something else while the game is running. \n\nThere's also a few things I noticed that I wouldn't even call complaints and I honestly don't care if they ever get fixed I just want to point them out really. The first is the the Bilbies picture has a floating nose for some reason. This next one's weird. Every time I get a life it goes up to the number on the top left of the screen and the number has an invisible box around it that covers part of the life as it's getting added. The last thing I'd say here is that the game has the same glitch that Super Mario 64 had with the water life bar. If I take damage on land, I can go into water and the life bar will switch from the normal one to the water one. Then if I go back out of the water the normal life counter will be full again. I'm not sure if this was in the original games or not. If it was I never noticed it. Anyway, like I said these three are just tiny quirks and I really wouldn't mind if they weren't fixed. All other negatives however should really be looked into.\n\nIn conclusion, I really like this version of the game. My only major issues I would say are the cuscenes and not being able to move the camera around while in mid-air.

So I know the game inside out and so can pick out a few things that are definitely different and not in a good way. Firstly with the intro sequence showing the background to the story, the audio is all out of sync. Secondly, as soon as you get into the game at Rainbow Cliffs the game runs EXTREMELY slowly, this seems to happen throughout the game so far (I've played through 2up, Ship Rex and Walk in the Park) but mostly in Rainbow Cliffs. It's not too much of a problem in the other levels however in Rainbow Cliffs when I first opened the game I almost concluded the game was unplayable. It seems to be certain areas in the other levels that trigger it to run slowly for instance, in 2up it runs slowly until you reach the first two of Cass' henchmen at the waterfall and then runs fine after that area. Another problem I encountered was the camera. If you're near a wall it will tend to \"freak out\" and you can't see at all what you're doing and trying to move the camera to a place where you can see is near impossible. The only way to fix it is to move TY himself away from the area that is causing the camera to stop working. Another small problem which I'm only picking up on because I love the game is that when you collect a thunder egg/golden cogg/bilby the music in the background continues to play over the tune that plays when you collect it. The audio in \"Walk in the Park\" is also not too great as sometimes the sound of the rain/waterfalls can be too loud to hear what any of the characters are saying. \n\nThe quality of the models and environment are beautiful and is a definite improvement from the xbox/playstation games. The controls work for the PC very well. However, I realise this is an early access to the game, I really hope that the speed that the game runs at can be fixed as it is the biggest problem and really impacts the gameplay so far.", "timestamp_created": 1458656149, "timestamp_updated": 1458656149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500056", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21983275": {"recommendationid": "21983275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045241565", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459035070}, "language": "english", "review": "MY CHILDHOOD IS BACK \n\nRuns perfectly with a gtx970.\nCheap price.\nVery solid game even 14 years after the original release.\n\n\nGo for it.", "timestamp_created": 1458655564, "timestamp_updated": 1458655695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21982657": {"recommendationid": "21982657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038933893", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459361071}, "language": "english", "review": "TY is my childhood.

I know there's forums for that, but not everyone goes there. I'll edit the \"review\" every new update and everytime I see a problem worth mentioning\nI used two different computers to test it: a Low-medium end Laptop (AMD A8-4555M 1.6 Ghz Quad-Core APU, HD8550M + HD7200 1.5GB, 6GB RAM) and a High end PC (Intel Core i5 4670K 3.4Ghz Quad Core, MSI Radeon HD7950 3GB, 8GB 2133Mhz RAM). According to the specs, both of them should run the game just fa (unfortunately, that's not the case).\nSo here is what I found now:\n\n- Can't use mouse on the menus (mouse cursor has the \"thinking\" symbol and never goes away)\n- Cutscenes: All of them have poor image quality. They should be re-done\n- Cutscenes: All of them have the audio and video severely desynchronized. Most of the time, the sound is more than 20 seconds ahead of the image\n- Lack of options in the main menum and lack of graphical options\n- Terrible framerate in the laptop that makes the game unplayable, even with low graphic options. Runs at 60fps in the high end PC, but still has some slowdowns.\n- The controller gameplay have to be tuned, because it's too much sensitive. I used Xbox One controller.\n\n\nSo, right now, the game is still very raw. The graphics are better and doesn't look that bad for its age, but still has a lot be polished in here.\nIf you played Ty games in the past and are his fan, I recommend buying it, because it's cheap (the price will raise after getting out of Early Access) and you'll support the devs, who promised to bring Ty 2 and 3 aswell if this game sells nice.\nIf you never played a Ty game and you're just curious, I recommend to buy it later, because the game has a lot to evolve.

I was so glad when I heard they were porting this game to PC and re-doing the textures. It's exactly how I remember it, except for some new great looking textures. The game itself is a fun lighthearted 3D platformer, lots to do, great level variation and fun platforming. Each level is completely different and offers some brilliant music along with interesting strange characters.There is a sense of accomplishement from collecting the little collectibles hidden in the map, you can obtain multiple new boomerangs from these collectibles. The game looks beautiful with so many colors and interesting enviroments. The voice acting is not the best, but what can you really expect from a 15 year old game with a reasonably low budget. I have noticed a few issues here and there. In the very first cutscene the audio gets really out of sync with the video towards the end of it. Sometimes the camera will just lose Ty completely, but only for a couple of seconds, this usually happens when getting out of the water. I haven't really noticed too many techincal issues other than a very few amount of frame drops, and they weren't too big either. \nI would absolutely reccomend picking this game up, and if its your first time playing it, I envy you. \nIn its current state, I would give this game a 9.5/10. Other than a few minor techincal issues, there is nothing wrong with this game.\n\nEDIT: I have to give a whole lot of respect to the devs who are trying to pin down every single issue that people are having, good on you Krome Studios.\nEDIT 2: There have been many subtle upgrades since my last update, they have really enhanced the performance and made it look much better.

Couple of things I've noticed right off the bat are significant FPS drops just from running around in Two Up, as well as the background music not cutting out when I collect a cog or free a bilby like it did in the original release. Additionally, sometimes the dialogue is out of sync with the animations.\n\nAlso, controlling the camera is very difficult sometimes, as it feels like the accelleration is cranked way up proportionally to how I move the analog stick. I have the PS2 release with me and have compared, and it was like that in the original, but an option to adjust camera sensitivity would be nice. \n\nFinally, the mouse cursor does not dissappear when I am in-game and using the gamepad, and it appears that I cannot tab out easily.\n\nStill, these are just little things I've noticed so far, and since it is in Early Access, I figured I should chime in with those issues to make sure that they get fixed and help make this every bit as good as I remember it being! \n\nMoving on to the positives, the HD looks amazing, especially for such an older game, and the reflections are a sight to behold on the highest settings, Controls are tight and responsive, except for that little camera nitpick previously, and Ty controls beautifully. I can't wait to complete this game all over again, especially since my old PS2 copy is nearly worn out!\n\nI've not ventured past Two Up so far, so I'll be sure to edit this review with any other points of interest I come across.\n\n*EDIT* Okay, so I just finished Ship Rex, and I'm a little baffled by a few musical changes.

But little did I realize that he was more popular than I led myself to believe, as with how I see all these people here on Steam who do, in fact, love him. They love Krome Studios for holding onto the rights to Ty for so long, and with such little funds behind them.

Every thing at all is the same, but that's DEFINITELY not a bad thing, as it's what the fans loved from before, and still do, and will forever.\n\n-------\n\nFor new players, read here:\n\nThe gameplay is by NO means lackluster, while it may be simple. It really is an easy 3D platformer with its own collection of...collectibles for you to find. A lot of them are really out in plain sight, but with a lot of those that are in plain sight, you'll sometimes need to get a certain 'rang' in order to gain access to it and grab it. And all of these collectibles help you out in the main game as well. You'll see~\n\nThe game\u2014assuming you're new\u2014would probably last you about 5 or 6 or even 7 hours alone, and FULL completion can take you as long as you'd like it to.\n\nI won't say anything about the story, because if you're one of those who is just now learning how loved this series is, it's best to let you experience it for yourself, completely blind, if you're up for it.\n\nYes, this is Early Access right now, and there are minor\u2014I repeat, MINOR\u2014errors in the game. No real bugs, or anything truly game-breaking, as the game has only needed to be rewritten in every regard. And as with Early Access, you would encounter these should you purchase the game, and your interest turns to adoration (though you might not appreciate the game as much as all of us prior fans do.) But Krome is VERY responsive ALL over the place: Facebook, Twitter, in the Steam discussions... Everywhere. None of your input will be missed, whether it be helpful input from this Early Access period, or just admiration for this game and how amazing in every way it is.\n\nI agree\u2014the price is a bit much if you're just jumping onto the bandwagon, and also assuming you have neither of the games that would give you a small discout; and even with the early access discount, too. But again, going back to how I started this off:\nUs fans will GLADLY give Krome our money in hopes that they regain financial stability to become as great as they were before, and it's just so cool that they're still here<3", "timestamp_created": 1458618333, "timestamp_updated": 1463419685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21975974": {"recommendationid": "21975974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010292895", "num_games_owned": 567, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458706997}, "language": "english", "review": "Australian boomerang throwing simulator 2016... errr 2002.

First and foremost, the performance needs to be addressed. It is by no means at a solid 60FPS all the time, and I wouldn't expect it to be at this point in development. There seems to be an inconsistent V-sync cap. Sometimes when the framerate dips below 60, it will cap it to 30FPS, and other times it doesn't. Bearing in mind that this game was designed for 6th-gen consoles, it is more than playable in this state.\n\nVisually, there's some bugs here and there, some clipping textures in the HUD, some shaders gone awry (for example, the heatwaves coming from torches at the end of Walk in the Park). Some textures have been remastered and look gorgeous at a high resolution. Others still have that pixelated \"Minecraft\" effect to them. Shadow maps could do with being a bit sharper. Overall, the graphical quality is inconsistent, but I'm sure the devs will address this in future updates.\n\nKeyboard controls are a cumbersome mess, but I would recommend playing this game with a controller anyway. If the devs fix keyboard and mouse controls in the future then I'd be interested in trying it out, but this isn't a game that demands accuracy so it's not a big deal.\n\nSound design is a little glitchy too, just minor things I've noticed here and there. At least once, ambient background noise drowned out some dialogue. When you collect items and a jingle plays, it doesn't fade out the level music, so you just get this audible mess in your headphones. Regardless, this game's soundtrack is utterly fantastic.\n\nThe FMV cutscenes look HORRIBLE. Completely unchanged from the console days, there's just a pixelated mess all over your screen whenever one plays. In-game cutscenes are a little odd sometimes too, since the animations for the characters are 30FPS, but the world they're in is running at 60FPS.\n\nOkay, now that I've nitpicked over every little thing I've not enjoyed so far, let me just finish up by saying that this game is fantastic, a relatively unknown platformer from the sixth gen of consoles that I've been hoping for years will come to PC. It's finally happened, and for the first Early Access build, I'm really rather impressed. I'm very excited to see what this game will become as more polish is added.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1458613842, "timestamp_updated": 1458613842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500124", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21975260": {"recommendationid": "21975260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062949686", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490028934}, "language": "english", "review": "The game, It runs at 144fps for me and it hasnt dropped a single fps once (Running a GTX 980 and a I7 4790K).\nThe graphics, Krome Studios has done a beautiful job redoing the graphics and everything it looks absolutely stunning.\nThe gameplay is just as i remember back on the PS2 only more smooth and with the better graphics much better.\nI would reccomend you buy this if you find it interesting as it has a decent story and nice gameplay, Thanks for reading ^^", "timestamp_created": 1458613429, "timestamp_updated": 1458613429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21975244": {"recommendationid": "21975244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082053682", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468283597}, "language": "english", "review": "There is no disliking this game, are you insane?", "timestamp_created": 1458613321, "timestamp_updated": 1458613321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537175", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21975172": {"recommendationid": "21975172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108617832", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 59, "last_played": 1514325232}, "language": "english", "review": "This was my second game I have ever playing when I was a child, first was Sly Cooper. 3D platformers is what made gaming what it is today.

What a wonderful nostalgic feeling it is to replay my very first and favourite Playstation 2 game on PC in High Definition, such a really great port too!\n\nRunning silky smooth with no lag or errors or anything, the controls feel tighter and more responsive than ever, little tweaks have been made to make it a really great experience, the colours are bright, sharp, and the whole game looks and plays amazingly.\n\nTy, for those unaware, is a 3D action platformer, in the vein of Spyro the Dragon or Banjo Kazooie (although I always thought it would be as if Crash Bandicoot was made into a 3D open world platformer, judging by the style, enemies, location) Whilst platformers were more abundant than hydrogen back in 2002, its so fresh and awesome to see a classic platformer like this getting a facelift and being released on PC in 2016. I absolutely loved this game when it came out and having played it for an hour this evening, straight on launch, my rose tinted spectacles were not needed. The game is amazing, fun, slightly silly but genuinely exciting. Its easy enough for newcomers to platforming won't have too much of a challenge at first, but enough so that veterans will have a great time searching every huge level for every single shiny thing to collect. I really love the plinky plonky sound collecting opals makes, and just enjoying the feeling of running around on the beach in ship rex, its like liquid nostalgia is dripping through my PC.\n\nAs for other thoughts, I would be interested to see antialiasing turned on (rather than being forced by my graphics card) as when I first booted the game up, there wasn't any. Perhaps a few more options considering it is running on PC? (The game had a hard time deciding which of my multiple monitors to run on at first) it would be cool to alter a lot more in depth settings the game has to offer. I'm assuming it being early access the textures will be upgraded? Like on the boomerang start menu, it is very low textured, the same with some parts of some levels. At the moment it feels like its a 1:1 port of the PS2, lets aim to make Ty feel comfortable in 2016, yeah?\n\nThank you for bringing Ty out of retirement and back into the real world again, its been too long. I had a glint of hope supporting Ty 4 on PC would reinitialize the franchise, so glad to see it paid off!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1458609341, "timestamp_updated": 1458609341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502158", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21974312": {"recommendationid": "21974312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054874007", "num_games_owned": 915, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486166264}, "language": "english", "review": "Welcome Back To My Childhood", "timestamp_created": 1458608371, "timestamp_updated": 1458608371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21974116": {"recommendationid": "21974116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188104813", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473927637}, "language": "english", "review": "I thought I might be nostalgia blind, but I would still recommend this game to anyone who likes collectathon platformers. \n\nWhat I love about the game:\n\n-Amazing Soundtrack \n(I get upset when dialogue interrupts a level's music)\n-Unique Style\nThe Ty series gave me a childhood obsession with boomerangs. \n-Varied Levels \n\nThe complaints I listed in my original review have been fixed.

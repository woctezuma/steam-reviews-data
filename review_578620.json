If any of you have played Robo Recall for the Rift then you know pretty much how the melee combat works in this game. What sets GORN's combat apart from Robo Recall is that there is no warp mechanic. Instead you \"walk\" by holding down the touch pad and swinging your arms. The walking mechanic felt awkward at first, but after a little while it started to feel surprisingly natural.

On the store page it looks like it's a simple game where you just wave fight mindless enemies with a bunch of weapons that are given to you. Seemed.... too simple. I was very wrong about this assumption.\n\nGorn doesn't explain all that well that there is actual progression and challenges/achievements to get these new weapons.\n\nFor instance, about every 5-6 fights you can fight a champion. There are 8 based on the wall I can see and they are unique enemies where you are given a certain set of weapons to deal with them. This actually makes me want to do some normal rounds to be able to beat all of the champions. Once you beat the champion you get a new weapon that that specific champion unlocks for you. Such as iron fists or a grapple gun fist.\n\nA good example of a champion is Achilles. He is a fully armored enemy except for his ankle and you are given a sword, which performs very poorly against armor. So you end up having to parry his sword attacks which will slow-mo for a bit, then duck and swipe at his foot to kill him. It was a pretty enjoyable experience! I'm not going to lie.\n\nThere are also weapon challenges to get new weapons. For instance, there are 5 heart removals required with a Rapier  or Spear (also unlocked weapons, I don't remember how) that will unlock nun-chucks for you. Heart removals can only happen if you stab them in the chest around where the heart is. This makes each wave interesting since you have certain challenges you can focus on against these enemies. In other words, there are objectives each wave for the most part.\n\nI have almost 2 hours in the game and have killed 5 champions. The combat is pretty satisfying since each weapon for the most part handles differently so you can find your favorite weapons of destruction. I personally like the axe the most and after that these metal fists they just introduced since you can block with your hands and then punch them to death while breaking their armor with your iron fists. It makes me feel super BA and like a super buff monster dude just like the guys I'm beating up.\n\nOne of the things I think VR is for is to make you feel like a superhero or something better than just a regular person. Gorn achieves this. If you are careless you can get killed, but the game isn't so hard that you feel it's impossible.\n\nI'm also very glad that it has a strict chaperone that pauses the game if you get out of your chaperone area at all. It is super helpful since sometimes in frantic battles you really are swinging very hard or punching very hard to be fast to smack the enemy in time. I have about 8-12 inches of give past my chaperone to actual objects/walls and I haven't broke anything yet.\n\nTLDR: The game actually has progression, achievements and lots of weapons.

It contains many types of weapons and powers. It may not look like a whole lot from the trailer or from gamplay, but it really never feels old. There is always something to do within the custom mode, boss mode, endless mode, party mode, or normal arena mode. With each weapon, it is a different experience. You have to stratagise around depending on what weapon you have. If you don't like to see all the bood and gore, you can turn your enemies into walking pinatas spilling out candy, which makes you feel far less insane. You can also give the middle finger...cause that's a thing.\n\nThis isn't a perfect game though... yet. It is still in early access, so it isn't completely a finished product yet. From playing this game on the oculus rift, I have encountered a few audio problems. At first the game didn't even have sound at all. I googled up how to fix it, and sure enough there was an answer. I went into my windows settings and disabled all of the other audio devices except the rift headphones. After I was finished with that game session, I re-enabled all of the devices except for the steam streaming mic and the steam streaming audio and the audio continued to work. Recently, when I was about to be killed by enemies in-game, my audio would temperarily cut out for a few seconds to almost a minute. I am not sure if this is because of a recent update that cuts out your hearing at near-death, or if this is just a bug. Either way, I don't really like it.\n\nBut overall, this is a pretty good game. It is actually one of my favorite VR experiences so far that I have played. Sure, the devs need to work on it some and add a little more content, but this is a [b]fun[/b] game. And after all, that is the whole point of video games, isn't it? At the current state, I give this game an 8/10.\n\nPS. The amount of hours that it says reviewers have played may be too low if they use an Oculus Rift.

Use the quick turn option in the game movement settings to cut down on bumping your room walls - made a big difference when I made that switch.\n\nLegs, arms, feat, hands and head can be severed. Enemy armor can be destroyed piece by piece. Enemies with severed limbs will eventually bleed out and die on the spot. Cuts and severed limbs will spurt blood as well. You can chop heads at different angles revealing different parts of the skull/jaw. Weaker bladed strikes to the face will pop out an eye, or both eyeballs, or just leave a nasty cut on the face. Wounds reflect the type of attack (pierce vs slash vs bludgeon, single blade vs multiple blades, etc.)\n\nYou can parry enemy strikes. You can fight with a two-handed weapon, dual one-handers, bow and arrows, one-hander and shield, two shields, one shield and unarmed, or fully unarmed. You can grab enemies with one hand and smash their face in with your free hand You can grab an enemy and use them as a shield, or bludgeon another enemy to death with their body, or simply grab an enemy and smash his body against the ground until he dies. Hearts can be ripped out with piercing weapons (spear and rapier at least), heads can be ripped off as well.\n\nEnemies often mistakenly hit their friends when swinging which is hilarious at times.\n\nDefault movement is a sort of arm pumping/skiing movement, but you can change this to a less involved option in-game to suit your playstyle.\n\nDifferent weapons are unlocked based on certain achievement requirements involving boss battles and arena victories. Weapon challenges provide timed scenarios where you try to sever the most number of limbs, or smash the most amount of armor in a certain time limit.\n\nMy personal favorite is going Musashi with two one-handed swords in the decapitation challenge. Highly recommend you use the default Gorn movement.

The recent updates have improved an already fun game immeasurably. Let me break down the positives.\n\nGRAPHICS: Fun, cartoony, consistant with the weapon design and immersive.\n\nPHYSICS: By far, the draw cards of the game. Incredibly satisfying to smash, stab, swing and throw your weapons and see them have the desired (and undesired effects on your combatants)\n\nWEAPONS: A wide range of killing instuments to allow you to adapt your play style. Become a Juggernaut swinging a huge morning star, or a lithe quick fencer stealing in for chest stabs to take as many hearts as possible. Awesome.\n\nLOCOMOTION: Some options for this, but the recommended arm swing is by far the best. Takes some getting used to, but once you're there, it really (weirdly) helps with immersion (and calorie count). The winged gloves recently added allow you to leap into and out of action like a crazy flying...ninja... of um....gory.... death (running out of adjectives).\n\nSUGGESTIONS: Very excited to see where this game goes. Already in an AWESOME place. Some humble thoughts. Would be good to have a wider variety of enemies (sizes, shapes, speeds, health, tactics). Would be great to have more content, more things to kill, weapons to get, skills to master, places to explore, more more more. To have the weapon's mastery system give you added benefits, an RPG lite feature kinda thing. \n\nOtherwise, some of the most fun I have had with my Vive.

The movement options alone make this game worth the purchase. It's clear a lot of love has gone into this game. GORN is an exercise in creative approaches to locomotion in a literal proving ground where you engage in brutal combat with a whole catalog of martial (or feral) weapons. What more is there to say? Plenty!\n\nPros: \n - Several movement styles to learn, each with strengths in the arena. \n - Sometimes frantic, sometimes epic, always fun. Leap 20 feet in the air and let an arrow fly. Pretty satisfying.\n - Weapons combine in different ways to provide interesting gameplay challenges. Game progression encourages novelty, and one can choose custom battles/challenges with a weapon of your choice.\n - Several gameplay modes and enemy types. \n - Controls feel tight and responsive. GORN gameplay is unique and the locomotion style is unlike anything I've played (standard locomotion is available).\n - Very good exercise.\n - Strict chaperone option pauses the game when I approach the edge of playspace. Given adequate room scale space, it is possible to play this game safely without punching things.\n - Lots of replayability.\n - The game interface is one of my favorite parts. GORN puts you in character, and the interface is the game. This is how VR content should be made. Nice job devs!\n - Non-violent mode makes me feel like less of a psychopath (this may be a con in the long run idk)\n - More customization options than I have yet explored. Tinker with scale, enemy strength, and more.\n\nAreas for growth / questions:\n - Sore muscles for days and days. How can I stop being such a feeble-bodied peasant? \n - Will you start looking at network features? I know PVP probably won't happen (and rightly so) but friends scores for challenges, PVE coop, some type of record/sharing option for a session -- any of those possible?\n - Will there be an option to change audio? I don't love the laugh track being on all the time.\n - Any plans to add new/different arenas? Perhaps a king-of-the-hill style map with different geometry?\n\nTL;DR: Addictively fun arena game with a beautiful art style, combat in GORN feels feature complete (with obvious paths for growth, like more bosses, etc.). The flying fists of fury update is amazing, and really opens up the door to new playstyles.

Fight some guys, spray some blood, maybe slice off an arm or two, get beaned in the noggin and pass the Vive to Jeff.\n\nHo ho ho, no no no. I don't know what it is about this game, but there is [i]always[/i] something to do. There's always a new way to fight, a new way to approach the battle, and a new experience to be had. Yeah, it's a single arena and you fight an (unending, if you want) army of identical muscle-bound gladiators who constantly smile like they're strangely aroused and talk smack while a giant metal fist is hurdling at their squishy, unprotected flesh. You know what they say about judging a book by it's cover-- I guess that doesn't really apply here because it's not a book and doesn't really have a cover but you get the jist. If it was a book, the words on the pages would change every time you read it, and still be equally as exciting.\n\nAt nearly 60 hours and climbing almost every day, GORN holds the majority of my time spent in SteamVR. Other titles just haven't held my interest-- they got stale after I've done everything or the parts I liked were patched out (looking at you, Sairento). 60 hours in, playing in chunks of 10 minutes to 3 hours, I'm still not bored. It's still fun. It's still exhilarating, and it's still the best workout regimen I know of when I play it like I'm really there. Added on is the fact that it supports local multiplayer, either by the new party mode (introduced with the most recent update, this review written 12/15/17), or by hot-dropping into an in-progress game by just pressing start on a controller. I tend to prefer the latter because it allows you to play multiplayer in custom mode, which is unlocked by completing a set of tasks that I forget the exact details of. \n\nParty mode, however, allows multiple controller-players (I think? At least one.) who take control of an enemy gladiator who participates in the bloody free-for-all until the HMD player is elimitated, while racking up kills to grow stronger. I tend to work with the extra player to prolong the game as long as we can, and then switch.\n\nRegular \"old school\" drop-in (pre-party mode update) is a little different in that you can plop yourself into a game at any time and take control over a previously AI controlled gladiator, and you switch between gladitors that are already fighting when you die, as opposed to spawning as a new one as you would in Party Mode. However, in regular drop-in mode, kills are not counted and you don't get yoked for getting more. There have been times where I've booted up SteamVR and set the headset on my bed just to play as one of the mortals by myself and still had a blast.\n\nThere are a plethora of weapons to use, each with its own unique abilities and drawbacks. As of the most recent update, there are a set of caestus-- special gloves that you equip in the lobby after you've unlocked them-- that extend your death-bringing abilities to a fantasy level that brings even more fun to the game with a seemingly unlimited combination of new ways to murder swaths of dim-witted meat puppets. You can have extendable claws, yank people across the arena with a chain, and even leap through the sky to descend upon your enemies in a superhuman fashion, plunging your arsenal of floppy poking tools into them and popping their limbs and bodies like sausage-filled balloons.\n\nThe game's primary developer, Ruan (apologies if primary developer is a misnomer in this case, but he seems to do the main mechanical work) hangs out in Discord on a regular basis and is open to feedback, suggestions and bug reports on a daily basis. I have personally seen bugs that I've reported fixed within a few hours while playing on the Experimental branch. The team that created this masterpiece as a whole seems very receptive to the community and supports what we want as much as they can. If you have any interest in VR melee combat, do not hesitate to pay full price for this game and support the development team as they deserve it and more.\n\nGORN is, without a doubt, the most uniquely satisfying and most replayable VR game I own or have experienced. I haven't played a AAA VR game (as if there are many) that can even hold a candle to the intense, heart-racing and often hilarious antics that this game can provide. If there was an \"Absolutely\" button next to \"Yes\" I'd have pressed that.", "timestamp_created": 1513398157, "timestamp_updated": 1513398443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 96, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.898327", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38340796": {"recommendationid": "38340796", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977801908", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511754280}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a ton of fun...

Was initially going to return, but a friend convinced me to give the game a second chance, since I hadn't unlocked everything yet. There's a decent amount of content in the game, and the developers seem really willing to add things to the game, with updates being a fairly reliable source of new content in addition to fixing bugs. \n\n- Combat -\nSomething to keep in mind with this game is that while the melee combat isn't perfect (flailing your arms wildly can win most fights quickly), it still provides a good amount of variety with the way the different weapons handle. The flail surprised me with how well it functioned, and the spear and two-handed weapons caught me off guard with the way they handle (spears still flop around a bit too much for my liking though). The hammers are a bit OP, as either version of it breaks armor and seems to deal a lot of damage. Bows and throwing knives have accurate tracking, but have extremely limited ammo, making them less fun since you quickly have to ditch them to stay alive. You can pluck your ammo out of foes to reuse it, but it's kind of hard since enemies are like ragdolls that can lurch at you suddenly.\n\nRemember Skyward Sword? The Nintendo game with Link and the annoying Siri thing? This game does it better. When you swing a weapon at a foe with armor, it doesn't deal damage until you break the armor off. Unrelated, but as seen in the trailers and comments, you can rip foes' appendages off. I learned the hard way you're not supposed to do this until there's like one foe left, as other enemies can and will ignore your morbid celebrations. You can use dead foes as human shields, which is something I did really like (especially against archers).\n\nP.S. You parry enemies by attacking their weapon, regardless of whether the enemy is attacking or not. This is something I managed to exploit during multiple battles. \n\n- Health -\nSince it never seems to be directly said in the game at any point, you do have an interesting health system. If you are hit by an enemy ONCE, your vision starts to fade and you will die within a few seconds. HOWEVER, you can immediately recover from this \"dying\" state by killing an enemy, encouraging you to go berserk in a last-ditch effort to stay alive. It's something that hasn't been seen in any VR games that I've played, and it reminds me of the Borderlands mechanic. \n\n- Replay Value -\nThis is the big hitter for me. I think I'd reccomend the game because of the updates, and since the latest one added MF Honey badgers, which adds a unique spin on combat (you can rip them off of your face and throw them at people) if they don't kill you in the first few seconds of their arrival in the arena. Local multiplayer is a big plus that kept me and my friends coming back to this game, kind of like Blue Effect but instead of scaring each other you just flail at each other until one person dies. It's kind of great. \n\n- Content -\n\nYou can unlock most of the game's content in about an hour, but most of the content is locked behind an achievement wall... by fulfilling challenges such as getting headshots with a bow or parrying enemy attacks, you can unlock additional starting weapons for your randomized starting lineup, along with boss battles and challenge modes, including an endless mode. As it stands, it's an okay game, but with a few extra updates, such as time of day/lighting differences, stage hazards like a pit of lava, or a bit of enemy body type variation, this game could quickly become something really impressive. \n\n- Verdict -\nTry the game and play for about an hour, or try to conquer the first six bosses. At this point you'll have experienced most of what the game has to offer, and it should give you an idea of whether or not the game is worth keeping.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511845244, "timestamp_updated": 1511845244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37836365": {"recommendationid": "37836365", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982387975", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509771042}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

I bought this on a whim when it was on sale, since I'd been eyeing some of the boxing games for Oculus, and I was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nAs many here have already explained the mechanics, I won't - other than to say it's a gladitorial game.  Your in an arena, you pick weapons, you fight.  Simple.\n\nHowever, despite how bland that might sound, the game just never gets old.  Every fight is a different mixture of opponents, some armored, some not; some armed, some not.  The over-the-top damage you do to your opponents is hilarious and gruesome at the same time - weapons do what you'd expect them to do.  Lop an arm or leg off with a sword.  Bash a helmeted head with a mace.  Run an opponent through with the spear or poinard.  The combat mechanics are very well done (for VR), and you can block attacks with every weapon instead of just using it to fight.  The sounds are excellent - the clang of weapons on armor, the horrible thunk of a warhammer on an unprotected skull, etc.\n\nIn addition, the game is a room-scale game, and you can build up quite a sweat from playing this game.  After about 30 minutes of playing it the first time I was breathing like I'd run a quarter mile.  With that said, make absolutely sure you have enough room to play this - as you WILL be flailing your arms around like a blind madman.  I hit the wall and nearly broke my monitor in the first 10 minutes (the video above is not that  much of an exaggeration).\n\nI very heavily recommend this game to all VR gamers.

Is it worth  Step into the collisium and face off against lowley scrubs to fully armored behemoths, using motion control to shoot, stab and bash each foe you face. Use the room scale features to dodge attacks and revel in the gore you spill with each strike. \n\n\tThe wepons in Gorn are what really sell the experience. From the bow and arrow piercing the armor of your enemy to the heavy 2 handed maul knocking them clear out of the arena almost every weapon you pick up feels real. Gone are the days of just waggling your hand to cause damage with motion controls, in Gorn the speed and placement of your swing determines the effectiveness of your attack. Quick stabbing motions with the small daggers can be just as effective as large lumbering swings with 2 handed mace.

Akin to Climbey, the grip buttons are the classic locomotion and offer a similar type of movement to your top-heavy enemies. Trackpad locomotion is also an option, and it works perfeclty, but I feel GORN loses a little bit of it's magic if you aren't stumbling about like you just drank a flagon of ale.

I don't know how many hours I will have played when you read this, But even for just 2h of gameplay, this game is worth it's money.\n\n2.Like many others I presume, I'm afraid I'll break my HTC with sweat. this game is the most exhausting VR game I've played.\n\n3. The trailer, while extreme, is accurate. I smashed my controller into 2 walls, a shelf, a window frame and 5-7 times on my couch. I have pretty good situational awareness in other games. But this... this is too fun to think about your bedroom!\n\n4. Unlike the specifications say, wich I decided to ignore, GORN does run on Windows 7 without a problem.\n\n5. I'm gonna continue on point 1, This game is definetly worth buying even if you don't get alot of hours on it. like paying 30\u20ac for a couple of hours for a bowling alley. It's incredibly fun and I just can't get enough of slapping gladiators with their companion's arm.\n\n6.

Without magic transporting (which would not work in this game), moving more than 3 feet just isn't practical in VR today.\n\nYou do need more space than the average game to play - you will want at least a ft of space around your play area to make sure you aren't banging into walls - but it's well worth the extra space.\n\nFor the life of me I cannot figure out how you are supposed to correctly use most of the two handed weapons. The weight of the giant flail and the hammer is just wrong and makes them pretty pointless.

It's totally natural, and an okay thing to be.  Anyone with a hind-brain can probably relate.  The thing that's unnatural is the society we've built that depends on us NOT expressing that facet of our being - one that i believe we all share, though some of us are better at diverting or suppressing it than others.  \n\nGorn is the best, most immersive, most rewarding way to express that deep-seated, reptilian aggression without violating any of society's expectations.  I think that Gorn is the most honest video game i've ever played.  \n\nIt's completely replaced my (admittedly light) exercise routine.  i bought wrist weights so i could keep pushing myself physically.  I kill over a hundred men a day, every day, and i cannot wait to exercise each evening.  I have never felt that way about working out in my life.  \n\nGorn is one of those pursuits where the more you put into it, the more you're gonna get out of it.  If you let yourself really enter the arena, let your living room melt away, really get your blood up - then i think you'll have a better time than if you try to play it in an \"optimized\" or physically lazy way.   Don't play this game with your wrists, play it with your shoulders.  \n\nWhile the game is designed to be a sort of testosterone-fuelled gratification of an adolescent power fantasy, the women in my life who've tried it report satisfaction too, often more emphatically than the dudes.

They might need to get a contractor in here.

Dont think twice.  Buy it now.  BUY IT.  BUY BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHoly crap, GORN is so much fun!  I was having a shitty day, my morning mocha was undrinkably shitty because some shithead trainee doesn't know how to make coffee, and i was out of good coffee at the apartment, and the kitchen is a god damn mess and my servants never clean up when they're supposed to, and I could just go on for hours... so I was mad and decided to blow off steam by hopping on Steam VR.  Incidentally, I think that could be a clever marketing thing.  \"Blow off some steam with Steam... VR!\" I think of brilliant things like this all the time but it's like nobody ever reads the comments I leave on Reddit.).  I digress. \n\nI spent most of the afternoon beating the shit out of people until I accidentally raised my hand into the ceiling fan and almost broke my thumb.  I have decided that if I'm ever thrust into gladiatorial combat there are two weapons I should never try to use: flails and swords.  Now, you can't kill yourself in GORN - at least not that I've seen - but I can certainly tell when I *ought* to have been dead because of an errant thrust or swing.  The flail may be my favorite weapon in the game, but if I'm being honest, I ought to have bashed my own brains in more than a few times.  The sword, by contrast, appears to me to be the most difficult weapon to use in the game, which tells me it is probably exponentially more difficult to use in real life.\n\nHowever, after GORN I'm expertly prepared to face real life gladiatorial combat.  I know exactly which kinds of weapons to choose, when given the choice: caveman weapons.  Anyone can swing a club.  I can usually swing a club and not kill myself in the process.  Hammers, clubs, maces, baseball bats, whatever.  Anything more advanced takes greater and greater degrees of skill, until you get to crossbows and finally guns where you've gone back to caveman skill, but with the lethality of an Olympic God.\n\nI mean, with a couple of decently skilled marksmen a gunfight comes downt o who can point at the other guy fastest.  It's a pretty funny way to duel each other, here in the future.  You used to have to get sweaty.  And brother, did I get sweaty playing GORN!  I had to take off my shirt, the sweat glistening down my long greasy hair.\n\nI don't know why this review got weird, I'm sorry.

I mean really, it's slick.\n\nA nice mix of weapons and challenges, some of which revolve around picking up dead foes weapons. So you actually have to think.\n\nDamn good exercie. I was all sweaty and [strike]worn[/strike] GORN out. It was a good workout.\n\nSome of the animations were funny the 1st few times.\n\nYou can actually give the finger lol.\n\nThe negative:\nI know this is EA so it's difficult to complain but, really, after just under 2 hours I realized all this is, is repeatedly trying to melee the exact same, cartoony looking, 1-3 wobbly guys with bendy legs and weapons over, and over, and over. For all of that positive, I just got... bored. Hopelessly bored. \n\nAfter just 2 hours I had almost every weapon, and was working my way though the challenges (more or less). It's a fun game, really fun, at first. Most of the reviews (though not all) have less than 5-7 hours played, that's about how long this game is fun for in my opinion. \n\nIt can be very frustrating, watch Jacksepticeye and how annoyed he gets at not being able to effectively parry certain hits because the weapons actually wobble. \n\nAll in all, it is a fun game at first.

You do have the option to change it to using the joystick, however I decided to give it a chance.  It took me a few matches, but I got the hang of it fairly quickly, think of it as cross-country skiing motions.   \n\nWeapons:\n\nWeapons are a lot of fun.  I enjoyed the challenge of using the bow\u2026You only have a limited number of arrows.  After which you need to retrieve them from the corpses otherwise face your beatdown!  Some rubber banding effect with the bigger weapons, but it adds more comedic value than a serious bug mainly do to the overall theme and gameplay style.\n\nGameplay:\n\nPretty simple gameplay\u2026Gladiator arena, where you face off with multiple (dumb) weapon wielding grunts.  One, two no problems, when there are many, all surrounding you, you need to start thinking a plan, otherwise nighty night!\nWhen you are in the mood to beat up / maim this is a great game to jump in and play.  Just make sure you have enough space.  I already came close to busting one of my Oculus Touch controllers as when I was trying to hack a \u2018grunt\u2019 with my sword, I was a little too close to the wall.  \ud83d\ude0a  \n\nOkay now for the negative:\n\nIt\u2019s a simple game, repetitive in nature.  Hopefully there will be some new characters instead of the same old grunts.  Multiplayer could potentially add some unique challenges.  A campaign would be nice, start off as a nobody, and work you way up the chain to eventually get your freedom. \n\nOverall:\n\nThe game, as it\u2019s still in Early Access is so far a lot of fun, even with its simplicity nature.  Price point is fair for what you are getting.  I\u2019m generally not one to buy early access games, as I\u2019ve seen many times developers just never complete them, however I am curious to where they plan to take this.\n\nIf you are looking for something fun I would recommend this game.

My personal favorites are the spear for its lunge capability and the rapier/shield for stabbing at the enemy from cover. The variety in weapons actually feels like variety because they all play to various strengths and weaknesses.\n\n[h1]Movement[/h1]\nMovement was a bit of a chore at first using the default style of movement (clicking track pads and swinging arms) but once I switched to the scheme where you can just click-and-hold the pads in a direction to move things got a lot easier. If you have a setup like mine where the cord drops behind you to the floor you may have the same trouble I did with taking advantage of the 360 degree aspect of the game. I've been mainly working with about 300 degrees of rotation and I feel somewhat vulnerable as a result.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nThe combat is gorey in a goofy way with limbs popping off, eyes hanging out of sockets, and being able to gore enemy hearts right out of their chest. You can even abandon conventional weapons and pull their head off orm bash it in with a rock.\n\n[h1]Modes[/h1]\nA standard campaign that gets harder with each fight won eventually unlocking the ability to fight unique champion enemies. Eventually you unlock an Endless mode. That's it, but it's more than enough and keeps the menus simple and the time outside of combat minimal.\n\nWhat really makes this game worth the money to me is the workout it can provide.

There isn't a story (or not one that I have found yet) and while this game is the definition of repetitive it is always exciting and will always get your heart pumping.   Simply for the bloodlust and adrenaline you are guaranteed to get this deserves a 10/10, however I do have a few gripes.  I do not see anywhere on the page or requirements but you HAVE to have a 360 setup and you HAVE to have room (no standing in one spot) or you cannot play this game. I also kind of have an issue with how you turn, because you have to turn in real life you have to constantly be conscience of your cord which really does not let you full emerse yourself.  I feel like the developers should allow for turning via joystick to at least be an option until wireless VRs/VR attachments come out.\n\nSo if you have a 360 set up, don't mind sweating and potentially breaking something you need to buy this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1502463526, "timestamp_updated": 1502463526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34161453": {"recommendationid": "34161453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065849642", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503012460}, "language": "english", "review": "2nd best vr experience", "timestamp_created": 1502428703, "timestamp_updated": 1502428703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502240", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34153001": {"recommendationid": "34153001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036922139", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "last_played": 1513744456}, "language": "english", "review": "If being able to rip a gladiators arm off which happens to be holding an axe and using that as a weapon doesn't keep you entertained... then maybe using their whole bodies as a weapon will!

While I have a 360 setup and just enough space for room setup I play using a Standing Room steam setup to minimize punching my walls or windows out and the game works beautifully. \n\nThe Dev also took the time to reply directly to my initial review stating that in game turning had been implemented after the recent update was released, that's pretty damn impressive not many would take the time to do that - push out an update then locate a review from weeks prior and reply to it. \n\nAs a game it's pretty solid and enjoyable, loving the recent custom battles feature.

You had to keep the grip trigger button down to keep holding the weapon and you could only move by clicking down on the thumbstick while also moving the controller in a \"skiing motion.\"  They finally patched that up so you can keep holding the weapon with just a click and you can press \"A\" button and do the skiing motion and it's made moving around a whole lot easier.  \n\nGame is fun.  You get a good workout.  Very gory.  Lots of weapons to try out.  A few different enemy types with varying levels of difficulty.  Of course, you can also do crude gestures and tear all types of body parts out.  Blood splatters all over.  This game is fun in spurts and a nice game to show off to friends how fun VR can be.  \n\nHowever, this game also still has a few bugs.  Weapons still fly out of your hand for no apparent reason.  The best strategy is usually to either flail about your weapon or to move to a decent spot to hit your enemy first.  As far as I can tell, having a shield is not very strategic.  Spear is kinda OP.  Really, it's just about having a long reach and being able to hit your enemy before they can hit you and not getting ganked from behind (like prison!).   \n\nSo this game can get repetitive.  Definitely a close call but I recommend even at $19.99.  But you may want to wait for sale if anything about the above bothers you.  It's mindless fun.

You won't find better melee anywhere else in VR.\n\nI've got to say, this game is already well-worth the money, and the dev isn't showing any signs of slowing down in content. This is gonna be a long one so buckle in, boys and girls.\n\nPros:\n\n- Unbelievably good melee combat that is leagues beyond the competition. There's such a variety of weapons and they all shine in their own ways (some more than others, admittedly) You didn't know how impactful VR could feel until you've beaten a guy to death with a rock or swung a flail as it dynamically crushes your opponants armour.\n\n- Plenty of content. The game has more of a \"sandbox\" feel to it than a campaign or anything. However, there is definitely already progression. You can unlock new weapons by defeating enemies in the arena (removing 5 hearts with a spear, for example) and you will also find your arena runs get progressively more challenging, unlocking bosses in a special \"challenge\" mode which is insanely fun.\n\n- Just as fun to watch as it is to play. This game isn't for the faint of heart though. Be very selective who you give a go of this game, because you really want your \"VR legs\" and good spacial awareness, otherwise you'll smash everything around you, including yourself. The trailer speaks for itself and it's no joke.\n\n- Incredibly immersive. At first you think \"wow, these gladiators look kinda dumb\" and similarly \"what the hell are those big-headed dudes in the crowd?\" but once you land your first punch, you'll be right at home. Enemies are dynamically injured, and their arnour is dynamically broken as well. You can remove limbs, tear off heads, impale hearts and shatter bones. Your enemies will still (try to) fight with those grusome wounds too.\n\n- \"Honest\" combat. Enemy attacks are somewhat predetermined, meaning they will usually swing their weapon in a variety of general directions. The beauty is how many variables affect their swings to make them all behave very differently. Your first time going up against a guy with a flail is terrifying, until he manages to knock himself out with the flail swinging above his head, which happens rarely enough to be hilarious every time.\n\n- Slow-mo. Let's face it, slow-mo combat always feels cool. So when you expertly parry their swing or land a headshot with an arrow, the triggered slow-mo not only feels great, but you can set up your next attack for some lethal combos.\n\n- Weapon variety. I mentioned this earlier, but weapons aren't just aesthetically different. Some weapons, such as swords or axes, can decapitate foes with lethal efficiency, but struggle to penetrate plate. However, hammers and flails can crush that plate or leave foes stunned, leaving those fleshy bits exposed for the kill. Spears can accurately penetrate gaps in armour and bleed your enemies out slowly. Bows and throwing knives can disable your enemies and pick them off from a distance. Shields are invaluable for dealing wtih bowmen or protecting your flank. Rocks smash faces. There's still many more weapons beyond that, too.\n\n- Multiple modes. Currently there is arena (typically for unlocking weapons, usually lasts a few waves), challenge (1v1 duels with some very intimidating bosses) and also endless mode (massacre as many people as possible and beat your high score) There are also many more modes currently being tested in experimental mode (which anyone can optionally access once they buy the game) but I'll just mention what's in the \"official\" version.\n\n- Variety of movement types. There are currently technically 3 types of movement (2 really) in the game, walking with the touchpads (HMD or controller facing) and GORN. The latter is definitely the way the game is supposed to be played, and looks fantastic when people get the hang of it, but I personally use the latter HMD walking. I find the GORN movement to be very difficult to use but have no serious problems with my own familiar movement method, though your combat potential is definitely higher using GORN movement since you can dash in before they can react.\n\n- Fantastic dev. This is probably the biggest positive to me. This dev is unbelievably responsive to the community. I have even spoke with Ruan a few times already regarding a few suggestions I had, and he took my feedback on board and had the one he liked on the \"experimental\" version within a couple of days! Somebody else, around the same time, said it would be cool to have an \"invincible\" mode where you can beat people up freely. \"Sure, added\" said the dev. Also on the experimental version already as I type this. In a world where the EA market is flooded with garbage and cash-grabs, this dev is like an oasis in the desert.\n\nCons:\n\n- The game really needs space. I hinted to this earlier, but you will need roomscale for this game. You will sweat and you will ache. The game recommends 2x2 metres to play. I currently play around 2.2x1.6, so not ideal. That being said, if you regularly check you are central to your playspace, you should be fine with around 1.5x1.5 (but bigger is always better). If you have less than that, you'd better be damn good at staying in the centre or you (and anyone near you) are gonna have a bad time.\n\n- Because of the last point and the sheer chaos the game can have going on sometimes, this game isn't something you'd give to someone who hasn't played VR before. If you want to risk it, make them wear the wristwraps and make sure they can hear you over the game volume (leave an earplug out or something) so you can guide them away from smashing your room apart when necessary.\n\n- The game still needs optimisation, as with most early access games. I run the game with a pretty good GPU (RX 480) and the game does run at a very good framerate usually. However, there are times when the framerate can chug quite hard, particularly when there's a lot of ragdoll physics going on (hitting a bunch of dudes with a greathammer, shattering multiple pieces of armour and sending blood and people flying everywhere) although these have been few and far between for me. Certainly hasn't impeded my enjoyment of the game too much, but worth mentioning still.\n\n- This game can be frustratingly hard or too easy sometimeas. Early on most people will probably find the game very easy, especially with cheese tactics, but difficulty can rise deceptively quickly once multiple enemies start showing up, especially when they wear armour. Sometimes you can feel like you just don't have the right weapons around to fight, as fighting an fully-armoured foes without a blunt weapon or an archer without a shield to block his arrows can feel like suicide. As you can only withstand two hits before you die (from any weapon, even fists) you really do have to be careful with the risks you take in combat.\n\n- Some weapons currently don't feel as fun as they should. This is mainly personal preference here. The rapier feels like it needs more range to get effective stabs without the player being too exposed to counterattacks. the nun-chucks are awesome (because they're damn nun-chucks) but there's no real reason to use them over other weapons, as they aren't particularly effective at damaging armour or breaking bones, yet suffer from a very low range (though they attack very fast to possibly make up for that.) Throwing knives are bloody hard to use, they're extremely cool and satisfying when you land one but definitely take lots of practise if you want those glorious headshot kills.\n\n- Glitchy (no way?!) Sometimes weapons feel kinda like they're inflatable (as they sometimes bend in weird ways to avoid clipping) but they feel too impactful and deadly to always feel like that. I personally find this compromise to be much better than magically clipping through everything constantly or the weapon \"seperating\" from you. Sometimes physics can \"break\" but usually the results are hilarious, not obnoxious.\n\nBuy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1501809937, "timestamp_updated": 1501810713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34003488": {"recommendationid": "34003488", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998336636", "num_games_owned": 719, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513113951}, "language": "english", "review": "Brutal, cartoonish gladiatorial combat in VR.

So when they have launched this already polished game (in Vr Standards *cough cough*) into Early Access, it gives me high hopes for the final product of the game.\n\nSome things I do hope they add are as follows\n- Arenas with obstacles\n- Possibly a leveling system\n- A way to purchase upgrades with gold awarded at the end of arena battles\n- CO-OP (please please please add this my lawrd)\n- Of course new enemies and weapons (they already mentioned adding this)\n\nSeriously though if you haven't purchased this game and own a Vive you are insane.\n", "timestamp_created": 1500563923, "timestamp_updated": 1500563923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33666873": {"recommendationid": "33666873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006832926", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504697303}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is brutally gory, and I LOVE IT and I need more... just a bite more gore.... \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1500535318, "timestamp_updated": 1500535318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33664708": {"recommendationid": "33664708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146090205", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1513974090}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely addictive game!

I figured it would be decent, as I was looking for a new VR distraction for the times I didn't feel like Elite or Bridge Crew - this fits the bill pretty well!  \n\nSome of the extened arena battles will have you work up a sweat, and the beauty of the VR is when you are engaged with 2 gladiators to the front, and mentally trying to recall at a feverish pace how much time you have to deal with them before the Bezerker that just entered the arena behind you turns you into a fine red paste on the arena sand.  Turn now....still have time...turn now...???  Ok maybe 5 more seconds...turn now...CRAP he's right there!   Classic moments.\n\nOccassionally I have tracking issues when I have to spend a lot of time turned directly away from the sensors, but that is more of a function of my layout I think than a shortfall of the game, but still.\n\nI am watching this one with interest and hope to see it continue to improve.  Solid entry for an EA game.  Recommended if you don't mind working up a bit of a sweat w/ your VR games.

Concept is pretty simple, they put you in an arena with CPU controlled fighters, give you a random selection of weapons to choose from, you salute the emperor (raise your hands) and then fight.  If you enjoyed Drunkn Bar Fight, this game does it MUCH better.\n\nDefault locomotion is done by clicking in the thumbsticks and \"pulling\" yourself across the ground.  There have been a lot of complaints about this movement style, so they have recently added free thumbstick locomotion.  I honestly prefer the default, classic GORN style of movement because it allows much faster and more agile movement, but to each his own.\n\nFighting is simple and intuitive.  Blunt objects stun enemies when hitting them on the head, and break armor quickly.  Slashing weapons (sword, axe) will sever unarmored limbs.  Stabby weapons (spear, dagger) will stun or insta-kill when stabbing someone in the chest or face.  Giant weapons require two hands but can knock people around the ring, easily break armor, and can stun regardless of armor.  But you already know this because that's what all these weapons would probably do in real life as well.\n\nStarting out, your choice of weapons is slim.  Unlocking new weapons is done through fulfilling objectives.  For example, killing 5 people with the mace unlocks a weapon, killing 5 people with that weapon unlocks another weapon, etc.  Some weapons are only unlocked by picking them off of a dead body and killing five people with that weapon (e.g. Sword is unlocked this way).  Eventually you will have a variety of weapons to choose from at the beginning of every fight, although that variety is random every time.  Sometimes you may not get your favorite weapon and have to make do with the choices you have.  This isn't particularly a bad thing, since sometimes you find out new ways to utilize a weapon you originally hated.  I hated the nunchucks at first, but after being forced to use them a few times, I found out they're exceptionally good for stunning enemies.\n\nAfter playing the normal game mode for a while, you unlock \"champion battle\", which is basically boss fights.  Currently there are only a few boss fights available, but once you finish them all, there is a sign on the door saying \"More coming soon\" (or something along those lines) so hopefully they add more of those because they were interesting.  One of the bosses even has a special move where he jumps at you through the air, wielding a two-handed warhammer.  I am really looking forward to more little AI routines like this one to spice up combat.\n\nI will admit that at first, I felt cautious about paying $15 for GORN.  At a glance it seems like there isn't much there, and that's not really an inaccurate observation.

Und das ganze macht ein riesen Spass!\n\nDas Game ist definitiv nichts f\u00fcr Kinder, das nicht nur das Blut in Str\u00f6men fliesst, sondern auch Organe (Herz) herausgerissen, Sch\u00e4del gespalten und K\u00f6rperteile abgetrennt werden k\u00f6nnen. Sogar das abreissen der K\u00f6rperteile ist m\u00f6glich. F\u00fcr Erwachsene bietet das Spiel aber immer mal wieder ein Gel\u00e4chter, wenn man einen Gladiator packt und dann gegen die anderen Gegner schleudert oder man mit ihnen \"den Boden aufnimmt\" ^^\n\nDas Handling f\u00fchlt sich intuitiv an, einzige Ausnahme bildet hier die Fortbewegung - die aber nach ein paar sekunden auch felsenfest sitzt und sich dann sogar recht witzig und passend anf\u00fchlt.\n\nZiel ist es, in der Arena vor Caesar gegen eine Menge Gladiatoren zu k\u00e4mpfen.\nNach ein paar Runden in der Arena kann man dann jeweils gegen einen Gegner antreten. Diese haben immer spezielle Schwachpunkte oder man muss sie speziell angehen. Zum Beispiel Achilles den man hald an einem bestimmten Punkt an seinem K\u00f6rper treffen muss - was ich ehrlichgesagt mega witzig fand. Oder Goliat der komplett Gepanzert daher kommt.\n\nKleine Erfolge sind ebenfalls mitdrin: Zwischen 5 und 10 t\u00f6tungen mit einer Speziellen Waffe - die man get\u00f6teten Gegner abnehmen kann - schaltet man die entsprechende Waffe frei und kann sie ab dann in der zum Start vorliegenden Waffenkammer selber ausw\u00e4hlen.\n\n\nNegativ aufgefallen ist eigentlich nicht wirklich was, man kassiert immer mal wieder einen Treffer ob wohl man geblockt hat, oder Gegner treffen einen einfach gar nicht. Aber diese Punkte sind nicht speziell erw\u00e4hnenswert, denn selbst wenn man selber zu Muus verarbeitet worden ist: Man ist so schnell wieder im Spiel - das dies definitiv zu vernachl\u00e4ssigen ist.\n\n\nZusammengefasst:\nMit Gorn erhaltet ihr ein Spiel das dich innert 10 - 15 Minuten klatsch nass macht weil du so schwitzt. Man kann richtig die Luft raus lassen, wenn man zu viel energie hat und es macht einfach unheimlich Spass, alles im Weg wegzukloppen.\nDie seltenen geblockten Treffer die trotzdem durchkommen sind nicht wirklich schlimm, da man sofort wieder in einem neuen Game ist, und weiterkloppen kann. Ein einfaches Spiel mit viel Humor das einem echt auspowern kann.\n\n10 von 10 Pixeln f\u00fcr ein VR Game.\nSo muss das!", "timestamp_created": 1500284085, "timestamp_updated": 1500284085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33600644": {"recommendationid": "33600644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065387876", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "last_played": 1514446661}, "language": "english", "review": "Things I've broken playing GORN\n>at least two lightbulbs\n>along with my cealing fan\n>one or two knuckles\n>my wall\n>my PC case\n>one of the fans in my PC\n>probaly both VIVE controlers\n>a drawer on my dresser\n>probaly a few other things\n\nAnd all this and I'm only 4 hours in.\nI don't regret a thing.", "timestamp_created": 1500267249, "timestamp_updated": 1500267249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499587", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33599479": {"recommendationid": "33599479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001874160", "num_games_owned": 658, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499740713}, "language": "english", "review": "Let my friend play\nWatched in horror as she smashed everything on my TV stand in a singularily devastating strike\nI play\nFurther destroy all that remained on my TV stand with a sick downward flail swing\nRIP TV.

If you've ever wanted to shout ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED to the crowds and give them the middle finger, this is also for you.\n\nGORN is the most mindless murderfest I've ever played.\n\nBuilt from the ground up for VR you can see how much attention the developers have put into this to make the physics feel like real combat physics. And the results speak for themselves. In this GORN you can't just wrist flick your fake VR sword quickly left and right to score hits like in other games, rather you have to swing each hit into position with force and precision.\n\nThe weapons feel just right, you swing a flail around in circles like you would in real life to get the momentum going then clobber some dude in the head and watch it explode. Eyeballs pop out, heads get sliced in half, this is brutal combat but in a ridiculously cartoony fashion. The spear actually feels like it has a long reach and you have strategically aim for his exposed chest or head depend which body part you feel like ripping off. If you got the sword and a shielded gladiator dude comes up, you can literally duck his attack and slice his legs in half.  Sword and shields combat has never felt so real.\n\nThis game is a must for VR,  but make sure you have lots of space in your room because i've had quite a few close hits with my TV etc. Also, this game is one hell of a sweaty workout I'd hate to think how knackered real gladiators got. \n\nDefinite positive, there's no other sword combat simulator that offers such an immersive physical experience.", "timestamp_created": 1500249258, "timestamp_updated": 1500249258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33595952": {"recommendationid": "33595952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182779627", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 95, "last_played": 1514675380}, "language": "english", "review": "Get it.

Good then look, you can read the rest of the review, I want you to, it took time to write after all, but you know what...just go buy the game, you will love it! \nI have always loved arena games from Shadow of Rome to the tiny arena mini-game in ps3\u2019s move sports and when I first stepped into VR my initial thought was \u201cThis needs an arena game!\u201d although there have been attempts at it this is the first one I have found hard to put down.\nHow hard to put down? Well in a live stream on Thursday I caught my knuckle on a table, blood everywhere (remember to clear your VR area folks) a few hours later despite not having full use of that finger I was back streaming for another 2-hour session. \nAt the end of every game of it, I am drenched in sweat (and my \u201cday\u201d job means I am an active person no couch potato here) so it also doubles as a fitness game.\n\n[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT / GRAPHICS[/b]\n The arena is a fair size and you have to love the giant heads watching you lol, the actual art style is leaning towards cartoony, teamfortress 2 like (again not for kids) with some really well-done gore effects (they are deeply impressive) \nThe weapons have some bizarre qualities (almost rubbery at times, until you use them) which adds to the game, it is amusing to hold a spear one handed and seeing it flop limp like a flaccid ...well ok you can see where that analogy is going ;) (remember this game is not for kids ...neither is this review) \nWhile some would argue that they may wish to see new arenas, personally I feel the one we have is perfect for this game.\n\n\n[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] \n[strike]I have had moments where the physics have wigged out and things have flown strangely or stretched out, mostly this is a cause of amusement (though often resulting in your in-game death) but on rare occasions, it has caused the frame rate or game to freeze for a few seconds. This, however, is rare and the game recovers beautifully from it.\nThe only other issue is that in the latest build I lost the ability to loose arrows, instead, they drop to the floor, an issue I hope the developer notes and fixes soon (is reported)[/strike]\n***UPDATE 25/10/17*** Performance is near perfect now and the bow issue is fixed\n\n[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] \nYou beat them to death before they beat you to death\u2026.I mean it is fairly intuitive.\nThe one downside is that whenever you load it your movement is defaulted to arm swing motion (a god awful movement system where you hold the touchpad and swing your arm to move) and you have to make your way to the options board to set it to the better touchpad locomotion (The dev clearly loves arm swing motion and it did take persuading for us to get an option added). \n\n[b]PROS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] Very addictive\n[*] You can tear off a man\u2019s arm and beat him to death with it.\n[*] you can kneel down and stick a finger up at an enemy that has no arms, one leg and its rolling towards you with menace. (yep Monty python jumps to my mind to, Tis but a flesh wound)\n[*] A good sense of progression, unlocking new weapons by using the others a certain amount of times, enemies get harder and you unlock bosses.\n[*] A developer that listens to his users (so long as you are not asking for new movement...though even there he did listen after a while) and adds things in like demo mode so your mates can try the game without having to face the waves of now peeved, leveled enemies who are waiting for you to log back in so they can have a quiet word about how you pulled their mate George\u2019s head off and bashed in Fred's skull with it.\n[*] An endless mode that is a see how long you can last type deal where the enemies get steadily better equipped (best mode in the game in my opinion)\n[*] Strange and challenging Boss fights (with the tease that more will be added)\n[*] You WILL get a good workout if played properly.\n[*] I guarantee there will at least one moment where you pull off something so amazing that you will wish you were recording \n[*] More than fair price.\n[*] ***UPDATE 25/10/17*** rabid badgers....one of the bosses has rabid badgers\n[/list]\n\n[b]CONS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] [strike]The bow bug, it is really annoying and the developer seems to be ignoring it or not responding on topics about it. [/strike]***UPDATE 25/10/17 this is not an issue anymore***\n[*] The endless mode has to be unlocked and yet is the most fun mode.***UPDATE 25/10/17*** When additional bosses are added you lose access to endless mode, endless mode, endless mode remains my favourite mode and it was frustrating to find it locked out.\n[*] [strike]Certain weapons like the throwing knives(awesome weapon) do not appear in Endless mode[/strike] ***UPDATE 25/10/17 They do now so ignore this***\n[*] If you are not physically fit or not into getting a workout this may not be for you.\n[*] Can get VERY hard.\n[*] Explaining to a mate on the phone how you threw the throwing knife into one guy's head while bashing the skull in of a guy with a mace still clutched in the hands of his friends severed arm, will get you strange looks from other people on the bus no matter how quiet you talk\u2026.I dread to think what government watch lists I may be on due to my gaming habits. \n[/list]\n\n[b]VIDEO:[/b]\nThis is one of those games where video does not do it justice, that said here is a tiny clip (you can find full videos of it on my twitch channel, should you wish to)\n\nhttps://clips.twitch.tv/OutstandingAbstruseMushroom4Head\n\n\n[b]VERDICT[/b] \n\nOwn VR?

The night ended with my eyes burning from the profuse sweat i had started producing and I decide even the best gladiators need sleep so i proceeded to get some rest.\n\nDay2: After the intense combat of day 1 i felt like i had been hit by a train, but the arena called to me. I started carving my way through the meat sacks once again, facing harder and harder rounds each time. Instead of trying to please the crowd, i now have a deep seeded hatred for them and their \"king\" and i use that hatred and anger to fuel my berserk fighting rampages. once again i have ended the night drenched in sweat and will likely be unable to move tomorrow.\n\nOverall this has to be one of the best vr games in existence.

Some small bugs like enemies glitching around the map and somehow hitting you.  (While very funny, it is still a bug)\n\n2. Movement system doesn't fit all people.

Throw a robot in the air, teleport over to where he'll land, and take his head off with a shotgun? Totally. Rip a head off, and use it to complete the whole level. Totally. Phyisics are a big part of making all of that feel right, and Gorn recaptures that feeling for me. In regards to bringing be back again and again, it supercedes Roborecall, and there is still more content to come. There are only two things I can think of, that I hope get adressed. There are physics bugs (that end up just being funny), but there are also camera bugs. Seeing the world spining out from beneath you can be disorienting, but that's something I have to immagine will be adressed. The second thing is pretty oculus exclusive. I have ok 360 tracking, but I have very little room behind me. This leads to me circling the arena trying to keep everything in front of me. If they added the ability to turn the camera 180 degrees, it would make it a lot friendlier to Oculus users or anyone with room constaraints.

Instead of memorizing attack animations and learning when to swing where as you will in numerous other games, GORN will have you actually parry, move, and strike in a very natural way.\n\nThe realistic nature of a physics-based combat system contrasts starkly with the humorous style the game presents through the condescending caricatures of onlookers above the arena, the wobbly movements of your enemies, the rubbery flexible nature of the shafts of all the weapons, and the wonderful showers of blood and gore the game offers. The result is a masterpiece that takes the right things seriously, and makes light of all the rest.\n\nI strongly recommend this game to anyone who has sufficient space to play it. There are some caveats though -- first off, it is worth reiterating you NEED proper space to play this game. If you have a crowded VR space with lots of fragile objects, children/pets who may enter your gaming area while you are playing, or an aversion to sweating profusely, this game may not be ideal for you. Be aware that no matter how effectively you've managed to avoid hitting things while playing other games, GORN has a strong potential to change that. The trailer is not a joke.\n\nTwo interesting design choices that stood out to me in this game that I think are worth addressing beyond the physics-based combat are movement and the flexible weapon shafts.\n[list]\n[*] Movement\nGORN uses an arm-swinging movement mechanic that will leave you feeling far less fast and mobile than most other melee combat VR games. You will rely on your roomscale space more than you do in other games as a result of this, so make sure you have plenty of space. This also makes it feel like you really need to fight to survive, running is not a very viable strategy.\n\n[*] Flexible weapon shafts\nA problem that plagues all VR melee combat games is the cheesy \"wiggling\" tactics to kill enemies. If you've played a lot of the other offerings out there, you have almost certainly encountered this. GORN solves this problem completely with the rubbery weapon shafts as damage seems to be based on the momentum of the weapon when it hits the enemy. If you wiggle the weapon around without committing to a proper swing, it is not going to kill anything.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1499890971, "timestamp_updated": 1499890971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33487766": {"recommendationid": "33487766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099283936", "num_games_owned": 693, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1514000392}, "language": "english", "review": "You don't see any negative reviews and that's because this game is polished and amazing.\n\nMy favorite part is not even the controller swinging combat, it's being able to pick up an opponent and literally rip him apart.

This game is great for everyone and will not dissapoint. But it now before the developers smarten up and start charging a lot more like many other high priced games on vive run.\n\nP.S.

Beating a horde of brawny dickheads requires a great amount of skill, rather than just flailing around. It's also the first VR game I've played that implements a really fluid, non-sickening method of walking around at a good pace. It opens up the arena to be your playground.\n\nHowever, like others have said, it does carry a heightened risk of punching out any nearby furniture. But it's worth it. Use the walk mechanic to keep control of your position and you'll be fine. I haven't hit anything yet. My sister-in-law punched me first go, but that was my fault ;)\n\nHighly recommend.

It's not perfect, but it has potential to be a real contender for the standard in VR melee.\n\nGorn, as of the moment (Early Access), is an arena fighter where you're some Roman gladiator or some shit. Locomotion is kind of strange - you swing your arms while alternating touch pad presses, as if you were climbing a ladder on the ground (H3VR does something similar for the challenge course things it has). Either hand is open and closes with a trigger pull, or you can invert it with the menu button and open on click instead, which is useful for using weapons.\n\nHand to hand combat is the focus, and it's pretty good. The game utilizes physics to judge the strength of your attacks, so there's a different between jabs and swings, pokes and slams. I think it's better to list what you can do than just outline it.\n\nYou can:\n[list][*]Punch\n[*]Rip off heads and arms\n[*]Swing or toss said parts\n[*]Pick up and use bodies as shields, or throw them\n[*]Swing swords and axes (chopping off parts or cutting heads in half)\n[*]Smash armor and shields with hammers, morning stars and maces (armor flies off as if Guts\u2122 smashed a dude)\n[*]Use two handed weapons like war hammers, giant morning stars and spears (and puck out hearts with a poke)\n[*]Attach throwing knives to one arm for quick distance attacks\n[*]Use a bow and arrow\n[*]Parry strikes with a weapon to slow time down\n[*]Nunchaku bro\n[*]Use a shield and bash someone's face in with it\n[*]Flip off the emperor[/list]\n\nMost weapons are things you have to unlock doing challenges, like killing with certain weapons or a particular way. Enemies are all the same aside from different armored bits and different weapons. Weapons determine how the enemies attack you, but they are all sort of dumb grunts that move in to strike you, which is fine for this game (though they will probably need harder enemies or a harder mode down the line).

I had a few minutes of fun, and I could see how some people could really enjoy this for hours, the weapons are varied, some of the mechanics in the game are polished etc...  But this is definitely not for everyone.  Overall I just couldn't get over the feeling of how sloppy and unfinished everything felt to me, was not expecting that after hearing about this game for most of the past year.  The combat felt better than any other melee VR game due to great collisions and random attacks of enemies, but still not very engaging since usually you can just race up to someone and smash them in the head or take advantage of their stupidity otherwise.  An improvement over other melee games, but we still have a long way to go in this regard.the enemies movements almost felt too random and/or predictable and random... hard to explain..  Just was not fun to me.  Graphics are consistent and stylized but didn't keep my attention, the goofy animations are supposed to be funny and allow for the rediculous ragdoll but it didn't sit right with me, didn't hold my attention.  Sound seemed good, flailing a morningstar over my head was epic, but the flashes of fun will not be enough to keep me coming back to this one.  Unfortunately I could already tell I wouldn't load it up again after the half hour I played  =(\n\nSorry to give it a negative review, I know it's got a lot of hype right now, but I just didn't find it fun.

It is so much fun and it goes to show you how much a really good mechanic can drive a game, and provide many hours of fun. However I do have one gripe with the game so far.\n\nThe \"story\" mode is quite good right up until you defeat the last boss (at the time of this writing). After the last boss the main event starts to feel too long. The game starts you out in an arena with one naked dude to fight fisticuffs style. And as you get more kills with certain weapons you'll unlock more weapons to play with. That is great, and I love it. But after you fight the final boss (btw, we totally need the ability to re-play bosses, they are some of the most fun fights in the game) suddenly you're fighting crowds of 30+ fully armed and armored men. Just when you think you're done more enemies come out, and even though the mechanics are great, eventually you're going to take a hit no matter how good you are. And that leads to some frustration as weapon unlock requirements only count once you've finished an arena wave. Which means that the 10 minutes you spent killing through 30+ dudes only to have a door open behind your back and get sucker punched to death is all for waste. \n\nIf I had to make a suggestion it would be to up the requirements to unlock weapons (ex. instead of 10 sword kills to unlock the bow make it 25), but make the kills count even if you fail a match. I believe that would take a lot of the frustraton out of the end-game. Plus weapon unlocks are a little too easy anyway, it feels like they are given away like candy. There is nothing wrong with having to work for rewards a little.\n\nBut despite that one gripe, the game is incredible, and I can't wait to see where the devs take it!", "timestamp_created": 1499714659, "timestamp_updated": 1499714875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33438597": {"recommendationid": "33438597", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977336122", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500050432}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay.

This is probably my favorite VR game and my go to when I put the HMD on.  I've been playing it for free but I'm not checking the box because I play to pay money for the game in some regard.  That's how much I appreciate the game.  The physics are on point, the challenge has been upped well in the later game.

[Smashed noses with eyes hanging out made me kill the guy extra fast :)]\n-Humor is well done, the crowd is fun.\n-Active developers\n-Fun way to exercise.  I'm gonna go buy wrist weights\n-Replayability because the gameplay is just fun.\n-There's more but my brain isn't working right now, just buy it for goodness sake\n\nCons\n\n-With tons of limbs getting blown off, and armor physics and enemies, sometimes framerate drops to where it's annoying and the physics act funny.\n-The weapon wabble affects my swing to where weapons like the ax and sword twist causing mis-hits.\n-[This is half con and half compliment] The game is so fun, immersive and exciting that if you get too far immersed, you can easily swing outside of your play area, which cost me a controller :(.  I corrected this by having a physical object in my play space and tried to keep a foot touching it so I couldn't reach out of my space.\n\nGet this game, you'll appreciate it.

The developers are nice and constantly updating the experimental version of the game, their dedication is truly inspiring and model to what VR early access should be. The game is not perfect by any means; it's ridiculously easy and nausiating for many people. Gorn's lack of a teleport function is truly dissapointing as I seriously have fallen in love and want everyone to be able to play the game at it's best; when you're running around the arena beating the ever violent crap out of some brutes. Though the lack of a teleport function leaves a aserious majority of players from not being able to play very much if at all. Other than that; the game doesn't run amazingly well at times. Making custom games where you're slaughtering left and right, frame by frame movies where the main chracter can't attack for shit.\n\nOn the upside, this still has the best melee combat in a vr game, it's not realistic but I never felt like i was wacking at an object until it fell down. Some may complain that the game is just another VR game where you can just flail around. While this is true; part of VR is role-playing in the world you're set in.

The cartoon-like cel-shaded graphics are quaint, yet impressive, helping to take away from some of the horror that would otherwise come with hacking off limbs and bashing in heads.\n\nRead the rest of my review here - https://www.pocket-lint.com/ar-vr/reviews/143159-gorn-vr-review-hilarity-and-brutality-abound", "timestamp_created": 1514891694, "timestamp_updated": 1514891694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38965295": {"recommendationid": "38965295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051387528", "num_games_owned": 498, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 99, "last_played": 1515790456}, "language": "english", "review": "Every time I start the game I begin singing \"Hooked on a Feeling\".\n\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1514880705, "timestamp_updated": 1514880705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38963479": {"recommendationid": "38963479", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987136569", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514822923}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "VR\u780d\u6bba\u904a\u6232\u7684\u5178\u7bc4\n\u6c92\u6709\u4e4b\u4e00\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u76f4\u89ba\u6613\u4e0a\u624b\n\u6253\u64ca\u611f\u6975\u5f37\n\u9664\u4e86\u6b66\u5668\u592a\u8edf \u8b93\u523a\u64ca\u578b\u6b66\u5668\u4e0d\u592a\u597d\u767c\u63ee\u4ee5\u5916\n\u5e7e\u4e4e\u662f\u76ee\u524dVR\u6700\u597d\u904a\u6232\u793a\u7bc4\n\u76ee\u524d\u55ae\u6a5f\u6a21\u7d44\u9084\u4e0d\u592a\u6709\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u554f\u984c \n\u53ef\u4ee5\u8003\u616e\u52a0\u5165\u9023\u7dda\u529f\u80fd\u8b93\u5927\u5bb6\u4e00\u8d77\u5edd\u6bba", "timestamp_created": 1514874748, "timestamp_updated": 1514874748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38962970": {"recommendationid": "38962970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073982998", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "last_played": 1514870314}, "language": "english", "review": "so i'm changing my review, so I think it's still a really fun game, i'd still recomend it.\nit does however, have the issue that the game doesn't get harder as you progress, it just gets harder to enjoy progressing.\nwhat i mean by that, when you get to like 30 rounds in or so, it'll start spawning horrific amounts of enemies, (like 30 or more in total) and all fully clad in armor and with shields, which on my system makes the framerate go to shit, but that aside, it makes it pretty much unplayable, because you have no where you can run, so you end up just grabbing onto the most OP weapon you can find (the war hammer) backing into a corner, and swinging around wildly hoping it'll glitch out and kill some dudes, so you'll be able to continue.\nit'd be MUCH more fun if it spawned in a cap of about 8 or less enemies in the arena at once, and then gave them unique skills or armor (like the bosses have crazy abilities and armor, give the grunts some better armor, or skills) that way, as you learn new skills in playing the game, you get to apply them in really dodging, then swinging back, then running, etc, rather than what you have to do now which is cower in a corner from the 40 fucking dudes all fully clad in black armor, here to smother you with thier many flails.\nTL/DR: it's a fun game but it needs a LOT of work with arena fighting, which is really what the game is made for, so i wouldn't recommend it unless it's on sale for at least 50% off, or untill they've made the arena fighting really more challenging and fun, rather than increasingly overbearing and annoying.", "timestamp_created": 1514873016, "timestamp_updated": 1515048805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38960415": {"recommendationid": "38960415", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970397001", "num_games_owned": 904, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1515456535}, "language": "english", "review": "Burned 1000 calories my first play session like it was nothing.

I have a huge library, but this is now one of my top go-to's for party games and VR demo.\n\nNo complex story, but graphics are strong for the cartoon vibe, and the gameplay is surprisingly addictive and even the same army of bad guys plays out differently match to match. Good replayability.\n\nHaven't played the game terribly long, but in the time I have thus far, I play match after match, slowly unlocking new weapons, that require different techniques, but come with hilariously bloody outcomes. Bad guys do come in variety, in terms of what weapons they use, and how much armor they have. After enough arena matches you get to do champion/boss fights in a sense. My last (and only thus far) was a guy in golden decked armor with a sword, and no known weaknesses. Was a good fight, ended up stabbing him through the face in what little exposed flesh his helmet afforded.\n\nI could play this game quite a bit, and am getting quite a workout. \n\nI know my friends will appreciate this everytime they come over, and it will be fun to watch their shenanigans on the big screen (duplicated on the monitor).\n\nOnly wish they truly had a greater variety of bad guy skins, and perhaps different arenas. Also, it's a bit odd, that there's some voice acting involved, but mostly I never hear it, and only have the text to read. They should add a little more. \n\nStill, well worth the sales price I got it for ($15).", "timestamp_created": 1514856493, "timestamp_updated": 1514856493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38955827": {"recommendationid": "38955827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113685569", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1515733523}, "language": "english", "review": "Such an amazing game!

This is Gorn.\n\nOne of my favorite VR titles, it\u2019s actually one the games that made me want to buy a HMD in the first place.  It might not be for everyone, especially for those who play VR to relax.  But if you\u2019re looking to de-stress by participating in pure, unadulterated, mindless violence, and you have the play space required, you should definitely give it a try!\n\n[h1] Warnings: [/h1] \n\n[b] Physically Demanding, Large Play Area Required, User Health Hazard, Innocent Bystander Health Hazard, Pet Hazard, Furniture & Electronics Hazard, Just be careful...[/b]\n\n[h1] Audio/Visual/Performance: [/h1]\n\nThe art sort of reminds me of Borderlands without the comic-style black outline around the characters.  Enemies are big, muscle bound, ragdoll-like characters, and the spectators are giant floating heads that judge your every move from the stands above the arena.\n\nAs far as sound, the sound effects are great but everything else ultimately feels a little lacking.  The developers might have done it on purpose but there\u2019s no music whatsoever, there\u2019s also little variety when it comes to enemy taunts.  You\u2019re basically beating your enemies to a pulp with your bare hands to the sound of spectators murmuring above you.  You honestly stop noticing as soon as you begin fighting but it would be nice to have a little background music.\n\nThe combat is physics-based (is that a thing?), meaning the harder you swing your arm, the harder you\u2019ll hit your enemy.  I think that\u2019s probably why this game works so well.  Yes, the weapons are rather wobbly, like they\u2019re made out of rubber, but that\u2019s the only way it would work in a game like this.  There\u2019s a great feeling of satisfaction that comes from watching the enemy\u2019s head fly across the map because you tore it clean off his body with one powerful swing.  As opposed to other games where it registers a \u201chit\u201d and the death is animated.  These characters are ALWAYS governed by physics, you can see them struggling to even move, sometimes they may even trip over their own feet (which is hilarious).  It isn\u2019t perfect however, sometimes you may hit an enemy in such a way that makes him glitch out and explode, sometimes resulting in a game crash.  But it\u2019s so worth it.\n\n[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]\n\nPlease, please, please make sure you have enough space around you and the play area is clear of obstacles (and people) before playing.  Do not let go of your controllers and make sure your Chaperone bounds are properly calibrated.  Otherwise, you may hurt yourself and/or others.\n\nYou begin the game in the lobby.  Here you can pick your game modes and change your settings (there are several locomotion settings for those who experience motion sickness).  You can also participate in trials and pick special weapons to fight with as you unlock them.\n\nOnce you step out into the arena, weapons will spawn in front of you and you can pick which one to start with.  There are lots of weapons you can use but there won't be many, if at all, on your first game.  As you complete challenges with certain weapons, you will unlock more and these will be randomly spawned every time you begin a new match.  Once you pick a weapon, you need to raise your arms to salute the emperor and begin.  The remaining weapons will disappear in a puff of smoke and the gate will be lowered.  If you wish to start off with more than one weapon, you may pick another with your off-hand.  Also, if you want to keep all of them just pick them up and drop them on the ground.  They will remain when the match starts and they\u2019ll de-spawn over time.\n\nYou're a gladiator.  Your only task is to step into the arena and be the last one standing.  Once the gate is lowered you may begin slaughtering your enemies.  As you defeat them, more will come out of the gates around the arena.  Note that you can drop your weapons at any time and beat them with your fists or their own weapons.  You can even tear them apart limb from limb and beat their fellow comrades with their dismembered bodies.  If you pick a bow, spectators will periodically throw arrows into the arena that you can use in case you run out.\n\nIf you\u2019re hit by an enemy, your sight will slowly fade out as your health depletes and eventually die.  However, if you kill an enemy before this, you'll gain a second wind regain consciousness.  Please note that while you may be able repeat this process multiple times, every time you\u2019re hit your health will deplete faster and faster.\n\nWhen the match is finished, spectators will throw coins at you and the emperor will ask you to salute him to end the game.  If you look directly under him, you'll notice a board that displays any challenges you made progress on or completed.  You may now salute him to return to the lobby and begin again to complete more challenges.\n\nAs you complete challenges you may unlock new weapons, as you unlock new weapons you unlock trials for that weapon.  You may also unlock new game modes and bosses that will in turn, unlock special weapons when defeated.\n\n[h1] Game Modes: [/h1]\n\n[b] Endless: [/b] Here you compete against endless waves of enemies.  You begin this mode with no weapons and must acquire them through combat.  Once you defeat 15 enemies in this mode, you will unlock Custom mode.\n\n[b] Bosses: [/b] As you defeat bosses, you may unlock special weapons that you can enable to start the match with on Regular, Endless, and Custom mode.\n\n[b] Weapon Trials: [/b] You can also participate in trials for specific weapons, you basically pick a weapon and see how many enemies you can defeat with that weapon.  You may access these in the lower levels as you unlock new weapons.\n\n[b] Custom: [/b]  Once you defeat 15 enemies in Endless mode, you may take the elevator down to the lowest level to access this mode.  There are several settings you can experiment with like enemy or player size, enemy aggression, the amount of gore, a free-for-all mode, etc.\n\n[h1] Multiplayer: [/h1]\n\nGorn features local multiplayer.  You can play with up to four players, with or against the VR player as a gladiator.  You may press start on any controller connected to to the computer while on Custom to activate multiplayer mode.  The controls take a bit to get used to but it\u2019s great fun.  They also feature a \u201cParty Mode\u201d which I haven\u2019t tested as of this time.\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts: [/h1]\n\nLet\u2019s face it, this game does not need another positive review.  I think was a soaring success as a prototype on itch.io way before it released on steam.  But it\u2019s one of my favorite games on VR so I think it\u2019s only fair I give it proper review.  It honestly does not offer much in terms of story, but this game is amazingly fun, and engaging.  You\u2019ll end up sweating buckets in mere minutes as you slaughter all your enemies,  I could not recommend it more.  Just make sure you have plenty of space around you, the original trailer does not lie.\n\n[b] *This review is based on my personal experience with the game at its current state (date of review or last edit), and may be edited in the future as I play more and/or the game is updated.* [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1516730448, "timestamp_updated": 1516731690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39560833": {"recommendationid": "39560833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043779038", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511033540}, "language": "english", "review": "Action packed and gory.

Before starting the battle you must salute the emperor (holding your right arm up), I liked this, it's a nice touch to give you that VR feel, upon winning you must hold both hands up and cheer which is also a nice touch. After winning about 5 games you can face a champion, I can not remember how many there were but I do believe there are more upcoming in an update coming soon (surely?).\n\n\n[b] Combat [/b] - Well this was....An experience, a bloody good one, no pun intended ofcourse. You can slice heads off, arms off, anything you wish you can even knock out their eye! Combat feels nice and the weaepons handle nicely but a lot more work needs doing on 2 handed weapons as they can be really awkward. Gore makes this game because it adds a whole repelayability feature on its own, I had a great time tearing heads off other gladiators like a true barbarian and I swear I am not crazy, (I am) but I love tearing people's hearts out with a spear (after swearing at the pain of using a 2 handed weapon!). I was'nt a great fan on the idea that you only have 1 hit until a small off screen timer starts in which you will black out until you kill someone, failing to do so is game over.\n\n\n[b] Movement [/b] - I just have to point out, do locomotion although the developers method of moving is creative it's highly inpractical and just does not feel natural.\n\n\n[b] The games biggest let down [/b] - They did something that I really respect because few developers shy away from the feature of gore, but thats it unfortunatley gore makes this game, if it was just a bit of blood this game ewould be nothing, sadly I feel there could be more especially since I beat all the champions in almost a day, infinite mode just isn't enough to make you want to play regulary, maybe a co op mode or versus mode online could change this?\n\nGameplay - 2.5/5.\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\n\nSmooth well optimised, you really don't feel the screen door effect it's sharp everywhere you look\n\nGraphics - 4/5.\n\nPrice - \u00a311\n\n\u00a311 is what I paid and my advice to you would be wait for a sale, the games great fun but after a while you may go back to it here and there.\n\nValue for money - 2 out of 5\n\nThis is hard for me, I want to say yes I recommend this game but at the same time theres more work needed, hey Steam wheres that neutral button?! It is fun but they need to find a formula for replayability as I always say about games, nothing will ever be a perfect game, but a damn good one makes you come back for more. wonderfully optimised, GORE GORE GORE! I may of been a bit harsh in some senses because this game really has come a long way, just needs to keep heading in the right direction\n\nThings I liked:\nGOOOOORRRREEEEE\nOptimisation\nGeneral feel of most weapons are spot on\n\nThings I didn't like\nVoice acting was just simply looked over\n2 handed weapons\nLack of replayability\nNo achievments or cards?! \n\n\nOverall rating - 2.5/5 \n\nSpoiler alert:  [spoiler] I don't think I have ever used the word gore so much, ever.

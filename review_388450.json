You can play either untimed or timed (easy or hard).  As you play along you can purchase items to decorate the outside of your house and those are your bonuses and upgrades.  Sometimes you only have enough money to choose between two available bonuses and have to think about your decision.\n\nWhat makes this game fun for me are the special helpful items that appear when you match 4 or 5.  There are several different ones you could get and it seems to be random.  They could be really helpful in your situation or not much, but it's fun to get the big pumpkin bomb that destroys all blocks in a square around it!  \n\nThere are also helpful items that you have at the bottom of the screen and need to be charged slowly after you use them.  I try not to use them because that's the way I like to play.  They are things like a hammer to get rid of stone blocks, a duster to get rid of the webbed blocks, etc.  \n\nEach level has different goals.  It could be to match a certain number of frogs or ghosts or whatever.  There are also gold and silver tiles that you have to match over to break them up.  Occasionaly there are giant skulls that you have to get to fall off the bottom of the screen by making matches under them.  THere is a nice variety that keeps it from getting boring.\n\nGraphics are good, Music and effects are okay (I especially love the splat sound of the pumpkin bomb!).\n\nThere are achievements and trading cards!\n\nAnd it has frogs!

This town has been haunted by an evil vampiress who is the cause of the strange things happening. It is up to you to take out the vampiress in various parts of Old Town by navigating the 100 levels of board matching 3s of candles, toads, cats, skulls and other enemies. Matching more than 3 of a kind results in bonus powerups that can be used to eliminate enemies on the board. Coins randomly come down to the board that will come in handy as part of the game\u2019s currency.\n\nThe Old Town is divided into several sectors that eventually lead to the final section, which is the crypt, the residence of the evil vampiress. There are powerups to purchase from an elderly shopkeeper who is relying on you to rid Old Town of its evil. The powerups can be upgraded over time as you accumulate more gold throughout each board level. You can also purchase decorations for the house that act as powerups of their own that make you more powerful as you progress through the town. Powerups lead to more explosions that will eliminate more enemies from the board. For example, a pumpkin appears after matching 4 of a kind in the early levels. Moving the pumpkin in any direction will cause an explosion that will eliminate several enemies on the board. Upgrading the pumpkin from purchasing a house decoration will increase its explosion radius. Other nice powerups that appear on the board from matching more than 3 of a kind include silver bullets, holy water, and garlic bombs. There are 6 powerups at the bottom of the screen that can be used to quicken the pace and each can be upgraded to level 3 for greater effects.\n\nThis game is like other games with boards that require matches of 3s such as Bejeweled, Candy Crush Saga, and other casual games. However, Spooky Bonus does not challenge you like other casual games in that you cannot make a wrong move. There are two modes, including the Relaxed mode and the Timed mode. The Relaxed mode allows you to take your time to make the necessary matches to complete the level. The UI shows you how many of each kind you must eliminate to complete the level. The Time mode includes an hourglass indicating how much time you have remaining before you fail the level. However, this is as challenging as the game gets. Typically, matching games will challenge you to make a limited number of moves before failure. Therefore, this game is as casual as it gets for a matching game.\n\nThe graphics are nice to look at, but nothing extraordinary or demanding which is no surprise for an indie and casual game. The audio sounds realistic with the music constantly sounding appropriate for a horror themed game, as it is well composed. The explosions also sound appropriate according to the explosion of the powerup upon moving it left, right, up, or down.\n\nI think Spooky Bonus is a fun game for everyone because it is entertaining without being too challenging or frustrating. Hardcore Bejeweled fans may find this game not challenging enough because there are unlimited moves for each level. The greatest challenge is the timed mode, but there are still unlimited moves. I recommend Spooky Bonus for its entertainment value more than for its challenge value. It is a nice job by indie developer Grey Alien Games.\n\nMy Score: 7.5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1477539046, "timestamp_updated": 1477539046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26197800": {"recommendationid": "26197800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047847143", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477312647}, "language": "english", "review": "https://youtu.be/dvwLCE6_Zvw \n\nLovely Halloween match 3 game!

Well, it starts off easy enough. At the higher levels, it can be very challenging.  Basically, you match the spooky symbols in threes or more to collect gold and complete goals.  Pretty standard, really.  However, this game is not about points.  There is gold in the game which can be used to buy special perks.  This game is not about gold, either.  These special perks are very much needed in timed mode to reach the goals in time.  Usually, goals are match X of this symbol or clear all gold background tiles or drop Y skulls to the bottom of the board..  It tells you how many are left, which is nice.  This game is about meeting all goals to move on to the next level.  This is where the puzzle part of the matching comes into play.\n\nTIles can be stone (need one or two matches right next to it which breaks the stone), or it can a web (match the tile under the web in a match or more to remove the web), have a gold background (match it once to collect the gold), or it can have a metal plate (requires two matches - one turns it into gold, the next collects the gold).  The gold buys powerups which can have special effects (exploding an area, exploding in a cross pattern, damaging a whole row, clearing webs in a pattern, breaking stone tiles in a pattern, etc).  These powerups are critically important.  They take time to charge up, so they are used sparingly.  However, they are necessary to use in timed mode to complete the board in time.  It's a little bit of mental planning and a lot bit of keeping track of the board.  Matching four or more can generate special items, and this is also dependant on the special perks you buy.  The game is paced so pretty much you can buy every special perk when it becomes available (some require building up gold for a couple of levels).\n\nI played this for quite some time when I sit down to play it.  It is very addicting.  The dev has two other \"bonus\" games that are not on Steam, so feel free to express interest in getting those here if you like this game.

The game was developed with Blitz Max.\"\n\n1. Does not run on the Unity Engine! YES!\n2. Playstyle is like the Puzzle Quest (MPQ) or Bejeweled match-3 style.\n3. Can make match 4, 5, etc. 'L' and 'T' shapes, etc. Sometimes tiles need unlocking, etc.\n4. Don't have to wait for the board to settle before making your next move.\n5. The special power tiles that appear on the board you only have to click or drag them to activate. (Doesn't have to be part of a 'matching' movement).\n6. Game can be played in 'timed' mode for more of a challenge, or not, for a more casual feel.\n\nThe music is decent, in fact I turned the sound effect volume down a bit and put the music to maximum. (In comparison I play MPQ with both music and sound effects disabled).\n\nSo far I have played up to level 20 and being a veteran to the genre I have not had any issues. The gold I have collected so far has been enough to buy all the items I have unlocked so far.  I have only played each level once, so have not had to grind at all. There is apparently 100 levels in total.\n\nUsually each level will involve either collecting enough tiles of a certain type, or clearing a specific set of tiles on the board. The 'specific set of tiles' clearing is similar in playstyle to the \"7 Wonders: Treasures of Seven\" match-3 game (without the rotating board though).\n\nOverall this game is an enjoyable experience for beginner or veteran match-3 players and is an excellent starting point for anyone that wants to get into the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1467789829, "timestamp_updated": 1467884019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23915521": {"recommendationid": "23915521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202977918", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475815937}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306a\u30de\u30c3\u30c13\u3002\n\u3084\u308a\u3053\u307f\u8981\u7d20\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u30011\u5468\u3057\u305f\u3089\u3082\u3046\u3044\u3044\u304b\u306a\u3001\u3068\u3044\u3046\u611f\u3058\u3002\n\n\u30bb\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u7279\u5225\u5b89\u304b\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3059\u308c\u3070\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1467178078, "timestamp_updated": 1467178078, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23839525": {"recommendationid": "23839525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049234678", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467371149}, "language": "czech", "review": "Jednoduch\u00e1 \"spoj 3\" hra s hororov\u00fdm/halloweensk\u00fdm n\u00e1m\u011btem.

Then I saw Spooky Bonus and I knew I had to get it, since I am a fan of Spooky/Halloween themed games.\n\nIt shows inspiration from Bejeweled, but it does not out-right copy it, like other Match three games I've seen being sold on Steam and elsewhere.\n\nSpooky Bonus brings in different mechanics and puzzle pieces that keep the gameplay fresh and interesting, it increases the challenge as your progress. It also brings to you a fantastic art-style and a great soundtrack. You even have a button to change your current desktop wallpaper to the background art of each region of Old Town.\n\nThe puzzle boards drop for you,  many gold coins and bags of coins that you can pick up and use the coins to purchase things for the house that you own in Old town. The things you can purchase are decoration and will reward you special abilities or bonuses to existing ones. There is also pieces such as silver bullets, crosses, pumpkin bombs, flashlights, and many more that you can use to help you solve each puzzle. It gives you abilities that once used go on a cool-down, and you must earn points to refresh them. \n\n\nI have nothing negative to say about this game. It's runs perfect, I have encountered zero bugs or glitches, controls and clicking with the mouse are perfect as well.\n\nI did see that there doesn't appear to be any other game modes besides relax or timed, but there is a possibilty that they can be added in the future.

Soon it becomes more difficult, as you must make matches over golden tiles to remove them, and then over grey tiles that are over golden tiles (so you have to make two matches over that space to get rid of both). Then they add impediments like spiderwebs that must be removed by matching the token on that tile, and rocks you have to break by making matches near them, etc. The game gets harder and harder! \n\nHowever, you are also given powerups in the form of Halloween decorations on your front lawn. You buy these with money you earn from completing levels. Many of the decorations also level up your powerups so they're more powerful or more efficient.

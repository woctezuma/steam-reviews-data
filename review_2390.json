Consiglio vivamente se si vuole giocare a questo titolo di scaricare GZDOOM un tool gratuito che permette di adattare la grafica a gli schermi moderni MA SOPRATUTTO per editare i controlli che quelli di base sono molto scomodi, che sono forse l'unica \"pecca\"( erano altri tempi quindi i controlli per l'epoca erano ottimi ma ora potrebbero infastidire tantissimo i giovanissimi ). Oltretutto GZdoom permette di utilizzare anche il joypad quindi perfetto!\ndopo aver scaricato il tool io lho aggiunto nell' elenco dei giochi per trovarmelo in libreria , per comodit\u00e0 lo

Never-the-less, the game will still surprise you with its differences, such as usable items, interactive environments, and *GASP* the ability to look up and down!\n\nThe level design here is top notch, so kudos to Raven Software.  One of the strongest factors going for Heretic is its surprisingly impressive levels, both in terms of scope and functionality.  \n\nThough, one thing that I find slightly disappointing is the seemingly haphazard enemy selection.  There's golems (which look like mummies), gigantic skeletal warriors, small imps, serpent-men, minotaurs, wierd scorpion-like insects with axes for hands, bipedal lizards, something called a \"weredragon\", and a GIANT FLOATING SKULL....Whatever they seem to be, the game could've benefited from a more thematic assortment of enemies instead of the circus we have going on here.  Some of the sprite-work also appears to be rather rushed, namely the imps that infest nearly every level.  You might be thinking \"that's a small nit-pick!\" but if you compare the Imps in Heretic to the Lost Souls in DOOM, you can immediately tell that the imps were rushed.  Which brings to light another issue I have, where some enemies look \"more\" cartoony than others, like there were different sprite artists working on different enemies and they weren't communicating with one another, just trying to throw together an enemy and ship it out.\n\nOverall, just a few things I noticed that chip away at the other-wise admirable attempt to cash-in on the Doom clone craze and coming out a LOT more successfully than its competition.", "timestamp_created": 1506324906, "timestamp_updated": 1506324906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35193662": {"recommendationid": "35193662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339563496", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515345437}, "language": "english", "review": "Still the best!", "timestamp_created": 1506300068, "timestamp_updated": 1506300068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35140549": {"recommendationid": "35140549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127851014", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408992239}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game for the whole family", "timestamp_created": 1506126088, "timestamp_updated": 1506126350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503216", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35040163": {"recommendationid": "35040163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046734749", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 6007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506055230}, "language": "czech", "review": "Heretic je skvela doom 3d strilecka davnych casu a po vylepseni zdoom nastrojem se da hrat i dnes.\n\nHodnoceni: 83%", "timestamp_created": 1505716964, "timestamp_updated": 1505716964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34855996": {"recommendationid": "34855996", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972244348", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504989311}, "language": "english", "review": "Good old school FPS with dark fantasy atmosphere and monsters.

Then look no further than Heretic. Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders is the first game in the Heretic & Hexen series, and along with ID software games, have been the main force of evolution in the first era of first person shooters. Each game from Heretic & Hexen series have introduced a design concept that all other FPS games have followed ever since. Heretic SotSR remains the most accessible and action-packed title in the series, set in a dark fantasy universe with 54 complex levels which will guarantee you 20 hours and more of pure hectic and frenetic fun.\n\nYou play as Corvus, one of the last members of the Elves, as theirs and human kingdoms are being annihilated by the overwhelming forces of the three Serpent Riders, ancient spellcasters that have evolved into forces of pure evil and destruction as they invade different realms while spreading corruption and chaos in their wake. Witnessing all this horror, Corvus decides to take matters into his hand and exact vengeance against the first and weakest of the three Serpent Riders, D\u2019Sparil.\n\nHeretic SotSR was the first game that introduced gibing based on elemental hazards such as stepping into fire or activating a squishing trap. All levels are sorted into 5 episodes, and each episode has one hidden bonus level. These levels have beautiful macabre and mystic 2D art as you traverse open fields, medieval villages, castles and dungeons while you are desperately trying to fight against many dangerous foes and followers of D\u2019Sparil. Medieval weapons that you use are a bit of a knock-offs of Doom weapons, in a way they function and fire similar to Doom-marine\u2019s pistol, shotgun, minigun etc, but they are all easy and fun to use, while some of them are better suited against certain types of enemies. Speaking of enemies, there are 16 distinct and horrifying enemies that will try to put you down: from flying Gargoyles that lunge at the players in for a slashing attack, slow and strong Golems that can cause massive damage if they get close enough, to Disciples that are very fast and use powerful magical ranged attacks, and Iron Liches as one of the most devastating enemies that hunt in groups. Prioritizing which type of the enemy to take out first is the key in wining every fight in Heretic. At the end of each episode, you\u2019ll also meet deadly bosses, until you finally clash with D\u2019Sparil itself. Heretic is also if not the first, then among the first FPS games that introduced inventory system with a dozen of powerful items that will aid you in combat, such as: Tome of Power that temporarily unlocks alternative attack of all the weapons, Quartz Flask that heal a small portion of health, or Mystic Urn that fully restores health when used, or saves player from imminent death when all health has been lost.\n\nFor every fan of fast and furious FPS games of the 90\u2019s, Heretic is a must play: a wild dance of death and magic barrage against overwhelming hordes of enemies, set in the equally astonishing and dangerous fantasy realm \u2013 Heretic Shadow of the Serpent Riders will fill up your bloodlust and prepare you for the superior sequels of Hexen and Hexen II, where your skill and thinking will be put to the ultimate test. \u201c\u201dSorsit!\u201d \u201cSoract!\u201d", "timestamp_created": 1503503060, "timestamp_updated": 1503503060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34423475": {"recommendationid": "34423475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005434122", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411333736}, "language": "english", "review": "Just add OpenGL mode and it gets better than 99% of all modern 3d shooters", "timestamp_created": 1503433790, "timestamp_updated": 1503433790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539364", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34249490": {"recommendationid": "34249490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053335583", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490320941}, "language": "english", "review": "Doom: Wizard Edition", "timestamp_created": 1502774265, "timestamp_updated": 1502774265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34123856": {"recommendationid": "34123856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118451524", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459281506}, "language": "french", "review": "Un peu difficile de s'y remettre prendre dans le premier chapitre, ensuite le plaisir revient.\nNerveux, bourrin et tr\u00e8s bon comme pas mal de jeux du style \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque.", "timestamp_created": 1502280767, "timestamp_updated": 1502280767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33960636": {"recommendationid": "33960636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059893409", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508440730}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was my childhood alongside with Wolfenstein 3D and Need for Speed II.\nAt the time I had no idea what the menus said (like selecting the stage or difficulty) because english was a foreign language to me.

It retains solid shooting mechanics and the graphics are a little better but not by much(which is fine as I never felt doom was unplesant to look at anyway). I wouldn't be suprised if it uses the same coding from doom for some of the enemies and weapons(the pole weapons is the punch from doom, the axe armed enemies are the pig demon,etc.). It adds items to mix things up and they are a ton of fun to use ( I love the egg power as it turns enemies into chickens). The downside is your items are reduced to one from level to level no matter how much you have. I get why they did this, since building up nine invinciblity rings would kinda break the game, I think it's also to make you use the items instead of saving it for bosses. It's just disappointing when you have eight purple potions and you lose seven at the end, like it was a waste. Also like the first doom I was disapointed at repeated bosses in episode four and five. \n\nIf it sounds like I'm being critical, rest assured that was my last commplant. The great level design is there, the sound design is solid and the sound track is refreshingly diffrent from doom, and the enemies are still fun to fight(and the items add new ideas for attacks and methods for fighting enemies) and I love the fantasy feel.

The gameplay is timeless - still good fun to play, and offer a great challenge for a seasoned old-school shooter fan (especially the last 2 chapters are hard as a gargoyle's turd). The weapons are similar to Doom's, but - I have to admit - they are less fun to use, because they are quite similar to each other, and lack that power I expect from them. For example the Firemace is pretty much useless. The best weapon is the Crossbow, which basically functions as a shotgun.

Much of the game will feel like a doom reskin (Hence the old genre of \"DOOM Clone\") but that shouldn't be the merit to judge this game. The level design and enemies are fresh and interesting, especially if you've worn DOOM out and want new content.\n\nI don't thihnk it's very fair to only compare it to DOOM, but it's very difficult not it. That WAS the reaso nthe game was made, to tap into that sweet sweet DOOM money. Even down to the same beats of content with hidden walls dropping to release a horde of enemies for an ambush. Also, as a new Heretic player, my DOOM secret sense would tingle in all the right places to find pretty much all of the secrets on every level so far, save for a handful.\n\nI like this game, I like it a lot. My DOOM skills transfer nicely on the hardest difficulty and it keeps me on my toes. It even taught me some new tricks with the addition of a flying common enemy that comes out in swarms so it's interesting to change up the strafing dance. It holds nicely and despite me talking about DOOM so much, it really stands on its own in terms of rewarding gameplay. I recommend playing at the hardest difficulty you can play at because the level design is really nice for fun maneuvering and then the levels try to choke you so it gets hectic.\n\nI also recommend playing this with the Zandronum client for mouselook and just overall better controls. Playing vanilla controls might be bearable and I'm not an elitist enough to care. HOWEVER, don't turn jumping on, you will break the game in terms of progression.

I hope you read that sentence correctly: this is a terrible PORT, so I do not condone paying for this.\n\nRaven Software (the game's original developer) simply packaged the vanilla DOS distribution of the game with DOSbox, a DOS emulator. Because this game is emulated, it doesn't perform as well as its supposed to. The emulated musical renditions are unfaithful to what I heard when I used to play the game on a 100 MHz Windows 95 rig, and this sorry excuse for a Steam port includes none of the optional features that modernize and improve the game, like those found in free third-party launchers such as zDoom and The Doomsday Engine.\n\nSadly, all of id Software's DOS-based games received this sort of shoddy treatment when they were ported for digital distribution. Now that id Software is owned by Bethesda, I can't advocate buying anything associated with id Software anymore. (Raven developed this game, but id Software licensed the Doom engine to Raven.)\n\nHeretic has always been one of my all-time favorite first person shooters. Raven Software made some tremendous improvements to the Doom engine when it made this game, but what impresses me more than the tech featured in this game is its atmosphere. Heretic's levels are more diverse than Doom's, and the excellent music and creepy chants from enemy warlocks (the Disciples of D'Sparil) make the experience of exploring these environments more immersive.\n\nI find the game a lot more challenging than Doom, largely because of how the levels are designed and how ammo is distributed throughout them. The game is tough but fair, and does not hold your hand or bombard you with painfully obvious 'hints.'\n\nYou should play this game instead of Ziggurat if exploring compelling maps and uncovering secrets are things you value. If you like combat that feels exciting rather than tedious, you may enjoy this game more than HeXen, its sequel. (I sure do!)\n\nAlthough it's difficult to play Heretic with others, the game's deathmatch mode has always been a blast. Playing against your buddies is especially fun since you may end up being transformed into a chicken. When that happens, you actually adopt the advantages and disadvantages of being in that form! However, I have always preferred playing classic FPS games in co-op mode rather than competitive mode, and Heretic is no exception to that preference.\n\nIf this were the 90s and Heretic was running natively the way it was meant to, I'd recommend the game in a heartbeat. I still recommend playing the game itself if you're willing to trouble yourself with downloading and setting up a modern launcher, but I don't advocate paying for this game. The port is flat-out lazy and undeserving of your money, and with Bethesda's takeover of id Software, it's doubtful that much (if any) of the money you spend will go to the developers who made this masterpiece. Bethesda is not a publisher I like to support any longer.\n\nNormally I'd advocate buying older games on GOG for quality assurance.

Yeah, you there in front of the computer/phone/tablet, or whatever device you're using.  Are you a fan of Doom? Sure you are.  Doom is loved by many, and rightly so.  It was one of the most influential games of its time and still holds up extremely well today.  Why else would it be getting rereleased and even rebooted every decade or so?  What if I told you this game is basically Doom with a fantasy paintjob?\n\nYeah, because that's what it is, and I highly reccomend it.  But a quick warning; this game is a dinosaur by today's standards and the control scheme is rather, shall we say archaic and may be frustrating to modern  gamers.  But releif is available in the form of a little program called ZDoom.  This baby makes the game control like a modern shooter and even cleans up the graphics a bit.  And best of all, you can get it without spending a single penny, and without the headache of computer viruses.  Here's a quick guide to get it to work.  \n\nYou need:\nUnpacking softare (I reccomend 7-Zip as it's free, where as Winrar will eventually slam you up the butt with a paywall)\nZDoom: Found here.  https://zdoom.org/downloads\n\n1.) Download ZDoom\n2.) Use your unpacking software to extract it into the Heretic Folder\n3.) Copy contents from ZDoom folder into main folder.\n4.) Find Dosbox.exe and rename it Dosboxbackup.exe.\n5.) Find ZDoom.exe and rename it Dosbox.exe  \n\nAnd that's it, the game now controls like a modern shooter.  Once you've got that done, you can sit back and enjoy some fantasy bad guy blasting.  You are the Heretic, and you're out for blood.  The Serpant Riders have a nasty plan for Mankind, and your job is to stop it.  There is more to the story than that, but I don't want to give any spoliers, as you really should play this game if you're at all into Doom.\n\nYour weapons include, but are not limited to, The Etheral Crossbow, The Dragonclaw, and the Hell Staff.  Weapons and Ammo are littered around each level and you'd best pick them up because evil can be around any corner.  The game plays in five episodes.  Finishing an episode will wrap up the current episode and give you a prelude into the next one.  Again, this is basically Doom with a fantasy vibe rather than a science fiction one.\n\nThe graphics are spot on for that old timey Doom feel, as is the music.  The only real complaint I have is that I can't figure out how to make the screen go Full screen. That aside, Heretic Shadow of The Serpant Riders is a hidden Gem and for five bucks, you can't go wrong.  Heck, you can get the whole series this game is in for ten bucks.  Four games for Ten bucks is a pretty hard offer to turn down.\n\nIn the end, I urge you to get Heretic if you are at all into Doom.  But yeah, get ZDoom and it'll smooth the controls out and make the game accessable to modern gamers.

Boom (suono della mia mente che esplode dalle possibilit\u00e0)! Le chance che potesse deludere a causa delle eccessive aspettative erano molte (del resto Doom \u00e8... Doom, un caposaldo, uno dei Giochi con la G maiuscola, una divinit\u00e0 nel mondo del gaming), ma... fortunatamente, non delude, anzi: la Raven \u00e8 stata bravissima e ha creato un gioco che \u00e8 una vera e propria perla nel mondo degli FPS. Ha preso l'engine di Doom e ha creato un gioco con una personalit\u00e0, non una sorta di semplice \"reskin\": i nemici sono bellissimi (stregoni e Maulotaur su tutti), le armi pure (Mazza a parte, IMHO... non dico inserire una sorta di BFG magico, ma neanche una mazza che spara palle di ferro rimbalzanti... suona ridicolo da scrivere, da vedere poi...), le ambientazioni sono favolose. Il gioco ha inoltre \"inventato\" la gestione dell'inventario negli FPS (prima era \"alla Doom\", ovvero gli oggetti venivano presi e usati sempre automaticamente), cosa che introduce una gestione strategica delle proprie risorse, ed \u00e8 riuscita addirittura a inserire una boss fight finale IMHO molto intrigante, divisa in due fasi. Non \u00e8 frenetico e adrenalinico come Doom, non \u00e8 cattivo come Doom, ma \u00e8 bello e dannatamente divertente da giocare. La versione su Steam, tra parentesi, \u00e8 la versione \"pi\u00f9 che completa\", nel senso che oltre ai tre episodi originali, ne ha due aggiuntivi (che erano compresi appunto nell'espansione \"Shadow of the Serpent Riders\"). Consigliatissimo!\n\nNOTA FINALE: io sono un \"purista\", nel senso che i giochi preferisco giocarli cos\u00ec com'erano graficamente parlando, senza usare mod o quant'altro, ma vi consiglio VIVAMENTE di giocarlo con ZDoom. Il gioco, acquistato cos\u00ec com'\u00e8, ha due grossi problemi: (1) su un monitor moderno, con una risoluzione alta, \u00e8 sgranatissimo, con dei pixel grossi come case a causa dello scaling. Ma, soprattutto, (2) non supporta a dovere l'accoppiata tastiera + mouse: purtroppo, anche andando nel setup, NON \u00e8 possibile togliere il fatto che il personaggio si muova avanti e indietro con il mouse, cosa fastidiosissima.

It is tough to play without a source port. [/i]\n\n[h1]Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders is a essentially a fantasy flavored DOOM, so if you played the classic FPS, then you should feel at home here, though it has it's own unique features and feel. A good Doom source port is extremely recommened, if not required to enjoy this game in modern times. The ending is disappointing, but Heretic is a classic FPS that is good as if not better than the iconic DOOM games.[/h1]\n\nHeretic  is a pretty old game, and the lore isn't explained well in game, so understanind the story takes reading of the old manual and wiki pages. Gameplay wise, it is a fantasy flavored Doom - same sprite based graphics, same semi-primitive 3D Levels, similar weapons, same Midi-based music, same maze like level designs and secrets, well the same game engine. It isn't a \"reskin of DOOM\" though, it is it's own independent game in which I found pretty fun and has the same visceral enemy destruction and robust, but sometimes maze-like level design. Also, the items you recieve go into your inventory versus being used instantly, so you can save invincibility, invisibility, health potions, and even timed bombs for when you need it, but that also means you have to manage that inventory with scrolling and use keys. You also will find limited items that grant temporary flight for combat and exploration (though is only necessary for a few moments) and the Tome of Power (as mentioned in Heretic lore) that gives your weapons powerful alternate fire modes - which made the game really fun in big fights - more so than classic DOOMs in my opinion.\n\nThe start of some episodes are tough due to limited ammo and weapons, so expect to kite and bait enemies, and dodge them all together at times. I enjoyed my experience with the game, but I also found the ending to be underwhelming, which throws dozens of bosses from a previous episode and ends on a cliffhanger for Heretic 2, which is not easy to obtain (pricey on stores or via abandonware sites).", "timestamp_created": 1484372165, "timestamp_updated": 1484372361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594515", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29138391": {"recommendationid": "29138391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241350714", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508068269}, "language": "italian", "review": "Nonostante sia vecchio, pu\u00f2 risultare ancora oggi molto divertente.

He manages to convince the Seven kingdoms of the world to follow him like sheep, building worship sites in his honor via D'Sparil's Sign of the Trident. The only ones immune to his infectious influence are the ancient elders of the Sidhe race, a small group of strong Elven sorcerers that have been branded as heretics and seek refuge and are ultimately pressed to weave their powerful magic and extinguish the Seven candles in order to collapse the rallied armies of the Seven kingdoms primed against them. It seems D'Sparil's plan to inherit the world had failed. Until he reveals his own personal army from the depths of the abyss, who overpower and slaughter the remaining Sidhe. Only one elf managed to escape, Corvus, who now seeks bloody vengeance from the cruel slaying of his people and corruption of his world and challenges D'Sparil to the death, even to his own terrifying home dimension.\n\nIf the first Quake is more or less Doom in 3D, then Heretic is practically Doom with a fantasy skin. But what seperates Raven's game from id's is its own gimmicks and advanced engine features. You can look up and down, there's an inventory system that allows collection and utilization of various magical items at any time, a few examples like the Quartz Flask which is Heretic's take on Doom's medikit, the unique Tome of Power which is a spellbook of Sidhe origin that temporarily increases the power of all weapons in possession, the Wings of Wrath that grant the ability to fly for a short period of time, or the humiliating Morph Ovum that transforms once powerful foes into measily chickens! There's more environmental hazards than in Doom like slippery ice floors, wind currents that push you back, and regenerating spores which are effectively Doom's explosive barrels if they could respawn. Most weapons are very similar counterparts to Doom's: Gauntlets of the Necromancer (which sadly do not resurrect the dead as your own) operates like the chainsaw, the Elvenwand functions like a pistol, the Ethereal Crossbow like a shotgun, the Dragon Claw like the chaingun, Phoenix Rod is Heretic's rocket launcher, or the Hell Staff, Heretic's magical take on the plasma rifle. There's no BFG equivalent however, and like stated prior all of these weapons can be temporarily boosted to have extraordinary properties, making short work of even the deadliest creatures.\n\nD'Sparil's army consists mostly of little red gargoyles, flesh golems and undead warriors earlier on, but you'll be coming face to face with more otherworldly monsters like the enigmatic Sabreclaw, the serpentine Ophidian, and even D'Sparil's own Disciples. It's not quite as robust and memorable as Doom's bestiary but they put up a decent fight, often coming in large mobs, and can be surprisingly dangerous at times on the highest difficulties. Even though there are no hitscan enemies in the game, you will be bombarded with projectile attacks and some of these do pretty serious damage, the Disciple's attack in particular, or the alternative attack of the undead warrior in the form of a luminous red, blood dripping axe. Some monsters also come in several other variants, not simple recolors but different abilities, like some gargoyles are melee only and others throw fireballs, or Nitrogolems that cast homing magical skulls at their target. Bosses are featured at the end of each episode in traditional Doom fashion, and I'm happy to say here that none of them are really pushovers like they were in Doom. Iron Liches, Maulotaurs and D'Sparil himself are all formidable adversaries and pack a surprise or two.\n\nHeretic's level structure is just like the first Doom game, with five episodes in all. The first three consisting of the original story, and two extra that take place after the events of episode 3. Episodes 4 and 5 were added later on as a sort of expansion pack but more of an upgrade to the original release, much like the fourth episode added to Doom. It's really just more of the same, but the maps are notably more difficult to traverse and have a greater density of monsters. Only for the diehard fans, otherwise you're not missing anything if you choose not to play them. Heretic's levels are for the most part very Doom-y and straightforward, with optional side areas to visit and secret areas hidden about. Three keys are required to exit most maps and action is constant from start to finish, making even single episode playthroughs rather exhausting once finished.\n\nVisuals and audio are very well done, there's lots of color and plenty of detail in the artwork for textures and sprites, a lot of little details in fact which Raven has always been about and if you have an eye for such thing it's impressive the amount they packed into the Doom engine. It's not as dark in tone as Doom but Heretic's adventure still manages to feel oppressive and perilous. The music is done by Raven's longtime musician Kevin Schilder and has an appropriate fantasy sounding theme in each level, more or less on par with Bobby Prince's contributions to Doom. Not always as upbeat as Doom but they are often fun and catchy, with some of the gloomier pieces being very atmospheric provoking a sense of dread.\n\nMy personal criticisms is the lack of texture variety, as Heretic has a strangely small set of them, but they're almost always applied well enough. Some monsters can soak up a bit too much damage, making hordes of them feel like a chore to take down, and are usually too slow in their movement to be of any real threat if you choose to run past them. Episodes 3 and 4 are off to an unusually difficult start because ammo isn't in great abundance and you're almost showered with foes, forcing you to retreat until you find enough supplies to fight back. Lastly as mentioned earlier episodes 4 and 5 are very tacked on and don't offer anything new besides more difficult levels, some of which can be pretty obnoxious (I'm looking at you E4M9). It's no doubt a fun game and a worthy counterpart to Doom but it's not nearly as fun or as well designed as Doom is, combat can be so-so at times and the balance isn't always great in regards to enemy strength or player weapon damage. Some weapons are just flat out redundant in operation, there's not one not two but three rapid firing weapons which cuts down on the creativity. The Fire Mace being Heretic's 'ultimate' weapon is lackluster at best (at least when its un-Tomed that is). Finally the amount of user content available is also very low, nowhere near Doom's or even Wolf3D, so if you turn out to really like Heretic there's only going to be so much on offer.\n\nUltimately Heretic is a mostly solid shooter with some cool ideas and an overall nice premise and its the beginning of a very decent trilogy of fantasy themed shooters, with the sequels Hexen and Hexen II continuing and concluding the Serpent Rider trilogy. If you enjoyed Doom and want a similar game and/or wish to pursue Raven's Heretic/Hexen series then it still comes as recommended.

Let's get that out of the way right now.  It's the same engine, all of the controls are the same, there are three chapters with 8 levels and one secret level each, the final boss of the first chapter is two tougher-than-average enemies, all of the weapons have easily identifiable DOOM equivalents, and you even descend into Hell at one point. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it is very noticeable.\n\nThe fantasy setting is the main difference, but it's by no means the only one. The engine is improved, allowing the player to look up and down; the powerups are more varied, allowing the player to fly, teleport back to spawn, and give their weapons all-new attacks; and the levels are generally easier to navigate, which is always [strike] nice[/strike] A GODSEND.\n\nHeretic also has an inventory, and while it's nice to be able to pick up powerups and use them at any time, you're only allowed to carry one of each item with you between levels. If you managed to pick up 12 Time Bombs of the Ancients in one level and didn't use them (because why would you), you only get one next level. I'm guessing this was because they couldn't figure out how to make the game keep track of the quantity values, but it's still annoying, especially when you're trying to stockpile Tomes of Power or Quartz Flasks.\n\nHowever, Heretic is missing one very important thing that DOOM had: [strike] an actually effective BFG[/strike] the right tone. Heretic is a good game, but it's also a staid one, and it lacks the metal soundtrack, ridiculously fun weapons, anarchic mishmash of sci-fi and Satanic imagery, juvenile rebellion-for-rebellion's-sake feel, and sense of [b] fun [/b] that made DOOM so memorable. That difference is why DOOM is revered and Heretic is simply fondly remembered.\n\nStill, Heretic is a very good game, and it's definitely worth your time.\n\nP.S. I played this directly after Rise of the Triad, and am reminded of how much more fun idTech 1 is than the Wolfenstein engine. It's just freer.\n\nP.P.S. The Gauntlets of the Necromancer are technically just the replacement for the chainsaw, but l like them a lot more. It's fun to just run around whimsically Emperor Palpatine-ing enemies, and with the Tome of Power it's weirdly the most overpowered thing in the game, with the ability to leech health at an alarming rate.

Instead of borrowing or bootlegging the game, I decided to just wait until I had enough money in the future (which never seemed realistic at the time).\n\nFlash forward to today and I've somehow managed to have Heretic on my Steam account for 5 years without playing it. I had forgotten about the QuakeCon pack from 2011 that included every iD title from that moment. Much to my surprise after having a Doom craze, I had some more Doom to explore.\n\nCalling Heretic a \"Doom clone\" is doing the game an injustice, but it certainly has a lot of game feel similar to Doom. Almost every weapon is a reskin from Doom 2 and most of the monsters share similar properties to enemies seen in Doom. The designs are incredibly different (and really diverse), but it's hard to initially get out of your mind that Heretic is just Doom with a different coat of paint.\n\nEventually, you start to pick up on some of the changes that developer Raven Software has crammed into Heretic. For starters, this is the first FPS I can think of with an inventory system. It allows for the level of challenge to be ramped up since the player can constantly hold a source of health on them.\n\nNot only that, but you can carry around various power-ups to use in sticky situations. Other shooters at the same time forced you to utilize anything you picked up then and there; Heretic puts more control into the players hand with the inventory system.\n\nIt is a bit annoying how you need to scroll through and additionally select an item before using it, but I'll let that slide due to the release date (1994). That something so genre bending was even pulled off on the Doom engine is just awesome, let alone how chaotic it makes combat feel.\n\nEach weapon has a different ammo type. It solves the mini issue Doom suffered with having the pistol and chaingun share ammo; getting the chain gun made the pistol redundant. In Heretic, every weapon feels valuable at any given time. Even the dinky starter mage staff can become awesome with the correct power-up.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t so hot is how predictable the game becomes. At first, you're not quite sure where to expect enemies to spawn from. Walking down corridors has walls dropping and enemies flying at you from all sides. By the time you reach the third episode, you've seen basically all of the tricks Heretic is ever going to throw at you.\n\nThat may have more to do with the original game only being 3 episodes, but episodes 4 and 5 really suffer from a lack of creativity. They are definitely difficult and well built (better than the rest of the game, even), but it feels dull after having played through 24 maps with similar layouts.\n\nThis is coupled with how the level design tends to have a lot of dead ends that require you to return to a centralized location. I'm guessing this was a precursor to the level design in the sequel, HeXen, where every map has a hub world. It does lend to some insanely confusing layouts, though.\n\nThe sound design is also pretty lackluster compared to Doom. On its own, the music is okay and the monsters sound like monsters, but nothing is distinct and most of the enemy sounds play at the same volume. It doesn't feel as immersive as Doom, nor does it help the player distinguish which enemy is in an area with them.\n\nThe overuse of the first boss is also pretty lame. Maybe that is down to me playing on the second hardest difficulty, but I do wish there was more diversity in the boss encounters. Facing three of those floating giant skulls level after level becomes grating.\n\nWith all of that said, I still found Heretic to be really enjoyable. It contains enough originality that any comparison to Doom sounds nitpicky. Sure, Doom may be an overall more polished and enjoyable game, but that doesn't make anything done in Heretic not worth seeing. Heretic is also considerably harder, so Doom veterans will be in for a treat.\n\nGetting the game running on modern operating systems is also a breeze. Since id Software released the Doom source code a long time ago, any modern Doom source port works with Heretic. You can boot up zDoom and get Heretic going in any manner of resolution you want. Full mouse look is enabled and keys can be rebinded to whatever your fancy is. There is even support for internet play, which is pretty damn awesome.\n\nIt also doesn't hurt that the current price is exceptional. $5 for a game that will take around 6-8 hours to finish is just solid value. If you want to spring a bit more, you can get the rest of the series on Steam for $5 more. That includes Heretic, HeXen and HeXen II. That's a lot of classic first-person shooter action for a small chunk of change.\n\nHowever you slice it, Heretic is pretty good. There are definitely things that Raven Software could have done to distinguish it from the crowd, but for a first attempt from an unknown developer, you could do worse. For the price, you'd be hard pressed to find much worse, though.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1469070982, "timestamp_updated": 1470600462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24270187": {"recommendationid": "24270187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101468477", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438739895}, "language": "english", "review": "What a lovely gem this game is.

Don't get me wrong, Doom was, has been and will always be a genre-defining game that paved the way for the many CoDs and BFs of today, but Heretic has always been better at immersing players in a much more fantastical world and journey with its D&D-esque aesthetics and references, while pitting you against otherwordly creatures such as manticores, armored skeletons and warlocks, to name a few. Creatures that can easily be disposed of with your arsenal of fantasy-inspired weaponry that range from extremely powerful sceptres and crossbows to spells that can multiply your power manifold or turn the most-frigthening enemy into a puny chicken that can swiftly be ripped to shreds.\n\nHeretic is definitely worth buying not only for its place in history, but also for its extremely enjoyable mechanics and overall tone.

Heretic, however, finds several ways to mix this up, with new monster kinds, types, and some new, creative weaponry, as well as an inventory system. \n\nHeretic is also notably longer than DOOM; this version has five episodes, with, also like DOOM, 9 levels apiece, including a secret level. \n\nHeretic's inventory system is, however, probably the most notable new feature. For instance, Medikits are no longer instantly used. Medikits, now known as Quartz Flasks, are picked up and carried by your character until you decide to use it manually. You cannot do the same for Stimpacks, which are now known as Crystal Flasks, however. \n\nOther notable items include the Tome of Power, which alters each weapon's fire to make it generally more powerful, Rings of Invincibilties, essentially a portable Invulnsphere, and Morph Ovums, which turn the struck enemy into easy to kill chickens. \n\nThere are also new enemy types, such as \"ghosts\" which cannot be struck by anything other than magic attacks, like your wand, or the central bolt from your crossbow, etc...\n\nAll in all, Heretic is a nice DOOM-like experience, that I would recommend to anyone who considers themselves a fan of the original series. \n\n(Note: I probably don't have much time played, because I'm using a source port.)\n", "timestamp_created": 1466752663, "timestamp_updated": 1466752663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23667832": {"recommendationid": "23667832", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984160647", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510839782}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantasic  game !", "timestamp_created": 1466425306, "timestamp_updated": 1466425306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23617557": {"recommendationid": "23617557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310127599", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466449002}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome classic game, still one of my all time favourites", "timestamp_created": 1466184558, "timestamp_updated": 1466184558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23607675": {"recommendationid": "23607675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311451112", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494194383}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fantastic fps, similar to doom.

meer zodat je de indruk krijgt met meerdere classen te spelen.\nOok is er een inventory om te switchen tussen een toorts en andere hulpmiddelen zoals vleugels.\nJa idd, je kan vliegen in deze game,

By playing the game through gzdoom, you are able to customize the controls. I played this game on a windows 10 laptop and the game worked perfectly fine for me. There is a link below to zdoom. \n\n\n[u]What I liked about the game[/u] \n\u2022\tI thought the monsters in the game were pretty cool, especially the Golem. \n\u2022\tThroughout the game there are many secrets to be found. \n\u2022\tThere were some very good levels, especially in the first chapter.\n\u2022\tSome cool weapons. \n\u2022\tI like the idea of having an inventory, so you can use stuff that you collect later on\n\u2022\tIn the first three chapters, at the end of each level, I like how it showed you a map telling you where you have been and where you are going to next. \n\u2022 Cool death animations.   \n[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]  \n\u2022\tI thought the music was quite repetitive, I know they reused some of the songs in doom, but they got reused a lot more in Heretic. \n\u2022\tKilling enemies in heretic wasn\u2019t very satisfying. I didn\u2019t feel like a badass like I did in Doom.\n\u2022\tThe last two chapters aren\u2019t really anything special, I like to think the story ended on the third chapter. The final         bosses in chapter 4 and 5 aren\u2019t very interesting. \n\u2022\tChapters 4 and 5 were quite hard, it was a shock because the first three chapters were very easy.\n\u2022\tSecrets were too easy to find.  \n\n[u] My conclusion[/u] \n\nIf you liked Doom, Quake or Hexen. I would recommend this game to you. It is a good game with some good levels and weapons. Plenty of secrets to be found as well.

So this essentially is another FPS with significant new elements, compared to DooM standards.\nThis title puts us in the role of Corvus ( posthumous name given in the sequel), one of the last elves hunted by monsters from other dimensions, headed by D'Sparil, one of the Serpent Riders. Ok, like any other FPS of those times the story is completely useless, but in this case it's a very useful excuse to give the game a strong fantasy atmosphere. So there won't be zombies or devils, but Gargoyles, mummies, mages and minotaurs. There won't be guns but ther will be wands, ethereal crossbows and other magic weapons. There are more news compared to DooM: items. They're not just health powerups but they're proper items you may carry and use at your own discretion. These are the likes of health, damage powerup, teleportation in disguise of quartz flasks, Tomes of power, Chaos device... And many other items with different use. This kind of system seriously improves the gampeplay from DooM's standard, adding that creative spice to the classic \"shooteverythingthatmovesandfindthekeyfortheexitdoor\".\nAs in DooM, Heretic has three episodes made of 9 levels each. I was quite surprised to see that this release includes the other 2 expansion episodes from Shadow of the Serpent Riders edition which is a free upgrade I never heard about until now O.o (my bad).\nAs usual this game is released with DosBox to launch with. Fortunately they didn't even try to clumsily implement any mouse configuration as done in the horrible DooM releases.\n\n[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]\n[*][b] FANTASY.[/b] Clearly the prettiest innovation of the game is the fantasy atmosphere giving a creative new look to FPS. You explore buildings, which are not stations but castles or fortress with mosaic glass, while outside you find water and terrain. The settings obviously force the use of new type of weapons: magic weapons (my favourite are the necromancer gauntlets of course, the chainsaw equivalent... XD). And of course the implementation of new and innovative items.\n[*][b] GAMEPLAY.[/b] Besides the ability to look up and down, there are other innovations and most of them can be grouped inside the new inventory system. Now you can pick up items to be used in other moments at will, and they range from simple health replenisher, damage bonus and other disguised as perfect fantasy items. One of the most useful and innovative are the \"wings of wrath\" a big name for a flying device, a new and important powerup considering you can't jump in this game. Another interesting is the Hourglass, which is just a powerful proximity mine.

In this game, you won't have to spend 10 minutes going in and out of cover to shoot three enemies. Nor will you need to press 30 buttons just to be able to shoot and move at the same time. In this game, you go forward, kill shit, collect items and keys, and find the exit. Simple as. And did I mention you don't have to wait for a checkpoint, and you can just make your own by saving the game at any time from the in-game menu? Revolutionary!!!\n\n(Really...it's like games have DEvolved in this regard over the years!)\n\nOkay, so the graphics are bad by today's standards; for 1994, though, that WAS the standard, and Hexen pulls it off wonderfully. The sound, though, IS great even by modern standards, particularly the groaning and screeching of hidden enemies. The feeling of walking around a cleared room or courtyard HEARING these motherfreakers but not knowing when you're going to run across them provides significantly more tension than any Slender-style 'horror' game (really, if you've ever been in REAL woods at night, Slender shouldn't be the slightest bit scary to you.) And once you DO find them, they are some tough cookies, even at Level 2 difficulty (Level 2 or 3 is ideal for semi-experienced old-school FPS players wanting a challenging but not overtly stressful experience.)\n\nWhat's more, this is the Shadow of the Serpent Riders edition, which means technically you are getting five games in one, as it contains all the commercially released 'episodes' of Hexen. With eight or so levels to plow through in each episode, this one is sure to keep you playing for a while.\n\nIn short, while it does feature outdated graphics and lack the rockin' soundtrack of the original PC Doom, Hexen does everything else extremely right. The setting is both ludicrous and original for the time, mixing two of geekdom's favourite genres (sci-fi and high fantasy), locations are remarkably detailed for 1994, there's plentiful items to collect and weapons to try out, the difficulty is balanced but not overtly easy, and sound design is great. It also expands on the traditional FPS formula of the day by adding light RPG elements, with collectible items that can help you at certain junctions. This does, however, bring up another minor flaw, as at no point in-game are you told what each item does - you'll have to resort to FAQ guides for that, unfortunately. Once you do figure out each item's use, however, they are actively helpful, sometimes rendering previously impossible levels or sections significantly more manageable, thereby actively influencing and enhancing the overall experience.\n\nIn short - if you're a graphics snob, require all your titles to be AAA quality, or are only in it for the trading cards, Hexen will not be for you. Anyone simply wanting an enjoyable retro first-person-shooting experience, however, can't go wrong with this one - especially if you manage to get it for pennies, like I did!\n\nFinal Rating: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1450529109, "timestamp_updated": 1450529251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19585159": {"recommendationid": "19585159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114204203", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435161993}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b:\n- \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435: \"Heretic [1]\";\n- \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a: 1994.12.23;\n- \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438: \"Heretic [1]: Shadow of the Serpent Riders\" (1996);\n- \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a: \"Raven Software\";\n- \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430: \"2.5D\" (\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0451\u0445\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f);\n- \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u043e\u043a: \"ID Tech [1]\" (\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439);\n- \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440: \u0448\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0440 (\u043e\u0442 1-\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430).\n\n\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f:\n- \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c: \u043e\u043b\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043b;\n- \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u044d\u043f\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430;\n- \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442;\n- \u043c\u0438\u0440: \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439;\n- \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435;\n- \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f;\n- \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f;\n- \u043b\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0442;\n- \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436 \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u044b\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c;\n- \u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438: \u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430;

Although Shareware (the first level, The Docks, was all that you could play) it was one of the games I enjoyed playing, although it regularly gave me frights, with monsters popping out from behind pillars, and only the unidirectional roars to tell me that they \"might\" be lurking around a corner. \n\nI played it enough to warrant a full purchase via an unlock code, and the game proved to have a great deal of longevity. The stats at the end of each level, gave you feedback on no. of monsters killed, secrets discovered and items found. This lead to a great deal of replaying and backtracking to try and find each little hiding place. \n\nI never really read the manual, and the plot is really inconsequential anyway, this is by no means a narrative driven game, suffice to say your elven race was slaughtered as they refused to believe in the deity of the \"Serpent Riders\" and were slaughtered as Heretics. You, the sole elven survivor are out to seek revenge.\n\nToday it's legacy is questionable. The genre of Fantasy FPS, is non-existent, instead we have a modern warfare or sci-fi bias that the greater legacy games, Doom, and Quake popularized. Heretic is of course from the same  period. (It uses the Doom Engine). Yet has had far less overall impact on the trend of FPS fantasy, which is rather something of  a pity, as in an oversaturated market, this genre has potential. The only games that might have built from this core concept is of course Dark Messiah of Might and Magic (includes more brawling combat) and the recent Lichdom.\n\nIt has not aged well, the lack of resolution (it runs out of DosBox), poor textures and flickering lights may lead to eye strain, but the overall feel of the game is still enjoyable.

It's above average, good but far from great.\n\nThe main reason for this is simply put the level design. Possibly a fourth of my playtime consisted of aimlessly wandering around looking for what opened or what switch to push, a design choice decidedly \"old-school\", but nonetheless bad. DOOMs level design is infinitely better, because it will rarely (if ever) leave you scratching your head, wondering where to go next. \n\nThe weapons (with the exception of a few) are copies of weapons from DOOM, they just feel clunkier and are less satisfying to use. Enemies can usually also be correlated to some rough equivalent in DOOM, but most of them have been changed a little bit. The worst example of this is the Iron Lich (most similar to cacademons), whose whirlwind attack (depending on the situation) can be completely unfair, or completely useless. The best example of this are the Disciples of D'Sparil, who I can't even think of a correlation for in DOOM. \n\nAll that said, the art, music and sound in this game are all really great and create a forboding, dark and gothic atmosphere. If you're a fan of shooters from this era, you'd be a fool to miss Heretic. I would however recommend giving episode 4 and 5 a miss unless you're a masochist. They're not difficult in a fun way, it's just an excruciatingly slow grind of trial and error, possibly only surpassed by the likes of Final DOOM.

Both from a stylistic point of view and the technical side of things.\n\nDoom was a lot of things, but above all else the game was very polished and it felt inspired. From it's soundtrack to it's enemy design, everything felt like it needed to be there. And it genuinely felt like the developers all had a central vision they shared for what the game eventually became.\n\nHeretic on the other hand feels like it's stuck in Doom's shadow. The game mechanics feel far too similar to Doom and the aesthetic of the game, while impressive for the time did not age well. All of the weapons in Heretic feel more or less like reskins of Doom weapons. Apart from the graphics it feels like the same basic game but with a much less interesting aesthetic and soundtrack.\n\nThe things I appreciate Heretic more are for it's historical context like how it was one of the first FPS games to come bundled with online multiplayer support, how it had a very large custom map community and how it serves as a prequel to the HeXen series. But I really only recommend Heretic on it's own if you're a Doom fanatic such as myself, since I unfortunately see the game as very forgettable.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=487092473", "timestamp_created": 1437720734, "timestamp_updated": 1437720828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553723", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17057745": {"recommendationid": "17057745", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966632480", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472521299}, "language": "english", "review": "Ever wished Doom had a fantasy setting?

The original release featured 3 episodes, only one of which was playable as shareware. This is the expanded edition which was released commercially in stores following the success of \"Doom\". This new version gives you 2 additional episodes, bringing the total up to 5.\n\nGraphics - bright, vivid and colourful, which is a stark contrast to the realistic and disquieting look of \"Doom\" - the level design is well done and the enemies, items and characters represent what they are meant to represent. With that said, it CAN get creepy and even scary at times, so this game hasn't completely lost its horror atmosphere genesis.\n\nSound - the musical score by Kevin Schilder is limited but at the same time varied in terms of atmosphere, mood and genre, ranging from enigmatic to hectic to ominous. Episodes 1 and 2 have their own music, while Episode 3 uses recycled tracks from the first two episodes except for two levels, which have their own unique musical pieces not heard in any other stage. The music from the last two episodes are the same as from the first two episodes, in the same running order. The sound effects are minimalistic and represent the most basic form of auditory feedback, while the enemies' noises can enhance or ruin the atmosphere, depending on your mood.\n\nGameplay - as mentioned above, the inventory system and the ability to look/aim up and down breathes new life into the ageing Doom engine. The overall play style is almost identical to that of \"Doom\" - find keys to unlock doors, shoot on sight and escape to the next level. One stage of each episode has two exits, one of which will take you to a secret level - you'll have to look hard for it. Using the inventory system is crucial to survival as certain items will work in your favour, while others will have humorous effects, making the game significantly easier. You will lose your inventory upon completion of a level, so don't be afraid to use away your items.\n\nPresentation - you are greeted with a new version of the \"Heretic\" title screen upon starting the game. During the intermissions between levels, you are shown the time you took to beat the present level, amount of enemies killed on that level, items obtained and secrets discovered - a feature copied directly from \"Doom\". On the first three episodes, you are also shown a map indicating your progress from stage to stage - this feature is absent on the last two episodes, considering they were only included to make the game a commercial re-release (the original version was only available via mail-order).\n\nConclusion - the two extra episodes may or may not take your fancy since they add nothing new to the formula (I have mixed feelings about them myself) unless you want a new challenge (they were made for gamers who had mastered the original \"Heretic\" trilogy and wanted something harder), and it's a much more enjoyable game than \"Doom\" when you take in the extra features this game has to offer.\n\nFinal Score - 5 out of 5 stars.", "timestamp_created": 1435850971, "timestamp_updated": 1435850971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16774955": {"recommendationid": "16774955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031387337", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441958236}, "language": "english", "review": "This has been my childhood since I was a little boy.\nI remember playing this with cheats on beceause I was a scrub who coudn't play (6-9 years old) without cheats on these kind of hard games\nIt's pretty mutch summarized as Doom in the medieval ages.", "timestamp_created": 1435559082, "timestamp_updated": 1435559082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16751352": {"recommendationid": "16751352", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999124196", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437688066}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty unfair that doom get's a remake,but not this gem...", "timestamp_created": 1435453839, "timestamp_updated": 1435453839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851329", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16744589": {"recommendationid": "16744589", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981517282", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435122960}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing this on my old IBM Aptiva back in the day.

1994 and uses Doom engine. Yes, it's Doom-like shooter set in fantasy. Awesome mix. Plus inventory.\nShadow of the Serpent Riders is a special patched release of a game that brings it to 1.3 version, thus adding two more additional episodes. No new game content like weapon or monsters or textures, just new levels. Think of Ultimate Doom.\n\nNow, let's tip apart the way that game was handled on Steam. Well. At least they brought the most full version of the game here. And it uses DosBox, which is usually a good thing until you find out how badly id Software configures them for Steam.\nThe game will lag at full screen, so you want to go to game directory and edit heretic's conf file to make it use \"opengl\" for \"output\" setting.\nGame's option like music device and controls is once again isn't easily accessed. On good side, they didn't remove Setup.exe this time around, unlike Doom games on Steam. So you have to open game directory, drag setup.exe onto dosbox.exe and then configure it as you want.\n\nStoryline of a game is quite simple. Well, it has a lot of written in manual, but main idea and amount of plot in game is minimal.\nYour hero is elven hero, who's name is Corvus. Elven race, guardians of the Pathoris world and keepers of Tome of Powers, were proclaimed as heretics, when Dragon Riders came to conquer this world. With two Dragon Riders leaving for the other worlds, the remaining Dragon Rider, D'Sparil, unleashes horde of monsters through portal after Elves manage to wipe out all of the human armies of the world. Most of the elves were killed, monsters took Tome of Powers for themselves and you are one of the lone survivors. Your journey will begin at the City of the Damned.\nSomebody will get murdered in the end.\nThe additional episodes 4 and 5 have excuse plot of \"portal didn't lead you to home, so enjoy the world destroyed by Dragon Riders and the home of D'Sparil\".\n\nPresentation-wise the game is quite awesome looking and sounding for it's time. Yes, Doom engine. But art-style-wise, Heretic presents the world that is dark fantasy yet very colorful, with great contrast. Setting is awesome, you get to wield a magical crossbow that is equalient to shotgun. While Episode 2 is a least interesting looking one, taking place in brown caves with lava, until it gets less dull with inclusion of ice in later level, Episode 3 brings an original setting of a underwater shrine and buildings. Even water in this game has that artsy look to it.\nMusic is great too. With medivel feel, it's not afraid to use modern instruments. Well, instruments of MIDI and Soundblaster. Most of them are melodic and catchy. Cathedral track will send chill down your spine for sure.\n\nGameplay itself is, surprise, Doom-like. You search and explore mazes at the running speed, finding keys and opening lcoked doors, pressing switches and discovering secret areas, shooting down monsters or rather rushing past them.\nYou will shoot down red flying gargolues, mummies, armor knights that throw axes at you, and dark wizards of D'Sparil, who will turn your blood cold with their backward speach that sounds like silly phrases. You will also deal with respawning \"explosive barrel\"-like things, will push yourself against streams of water and wind and will encounter bosses. Which are your standard FPS bosses. Being tough enemies that you will start encountering more often in later episodes. So not too amazing.\n\nThough, unlike most FPS, it does do something good: There are no enemies who use hitscan against you. What it means is that any damage in the game can be avoided, giving it more arcade-like quality. If forget that it still makes you run over damaging acid like Doom does.\n\nThere are seven weapons of magical nature. Shotgun-like crossbow, Rocket Launcher-like Pheonix Rod, Plasma-gun-like Hellstaff. With most of them shooting projectiles, they feel slightly too similiar to each other in use. But thankfully, game introduces Tome of Power.\nTome of Power is a item power-up that you will find through levels. By using it through inventory you will power-up your weapons for a limited time. It doesn't just make them stronger, it also gives additional properity for them, making them even more amazing. For example, mace, the final weapon, stops sucking hard. Hellstaff will make a hot magic rain appear over where the projectile collided. Gaunlets, the game's chainsaw, will start to heal you as well.\n\nInventory is another addition to gameplay. You will get to collect various helpful items that you can use it anytime. It could be Hourglass who work as timed bomb and aren't much of use, or healing potion, or invincibility ring, or, as said, Tome of Power. Not related to inventory, you also will sometime find armor, but it's quite a rare thing.\nThere is one important thing to be said about inventory: When you move to the next level, you will retain only one quanity of each item. You will also lose item that allows you to fly around. I am pretty sure that it may sound like a bad thing for some players. But I think it was a good idea. Most of us are used to stockpile tons of items so we could rush bosses down. With system like that, you should feel free to actually have fun using additional items during normal gameplay, you will lose them for no good otherwise.\n\nLast thing I should note is difficulty of additional episodes. Yes, episode 4 and 5 are harder. They are also more of same. And yes, the final level has eight Maloutaurs. But first levels of each of those two episodes deserve a special mention, as they will require you to think fast, use items effectively, avoid enemies you don't want to fight with in order to survive. It was really fresh challenge, at least on Normal difficulty. Got simpler after that though, as you gain more items in process.\n\nBut with all the positive things I said, I have to be honest, it didn't become favourite FPS. It's hard to explain why. But you see, the game just doesn't \"click\" like Doom does. It just doesn't. I am not sure what it lacks. There is something in game feel that it doesn't have. Perhaps there should have been more common enemies that die bloodily. Or maybe it's the projectiles nature of weapons not being comparable to shotgun and rocket launcher. But yes, it lacks something, hard to say.\n\nHeretic is an awesome FPS and yes, it's a Doom clone. But it's an awesome Doom-clone, perhaps bettering Doom itself for some people.", "timestamp_created": 1433598705, "timestamp_updated": 1433598705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16208201": {"recommendationid": "16208201", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984934100", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433523443}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Veredito final sobre o jogo: ele come\u00e7a surpreendentemente bem, mas acaba decepcionantemente mal.

I guess it's because it's the game I grow up with it and I find all the games of the series to be good. While I do love it, it's nice to see some people look at that game and not only make a good DOOM clone, but decided to add to it and make it better. So yes, I'm saying this is good already. Now let me explain as best I can.\n\nStory\n\nIt's a 90's shooter so there not much to talk about. From the synopsis from the DOOM wiki, three sorcerers called the Serpent Riders came and people started to worship their awesomeness. except for the elves who find the powerful monsters very suspicious. When two of the riders left, the remaining one gets his cult to hunt them down. As the world gets destroyed, one man decides to stand up and kill the wizard. At least it's a fantasy setting and not with massive guns for a change.\n\nGameplay\n\nIt's DOOM with a few new things so lets talk about those: For starters you have an inventory to store items like health packs or invincibility rings, which allow to use them when you need to, unlike DOOM when it's used when you touch them. The weapons are mostly the same from DOOM except no shotgun or BFG, but one power-up called the Tome of Power allows you to use a secondary firing mode, such as turning your lightning gaulents into a life draining weapon or turning you chaingun equal into a weapon that shots multiple mines on impact. So we have a inventory and weapon modes. What else is new. Oh, you can FLY!! But it's only used to find secrets.\n\nThe enemies are also a step up from DOOM. These guys are designed to kill. We start with some flying imps and golems that just scratch you, then we meet guys that throw stuff, then ones that shot three balls at the same time and then the first guys start shooing fireballs, and so on. And that's not talking about the bosses which are a league of their own. These are some of the hardest bosses I've seen in a shooter and freak me out whenever I see some. Sure the Cyderdemon was cool but he's nothing compare to the Maulotaur with his giant hammer, fire attacks and charge attacks.\n\nIf there's any gripes I have with the game is that the levels have a pattern. What I mean is that it's yellow key, green key, blue key in any level in that order. This cause the levels to be dull after a while.\n\nPresentation\n\nMusic is okay. there are some good tracks here, but they're nothing compare to anything from DOOM and start to sound the same after a while. The art design is mainly brown and grey but there's also a lot of blue, especially later in the game when we get to the underwater lair.Speaking of which, the Serpent Rider is everywhere. you constantly see his statues, his picture and symbol wherever you go.\nAlso, this is one of the goriest games I've played. Almost every enemies blows into tiny bits when kill. Sure other games have some prettying graphic kill animations but I could still recognize the corpse.\n\nVerdict\n\nIt's a good DOOM clone with several improvements. If you love DOOM I recommended giving it a try.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1429886938, "timestamp_updated": 1429886938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599677", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15329164": {"recommendationid": "15329164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043108500", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 162, "playtime_forever": 1210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428856364}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is by far amazing, its originally a doom mod so of course you will expect alot of things from this game. The gameplay gives off that doom feeling (without respawning though those who plays Doom on nightmare mode), and the amount of enemies they added in the game is truly insane. This is something a hardcore first person shooter would have, intense action.\n\nThe game is quite fun and i would definitely recommend anyone playing it. Keep noted, the setup is not like modern games so make sure you know what you are doing. Otherwise, go search up on google or check the Steam community for some help. If you know any friends that knows how to do the setup on binding keys and disabling mouse movement, let them know. Its possible to modernize some controls, but remember to put in the keys that are comfortable for you to use and easy to remember.\n\nI mean at first i was like \"meh\" because of how it looks which put me in the \"ok\" position. But dang, after playing through certain levels with bunch of enemies, the adrenaline has kicked in and I went full carnage the same way i did in Doom.

It's all beautiful. Except for the enemies, that is. :p Now you may wonder why \"1 hour?\"...because of ZDoom, I can't run the Steam's executable so I added ZDoom's to my library. I played this game A LOT in my childhood along with many other FPS classics, hence why I find it all so beautiful, I used to be astonished and find everything just so amazing to look at when I was that young. Especially the water and the paneling on Episode 3. I must've spent over a week of gameplay in my life so far, I look forward to many more hours! Anyway, enough about my experiences, I ABSOLUTELY recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Doom, old as the 90s' games, medieval FPSes, and I encourage everyone that enjoys FPSes simply because this is the best of both worlds. Medieval FPS that has an inventory system, (unfortunately, though, you only have one per item left in your inventory after each level's done which REALLY sucks) and its textures for the maps are just great for their age, so if anyone who's artistically interested in video games, this is one of them. Of course its old, but if you don't mind old then its great! Also has an alright replay value, its levels can be memorable, sure, but the gameplay doesn't really get old. Finish the game once, let some time pass, (whatever's necessary to make you forget how some of the levels are laid out) replay it again. How much fun, right?...but if you don't enjoy it that much then I dunno, must be my nostalgia goggles or something. :p Anyway, yeah, amazing game, (for its time?

If you're here for an authentic, 1990s experience, no additional work is required, but to anyone not willing to adapt to these oldschool pre-WASD controls, you must download a sourceport to run the game. The sourceport I personally recommend is GZDoom, as it has an enormous amount of settings allowing for you to adjust the game to your very specific needs. This includes simple things such as mouselook support, remapping controls but even allows for things such as online multiplayer. Running the game through the sourceport is as simple as downloading it, then launching the WAD file through the sourceport. You will obtain this WAD file through your Steam download of the game. Unfortunately, running the game through the sourceport will not track your in-game time on Steam, which should explain the measly amount of play time I have myself. Either way, for the best experience playing Heretic, HeXen, or any Doom engine game, using a sourceport is the way to go. Others include ZDoom, Zandronum, and Chocolate Heretic.\n\nHeretic is a classic 90s first-person shooter built on the Doom engine. Unsurprisingly, base gameplay is very similar Doom / Doom II. You kill monsters, flick switches, solve puzzles and acquire keys to navigate your way through each level, however, Heretic introduces some fantastic mechanics which are absent in the oldschool Doom games. The version of Heretic available on Steam is the Shadow of the Serpent Riders release, which offers two additional episodes not included in the original release, simply titled Heretic. This is an obvious benefit as it simply means, more gameplay. Looking through the character, Corvus', loadout, it's clear to see all the weapons are very similar in function to the Doom weapons, and it's the same for most of the monsters also. Most of the weapons work great, and have very unique functionality. My main complaint being that the Ethereal Crossbow, the weapon you'll likely be using the most, is very weak and often takes multiple shots to kill common enemies. This, however, is definitely balanced by the other weapons in the loadout, and the various powerups you'll find throughout maps.\n\nIn terms of Doom engine mechanics introduced by Heretic, an inventory system is a very significant one. In Heretic, powerup items are stored in your inventory when picked up, allowing for you to activate them at any given time during each map. This also allows for certain items to be carried across from one map to another. This is a definite improvement upon Doom's powerup system, allowing for more tactical gameplay. Heretic also introduces wings, an item which allows you to fly across the map. As a result of this, enemies having infinite height was removed. Again, a definite improvement upon the Doom games, with flying definitely adding a unique and enjoyable flavour of gameplay, not found in the original Doom games. Another notable powerup is the Tome of Power. When activated, this gives your weapons each a unqiue improvement for a temporary time period, allowing for yet again, very enjoyable gameplay. A good example of the Tome of Power's effect on a weapon would be on the Gauntlets of the Necromancer. With the Tome of Power activated, the Gauntlets increase in strength, and will also heal the player as they are used to kill an enemy.\n\nMost certainly, there is very little this game does wrong. The game has a great theme and feel, offering unique and entertaining gameplay not seen in other Doom engine games. Music is tremendous, sprinting allows for fast-paced progression, difficulties are well balanced, all weapons are great and have different advantages in different situations. The list goes on. Heretic is definitely a must-buy for oldschool FPS lovers, and definitely a great introduction to anyone interested in classic Doom engine games. I personally feel you must take the time to get to grips with each weapon and powerup, and develop a decent understanding of the game for maximum enjoyment.

In many ways, its status as a mod is obvious: the crossbow functions exactly the same as the shotgun, the Phoenix Rod is a rocket launcher, and so on. It plays like Doom as well: the game is broken into multiple episodes of 8 levels + 1 bonus. You go through collecting keys and finding secrets until you reach the exit. Killing anything and everything you can along the way, of course. Many of the items are similar as well: maps, invisibility, invulnerability, etc. etc.\n\nThis isn't to say that Heretic is just a re-skinned Doom wad. Heretic introduces brand new enemies and items. While many of the enemies are tweaked Doom enemies, there are new ones, such as the Iron Lich and the Ophidian. New items introduce new concepts, such as flight and emergency teleportation. Plus you can turn your enemies into chickens, and who doesn't love doing that? There is also the Tome of Power, which alters weapons for a short time. Some simply become more powerful, but others have different functionality. For example, the Phoenix Rod goes from a long range rocket launcher to a short range flamethrower, while the Gauntlets let you suck the life out of enemies.\n\nWhere Heretic really shines isn't the gameplay mechanics, but the level design. First of all, they are just gorgeous. Second of all, they are a technical accomplishment as well. The use of shadows and texture is excellent, which really creates a completely immersive atmosphere. You have everything from buildings, to narrow caves and alleys, to massive fields. The enemies are placed to work best with the current situation, so you always have a fight to deal with before you can admire the view.\n\nOverall, Heretic is a bit harder than Doom, though the difference between the very easy and very hard settings is enormous. On very easy, as long as you don't forget to pause the game before you wander off for lunch, you probably won't die, though there are a few spots where you can take quite a beating. On the highest difficulty, it makes Legendary mode on Halo look like a walk in the park.\n\nThere are only one issue: the game was made at a time when 800x600 was considered a high resolution. If you try and play it through Steam, you'll barely be able to tell what's going on because it's so pixelated. After buying the game, download ZDoom, which bumps up the resolution and offers a few other features. It's a free download and setting it up consists of copying the Heretic IWad file into the ZDoom directory.", "timestamp_created": 1411937785, "timestamp_updated": 1411937785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12224393": {"recommendationid": "12224393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079085645", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406046287}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Doom Medieval", "timestamp_created": 1411591051, "timestamp_updated": 1411591051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12204550": {"recommendationid": "12204550", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968668459", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411484676}, "language": "english", "review": "If you tried to like Doom but aren't big in to SciFi, Heretic is the fantasy FPS you should've looked for back in 1994!!!

With that being said however, the game's atmosphere doesn't really stray from cobblestone-bricked castles, dungeons, catacombs and sewers. That's not to say that they're boring; a nice atmosphere of horror and Dark Souls-esque hopelessness is present here. It can just feel a bit monotonous to see recycled and similar-looking textures, battling the exact same enemies repeatedly with one or two more thrown in during each episode, and hearing the same music again and again. The overbearing use of grey isn't very appealing to the eyes either. With that being said though the maps are really big and sprawling with cleverly placed traps and treasure to run into. I'm also a huge fan of the crisp sound effects, minimalist but funny and charming voice acting, well detailed graphics and the designs of the enemies and environments which draw obvious influence from medieval art.

'that's where it all began' but there's more creativity behind Heretic.More use of color,nice variety of enemies.the weapons seemed more interesting,eerie  soundtrack.If you like the Doom games I

Would recommend to anyone who enjoys old FPS games like Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM, etc. \n\nGreat game!\n\nEdit:\n\nThis is an aside, scroll past this paragraph if you want to get on to my actual review:\n\nWhenever I first had this review I definitely wasn't out of my shell as I am now with my opinion and how I word things than I am now, so I think that I'll write a better review now that I can fully explain my thoughts without fear of someone not liking what I have to say about this game or any game whatsoever. People should consider the fact that whenever people review a game that's just what they thought of the game and it shouldn't actually dictate whether they liked the game or not. For instance, there was a game called Alone in the Dark which came out in 2008 and I absolutely loved this game. While I loved this game, the public seemed to not care for it whatsoever. I think that if you're able to get into a game that not many people like but that you like for some reason for another, that's wonderful because then you've actually achieved the ability to discern whether or not you like a video game based upon your own experience and not necessarily based on public opinion. It's nice to just think for yourself, you guys! \n\n\nOn to my actual review of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders. So this is the first installment of a series which is also excellent called Hexen. You should definitely look into Hexen if you find this game to be interested. I'm sure that you're aware of Hexen if you've done your research on this game and you've played this game, etc. But Heretic is a DOOM-esque game (The reason why I describe it that way because that is a common ground that most people can understand) and it is primarily based around you being a magician or a sorcerer of sorts just killing baddies. It's like Shadow Warrior, Doom, and all that. Except this is more for people who enjoy fantasy games.\n\nNow with all this I personally don't think that there are many drawbacks in this game, because at the time this game was pretty top notch, whereas now people might look at this game and laugh. I don't, despite the fact that I did discover it past the 2000s. \n\nAbout this game, I would say look into gameplay videos to see what it's about, check out when it was published, and do research on it before buying it. I know that impulse buying is a vice of mine so that's why I say that in practically all of my reviews.\n\nThis game is definitely a change for more modern gamers and maybe you woudln't even be able to adjust to a game like this, and I totally understand that. I wouldn't blame you for not really wanting to get into something that modern gamers may consider \"a step below\" the dynamics, graphics and level of gaming that we are at now. \n\nHeretic does hold a special place in my heart and it is a pretty neat game.

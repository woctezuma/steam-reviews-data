This ends up making the game more difficult in a way, especially by the later levels, but it's a pure, fair, and classic sort of difficulty.\n\nThe general aesthetic, which includes graphic+UI design and music, is as pleasant and relaxing as any other minimalist puzzle game. The puzzles are short and sweet enough to play in a few convenient minutes of your time, and there is enough pure difficulty from the way the game is designed so as to never really be reduced into a few algorithmic strategies. \n\nYou can also unlock a rather difficult Daily Levels pack after you finish the game too, so the game does have its replay value.\n\nAll in all, a solid puzzle game.

But this should be one of the last ones you read. After this paragraph or so of text, you're going to scroll upwards, buy this game, and enjoy your life. \n\nJust do it.\n\n[h1]What is this thing you call a \"Chess\"?[/h1]\nKNIGHTS is a game about, you guessed it, moving knight pieces on little checkered puzzle boards. Do you need to know jack about chess? Not really, but it helps if you've played a few casual games, just so you're familiar with a Knight's moves, since it's definitely the least intuitive of the pieces. But, even if you've never played a game of chess in your life, this game indicates quite clearly which spaces you can and can't move to.\n\n[h1]But is it any good though?[/h1]\nKNIGHTS takes the mechanics of moving a knight chess piece, and builds a fantastic little puzzler around it. Your task is to move knights to certain preallocated positions, which gradually becomes more and more complex as your chessboard shrinks, and the number of pieces increases. You can do this by just brute-force clicking at everything you can until it works, which is only viable for the earlier puzzles, or carefully try to map out how you want things to look like X moves from now, and work backwards. At the point I'm at, about 2 hours in, I'd go crazy if I even attempted to brute-force these monsters...\n\nThe game also apparently has dailies, which I haven't looked at too much so far. These might have varying difficulties day to day (the was Duet does it), or  just a set difficulty. I'll update this review on my thoughts on dailies once I give them a look. At a glance, though, just that should be enough to add a good number of hours to your time with this game.\n\n[h1]What can you even buy with a dollar anymore in America?[/h1]\nReally, it's just a fun and cue little puzzle game for a dollar.

The puzzles are all logically solvable, and in the King pack in particular, random movements to attempt a solve will generally not yield the desired fruit. As the game is based upon a single concept I found it easier to play in short bursts, rather than try to solve 100+ similar puzzles one after another.

The base mechanic is incredibly simple and easy to pick up. But make no mistake - this is not a casual puzzle game where you can mindlessly brute-force yourself to victory - the chess-style movement means you can easily find yourself trapped in a loop. Once you've gotten over the initial confusion, patterns start to emerge. With a little planning, careful thought and clever management of your empty spaces you'll still find success rather easily.\n\nThe 82 pre-made levels are pretty much an optimal length. They provide a nice progression and never really feel boring. The game also features an endless mode in the form of randomly generated daily levels (75 of them each day), although I wasn't blown away by them. Even though they variy widly in difficulty, they feel very samey and tiresome as they are always on 5x5 grids and have 2 or 3 spaces empty. I would have liked customisation for difficulty, grid size and difficulty (empty tiles). But this is a very minor gripe as the price-tag leaves nothing to be desired. You get a [b]lot[/b] of bang for your buck, even at full retail price. My playtime of 7-8 hours includes beating the game, around 30 daily levels and getting all the achievements.\n\nThe game is technically solid. It has a pleasant and consistent style in terms of visuals and sound, sometimes even a little too much style. The initial load time feels long and the fade-out upon closing the game is pretty annoying.

I happen to like these types of games so that first part didn't apply to me. If this disclaimer doesn't apply to you then feel free to read onwards!\n\nWow! What a fantastic game! I absolutely loved this game for the idea of the game and how well it was executed. I've got a lot more to say about it, but I'll run through a list of the pros and cons of the game first.\n\nPros:\n- Low Price \nFor only 1 dollar off sale and even less when it\u2019s on sale, this game is quite worth it! Imo it could be a little bit more on the shop and I still would have bought it!\n- Fantastic Idea\nI've loved the puzzles that deal with the knight piece from Chess for the longest time, but the idea of putting a bunch of them on a chessboard and then working puzzles around them was also awesome. It was especially rewarding that one of the achievements led to you thinking a little bit outside the box on a certain level as well.\n- Infinite replaying\nEven though I'm not really sure how it works, it seems that there are 75 new puzzles generated for the game for each different day! I didn't play through a whole bunch of them but I did notice the changes between the different days, and (bonus!) the puzzles are still quite challenging.\n- Colorblind mode\nI feel that a lot of games of this type don't give too much thought to the colorblind players of the game, but I really enjoy that this dev took the time to make a separate colour palette so that everyone could enjoy the game.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of \"saving\"\nThe only real problem that I had with this game is that there wasn't any way to save the progress that you made with a given level. It was a little bit annoying knowing that if you started a level you were stuck there and had to finish it up before you could step away again (otherwise you'd lose all progress).\n\nOverall, I'd say the execution, idea, and time that were put into making this game make it a fantastic buy and the low price makes it that much better in the end. If you can get it on sale, that's cool but it's worth it even if it isn't! Overall, a solid 9.5/10 and like I said if there was \"save mechanic\" this game would have gotten a 10/10 from me!\n", "timestamp_created": 1500240438, "timestamp_updated": 1500240438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33482148": {"recommendationid": "33482148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102784274", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499875696}, "language": "english", "review": "KNIGHTS is a simple, minimalist puzzle with a distinct charm.\n\nHowever, considering there is nothing else to the game besides the singular, repetitive mechanic, I don't feel that the game provides value beyond being an interesting concept for chess fans. \n\nThe game ends once you complete/leave it, and your work is lost forever, which is disappointing.

Plastic is also really bad for the environment. \nIt's estimated that there'll be more plastic than fish in the oceans in 2050, so definetely don't dump the plastic-wrapped bodies there. \n\nYou solve the puzzles by moving your different coloured knight to their designed spots; and of course, you only move 2 steps ahead + 1 sidestep - Or 1 sidestep + 2 front leaps. \nSounds easy? \nWell some levels are easy, some will get you stuck until you close the game and your eyes; shutting your brain down while feeling utterly defeated by a 2D puzzle game; usually happens on mondays because F*ck mondays. \n\n[h1] King's approval\t[/h1]\nGood variety of puzzles\nThere's even new daily puzzles, so the game never ends.

My. God.   I just finished Knights, and my brain hurts. It really does.   I don't get much time to play games, so I have to cram everything at the weekend.   Thinking in \"L\" shaped patterns, and working out chains of moves is NOT my forte!  Let's just get it out there: I suck at chess.  I really do.  I once put a chess computer on \"zero ply\" (which is AI-speak for 'don't be clever, just move random pieces to places they can go), and I still didn't manage to win.  \n\nSo, a game which is all about trying to put pieces in a specific location is supremely brain-busting for me.    Nevertheless, I persevered through, and managed to finish the main game.   \n\nThe game is split into five 'levels', and each level has between 9 and 30 'boards'.. Each board is set up so that you have to move knight chess pieces around in order to put the red or blue knights back onto their red or blue squares.   Sounds easy?  Well, to begin with,  it is :)  \n\nPretty soon, bit of the board become un-usable, and then there are yellow knights whose sole purpose is to get in the way.   Once the little yellow b*****ds turn up, the game starts to turn into a really brain-bending challenge, because you often have to move a bunch of yellows out of the way, in a specific chain in order to get your coloured knight into the right spot.\n\nAs the game continues, you start to 'see' patterns.  There are ways to get your knight from one spot to another spot at a relative position away.  There are some hard moves (moving immediately next door) and easy ones (moving two squares away, or to your diagonal neighbour )..   Once you start to see the patterns, the game starts to flow a little better, and all of a sudden you begin to 'see' the chains of moves you need to make, and before long you're planning ahead to get the knight where you want it to be.   I guess it's sort of like a kingergarten level sense of 'ply' that real chess players have when they can scan the board, and plot a number of moves in advance.\n\nHowever, chess masters can simulate the moves in their heads, which normos like me can't so the game really helps by allowing you to 'see' the valid target jumps for a knight by clicking on it, and doing chains is easy because you can just keep clicking the place you want to move it to.  moving back and forth incurs no penalties, so you can move things about all over the place.    One of the most frustrating things is that the boards can be set up so that specific knights have to be in place before you tackle others.  It's vitally important in the later levels that you nail those first, or you're just going to spin for ages, moving one piece all over the shop.\n\nI'd say my experience to begin with was very impressed by the way you could 'milk' a game out of one chess piece.  This turned into being impressed by the way the board managed to be set up in increasing ways.  This turned into being impressed by how the boards are set up beautifully, but are, indeed, solvable, when they REALLY shouldn't be.   This then turned into dogged determinism to get the darned game finished.   Yes, I have to admit, midway through the 'queen' level, I started to really struggle.  I'd say the estimated time to complete a board started out at about 10 seconds, and midway through 'queen' ended up being a solid 10 to 15 minutes.   Strangely,  by the end of queen, I'd really started to get back into whatever flow you need, and the king level was relatively easy compared to queen.\n\nOnce you get to (say) Queen level, you are well-enough armed to tackle the Daily puzzles.  Like Lyne, Race the sun,  and a few other indie puzzlers, the daily puzzles are all procedurally generated.  The first one I tried was solved in two clicks.  The next one had be beat.  The difficulty level is all over the place, because the computer doesn't know what makes a level hard for a human.  What's really impressive is that the designers have figured out how to make boards procedurally generate that are still solvable!\n\nI really enjoyed this game, and despite my frustration in 'queen', I think it's well worth a play if you like logic and puzzle problems:  Especially if you like chess, or just like indie puzzlers like Lyne.", "timestamp_created": 1490530508, "timestamp_updated":

A simple enough to pick up and relaxing experience. The goal for each level is to set each of the colored knights into a space of their corresponding color. Forethought and future planning are key abilities to master for later puzzles. New ways to tackle a problem will gradually evident as the game progresses, allowing several solutions for the same puzzle.\n\nWonderful game with a very comfortable learning curve. Player is given positive and wholesome encouragement as he/she progresses through the game. Calming background music. Provides daily puzzles for more end game content. Highly recommended. I spent only little under an hour playing this game back in the day, and must say i enjoyed it so much i went back to it and began playing again. Hightly recommed! This is the type of casual puzzle games I love. If you liked Lyne, you're going to enjoy this. Visually pleasing, the difficulty seems to be well balanced and it's cheap, so what are you waiting for ? Just get it. Outstanding puzzle game. Simple and Clean. Well worth the buy.

Basically, that's similar to the advice of doing the barrel roll, if we talk about games in general. Now, I have the game where I can move the horses all the day long. I mean, knights.\n\nAs you all know, the chess knight moves in the \"L\" shaped path, and sometimes it is the most chaotic and unpredictable figure on the chess board. Some good chess players I know even value the knight lower than bishop - only because they cannot foresee the outcome of using the knights in their game. So they are tending to drop them off in the first occasion...\n\nKnights game is all about learning how the chess knights are moving, what they can and what they can't do. But it's not only a small class to learn how to play chess! KNIGHTS is a damn good small puzzle game, easy at start and quite challenging after some time. Therefore, I highly recommend it to everyone who can play little puzzle games, as it's one of the best in that genre.\n\nIt's also quite a good gift to other players, if you're into gifts!

The game is very good for its style and its puzzles. The game also has a lot of replay value.\n\nKnights is in a chess style, with the only pieces being knights that you move, this style is accompanied by a chessboard that the pieces lay on. The knights thus move in the same way they do in chess, this is a very good game mechanic, as it gives you something you are familier with, such as a chess knight, and making you use it differently, as in these puzzles. This use of only the knight is interesting, as it is the only piece in chess that can jump over blocked pieces, as it moves the strangest out of all the pieces, thus giving it a special interest.\n\nThe puzzles in Knights are very fun, and challenging, you have to move the red knights into the red spaces, and the blue knights into the blue spaces, which is easy at first, but it ends up getting challenging quickley (as this is a bloody video game!), and you need to find new ways to move pieces around to achieve the end goal. Eventually more obstcles are introduced, such as blocked spaces, and outcast knights (with no space to go, so they end up getting in the way).\n\nKnights has a system that is not unlike Lyne's, where you unlock daily puzzles. These daily puzzles help to provide much more replay value. If you finish the main puzzles, you can just play the daily puzzles. The only problem I have encountered with the daily puzzles thus far is that, because they are randomly generated, they will sometimes be generated solved. I am unaware if I have come across an impossible puzzle, as it's hard to tell if my failure is from a lack of skill or the lack of solvability. A massive pro to having daily puzzles is if a puzzle is too hard, you can always wait till tomorrow to get a puzzle matching your skill level, and you are not unable to progress.\n\nOverall Knights is a very well made game, if you enjoy puzzle games like Lyne, Knights is a great choice, or even if you love a game of chess, Knights will be a familier friend.

The game is about moving red and blue knights over boards of chess to red/blue highlighted tiles, as in a game of chess, knights can only move in L-shaped direction (2 tiles straight and then 1 tile to side), the knights can jump over whatever it's standing in their way, as long as the tile they're meant to go to is empty. To clear a level, every red knight has to stand in a red tile, as well as every blue knight in blue tile (the easiest  levels only contain knights of 1 color). \n\nWhat to expect of the base game (level packs and levels):\nThere are 82 levels in the base part of the game total divided into 5 level packs - the pawn pack, the rook pack, the bishop pack, the queen pack and the king pack. With pawn being easiest to king being hardest, resembling to value of the chess figures (rook is easier than bishop). Why exactly 82 levels? It's rather simple, allow me to explain: Pawn pack is the easiest, the board sizes in pawn pack are 3x3 tiles, so 9 tiles total, there are 9 levels in the pawn pack. Rook is on 4x3 tile sized boards, meaning there are 12 tiles and levels. Bishop is 4x4 (16 levels), queen is 5x4 (20 levels) and king is 5x5 (25 levels).\nIf you struggle with one specific level, you can always skip it and return to it later or not return to it at all, as unlocking new pack doesn't require you to complete all levels in the pack you are in, only most of the levels in a pack have to be completed in order to unlock a next one.\n\nAdditional information about the levels:\nBut of course, to make every one of the levels unique and more and more challenging as the game gets harder, most of the levels have some tiles on the board blocked, meaning no knight figure can access them. Even later in the game (starting from queen pack), there will also be yellow knights. It doesn't matter where yellow knights stand at all. They are there just to make the game harder for you by blocking the red and blue knights resulting in more trouble of getting them to the highlighted tiles. Of course you can move the yellow knights, but also only in the L-shaped ways. You can reset and exit any level at any time, everything auto-saves.\n\nDaily levels:\nThe game has also a feature that automatically generates completely random 75 levels you can play everyday, divided into 3 25-level packs. Pack A, B and C. Those packs reset daily and have no influence on the main packs that are the same forever.\n\nMotivational words:\nUpon pausing the game or finishing any of the main packs, you are given motivational texts, being reminded how capable you are, really nice little addition to the game.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGame's design:\n\nBefore launching the game, you'll see a small options window allowing you to set the graphic settings, the resolution of the game, and whether you want the game to be windowed or not. Even on the highest graphic settings and resolution, the game design is still so simple that every computer/laptop without exception could run it.\n\nThe music was great to the theme of the game. Simple and calming.\n\nOverall the way the game looks is just the way a puzzle game like KNIGHTS should look like in my opinion.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary of pros & cons:\n\nPros:\n-Great and challenging puzzles, over 3 hours of fun in levels of various difficulties\n-Easy to run on any PC\n-Nice base price of 0.99\u20ac, discounted to 0.49\u20ac during sales\n-Very easy to understand\n-Ideal for people of all ages, from children to elders\n-Great atmosphere of the game, relaxing music and fitting graphics\n-Almost endless, considering there are 75 new levels automatically generated every day\n-Great motivational texts \n\nCons:\n-Being a simple puzzle game could also make the game repetitive and boring for some people\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinal words:\nI did not know what to expect of the game when I've been buying it for the discounted price of 0.49\u20ac, but after starting it, I could almost instantly tell the game is great. I got more addicted to it than I would expect and even though I'm generally not a big fan of puzzle games, I really couldn't help myself but to leave this one a positive review. Definitely worth buying even its full price, though waiting for a 50% discount can always work too. Since the game also drops trading cards, big % of the game's price will still return to you through selling the trading cards, even though the game itself is already pretty cheap. If you are a big fan of puzzle games, I'd suggest to give KNIGHTS a shot as soon as you're able to, I am pretty sure you won't regret it.\n\nThis is my second serious game review I've written on steam.

If you don't have a love of puzzles and/or chess and even if you do, you still might not like the game. Reasoning, the game starts out pretty simple and most of the puzzles are easy. The player can plot out there moves and solve the puzzle. Later on the game becomes complicated enough that it is impossible to do this and you can find yourself randomly moving pieces until you find the correct solution. Or as it came down for me, I would work on getting one knight into his proper spot and then moving on to the next knight. Doing so makes the game lose some of the puzzle discovery lose its edge (feels more like chance). The game is kind of extremely short as far as the regular puzzles go. There are daily levels once you reach a certain point which is nice, but all in all I'm going to give this the thumbs down.

One of the best 1\u20ac games out there.\n\nA solid 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1481303131, "timestamp_updated": 1481303131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532174", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28259975": {"recommendationid": "28259975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116195446", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498930210}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0430", "timestamp_created": 1481231287, "timestamp_updated": 1481231287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28233519": {"recommendationid": "28233519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111654939", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481104141}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game to get all the achievements for.

Es kann schon mal etwas kniffelig werden, sich dabei nicht selbst im Weg zu stehen.\n\nHat man alle Level durch, gibt es auch noch die zuf\u00e4lligen, t\u00e4glichen Level, die man spielen kann.

While it looks like a chess game, it plays similar to a sliding puzzle in the sense that you make sequential moves and have to deal with spatial constraints.\n\nThe game features 82 levels, subdivided into 5 level packs: \n- Pawn: 9 levels\n- Rook: 12 levels \n- Bishop: 16 levels \n- Queen: 20 levels \n- King: 25 levels \n\nIt took me about 6 hours to unlock everything, at the time of writing this review I have access to the daily levels and I still have 23 King levels left to do.\n\nA very nice feature of this game is the fact that it offers new levels daily, which are randomly generated. However, the daily puzzles are only unlocked after beating the Queen level pack, which is relatively late in the game. The reason for this is the introduction of yellow ''obstacle'' knights in the Queen levels. I think that the unlocking of daily puzzles should occur after completing a few Queen levels, and not the whole pack.\n\nThe UI is minimalistic, which is nice, but could do with a few extras such as a redo button or an overlay to make some notes or scribbles on. \n\nThis is a nice puzzle game with a lot of playable levels and the price is fair.

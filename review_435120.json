Really bizarre narrative about murdering animals and feeding their meat to other animals. Not really sure what the point was. Never heard of the game before but it was on sale for Halloween, and I thought it might be a bizarre, interesting game. \n\nIt certainly is, but aparently this is a series of games, many of which are not marketed on Steam. Thus, I have the same/similar problem with this game as I did Lisa - this is not an overly privvy title to bring on newcomers. The ending to the game was entirely unsatisfactory and basically told me to enter a code in to one of their other titles to get some more story. \n\nSo why am I recommending this? Simple. At it's core, it's a weird, macabre \"escape the room\" game that's $2 regular price. Strictly as a puzzle game, it's entertaining. Some people think the puzzles are really obtuse or impossible to figure out. I would politely disagree with that. There are certainly some parts in each room that can leave you scratching your head, but all of the puzzles are DEFINITELY attainable without any sort of guide. Because of this, the game is worth the $2 price tag. \n\nAlso, don't let the hours played fool you. I left the game on for at least 3 hours while I went off to do something else. Depending on how much difficulty you have with the puzzles, I'd say the gameplay is 1-2 hours.\n\nTo sum up, it's a cheap bit of puzzle entertainment with a weird twist a lot of puzzle games don't have. The story is not really there and the ending feels more like what you might see on a Saturday morning serial cartoon rather than a fully fleshed out end.

Presumably. Who you are or what your name is never gets established. Your only job, apparently, is killing off the guests one by one and serving them for dinner the next day. Why? Who knows.\n\nRusty Lake Hotel was the first commercial entry for a longrunning series of free games. This was my first foray into Rusty Lake's setting, so it's possible those who have prior experience with the games might better understand what's happening. Still, just the tiniest of hints about what's going on, to make the game more accessible to newcomers, would have been quite welcome.\n\nThe lack of guidance extends to the gameplay as well. The puzzles in Rusty Lake Hotel can be as surreal as its setting. Sometimes that works, forcing you to think outside the box in novel ways. Sometimes it really doesn't. I frequently had to use the built-in walkthrough to get through a chapter.\n\nLet me give you an example how how obtuse the puzzles can get. In one chapter, I got stuck trying to find tabasco sauce so I could make an anthropomorphized deer his drink. (Yes, the entire game is that weird.) The solution? Click on the antlers of the deer skull mounted on the wall until tabasco sauce runs from its nose. [i] Of course. [/i]\n\nThere's barely a plot to speak of, either. Not only do you not know why you're murdering all these guests, they themselves don't appear to care. Each morning, if you choose to click on the remaining characters, they recite the exact same line as they did on the first day. None of them ever comment on the way their numbers are dwindling. Killing them barely affected me, because they didn't feel the slightest bit like people, just cartoon props.\n\nTL;DR: I'd advise those interested to skip straight to Rusty Lake Roots instead.

That makes it all the more refreshing when a game takes a more cerebral approach to murder, such as with a sophisticated murder mystery. If you\u2019ve come to Rusty Lake Hotel looking for that, however, you\u2019re not going to get much more than the appearance of sophistication. There are hints of something special here, but it\u2019s obfuscated by a thin plot, awkward puzzles, and literal boar shit.\n\nYou are introduced to the proprietor of the Rusty Lake Hotel, one Mr. Owl, as he guides a raft of five guests across the quiet waters to their lodgings. Each of the animal-faced visitors has their own reason for attending Mr. Owl\u2019s gathering, and it\u2019s your job to attend to their needs during their stay. Every evening the guests will set down to dinner, and then afterwards you will follow one of them to their room to assist them in some way. There is an ulterior motive to your service, of course, and it will see more and more vacancies open at the hotel as you progress.\n\nSpoiler alert for the main plot which you will learn about maybe five minutes into the game: The hotel has no main dishes to serve the guests, and said guests happen to be comprised of delicious meats. Whatever you may have been imagining about mysteries and intrigue, you can dump it because what you are actually doing here is murdering guests to feed to other guests. Most of the game takes place in the five rooms of the visitors, where a complex series of puzzles and brain-teasers will allow you to engineer a fatal encounter with the occupant and harvest their flesh. The next day you serve it to whoever remains, and then roll on to the next unlucky critter.\n\nThat makes the meat (heh) of the game the puzzles, and this is where most people are going to stumble. Each room is four walls covered with shelves, portraits, tables, and other decor that will be clicked upon and used to eventually kill someone. Expect plenty of locked cabinets with hidden keys, letter and number substitution puzzles, classics like unlabeled weights and measuring water out, and using strange items on other items. About half the puzzles are pretty logical and easy to spot but the other half is the killer, requiring you to click on sprouts until they randomly blossom into keys, or click on toy monkeys in a specific order, or look out a window at the right time, or feed a boar shit sandwich to the boar who shat it out. And let me assure you, I do not possess the capacity to make that last one up.\n\nMr. Boar\u2019s room was where I almost gave up on the game, between the fecal snack and the bleeding toilet and the insipid, confusing puzzle-locked cabinets. I stuck with it to see where the game went and I\u2019m happy to report that the ending is interesting, even if the means of getting there were not. Rusty Lake Hotel feels like an excerpt or aside from a much longer tale, one that needs context that isn\u2019t given anywhere. Things happens because they HAVE to happen to advance the plot, not because they make sense. There\u2019s a dark aura to the proceedings but the ridiculous elements like animal heads and poop take the Lynchian edge off and make it all feel awkward and arbitrary.\n\nThis one rides the line between yea and nay moreso than any other game I\u2019ve reviewed thus far. It\u2019s mechanically thin, the puzzles are poorly designed, and what little story there is is tainted by absurdity. But once you understand what it expects of you and what it offers it becomes a much smoother ride, and honestly the ending was a very bright point of darkness that helped color the game in retrospect. It\u2019s hard to recommend but I don\u2019t regret playing it in the end, and I must admit I\u2019m interested in seeing what the rest of the series can offer.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Had similar hopes for Rusty Lakes Hotel but was to be sadly disappointed.\n\nIt has the same quirky artwork and surreal (macarbre) settings which is fine but the game suffers from a HUGE problem\n\nThat is, you can not SAVE the game and it's own AUTOSAVE funstion is totally f***ed up.\n\nTo explain . . .\n\nYour task is to collect the cooking ingredients for a variety of meals (3 ingredients each)\nThere are essentially 2 location areas.  There's the downstairs lobby and the upstairs rooms.\nFor some of the menus, the ingredients you need are both in the lobby and in the bedrooms.\n\nThe way the game works is that once you enter a bedroom, it locks the door and YOU CAN NOT LEAVE THE ROOM until you have collected the \"meat\" element of the recipe for that room.  This is an immediate problem.  If you didn't realise that one of the ingredients was downstairs and you've entered the bedroom there is no NO WAY to complete the full recipe (for which you gain 3 stars).   It's insane.  You even get to go back downstairs after you leave the bedroom but the item you wanted can not then be acquired.\n\nThere's a similar problem with the order in which things MUST be done if you want to achieve the full list of 3 ingredients for each recipe.   For example in one room, you get a knife and you use it help you get into a box.  However it is also used to rip open a picture on the wall.  Guess what, if you open the box first then the knife stays there and can't be picked up again.  Result you can't complete the recipe.  WTF?!   There is literally no clue about this unspoken order that is required, you thus are forced to keep redoing the \"level\" (bedroom) until you get it right.  There is however a HUGE BUT . . . .\n\nWhen you go to reload from the autosave it puts you back into the bedroom before you touched anything which seems great until you realise that your inventory is MISSING THE INGREDIENT  that you previously first picked up in the lobby !!!   So once again you now can not complete the full recipe to gain your 3 stars.   At this point you are totally stuffed.  Your only choice now is to restart the entire ****ing game !\n\nSorry but this is simply ridiculous.\n\nAny player is going to want to at least be able to complete the game and do it properly to earn all the stars.   However it simply isn't possible due to that broken autosave problem.  \n\nAfter 3 bedrooms I had to abandon this.   I could put up with reloading specific bedrooms, if that actually worked, but having to restart the entire bloody game over and over to get a perfect score is just ludicrous.\n\nA shame as Roots was a lovely game.

Some will say \"but you'll understand if you play the Cube Escape games!\" but I say \"Then it should be bundled with those game\". Even then, any kind of side-game should still be even somewhat entertaining and understandable to some degree on its own. This game, isn't.\n\nThe puzzles range from actual brain-teasing to 100% random, to click-everywhere-until-something-happens-maybe. I enjoyed the puzzles that used legitimate logic, but some were either random and you had to find by accident, or completely betrayed the game's earlier use of logic. I won't spoil any of them, but by the time the end of the game came, the lack of closure or an actual story at all had me extra frustrated with the poor excuses for \"puzzles\" near the end of the game.\n\nIt's definitely easier, shorter, and more lacking in story than the other game in the bundle, Rusty Lake: Roots.

I'm glad I continued playing this series, but this isn't the best entry in it.\n\nPros:\n- I loved the artwork and the voice actor for Mr. Owl.\n- Wonderfully weird atmosphere.\n\nCons:\n- Characters' non-reactions to things they should have reacted to. You can add poison to a character's drink right in front of him, and he'll still drink it. You can cut him and he won't even try to leave the room. And the sandwiches! You'd think he'd have stopped eating after the first bite!\n- It's way too easy to move on in the game without having done everything you needed to do in order to make the best possible meal.\n- The puzzle design isn't always the best, leading to some puzzles being more annoying than difficult. One puzzle in particular seemed to come with no clues whatsoever - you either consulted a walkthrough (which is what I did) or you kept clicking until you eventually came up with the exact series of 10 clicks you needed in order to solve the puzzle. (Edit: Apparently there was a clue, it was just much more subtle than the clues for most of the other puzzles.)\n\nI'd recommend this only if you've played Rusty Lake: Roots (which is amazing) or the free Cube Escape games and want to know more of the story.", "timestamp_created": 1499528333, "timestamp_updated": 1499661726, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1499863422, "developer_response": "Hi Mella thanks for your review.

[/h1]\nRusty Lake Hotel is highly reminiscent of those old Flash \"Escape the Room\" games. You find yourself at hotel where all of the other guests are various animals. Your goal: murder each guest and serve them for that night's dinner. Crazy and weird theme, but interesting nonetheless. The game is simply a series of room puzzles, where you click around to find items, combine these items or use them in the environment, and solve occasional puzzles that eventually lead to the death of your chosen guest. These types of games often suffer from \"moon logic\", where players can get stuck due to illogical item combinations, but fortunately Rusty Lake Hotel is pretty straight forward.\n\n[h1] You Should [b]Buy[/b] This Game If: [/h1]\n[list][*]You like \"escape room\" (point-and-click) style games\n[*]You're looking for a quick gameplay experience (~1-2 hours)\n[*]You want a laid back gameplay experience\n[*]You like games that are weird and mildly disturbing (in a good way)[/list]\n\n[h1] You Should [b]Skip[/b] This Game If: [/h1]\n[list][*]You are looking for action or fast-paced gameplay\n[*]You want a long experience\n[*]You want a game with difficult puzzles (the ones here shouldn't be much of a challenge)[/list]\n\n[h1] My Personal Opinion (Recommendation Reflects This) [/h1]\nI personally really enjoyed Rusty Lake Hotel.

Plain and simple. A computerized game version of an escape room. It seems like an adventure game and the mechanics match point and click adventures for sure. But it shuts you up in several rooms and you can't get out until you reach the room's goal. It's very creepy actually, telling an Agatha Christielike parlor room mystery of sorts. All the ladies and gentry are there. But all played by anthropomorphic animals. It all kinda works. And that makes it more odd. More creepy. And being animation they can crank up the weirdness a bit. Not the negatives....I guess flash is okay, but note it will give you warning messages telling you it is affecting your computer until you let it. Not SUCH a terrible thing I suppose. It does save its checkpoints. The only really frustrating thing I've hit in the gameplay is...well sometimes you don't know just what you are supposed to click. WHich makes you just click random places everywhere. Which is kinf od a fault with the adventure genre to begin with. No different here, especially when some of the puzzles aren't really puzzles but more \"you can't move forward in the story and get THIS object until you talk to that person across the room\", which has no logic whatsoever. Still...this is insanely cheap...and I'm glad I found it. Most games for 99 cents are total garbage. I think there is a series of these Rusty Lake games. THis is the first one I played. The second I don't like as well. It doesn't have animals and weird murders. In fact the murder mystery aspect is exactly what sells this game as an escape room.

I got the first games of the series for free on Google Play Store, which called Cube Escape Series. The last game called Rusty Lake Hotels is one of the most favorite games by the user too (the users that share the same favorite genres as mine of course).\n\nLater on, I bought Rusty Lake Hotels in Steam. Turned out it is super exciting for me with the not-so-complicated-but-also-not-too-easy puzzles as usual. I love the characters, the thrill, and of course, the story itself.

Worst of all, you can only progress by clicking everything randomly and hoping something will happen, so there is no real reward for solving the \"puzzles\". \n\nNo atmosphere, no interaction with guests (they all stand around silently...), no heart, no charm.

An actual, runs in Shockwave flash game like your papi used to play when he was goofing off  in computer lab in high school. That sets a lot of limitations for how sophisticated the game can be, but to it's credit there's a great aesthetic on display that works well with the format. In normal mode anyway. 'Effects on' mode is a big step down.\n\nIf you like amatuer games, room escapes and just plain batshit crazy stuff there's a lot to like here. But there's two GIGANTIC caveats here and if you can't get down with those, don't buy this game.\n\n1) The moon logic on display here is absurd even by conventional moon logic standards. You got a guy to kill, and the game gives you a knife, but you're kidding yourself if you think you're just gonna insert Knife A into Victim B and call it a job well done. No, instead you have to use the knife SPECIFICALLY ON THE DUDE'S ANTLERS so you can get blood to make him a bloody mary because we're all about hospitality here at Rusty Lake. Then you poison the drink. Also I'm pretty sure a Bloody Mary doesn't have actual blood in it. And if it did who needs the poison at that point? Just kick back and let Hepatitis do it's dark work.\n\n2) Because of the limitations of the format, there are a lot of places in this game where if you don't know exactly where to look for what, you will not be able to solve all the puzzles and achieve the best rank. If you know where everything is you can beat the game in about 30-40 minutes but if you're a perfectionist you're going to be spending a lot of time solving the same puzzles over and over again.",

Le genre \u00ab\u00a0escape the room\u00a0\u00bb qui demande de s'\u00e9chapper d'une pi\u00e8ce en r\u00e9solvant une succession de puzzles est devenu leur sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 avec d'abord des jeux disponibles sur mobiles et navigateurs nomm\u00e9s les Cube Escape, surr\u00e9alistes et offrant des ambiances sordides et fascinantes. Puis, par la suite, les d\u00e9veloppeurs voient plus grand et proposent un jeu complet sur Steam, aujourd'hui d\u00e9j\u00e0 rejoint par une suite \u00ab\u00a0Rusty Lake Roots\u00a0\u00bb.[/i]\n\nQuand on vous dit que le jeu s'inspire de Twin Peaks c'est pour son pitch surr\u00e9aliste et glauque. Les personnages, semblables \u00e0 des humains \u00e0 t\u00eate d'animaux, se r\u00e9unissent dans un h\u00f4tel sur invitation d'un \u00eatre myst\u00e9rieux, Mr Owl. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873799459 L'histoire ne tarde pas \u00e0 virer au huis clos morbide, dans la lign\u00e9e des Dix petits n\u00e8gres d'Agatha Christie.\n\nParent de nombreux repr\u00e9sentants flash disponibles gratuitement un peu partout sur le web, le gameplay de type \u00ab\u00a0escape game\u00a0\u00bb est tr\u00e8s simple \u00e0 comprendre\u00a0: on a affaire \u00e0 un point & click dont le principe est de s\u2019\u00e9chapper d\u2019une pi\u00e8ce en r\u00e9solvant des \u00e9nigmes d\u2019apparence simples mais dont les cl\u00e9s de la r\u00e9solution sont dissimul\u00e9es dans les autres \u00e9crans (les escape games se d\u00e9roulant usuellement \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re personne, il n\u2019y a pas de protagoniste \u00e0 d\u00e9placer). Il n\u2019y a pas forc\u00e9ment de liens logiques entre actions et cons\u00e9quences\u00a0: en aidant par exemple notre h\u00f4te, on sera r\u00e9compens\u00e9 par un objet tout \u00e0 fait improbable mais qui d\u2019un coup, appara\u00eet comme l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment-cl\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00e9trange puzzle (fantastique oblige\u00a0!). Pourtant la logique n\u2019est pas partie aux oubliettes puisque les petites \u00e9nigmes sollicitent bien souvent nos connexions synaptiques dans la partie \u00ab\u00a0logique et d\u00e9duction\u00a0\u00bb de notre cerveau\u00a0: (\u00e9nigmes bas\u00e9es sur des \u00e9quations \u00e0 deux inconnues, s\u00e9quence \u00e0 retrouver en faisant preuve d'observation ou encore puzzles strat\u00e9giques demandant au joueur de faire preuve d'anticipation). http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873799600 On alterne donc entre \u00e9nigmes classiques et originales, certaines reposant d'avantage sur la logique math\u00e9matique et d'autres sur l'observation et la d\u00e9duction.\n\nLes dessins r\u00e9alis\u00e9s pour le jeu Rusty Lake Hotel ont une ligne claire et un style sobre \u00e0 base de grands aplats de couleurs. On peut dire que dans un puzzle-game la lisibilit\u00e9 des sc\u00e8nes est primordiale. On va en effet \u00eatre amen\u00e9 \u00e0 inspecter chaque recoin des pi\u00e8ces dans lesquelles on se trouvera, \u00e0 la recherche du moindre indice qui pourra d\u00e9bloquer la situation. A c\u00f4t\u00e9 de \u00e7a r\u00e8gne cette ambiance noire, presque en d\u00e9calage avec le style visuel choisi mais qui au final fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien dans le sens o\u00f9 l'atmosph\u00e8re \u00e9trange du jeu n'en est que renforc\u00e9e. \n\nDans le fond, Rusty Lake Hotel ne propose rien de nouveau mais ce qu'il propose est intelligent, bien pens\u00e9 et r\u00e9alis\u00e9 avec soin. Pour les sceptiques allez faire un tour sur le site du studio pour vous essayer \u00e0 des jeux flash gratuits reprenant l'univers du jeu. Pour ceux qui sont convaincus, il ne reste qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9bourser la modique somme de 1,99 \u20ac pour vous offrir ce petit (mais non moins r\u00e9ussi) jeu d'\u00e9nigmes.\n\n[quote]Lisez d'autres avis sur ma page de curation : [b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9002662/]Kitsune's Guide[/url][/b][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1488232047, "timestamp_updated": 1488232475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694866", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30222167": {"recommendationid": "30222167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164750344", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488366386}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u8d28\u6bd4\u8d77\u4e0a\u4e00\u6b65\u6709\u4e86\u957f\u8db3\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u652f\u7ebf\u8ba9\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u4e86\u591a\u6b21\u6e38\u73a9\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\n\u662f\u8c01\u6740\u4e86\u4e94\u4f4d\u65c5\u5ba2\uff1f\u4e0d\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e3b\u89d2\u54c8\u7ef4\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u732b\u5934\u9e70\uff0c\u66f4\u4e0d\u662f\u4e4c\u9e26\u3002\u800c\u662f\u53a8\u5e08\uff0c\u4ece\u4e94\u4f4d\u65c5\u5ba2\u8fdb\u5165\u65c5\u9986\u7684\u90a3\u4e00\u523b\u8d77\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u751f\u547d\u4fbf\u8d70\u5230\u4e86\u5c3d\u5934\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1488209981, "timestamp_updated": 1488294160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30203342": {"recommendationid": "30203342", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967229781", "num_games_owned": 452, "num_reviews": 303, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488103175}, "language": "english", "review": "Embark on a macabre puzzle adventure where your guests are the main course at The Rusty Lake Hotel.

I purchased this, Roots, and have all the free ones on my phone. The gameplay is great, the puzzles are just challenging enough, and I am never bored.

The developers are incredibly friendly, and even with their fanbase growing at an exponential rate they are constantly in contact via email or twitter or what have you. The soundtrack, too, is phenomenal, and the art. The effort that went into this game is clear as day, and I HIGHLY recommend it. \n\nThe one and only thing I would complain about, and this is only for the MOBILE version: If you are an impatient person (me) playing the game for the 11th time (me) and you get a little excited with clicking things (...me...), then it is somewhat easy to \"break\" the game. However, it does have a VERY good memory and will put you back only to the start of your level once restarted.

For under 5 NZ dollars you can pick up this game and the sequel, both of which fit into the larger narrative that started in the aforementioned flash games. Score, Visuals and Puzzles mesh to make something truly special.\n\nREVIEW\n\nStory:\nI've seldom seen storytelling done like this. Characters speak directly very infrequently and intuitive pictoral hints tell you a ton about the characters you meet. The story seems minimal, but everything that happens means something, even if you can't tell what it is. This game is ideal if you want to sit back and revel in the weirdness of some incredibly creative indie devs. Deeper story elements are shown, but they are murky and obscured, masterfully working with the continued theme of the lake. Dark gods, esoteric spirits and twisted motives lurk below the seemingly innocuous children's book style and mundane puzzle tasks. The story is a delight to unveil, so I will tell you no more. 8.5/10\n\nGraphics:\nThe art style is... Unique. Imagine a blend between 'American Gothic', 'Over the Garden Wall', old silent cartoons and creepy taxidermies, and you begin to get an idea of the excellent visuals presented in this game. Click through the screenshots if you can't be bothered googling those things. Everything is unsettling and surreal, but subtly. It feels like a dusty piece of American folk art, which really clicks with my particular sensibilities. With that said, I can see how the limited animation and somewhat simple graphics could be a putoff. For me, it's a real hit. 9/10\n\nGameplay:\nAside from a few irritating or samey puzzles, Rusty Lake Hotel is a sterling example of puzzle gaming. The game sets seemingly mundane tasks with esoteric twists and disturbing results. I won't discuss the intent of the puzzles, but they follow a shared, sinister theme. While the weakest element of the game, the puzzles are still excellent. 7/10\n\nOverall:\nI opened my steam wallet and found it was bare,\nI thought to myself that there was something there\nJust a moment before, but I remembered with shame,\nThat it a fever I had spent it on games. \n\nI looked through my library for something new, \nFound Jotun, The Deed and Surgeon Sim too\nBut there were two more that caught my attention\nTo find out was it was about my intention \nI booted it up and soon saw my mistake\nWhen I thought the worst of the game Rusty Lake.\n\nThe visuals, the music, the tension thick as tar, \nThe mystery, the ambience, the puzzles bizarre\nI soon bought the sequel, my thirst not yet slaked,\nI'd become an addict of the studio Rusty Lake.\n\nIn short, RL:H is a game that I am proud to have in my Steam Library. It's Short but Satisfying, Unsettling but with no Jumpscares and Interesting without Exposition. 8.5/10\n\nTil my next review!", "timestamp_created": 1479083766, "timestamp_updated": 1479083766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569283", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26551252": {"recommendationid": "26551252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039253670", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478927508}, "language": "english", "review": "a very fun, short macabre game. would play again!", "timestamp_created": 1478927714, "timestamp_updated": 1478927714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26514556": {"recommendationid": "26514556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123074450", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503668695}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9508\u6e56\u7cfb\u5217\u9996\u4e2a\u4ed8\u8d39\u7248\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u7d27\u51d1\uff0c\u7591\u4f3c\u4ea4\u4ee3\u9508\u6e56\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u73a9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u7136\u9887\u663e\u8be1\u5f02\uff0c23333~~~\n\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u8350\u524d\u4f5c\nhttp://www.cubeescape.com/", "timestamp_created": 1478761794, "timestamp_updated": 1478763331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26506636": {"recommendationid": "26506636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037345493", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478714531}, "language": "english", "review": "Moderately challenging and very enjoyable point and click puzzle game with an interesting story set in a compelling and creepy universe.

to play this after playing the sequel, Rusty Lake: Roots. I was hoping for something really compelling. Did I find it? Well, no. I really wanted to like this game, and it did feel like you were actually solving puzzles more than it did in Roots. However, the superficial elements of the story were predictable, and the non-superficial elements, if they existed, were obfuscated to the point where you didn't really engage with or care about them. Also, the game's buggy. It's easily possible to put it in an unwinnable state by doing things in an order other than what the developers expected. Did I earn all the stars? Also no, but I in no way felt compelled to go back and try. Some cheap scatological humour put me off a bit as well. \n\nThis wasn't a terrible game, and it was certainly odd, plus it's very inexpensive. However, it didn't deliver much of an experience, and I think you'd be fine just playing Roots and skipping this one.", "timestamp_created": 1478224169, "timestamp_updated": 1478225020, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26408129": {"recommendationid": "26408129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117475209", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478200798}, "language": "italian", "review": "Lo amo, questa storia \u00e8 stupenda", "timestamp_created": 1478218021, "timestamp_updated": 1478218021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26392612": {"recommendationid": "26392612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091777654", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479375120}, "language": "english", "review": "[spoiler]This hotel serves guests as menu[/spoiler]\nThe riddle isn't hard to solve, and the art n graphics are really nice.", "timestamp_created": 1478133325, "timestamp_updated": 1478133325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433819", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26381273": {"recommendationid": "26381273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070615992", "num_games_owned": 1050, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478125930}, "language": "english", "review": "Morbid fun.", "timestamp_created": 1478126323, "timestamp_updated": 1478126323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26363577": {"recommendationid": "26363577", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971417681", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478038989}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and quirky puzzler, could get more  time out of it by getting all stars.

Join for 5 nights to solve puzzles in your guests' rooms and to cook them a dish each night that they will die for. \n\nEach room is a whole puzzle to get what you ultamately came for [spoiler](their meat)[/spoiler], and to ensure the player to complete, it halts you from leaving the room. This can be appealing, as you know the solution is somewhere in the room, not having to run between rooms to get clues or objects. With each puzzle, it gives you enough clues for you to figure it out, but not too much to make it too easy. Each room has its own theme with the puzzles designed to correspond with the theme and the music different with each room. Depending on your puzzle solving skills, each room varies between completion times.\nNot only does every room act as a whole puzzle, there are two puzzles that are active throughout the whole game, making the meals and a key puzzle. While making the meals perfectly can be difficult, the game does help with guiding you through the most effective way to get the ingredients, some requiring you to look closely and some requiring you to remember if the guest was drinking something. \nThe negatives with Rusty Lake Hotel is the ending, especially to those not familiar with Rusty Lake's other works like I am.

Rusty Lake Hotel poss\u00e8de une ambiance myst\u00e9rieuse saisissante, de part son esth\u00e9tique parfaitement ma\u00eetris\u00e9e ainsi que par sa mise en sc\u00e8ne relativement originale (pour un jeux vid\u00e9o du moins).  N\u00e9anmoins le gameplay est r\u00e9duit \u00e0 son strict minimum, il s'agit d'un escape room des plus classiques. Parlons d'ailleurs rapidement, pour les nons initi\u00e9s, de l'escape room\u00a0: il s'agit d'un sous genre du point'n'click, en huis clos, o\u00f9 le joueur doit r\u00e9soudre des \u00e9nigmes, trouver des objets dissimul\u00e9s et s'en servir adroitement dans le but de pouvoir quitter la salle ou il se trouve. La nuance avec un point'n'click et un escape room se trouve dans la capacit\u00e9 de se d\u00e9placer dans un espace distinct, ainsi que dans la gestion de l'inventaire\u00a0; dans un point'n'click traditionnel nous allons ou bon nous semble et des objets peuvent conserv\u00e9s d'un chapitre \u00e0 l'autre, alors que dans un escape room nous sommes enferm\u00e9 et les objets sont tous utilis\u00e9s dans une m\u00eame salle, rien (g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement), n'est gard\u00e9 par le joueur.\n\n\tRust Lake Hotel offre cependant quelques libert\u00e9s, nous permettant de choisir l'ordre des salles, qui s'av\u00e8re avoir un impact plus ou moins significatif sur la fin du jeux. Il encourage le joueur \u00e0 chercher quelques objets facultatifs, sans pour autant l'y obliger, petit plus appr\u00e9ciable pour un jeux de ce genre. \n\n\tIl n'en reste pas moins qu'il faut se confronter \u00e0 une logique...pas toujours logique. Les \u00e9nigmes sont certes pour la majorit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t bien \u00e9quilibr\u00e9es, et leurs r\u00e9solutions se font apr\u00e8s une bonne fouille minutieuse ou un petit raisonnement. Malheureusement quelques d\u00e9chets inutiles qui n'appellent pas \u00e0 la logique viennent obscurcir ce quasi sans fautes. J'admets que c'est l\u00e0 faire la fine bouche, car les \u00e9nigmes sont agr\u00e9ables dans leur ensemble.\n\n\tParlons un peu de l'esth\u00e9tique du jeux. Un m\u00e9lange entre du Wes Anderson et du Alain Resnais, ou encore la s\u00e9rie Archer, avec un style bande dessin\u00e9e british tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able pour peu que l'on accroche au style. Les personnages sont certes assez classiques mais r\u00e9ussis dans l'ensemble (mention sp\u00e9cial pour le lapin magicien). Le ton sombre, voire un peu gore, fait compl\u00e8tement mouche, et participe grandement a un sentiment de malaise que l'on se surprend \u00e0 ressentir par moments. La musique est malheureusement tr\u00e8s en retrait et tr\u00e8s conventionnel. On notera un effort pour doubler quelques sc\u00e8nes.\n\n\tLa dur\u00e9e de vie approche des deux heures, ce qui rend le prix un poil exag\u00e9r\u00e9, malgr\u00e9 une possible rejouabilit\u00e9 pour ceux qui sont pr\u00eat \u00e0 refaire toutes les \u00e9nigmes en cherchant le bon ordre et  avec toutes les \u00e9toiles, ce qui se fait finalement tr\u00e8s vite puisque le jeux est d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 de toute son essence, \u00e0 savoir la r\u00e9solution d\u2019\u00e9nigme. Les plus habitu\u00e9s du genre auront peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame d\u00e9j\u00e0 tout r\u00e9ussi du premier coup. \n\n\tIl faut savoir qu'il s'agit d'un jeux flash, ce qui peut en rebuter certain.

I knew instantly that it was going to be a game that appeased my curious appetite. Food and Murder, I'm absolutely in! It was a jump into my recently found love of Point&Clicks. Unfortunately, this quick ordering left me a little hungry since it only feels like an appetizer. All the same...It was delicious.\n\nPros: \n- The character designs are what made me buy the game so quickly. They're seemingly basedon Victorian/Edwardian taxidermy and photography. They are delightfully creepy and appealing to the eye. They fit into the atmosphere around them, and for me they help make the game feel like a dark picture book.\n\n-Music wise the Rusty Lake Hotel is haunting. Each room has sounds unique to it, and they do distract from the puzzle solving process. Each piece sets the mood for each room, and it really adds to the game without being annoying.\n\n-The Puzzles for this point and click adventure are interesting and properly themed to each Dinner Guest. Often they are macbre, fun, and not too frustrating. There are exceptions to this,however. \n\n-Each room tells interesting hints about their occupants. They are all unique to their guests personalities/lives outside of The Rusty Lake Hotel. \n\nCons:\n-Honestly, this game is incredibly short. You can work your way through the meal fairly quickly. In my excitement to order I didn't completely read up on the game. For the price, however, I likely should have known. Still...It really left me wanting more despite my enjoyment of the puzzles and death. \n\n-Some of the puzzles for extra ingredients could be incredible frustrating. Often, I was unable to find optional ingredients because I was too soft hearted or it just didn't seem like something one would naturually do. \n\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Rusty Lake Hotel! I got more than enough entertainment out of it for what I paid...even if I'm not quite full yet. The good news is the next game Rusty Lake:Roots has been announced! So, it seems that we may be getting a second helping yet.

What irks me most is everyone LOVES this \"well-written story\", but as I said it is entirely ripped from \"And Then There Were None\" -- the only difference being they put animal heads on everyone, removed the good dialogue, and added you.\n\nWhen you subtract the story and eerie-atmosphere because those are just \"And Then There Were None\", then you subtract the clicking \"puzzles\" where you just click until the animations are done (aka [i]not a puzzle[/i]), then you're left with decent flash artwork, a handful of small puzzles(most nonsensical), and -$2.\n\nI do not recommend Rusty Lake Hotel. \nI DO recommend reading \"And Then There Were None\"", "timestamp_created": 1470017213, "timestamp_updated": 1470018456, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456110", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24612273": {"recommendationid": "24612273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114595371", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487678310}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc194\uc9c1\ud788 \uc874\uc7bc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4... 3\ucc98\ub10c\uc9dc\ub9ac \uac9c\uc740 \uc544\ub2cc\ub4ef..", "timestamp_created": 1469874658, "timestamp_updated": 1469874658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24597280": {"recommendationid": "24597280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082403060", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469788398}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud050\ube0c\uc774\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud504\ub97c \ud574\ubd24\ub2e4\uba74 \uc9c4\uc9dc \uaf2d \ud574\ubd10\uc57c\ub428. \uac1c\uafc0\uc7bc", "timestamp_created": 1469804566, "timestamp_updated": 1469804566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24558495": {"recommendationid": "24558495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067432385", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 70, "last_played": 1516316001}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc774\uac70\ub9cc \ud558\uba74 \uc548\ub418\uace0 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\ub3c4 \uc990\uaca8\uc57c \ucc38\ub9db\uc744 \ub290\ub08d\ub2c8\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1469636597, "timestamp_updated": 1469636597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677419", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24529593": {"recommendationid": "24529593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013133319", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478720413}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played this game three times in two days.

The ending is super wierd and has me guessing at its meaning right now just after beating it.The only complaints I can think of right now are that in most cases you can't turn back, once you enter a guests room unless you want to restart the game you can't turn back, once you complete the main objective you can't spend anymore time trying to get the optional objective but this isn't too big a deal because the game is quite short and there's no reason you can't just use the walkthroughs for levels you've already done so this one is annoying at worst, second and last one I can think of right now is sometimes when your looking at an entire room you can't see things which are out of place in the room such as small things over character's shoulders and poking out from behind objects.

I came into this game as a fan of the Cube Escape games, however, I feel that this game functions perfectly well on its own (though if you\u2019re interested in the Cube Escape games they\u2019re free to play online so why not go for it?). The art style coupled with the music helps create the setting of the Rusty Lake Hotel, and the intriguing characters only further heighten this fantastical, if not macabre, world.

If you haven't played any of the Rusty Lake games, I recommend that you look them up. This is the only game that I've seen them charge money for. I personally liked the weirdness of the game, but if you are on the fence about buying this game, go look at the other games online, play those, then make your decision. Anyways, here are my pros and cons:\nPros:\n- Game is different, it isn't like other games. \n- Doesn't rely on jumpscares for a spooky atmosphere.\n- Puzzles are tricky, but not impossible.\n- Also, puzzles don't depend on luck, but actually require thought.\n- Game keeps you on your toes.\n- The artwork looks good.\n- Music is fitting and sounds good.\n- Each level can recieve 1-3 stars, so you can play the game a few times to get 3 stars everytime.\n- Game makes you think, and does require interpretation for a full mind-blowing effect.\nCons:\n- Without playing the other games beforehand, this game seems really weird and the ending won't make sense. (Even after playing the other games the ending is a bit confusing.)\n- To get 3 stars everytime, you may need to look at a walkthrough. I personally couldn't figure it out on my own. \n- To get 3 stars everytime, sometimes you need to find certain items within a certain time frame (so you may need to find item A before you use item B otherwise you cannot find item A at all).\n- If you aren't okay with games having an ending that doesn't give answers, you aren't going to like this. \n\nTLDR: Game is interesting, but you should look up the other Rusty Lake games to make sure you like this type of game.", "timestamp_created": 1467739089, "timestamp_updated": 1467739089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703659", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24096884": {"recommendationid": "24096884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140210621", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467447165}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Rusty Lake's escape and puzzle games and this one did not dissapoint.

Dinners.\n\nPros\nArt Style\nComplexity of Puzzles\nStory Actually left me wanting to know what the hell was going on (could be a good or bad thing)\n\nLike most games there are some down sides\n\nCons\nWhen you enter each room, you can randomly click everyone and hope to find everything you need to solve the puzzle\nStory - Again, it left me wanting to know whats going on.\n\nIf you would like to see gameplay, and my own thoughts on the games you can check out this video, However if you like what you see i REALLY reccomend getting the game and playing it for yourself instead of watching the video.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/h6txKKe4WEM\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1465427245, "timestamp_updated": 1465427245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23444187": {"recommendationid": "23444187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068621116", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465238816}, "language": "english", "review": "Delicious!", "timestamp_created": 1465345245, "timestamp_updated": 1465345245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23356228": {"recommendationid": "23356228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219999492", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478446390}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7ac\ubc0c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4!! \uc57d\uac04\uc758 \uc794\ud639\ud568\uacfc \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \ub3d9\ud654\uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc704\uae30\uac00 \uc808\ubb18\ud55c \uc870\ud654\ub97c \uc774\ub904\uc11c, \ub9c8\uce58 \uafc8\uacfc\ub3c4 \uac19\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ub420 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uac01\uac01\uc758 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uae08\ucbe4\uc740 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b8 \ubc95\ud55c \uac83\ub4e4\uacfc \uc26c\uc6b4 \uac83\ub4e4\uc774 \uc801\uc808\ud788 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \ub531 \uc801\ub2f9\ud55c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uac00\uaca9\uc774 \uc544\uae5d\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc815\ub3c4\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uc5d0\uc694. \uc801\uadf9 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!!", "timestamp_created": 1464932094, "timestamp_updated": 1464932094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.970223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23301275": {"recommendationid": "23301275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068448287", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464658699}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun, yet challenging short puzzle game.

It is not even past.[/h1]\n\n[i]Rusty Lake Hotel[/i] is the 7th game in [i]Cube Escape[/i] series, a series of mostly freeware room escape games with elegant yet disturbing undertone. All games in the series can be either reached via Kongregate, or can be purchased as a freeware for iOS or Android. I've played the first of these games, [i]Cube Escape: The Lake[/i] in Kongregate some years ago, and found out that the developers continued to make new games in the series, revealing new clues to the spiritual, surreal yet eerie world of the Rusty Lake, connecting pieces of a morbid story with each new game. If you are curious and would like to appreciate the world of Rusty Lake appropriately, I strongly suggest you to play other games with the intended timeline to fully enjoy the experience that is Rusty Lake. Most of these games present you 15-20 minutes of gameplay with more anecdotes to speculate about the nature of the given world and its setting.\n\nIn this short yet morbid puzzle game, we take the role of a butler that serves in the Rusty Lake Hotel, a mysterious establishment settled upon a small island in the middle of the infamous Rusty Lake. The world of Rusty Lake is inhabited by odd andromorphic animals, including our hotel staff: all knowing and charismatic hotel manager Mr. Owl, silent attendant and receptionist Mr. Crow, bell boy Mr. Bat and chef extraordinaire Mr. Toad. In a fateful evening, our guests arrive: Mr. Deer, Mr. Boar, Miss Pheasant, Mr. Rabbit and Mrs. Pigeon. They will be staying with us for a short while, and it is our duty to attend their needs and arrange an excellent dinner party for our guests each night. Sounds simple enough, yet with each passing night our encounters grow a bit more disturbing, ending with a peculiar story revelation somewhat meaningful only if you've played previous games.\n\nHere comes mild or speculative spoilers, so feel free to skip this paragraph if need be. As a personal interpretation, the Cube Escape series, aside from highly disturbing point and click adventures, serve as symbolic happenstances concerning memory, deed and afterlife. Various figures with their own vices - like vanity, gluttony, greed etc. are presented as andromorphic animals in this surreal habitat where they'll be lured with their own vices as bait and used to satisfy a supernatural demand by gruesome means. The hotel and its environment serves as a Limbo-like setting for their memories to be extracted and collected. It was mentioned in previous games that the lake feeds on memories and whence memories are extracted from guests, what is left would be unsettling creatures of nightmares - or rather our antagonists for the following games. Yet again, this is just a personal interpretation, so I highly suggest for you to try other games to present your own. It all is quite [i]Twin Peaks[/i]-ish with a touch of John Keddie.\n\nThe game mostly consists of a basic point & click adventure, with some neatly arranged puzzles and a room escape concept for each night. If you manage to complete the game, you will be given a code to use in following Cube Escape games, revealing more information about the nature of this symbolic setting. This is a gruesome and short experience for your own contemplation considering all events and figures presented are highly symbolic and more so supernatural. It's more like surrealist art; completely open to interpretation and even to introspection.

First of all, people who develop games should NOT attempt to do their own voice acting. I don't know if that's what happened here but the line reads for the \"Mr Owl\" intro are horrendous and immediately gave me a negative impression of the game. \n\nThe art style is quite lovely, and the atmosphere is great. For the most part the puzzles are disappointing, though. There's very little logic or reason. Most of it boils down to \"click randomly everywhere until a bunch of random things happen\". There were a few exceptions and some of the puzzles were quite fun, but it's not fun to just click all over every screen and hope you find the \"optional\" items before you solve the main puzzle, because you never know which step will be the last and once you finish it you're kicked out of the room. If you didn't get one of the optional items, too bad because you can't go back. \n\nDo I recommend this? Hard to say. Bad voice acting, \"puzzles\" that aren't really puzzles, great artwork, cheap price tag. \n\nI guess if you're bored, it's worth a dollar or so if it's on sale. Otherwise, pass. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1461035540, "timestamp_updated": 1461035540, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1461061917, "developer_response": "We hired someone to do the voice acting for Mr. Owl, and we haven't had any negative comment about it before.

After posting it the devs marked it as abusive: All it does is make it so you can't edit it untill it's cleared by some mods. Over a year later and it's cleared, so I wanted to add this because I though the flag was funny. :^)\n\nI don't like clicking games but I was going to steam stream this while a few people watched for some giggles. I start the game up. It's a damn tiny window in the top left corner of my screen. I attempt to move the window by dragging the top bar, but my mouse is stuck in the window. That's a little weird. Why would anyone want the game to trap their mouse in the windowed game? I hit escape to try to free the mouse, but nothing happens. I hit alt, control, tab. Nothing lets my mouse go from the game window's grasp. I try to alt tab, and it works. I click the top bar and move the game to the center of my screen. I attempt to drag the bottom corner to enlarge the window. surprise. clicking the window to move it traps the mouse. I alt tab, enlarge the window, alt tab to free the mouse again, and click the window a few more times as I try to get the window set up. I am a little upset. I invite someone to watch. The shift-tab screen is over top the game window. I can't click anything on the screen. my mouse is stuck in the screen but clicking the buttons does nothing. I am forced to task manager shut it down. Restart and do it all again. I foolishly think that there most be some options to change this horrid resolution and mouse issue. I click options; There are no options in the options menu. Why is the button even called options? I see there is a shitty title bar on the app window. I attempt to click it but my mouse is trapped. I alt tab, and the game moves behind steam. I click on the icon on my start bar to bring it to the front. Even though my mouse never touched the game window it has teleported back into it's cage. Any interaction with the game traps the mouse. I alt tab and look though the menu strip options. There are no options here either. I start playing the game. It's a flash game. I click shit till shit happens. There is no relevant logic to 90% of solutions. This is all to be expected from a clicking flash game. Why would I ever trust a clicking flash game to actually try to be anything more that brain-dead shit; developed by a monkey trapped in a room with a typewriter for an infinite amount of time with the idea that if he bangs his little monkey hands as fast as his little monkey arms can he can he will eventually make something resembling a game. The monkey has not yet made a game but in the meantime he managed to trick me into thinking I could stream a bad game over steam while some friends watched and it would be ok to laugh at. like a bad movie. Only, instead of watching the movie you get locked inside because by dumb luck that monkey managed to type in the setting that locks the mouse into the window. You ask yourself why the monkey would think that any program should have this \"feature\", but you then realize the monkey didn't think. Let's play pretend. Let's pretend that I didn't already think clicking games were garbage. You like clicking games, and you wan't to know if you would buy a clicking game. The answer is always no, but we're pretending. you're looking for engaging puzzles, yes? Well, the monkey is still working on that so come back never. I finished the deer room. The deer's room contains about a dozen different things to work though, and only two were puzzles. I need this deer's blood huh? So he wants a drink. First puzzle with weights and a scale gets me into the safe which contains a knife. So I stab the deer for- nope. So I need to poison him first I guess. I have to open this window and trap this moth with this glass. Then clicking the moths in this specific order which is conveniently on this nice painting of moths of the deer's wall gives me a seed out of the moths. why is the seed in the moths and why did clicking them give me it? Monkeys. plant the seed. Grow the seed by clicking it, because monkeys. grind the plant to make poison. mix it with water by doing some water puzzle, which is a puzzle because I can't poor water properly. Mix it with the deer's own blood and Tabasco sauce from milking antlers on the wall; Which can only be solved by order of; I haven't clicked on this yet so click it all over till things happen. I did it. You like clicking games. That's why you're here. So, the nonsense of it means nothing to you right? You like that stupid monkey garbage, don't you? Checkmate. Google clicking puzzle games, and play an infinite pool of copy paste uninspired garbage that won't hold your mouse hostage in it's poorly made app window. Oh sorry. What was I thinking. It's the future, and everyone knows that best way to make games is to google flash games and make as many generic re-skins and plaster them all over steam and your phone's app store. If you're the first one to steal an idea that used to be free and slap it on a new device for a price you could be the next angry birds. No work or original ideas needed! Perfect work for a monkey to made for other monkeys.

The latest in the Cube Escape Series, this little gem has you playing hitman for Mr. Owl, the Hotel's \"owner\" and curator.\n\nFor the first time in the series, we are happily murdering the other characters. Are these actions our own? Perhaps. In the beginning, this seems like a harmless and pleasant visit to the Rusty Lake Hotel. Once the shrimp cocktails are dispensed, however, you get your first task. You must kill one guest each night until all of them are dead.\n\nYou are given no further information as to why these guests deserve to die other than they have \"their own reasons for being here.\" Why do we trust Mr. Owl? Do we fear him? Does he compel us? There are no answers to these questions.\n\nIf there were a way to make hotel murder fun, consider this the game the one that makes the mold. The puzzles are challenging but fun. Walkthroughs are provided by the creators just in case you get stuck. More than once, I found myself laughing maniacally while carrying out my morbid tasks. There's a clever mixture of whimsy, humour, and horror in these games.\n\nEach room and character is unique. Each room has its own atmospheric soundtrack. The characters Mr. Owl and Mr, Crow are returning and familiar friends from the other Rusty Lake Games. Lastly, the games themselves seem influenced by Twin Peaks. For anyone who is a fan of the show, or the genre, this game is a must for the \"owls are not what they seem.\"\n\nI hope you enjoyed my review and find this game as entertaining as I did. Hopefully, it will lead you to the other Rusty Lake games and join in the theory discussion as to the Lake's Purpose and just who is Mr. Owl?

And while I could say a whole lot, I'll try and keep it brief.\n\nFirstly, this is perhaps my favorite game from the Cube Escape series. It's hard to make that judgment considering how much I love every game in this series (as you might have noticed, my avatar is a screenshot from the recently-released Cube Escape: Birthday). But Rusty Lake Hotel does something special by bringing together elements - and characters, as you'll realize if you played the previous installments - from the games before it, and makes for a very intriguing, very eye-opening, very unnerving and unnatural experience.\n\nWhat do I mean by that last part? Simply put (and without spoiling anything), things get weird, and some would say gut-wrenching. The gameplay is similar to all of the games before it, as it should be, with the goal being trying to find particular items to accomplish the main objective. In this game's case, the objective is to find ingredients each night which will allow you to cook a savory dish for your guests the next day. A new element not previous in past games is the ability to find bonus items, which will allow you to get higher scores each day and eventually unlock something special in the end. The gameplay is, as always, thought-provoking and unnerving; mildly puzzling in some cases, moderately challenging in others. I guarantee you moments where you'll be grinning, gasping, and subsequently staring in disbelief at your screen in the span of minutes. It's the kind of game that makes you want to know more with each passing moment, and it fully delivers in the uncanny department. There were also parts where I was simply hesitant to act, knowing what would come; other times I was laughing at the ridiculousness of the circumstances, particularly the happenings in the room of Mr. Rabbit (Rest In Peace, valiant hare). All around, it's a game both chilling and absurd, enjoyable and brain-racking. All around, it's a great experience. I could complain about the problems I had with some puzzles, and my inability to collect all of the bonus ingredients, but I'd really only be expressing personal issues at that point - I'm admittedly dense at times in games like these, and so there's really nothing wrong here but my own lack of sight (or so I'd think). That being said, beware the water jugs.\n\nTo summarize, Rusty Lake Hotel delivers excellently for the first premiere game from the series. It keeps in line with the previous (extremely bizarre and difficult to understand) storyline and general style, while also introducing more through some new elements and abilities. It's plot is strange to say the least, but makes you want more - much more, in my case. The game gave me a couple hours of fun and frustration, and in the end left me jaw open and wanting a sequel immediately. If you're a fan of the Cube Escape series, point-and-click games, and dark, eerie, and morbid storytelling, then this is the game for you. And if you're not a fan of any of these, buy the game anyway; Rusty Lake Hotel will make you a fan.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game, and it's fully worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1455741502, "timestamp_updated": 1455741545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21273744": {"recommendationid": "21273744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188449186", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455715379}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game well done!!!!

That being said and since others already wrote enough about the content (point and click, surreal setting, a bit gorey, setting at a lake with anthropomorphic creatures that run that hotel and have tasks for you, solve riddles to proceed), here are my points of critique regarding the gameplay.\n\nFirst, the pros:\n- the game is entertaining. If you like point and click games, especially those leaning to the dark and surreal side\n- most* of the puzzles are logical and therefore, solvable by using your brain\n- the music is fitting and atmospheric\n- no pixel hunt\n- if you played the cube escape series, THIS game is where all open questions seem to start to fit together. Expect some cameos.\n- the game has some additional, optional puzzles that are a bit more difficult to solve (yay, extra challenges!)\n- you will get a reward if you solve those as well (yay, rewards for going the extra mile!)\n- for not even 2\u20ac, you get at least about 1 to 2 hours of entertainment, which is a good value!\n\nNow the neutral things (aka: things I'd like to see improved in further versions that catched my eye but didn't bother me that much):\n- the language needs some improvement to avoid involuntarily comical situations. The sentences spoken are very minimalistic (which is a good thing, since it fits the atmosphere nicely), but sometimes the grammar seems off or very simplified (I'm looking at you, evening initiating sequence)\n- there is one point where you are reminded where you currently are (the lobby) via a UI notification that pops up, states that areas name and has to be clicked to close. I found this a tad annoying since the area is not disorientating at all and it felt tedious to always close the notification without any benefit.\n\nOf course, that are only very minor issues. I did not find anything too negative about this game, except from maybe being a bit short. \n\nOther features:\n\nThe graphics are simple, but beautiful and very well fitting to the cube escape series. The sounds were fitting and subtle as well and provided to the atmosphere. Still suffering from deer-man related flashbacks (would recommend playing the cube series alone for this! Go and get your dose of trauma today! It's free!), I expected to be startled more often. In comparison to the other games from this developers, I found the Rusty Lake one literally placid, harmless even. There was a bit of gore, but sparsely (it's up to you if that's a pro or con).\n\nThere was an * to the notion of \"most riddles are solvable by brainpower\". Some few are not. Regarding the games of this developer, \"logical\" has to be a term to be stretched a bit. First, let's say: the WAYS to obtain or interact with something are logical - what exactly you will get from this interaction, needs not be. For example, you might spot a puzzle, do what you think you are supposed to do and solve it without much strain, but what you get out of this might be leaving you thinking \"wtf\". This is one thing that I enjoy about these games. And in this sense, most are logical and solvable. There were only about two riddles that were not exactly solvable by deduction but more by \"doing things randomly and having something happen\" - and this is what I meant. You can solve them anyway,  just more in the \"I wonder what happens if...\"-way.\n\nTo sum up: if you like point and click and a bit of a dark twist, go and play it, you probably won't regret it. But don't expect to be busy more than 1 or 2 hours with that game. If you want to maximize your experience, go and play all of the cube escape series games first. This should take several hours and a few minor emotional scarrings. Then come back, buy that game and feel like you just got about 8 to 10 hours of gameplay for a bit short of 2\u20ac.", "timestamp_created": 1454636889, "timestamp_updated": 1454636905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20948683": {"recommendationid": "20948683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011475724", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454592149}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer nichts gegen etwas Schwarzen Humor hat und eine Schw\u00e4che f\u00fcr Point-and-Click Games ist hier genau richtig!\n\nStory: Der Schauplatz ist das \"Rusty Lake\" Hotel.

I\u2019ve played less than an hour and a half so far, so there will likely be more to be said, and this may be uncommonly brief.\n\nThe premise of \u201cRusty Lake Hotel\u201d is you are Mr. Owl, and you have invited 5 creature friends to your hotel for a visit, including a special meal each day. Not to give too much away, but each day there is one less guest to entertain. This is a humorous game, but which also contains some pretty graphic cartoony violence and gore.\n\nDuring the day you explore the hotel, talk to the guests and employees, and look for objects needed later. This phase is generally quite brief, as it\u2019s basically just a preamble to the nighttime puzzle work. Only at night are you able to visit the guests in their rooms, and that\u2019s where the fun begins. Each guest\u2019s room has a theme. Mr. Rabbit is a magician, and his room, and the puzzles to be solved, involve magic. Mr. Deer involves finding the ingredients to fix a drink, including puzzles involving volume (as well as others, all closely inter-related.) Ms. Pidgeon, who has asked you to run her bath, has puzzles involving electricity and math. Most of the puzzles are simple, and provide some small item to lead to a quite possibly bigger puzzle to be solved. But (so far at least), each room\u2019s puzzles must be completely solved, and the meat needed for the next day\u2019s \u201cspecial meal\u201d must be found, before each room can be exited. Some items for the meal are optional, but the more you find, the more stars you receive for the quality of the meal when served. Presumably, the number of stars unlocks some feature(s) later on.\n\nAnd that\u2019s something new, in my humble experience. Rarely have I encountered a puzzle game where each area MUST be solved completely for game continuation. As such, it will most likely need to be restarted FROM THE BEGINNING, including all the dialog involved, repeatedly. The good news is that once each room is solved, repeating is simple, if you\u2019ve kept your notes and have a decent memory. (Yes, you will need to solve some puzzles with the help of paper and pencil.)\n\nBut more good news: the game includes some form of Walkthrough, yet to be investigated.\n\nEach day, having solved to puzzles in one room, you will take the ingredients you have found to prepare a meal\u2026.for one less guest. Presumably a larger puzzle opens as more guests are\u2026\u2026\u2026served.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt the repetition in \u201cRusty Lake Hotel\u201d will prove a bit tedious, but quite likely there\u2019s a good reason, yet to be determined. For full price, non-discounted, of $1.99US, I would give this game my NEXT TO HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION \u2013 4/5.\n", "timestamp_created": 1454205295, "timestamp_updated": 1454205295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746275", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20861408": {"recommendationid": "20861408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257876277", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482860794}, "language": "english", "review": "A really nice game! 10/10 can recommend", "timestamp_created": 1454202122, "timestamp_updated": 1454202122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20859422": {"recommendationid": "20859422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215637036", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514982283}, "language": "german", "review": "Enjoy the game its realy cool! \nSome rooms are difficult and tricky but very cool!", "timestamp_created": 1454194431, "timestamp_updated": 1454194431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20857424": {"recommendationid": "20857424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256664794", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456786317}, "language": "english", "review": "For only 2 dollars, this is really a game that went beyond my expectations.

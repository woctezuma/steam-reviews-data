On a few occasions, I seemed to - almost - perform the action that was required of me, but then the scene would reset for me to try again.

It all made sense. While the game is a simple point'n'click, you never move your character on your own, it was \"entertaining\". The story, the way it was laid out, was sad and I felt for the parents. Up until a certain point in the story, where they turn on the \"God is Good\" theme and run with it for the second half of the game. At that point, the game lost me.

Well, as the kid in question was only five at the time it's actually about the adults in the family and their experience. And given all that, it's a bit of a shame to call it out for being largely a load of balls. Mechanically it's primitive and odd to control even though you're mostly just pointing a character in a direction to advance the story. There are a couple of occasions when it tries to be more of a 'game' (a bizarre kart racing section and a puzzle involving candles that just had me clicking shit randomly until I could proceed) and those parts are arguably even worse as they're not only boring but just seem completely at odds with the subject matter. There are a couple of sections that genuinely take advantage of an interactive medium (e.g. a part where you can move between occupying either of the parents or the attendant medical staff while things are being discussed and 'hear' their internal monologue as bad news is being delivered and processed) and they show a glimmer of a good idea, but aside from that it's really just finding the next thing to click on to move your character through some landscapes. Coming off the back of something like Edith Finch which tells various stories of loss and heartbreak in incredible and moving ways this can't really seem like anything other than boring twaddle. Which is ironic given the very real basis here vs Edith Finch's invented story. The thing is, 'gameplay' aside, I was genuinely quite affected by the family's story in the beginning due largely to the voice work (the developer and his wife playing themselves as far as I know) doing a good job if putting you in the middle of the situation. However, not only is the wife's voice is incredibly grating after a while but about a third of the way through every conversation and line of dialogue becomes about their faith. Obviously I can understand the entire situation throwing up such questions and thoughts for a Christian couple but literally every scene after a certain point is a lengthy pondering on God and, frankly, I couldn't give a fuck so I was left cold by it all.", "timestamp_created": 1511530607, "timestamp_updated": 1511530607, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.375014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37253057": {"recommendationid": "37253057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161480139", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483072130}, "language": "english", "review": "This game..hits a little close to home for me, since..well, real life stuff.

The first being because I think this game deserves more recognition, for the family involved, for those who have had an experince similar to this one, and even for those people who unfortunately may have an experience like this in the future. This game is impossible to truly describe with words, that's why I tell people just to play it, to experience it. It's not very often that a game comes along and causes so many of us to consider it not as a game, but as an emotional or existential experience beyond what we ever perceived games could be. To move us in ways none of us of expected. This I believe is important for not only gamers, but for games as a whole. That leads me to my next reason I nominated this game, for gaming as art. Game developers, people with interesting or engaging stories, or anyone that wants to express themselves in one way or another can look to this game as an inspiration. This game proves that video games can be the next form of art, and I mean real art. Games can be a way for people to express themselves just like conventional forms of art. They can be used to express beauty, emotion, passion, or even the entirety of the human condition like this piece of art does.

It does a great job of conveying things from different perspectives; sometimes you play Ryan, sometimes his wife, or sometimes a silent observer watching events as they unfold. This is one of the game's strong points, and lets you see things from a very personal perspective.\n\nWhat wasn't so strong was focus and consistency. There were mini-games, linear set-pieces on rails, and in other scenes it wasn't clear at all what to do and where to go to progress. It felt sometimes like you were wandering through an art gallery but couldn't find the exit - some clearer hints might have been appreciated.\n\nA lot of the symbolism and allegory was very Christian. As a non-Christian I found it difficult sometimes to understand the message, and I reckon a lot of it went over my head. Anything as deeply personal as this was going to be hit and miss against a mass market.

Well i got to say this is one of the most beautiful, tragic and endearing stories that i have ever had the privilege of hearing, so prepare yourself for an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish as you smile with joel as you push him on a swing laugh with him when he's playing on the slide cry with him as he undergoes his treatment feeling every single moment like no feeling you have ever felt before. I dont know how long i sat at the picnic having pancakes with Joel i just didn't want to walk away. The raw emotion of his story will stay with you for the rest of your life.\n\nAfter finishing this the 1st thing i did was go to my 4yr old sons bedroom and as i stood there in his doorway watching him happily playing with his legos the tears where back once again, for about 10 minutes i stood there before he spotted me watching him, he looked at me with his bright eyes void of any sadness and said whats the matter daddy, why you cry? have you got an ouchy?, i instantly smiled a teary smile at him, yes i said i have an ouchy his eyes dimmed a little, me help you i got batman plasters he says i couldn't help but give another smile and a little laugh as i sat down on his bed and told him that my ouchy was inside that my heart was hurting and that a plaster wouldn't fix it, Oh he said his eyes now starting to sadden and he sat there for a moment you could see the cogs turning in his mind then he suddenly got up from where he sat on the floor came running over to me threw his arms around my neck with the words there you go daddy cuddles will make you all better omg i broke again more tears, please don't cry daddy he said i looked at him in my arms and said these are good tears now not ouchy ones he looked so confused at my words, there happy tears i said i'm happy because i have one of the sweetest little boys i know, he lifted his head from my chest and said very brashly i'm not sweet i'm Dylan!! instantly my heart lifted as i burst out laughing yes you are i said you are Dylan. \n\nThat special little moment i got to share with my son just like Joel will never be forgotton, his story made that moment happen it made me take time away from my own things to just step back and appreciate what a fantastic little boy i have.\n\nThank you Amy and Ryan for sharing Joel's story but most of all thank you Joel for giving me such a special moment with my own son.

Amazingly constructed experience, does a lot with very little.\n\nAm recommending to doctor colleagues, may also suggest to a select few patients.\n\nPros\n- One of the most emotionally engaging experiences I've had in any interactive experience.  Second only to communications simulations I've done with actors.  This game will change my practice, and I will come back to it.\n- Very well placed comic relief/whimsy\n- No achievements\n- Very accessible to a wide audience.  You can't 'fail', you can't really get stuck.\n- Plays fine with laptop trackpad + keyboard, one handed.  Great for flights.\n- Higher engaging moments per second than most 'core' games.  Respects your time at a lean 90-120mins playthrough.\n\nCons\n- Was not what I was expecting, this is a linear walking simulator with pauses to steep in well constructed moments, which isn't eveyone's cup of tea.  It works very well, but if you must have WASD walking controls, repetitive challenges or multiple paths then this isnt for you.\n- But, some elements are just a festival of random clicking, this is tedious.\n- The god/jesus bits may really rub you the wrong way.  This works in context for coping, but if you've resisted enough evangelicals this will cause flashbacks.\n- The best scene, the meeting with the parents and medical staff, there is a rewind button.  When you've listened to one person and seen water, press rewind.  Then do the same for the other 3.  This is not obvious.  You will miss 3/4 of this scene if you press the button initially and give up of it.\n\nN.B above edited somewhat after watching peads oncology doctor playthough.", "timestamp_created": 1502371862, "timestamp_updated": 1502548532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614090", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34138117": {"recommendationid": "34138117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210162011", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480869071}, "language": "schinese", "review": "<3", "timestamp_created": 1502335725, "timestamp_updated": 1502335725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34101450": {"recommendationid": "34101450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061374285", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500461457}, "language": "english", "review": "Made me cry", "timestamp_created": 1502192068, "timestamp_updated": 1502192068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502015", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34032507": {"recommendationid": "34032507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140567057", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475852384}, "language": "english", "review": "if you want an emotional trip get this its the most beautiful game ive ever played", "timestamp_created": 1501918096, "timestamp_updated": 1501918096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33987110": {"recommendationid": "33987110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182966269", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501744839}, "language": "english", "review": "Words cannot describe how tragic this experience is.

The overall story intrigued me, as did the production story of a family who had suffered loss because of cancer using a game to help with their own recovery through the grief process. \n\nThe games story did not dissapoint. Having suffered loss at cancers hands myself, the story was sure pulling on my heart strings pretty quickly. The games use of audio from old home videos is extremely effective. The visual art style of the game is unique as well, using symbolism for cancer throughout. Another aspect of this game that shines is the music and overall sound of the game.

This January my nannie (my grandpa's wife) died within a week of being diagnosed with late stage pancreatic cancer. We literally had a week notice. To be honest, it still doesn't seem real. It still makes my chest ache with sadness to think of them both. It hurts, alot. Regardless, I cannot begin to comprehend the pain the parents felt when they learnt that their son had cancer. The pain, the sadness, the numbness and all the other roiling emotions must have been unbearable. And yet they chose to share their story with us.

Contains some short minigames/puzzles for a refreshing variety.\n\nJoel's tale takes place in a very immersive, yet simplistic world. From time to time you get to play as his father, and listen to his thoughts on the situation. The emotions I experienced playing this game were truly tearing me apart; Especially when Joel's parents question each other's faith.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone, whether you are a fan of story rich games or not. It even let me play it with my controller without any issues. The game takes around 1-2 hours to finish (If you are an idiot like me, the puzzles eventually auto-complete so you dont get stuck).\n\nGive it a shot.\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Graphics[/td]\n        [td]9[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Audio[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Controls[/td]\n        [td]8[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Overall[/th]\n        [th]9,5[/th]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nOverall surprisingly good for a Kickstarter funded project.

Thankfully the frank sincerity with which the Green\u2019s tell their story is so touching that these minority of disconnecting points do not become a burden.\n\nPlayers\u2019 reactions to That Dragon Cancer may vary depending on their opinions and outlook on life. For instance, I struggled to feel as empathetic as I could have done at points due to the discussion of the family\u2019s religious beliefs. This isn\u2019t a slight against the game, it is simply a part of their story and just one of several elements of it that are ripe for post-play conversation.

Innanzitutto, da come mi era stato descritto, mi aspettavo molta meno interazione. Se volessimo catalogarlo potremmo considerarlo un'avventura punta e clicca in prima persona, in cui possiamo interagire con alcuni oggetti circostanti durante tutta la durata dell'esperienza. Alcune parti sono un po' confuse, nel senso che bisogna pensare un attimo a cosa fare, ma questo probabilmente rispecchia lo stato d'animo dei genitori del bambino che, appunto, non sapevano che direzione prendere. Tuttavia, al suo interno troviamo anche mini giochi che aumentano la quantit\u00e0 di gameplay esplorando differenti generi videoludici, dal racing al platform in 2D. Quindi, si gioca abbastanza, al contrario di quanto viene detto generalmente. Inoltre, vorrei proseguire cercando di confutare alcune delle critiche che vengono fatte a questo gioco. Una \u00e8 quella del poco gameplay e ne abbiamo appena parlato; le altre sono: i controlli imprecisi, il fatto che sia stato sviluppato solo per guadagnare e l'aspetto religioso. \n\nPer quanto riguarda i controlli, \u00e8 vero, sono un po' macchinosi ma essendo un gioco lento e giocato quasi esclusivamente mediante il mouse, non sono insormontabili, non rendono il gioco ingiocabile o frustrante.\n\nSotto l'aspetto monetario, probabilmente coloro che fanno questa critica non hanno giocato il gioco. Quando qualcosa \u00e8 fatto per soldi o per passione si vede. Non c'\u00e8 nessun tentativo di strappare una lacrima facile mostrandoti immagini, ad esempio, del bambino nel suo letto d'ospedale o il suo volto sofferente, qui c'\u00e8 solo la realt\u00e0 dei fatti e la quotidianit\u00e0 composta da momenti di gioia e di disperazione.\n\nInfine, l'aspetto religioso. La maggior parte delle critiche sono legate a questo aspetto che \u00e8 effettivamente presente nella seconda met\u00e0 di gioco. Personalmente, non l'ho affatto trovato pesante o fuori luogo. Si dice spesso che i videogiochi abbiano la capacit\u00e0 di far immedesimare le persone nelle avventure che raccontano ed \u00e8 vero. Ma i videogiochi non possono fare tutto da soli, bisogna avere una mentalit\u00e0 abbastanza aperta per poter entrare in ogni vita raccontata, in qualsiasi gioco. Non conosco giochi che parlino bene della fede (in TDC si parla di fede, non di religione) o che mostrino protagonisti credenti. Solitamente la religione \u00e8 considerata come un qualcosa di esclusivamente negativo, un pretesto per fare del male, come se il suo fine ultimo fosse questo, ma a nessuno importa. Per una volta, una sola, in cui i protagonisti sono cristiani e mostrano la propria fede nel modo pi\u00f9 spontaneo possibile, vi lamentate? Nell'era del politically correct, c'\u00e8 spazio per tutti tranne che per le persone di fede? Se non siete capaci di immedesimarvi, non giocate. Non tutti i protagonisti dei videogiochi che ho giocato hanno le mie stesse idee o il mio stesso carattere, per\u00f2 li ho apprezzati ugualmente perch\u00e9 provavo a vivere le loro storie secondo i loro occhi. Quindi, vi consiglio di giocare TDC senza pregiudizi e senza timori. \n\nUltimo appunto: la durata. Se lo giocate svolgendo tutte le attivit\u00e0, esplorando e leggendo tutti i messaggi che troverete durante il gioco (cosa che vi consiglio di fare anche se ci vuole del tempo), il gioco vi dura sulle 3 ore, quindi durata buona per un Indie.

Si fa apprezzare innanzitutto per la scelta coraggiosa del game designer Ryan Green di esorcizzare il dolore per la perdita prematura del figlio Joel attraverso un'opera multimediale; al contrario la moglie aveva gi\u00e0 testimoniato pubblicamente l'immane tragedia familiare attraverso un mezzo espressivo pi\u00f9 tradizionale, un libro. Joel per la cronaca \u00e8 morto alla tenera et\u00e0 di 5 anni nel 2014, a causa di un tumore al cervello diagnosticato quando aveva un anno di vita. Ryan, un game designer indipendente con una piccola esperienza nel campo, ha iniziato a sviluppare il titolo prima della morte del figlio, ma dopo il tragico evento lo ha riscritto quasi del tutto con l'aiuto di un piccolo team noto come Numinous Games.\n\nLa spinta propulsiva di questo progetto deriva anche dal fatto che i Green sono ferventi cristiani e con questo titolo hanno voluto lanciare un messaggio di fede e speranza a tutti coloro che si trovano ad affrontare simili dolori e tragedie. In una delle scene del gioco \u00e8 rappresentata la forte risposta ricevuta dai Green da parte di chi aveva affrontato la stessa dura esperienza prima di loro: centinaia di messaggi di solidariet\u00e0 appesi simbolicamente per tutta la casa dei Green, tutti leggibili e originali! Che pazienza! \nLa stessa solidariet\u00e0 ha permesso al gioco di essere pubblicato grazie ad una riuscita campagna di crowdfunding su Kickstarter; molto importante \u00e8 stato anche l'apporto della OUYA, la casa produttrice della omonima e curiosa micro-console completamente open source prodotta nel 2013 e scomparsa nel giro di pochi anni, pensata per giochi casual e mobile. Ryan ricambi\u00f2 la OUYA con un breve periodo di pubblicazione del titolo in esclusiva.\nNei primi giorni di dicembre 2016 TDC ha ricevuto una certa risonanza mediatica per la partecipazione di Ryan ai The Game Awards 2016; l'intervento di Ryan ha colpito molto il pubblico dei videogiocatori, perch\u00e9 non ha saputo contenere la sua emozione e ha creato un sincero momento di coinvolgente commozione e confessione personale. Un evento davvero unico e particolare all'interno di una kermesse sui videogames, che denota chiaramente l'evoluzione culturale in atto nel mezzo espressivo che noi di Video Games & Art abbiamo colto con largo anticipo.\n\nIl merito di TDC \u00e8 proprio di tipo contenutistico e ricorda quello di un altro gioco pionieristico in tal senso, Papo & Yo, in cui il game designer Vander Caballero esorcizza la sua infanzia a contatto con il padre alcolizzato. Per\u00f2 i due titoli sono molto differenti. Infatti Papo & Yo trasfigura l'esperienza personale in un divertente platform 3D di elevata levatura tecnica ed estetica in cui la metafora \u00e8 palese ma non diretta.\n\nTDC invece come detto \u00e8 una drammatica confessione molto intima e diretta, ed \u00e8 molto difficile definirlo un gioco nel senso tradizionale del termine. Ryan raccoglie tutto ci\u00f2 che sente di dover dire e testimoniare sulla sua tragedia familiare e ci costruisce attorno un'esperienza interattiva con chiari intenti artistici. I suoi ricordi, i fatti, le sue emozioni, il suo dolore, le sue angosce, le sue speranze, etc. sono espressi abbastanza didascalicamente, spesso con testi che si materializzano sulle pareti o sullo sfondo degli scenari, oppure sotto forma di monologhi, una sorta di stream of consciousness, veri e propri fiumi di parole terapeutici; il tutto all'interno di una avventura grafica 3D punta & clicca, dove per\u00f2 non ci sono puzzle da risolvere. Puntando il mouse e cliccando possiamo muovere i personaggi e farli interagire con i vari oggetti in modo da attivare i ricordi ad essi associati. Quasi sempre impersoniamo lo stesso Ryan in prima persona, raramente in terza persona. Ma ci sono volte in cui facciamo le veci degli altri comprimari di questo dramma, la moglie e lo stesso figlio. Parlavo di intenti artistici poich\u00e9 gli scenari non sono realistici, ma sono piuttosto astratti, se vogliamo la trasposizione psicanalitica del dramma cos\u00ec come \u00e8 stato vissuto e metabolizzato dalla psiche di Ryan, come se fossero usciti da L'Interpretazione dei Sogni di Freud. Il ricorso all'astrattismo si palesa soprattutto nella scelta di non dare un volto a Joel, che in tal modo sembra una figura di un quadro di De Chirico; a volte non \u00e8 nemmeno rappresentato nella scena, ma ne sentiamo la voce o il pianto di dolore e vediamo gli oggetti con cui ha interagito. I fatti non sono dunque narrati in maniera cinematografica, ma richiamati alla mente con metafore, simbolismi, voci, monologhi, dettagli ambientali, particolari surreali, vuoti e assenze pi\u00f9 che presenze. Giusto per fare un esempio Ryan ad un certo punto affoga in un oceano su cui galleggiano pezzi e ricordi della sua vita naufragata, che non riesce pi\u00f9 a tenere assieme, poich\u00e9 si fa sopraffare dal dolore; la moglie invece appare molto pi\u00f9 resistente e forte.\n\nIl richiamo ai videogiochi \u00e8 piuttosto esplicito, tanto da trasformarsi in un meta-gioco in un paio di occasioni in cui la lotta contro il cancro di Joel viene vista come una sfida in un vecchio gioco arcade; che purtroppo alla fine si guasta.... C'\u00e8 anche una sezione di gioco sulla falsariga delle gare di Super Mario Kart, in cui Joel \u00e8 sul suo triciclo e deve raccogliere quante pi\u00f9 medicine possibili per accumulare punti.... \nL'esperienza \u00e8 suddivisa in piccoli capitoli, di cui gli ultimi sono ovviamente i pi\u00f9 toccanti; in particolare quello in cui Ryan ricorda una notte in ospedale con Joel, che non smetteva pi\u00f9 di piangere per il dolore.... \nLa metafora della vita e della lotta come gioco si protrae fino ai titoli di coda, dove scorrono le vere fotografie della famiglia Green, cha alla fine ringrazia il pubblico per aver partecipato al gioco.\n\nGli intenti artistici ci sono tutti e l'esperienza \u00e8 sicuramente toccante e vale la pena viverla; a mio avviso i risultati sono oggettivi e apprezzabili, ma non sono all'altezza degli intenti. E' una produzione indie a basso budget, che si riverbera purtroppo sulla qualit\u00e0 della grafica e dell'estetica e di conseguenza limita le ambizioni iniziali. Le invenzioni creative sono apprezzabili, ma come avrete potuto capire non particolarmente originali ed elaborate. Il titolo tradisce in parte la sua artigianalit\u00e0 casalinga. Come dicevo si apprezza particolarmente per i contenuti, per il coraggio di narrare una tragedia vissuta in prima persona in maniera intima e confessionale attraverso un mezzo inedito e non tradizionale.. E' il segno importante che la direzione intrapresa dal mezzo videoludico \u00e8 quella giusta: la strada dell'arte!\n\n\nVoto: 80/100", "timestamp_created": 1483664406, "timestamp_updated": 1495748844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29046098": {"recommendationid": "29046098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021954910", "num_games_owned": 938, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483654452}, "language": "english", "review": "It`s a very touching story.

Another problem is that the game doesn`t hint you on what objects you can interact.

But for the sake of the review, I'll call it a game.  \n\nI honestly don't know how to review this game.  It runs fairly like any game should, though I often felt a bit lost at various times since the game was vague about what I needed to do or where I needed to go.  The graphics are decent despite everyone being a faceless being and the voice acting is right on point.  But those things aren't really what the game's main draw is.\n\nThe game does an excellent job of allowing you to experience the family's grief when their son is diagnosed with cancer and their struggles with it.  It's not \"hollywoodized\" and melodramatic, instead being very much how people do react in situations like these in real life.  Sometimes you don't always cry when someone you love is discovered to be terminally ill, but instead convince yourself that you can fight the disease and win in the end.  Or, perhaps you don't feel anything at all and the grief hits you many days later when you can actually process what you've been told.  It's different for everyone.  \n\nI'll admit that I didn't cry at any point throughout this game, despite what everyone else says.  I knew how much pain the characters were in and how upset they were, as the game developers did an excellent job with showing their grief, but I never felt overwhelming pain myself.  I don't know if it's because I'm emotionally dead at times or because I'm a nurse and it's my job to keep professional distance from heartbreaking situations like this with my patients, but that's just how I felt.    \n\nBut despite my apparent semi-apathy, I'd still reccomend this game.  It's a short experience, clocking in at about 2 hours depending on how much time you take to explore the environment.  It's a wonderful experience and it does provide a good sense of closure to all those who might have perished because of unfortunate reasons.  \n\nAnd maybe in that time, you can feel what I couldn't and cry the tears that wouldn't come for me.", "timestamp_created": 1483073901, "timestamp_updated": 1483073901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28816395": {"recommendationid": "28816395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053511979", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488004836}, "language": "english", "review": "Instructions for Hard Mode:\n-Get drunk\n-Get emotional\n-Try not to cry\n\nIt's a movie worth playing. \n\nRIP", "timestamp_created": 1483073710, "timestamp_updated": 1483073710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28816259": {"recommendationid": "28816259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065125103", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513291273}, "language": "english", "review": "That Dragon, Cancer is one of the few games I can't bring myself to properly \"review\".

Now that may sound like I'm insulting the game, but nothing can be further from the truth. 'That Dragon, Cancer' is a kind of quality that words cannot adequately express; a deep, meaningful look into a real family's struggle with cancer and the complexity of everything they went through. You don't so much play as anyone or anything, but rather you fallow the family through the experience. You're introduced to their son Joel, and from there the game takes you through the story switching from vantage point to vantage point. There's a haunting, almost dream-like, pressence that lingers througout the experience and really gets across the full emotional weight of this very sad story. I caution any particularily sensitive players to play this game with discretion as certain portions of the game are very graphic, for instance the inclusion of real audio of a dying child screaming in pain from dehydration, actual CAT scans of the child, and some extremely emotional testimonies of the whole process. Truthfully this experience shouldn't be handled like just another piece of entertainment. The game goes far beyond just being a game. In this documentation lies the power to make you question, to make you appreciate the people around you, and to change the way you look at certain things. I personally am more appreciative of my health and the health of those around me for having played this game; that's the sort of powerful experience That  Dragon, Cancer really is. It's a very short game that can be completed in just over an hour, but what it does in that time is remarkable, beautiful, terrible, and deeply meaningful all at the same time. In short, That dragon, Cancer is a beautiful documentation about suffering, loss, faith, endurance, and perseverance made by two loving parents in memory of their son. It's a brutal look at the depths of human suffering, as well as a testimony of love and faith all executed in a masterful way and made all the more intense by the fact that every bit of it is authentic.

While I think this story perhaps could have been a little more powerful for me *personally* if it had been about people struggling with cancer without the belief in God, it is in fact about a family that *does* believe in God, and so it's basically imperative that the game touches on that and shows how the family deals with cancer in a religious context. What's more, you hardly have to be religious to empathize with the suffering and struggle that's going on.\n\nOn the downside, I unfortunately got very frustrated in the church scene, where I couldn't figure out how to advance the narrative to the next scene, even after googling for how the scene was supposed to work.

Music is excellent and ambient sound in general, builds a great atmosphere. \nYES, headphones are required!!!\n\nI will not write about story or plot, because game is fairly short and you need to experience it yourself, but the main idea is that you're going trough family\u2019s struggle of fighting with cancer. This journey starts up simple, but at the times becomes quite powerful, at one point I wanted to quit the game, because it was a bit heavy on emotional side. \nAs someone, who works in chidren hospital, I got to meet kids with cancer, and seeing them, knowing their health condition and prognosis, or seeing how slowly they become worse, makes you feel sad and desperate, but playing this game, and seeing it from perspective of family and relatives is whole new look and even more grim one. \n\nAs you know, this interactive experience is not for everyone, but I would strongly recommend you to spend these couple hours with it.

the \u201cGames for Impact\u201d prize at the Game Awards 2016, \u201cThat Dragon, Cancer\u201d is a game about developer Ryan Green\u2019s son Joel and his 4-year battle against cancer. From the first minutes, we learn from narration that Joel Green is not like a regular kid at his age, since he can't speak properly at the age of 2. At age 1, Joel was diagnosed with an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor and developed seven other tumors through the four following years. During the gameplay, we see his improvement through chemotherapy, but things turn dark when doctors bring the news that Joel\u2019s treatment is not curative and other tumors might develop. All in all, we follow the part of the parents who spend sleepless nights and live in a roller coaster of emotions towards a child that will hardly survive. The game\u2019s title is taken from a story told by Ryan and Amy to Joel\u2019s siblings about him being a brave knight that has to fight a powerful dragon named Cancer. In it\u2019s gameplay, you play a mini platformer as Joel the knight and need to avoid the dragon\u2019s constant attacks.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nAs the story suggests, this is a walk through the lives of Ryan and Amy Green and their struggles while facing their son\u2019s sickness. From time to time the playability will vary from first person, to third person, and even to a short platformer. Gameplay is mostly walking and moving to places, and the interactions are focused on selecting story frames, paintings, cards and certain actions the characters do. It follows a single storyline, so you won't have choices, except for the order of elements you want to see or even if you want to see them. At some points, you can change your \u201cperspective\u201d and jump from character to character and listen to their thoughts and feelings. Though it doesn't give you much choice-making opportunities, this game\u2019s intention is to tell a story that has happened and unfortunately happens to tons of people every day. So if you are expecting an exciting gameplay full of choices that change the story, you should probably reconsider playing this game or opening your mind to this kind of experience.\n\nDESIGN, PRESENTATION AND MUSIC\n\nThis game has had some negative reviews, specifically about its design, playability and specific parts of the story, so let\u2019s calm down and chat, shall we? For the design, it is as simple as it can be: the characters and scenery are modeled in a simple 3D texture and characters are faceless, the color palette is simple but changes according to the scene and the characters\u2019 feelings and thoughts. On the first scenes, we can notice black spiky balls and dark trees surrounding the scenery, even contrasting to the rest of it. Those are the representations of cancer, sometimes far from our perspective but always present. On some scenes we see imaginative recreations from the moments the Greens have been through, such as the heavy rain inside the room when the doctors talk to them about the treatment options for the tumor that don't guarantee other tumors won't grow and a wagon ride in the hospital imagined as a car race. As psychology suggests, we all experience things differently, and metaphors can help others to try and understand how we feel and think, so I\u2019ve found the fantasies created relatable to the actual experiences. The soundtrack is very good, specially on touching scenes. But what broke me were the narrations from Ryan and the recordings from when Joel was alive. This is not just a fictional story with good interpretations, it is the real documentary of real people\u2019s lives, so even though I myself don't have kids and don't even plan to, I cried as hard as if it were my actual son that I was hearing screaming and crying in pain.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBefore we move on to the conclusion, there are a few thing I\u2019d like to address. This game has a very present religious theme, so very often you\u2019ll hear Amy saying just how much she believes in God\u2019s power and His plans for Joel and for their family. Though Christianity is the world\u2019s largest religion, obviously not everyone can relate to their thoughts and world views. I for example had nearly zero reasons to relate to this game at all: I am not a parent, I am not a Christian and the people I know that have had cancer at some point had it diagnosed quick enough to give it proper treatment. But there is something that should probably be louder to people who gave this game a try than just the game\u2019s design, it\u2019s gameplay or even the religious themes. This game is about Empathy. \u201cThat Dragon, Cancer\u201d is not about the possibilities of playing, it\u2019s about putting yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s not about having beautiful graphics, it's about showing that this could happen to anyone. It's not about a God or faith, it's about human hopes and doubts. It\u2019s not about you or me, it's about someone other than us. And, above all, it is not about Ryan or Amy: it's about Joel. This is his story. Unlike games, life sometimes doesn't give you choices. Cancer is not a choice. The treatments available for it are and we must deal with the consequences of the choices we make, at times dealing with stuff we didn't even get a saying in. This story is the unfolding of the choices these parents made trying to save someone's life. A child\u2019s life.

Through their eyes, you experience all the different coping mechanisms they go through as Joel slowly fades away. To say this game is depressing is an understatement. It tricks you into thinking you can fix an issue like this if you just solve the puzzle or find the right solution only to be hit with the harsh realities of life and death. I imagine this is how parents of sick children feel. There is no \"win\" condition to \"beat\" this game and that's not the point. The goal is to make you feel every ounce of helplessness and despair as a loved one suffers and die. You WILL cry during this game. The moment came for me when the game FORCED me to listen to Joel cry in pain and I had to hear the father plead with Joel not to bang his head on the cradle bars because there was nothing else he (and by extension, me) could do. \ud83d\ude22\nCan I recommend it? Objectively speaking, it's not a good game. It's more interactive novel than game (and even the \"interactive\" sections aren't true choices), the controls and interface needs work and it moves too slow. However, this didn't win best game... it won best game for impact which was set up for titles that deal with important social issues and on that metric That Dragon, Cancer shines. No other game will make you experience grief and mourning nor make you aware of the effects of cancer to a family. On that immersive trait alone, I can highly recommend it... just be sure to have tissue nearby. :(", "timestamp_created": 1480857512, "timestamp_updated": 1480857512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28181946": {"recommendationid": "28181946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160522326", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480851535}, "language": "english", "review": "A little gem.

it is more like a work of art.\nLike a touching picture. Shortly before the death of my grandfather, I have some time always unconsciously the game that the child into the \"I\" themselves. In fact, my grandfather did accompany me through a child frail period of those days, in every possible way and my grandmother to take care of me.\nSo, although the game at first I have done because it may really just \"feelings game\", and one eye to close one eye to praise, but when I slowly play down, I finally loose Breath, because it can be used to describe.\nThis game style tends to focus on tone expression.

They experienced the same doubts, desesperation and anguish. For example DD's also went beyond her lifespan, lasting 5 years and the family also had to move. That Dragon, Cancer sure hits home, as I've felt I was going through DD's scrapbook of her short life. I can finally see and feel how my friends felt, even though they weren't exactly an open book about it.\n\nAs for the game there isn't much to say. I liked the graphics and the music but the controls are iffy and it's very short.

This title was tear jerker for those who have experience with cancer. If you have lived or worked with it you know the devastating effects of what cancer can do to an adult let alone a child. That is what the developers were trying to get across in the story. Unfortunately, if you haven't/don't live or work with the disease you have limited information on it. \n\nThe story is a little broken. We hear small bits from the family's life and journey with their child/brother taken from home videos. The small bits of narrative don't really make much sense in some cases. The developer and his family are Christian. Get over it. This is their memoir for their child, not yours. If you don't like a game mentioning Christiananity or religion for a few minutes then move on, please. It was interesting to see that this wasn't a feel good game like we see oh so often. That Dragon, Cancer was meant to move you, meant to make you think about things.\n\nThe controls are... not good. It's a basic point-and-click interaction and the game takes you in a on rails journey. My mouse cursor kept ending up on my second monitor. To fix it I had to keep pausing and readjusting the cursor's orientation. Not a fan of doing that. I didn't try the game with a controller, I didn't see the need to play with one. At times trying to figure out where to go or what to do with a puzzle could be confusing mostly in the chapel. The mini games inserted into the main title were decent metaphors for what was going on in the story or what might have been going through the minds of the family and Joel.\n\nThe artwork is minimalistic and I love it. They wanted to focus on the story and not your newfangled hyper realistic graphics. Representing cancer as black, dead trees is fantastic. What kid isn't scared of a tree scratching their window as the wind blows? It was nice to see the perspective change from first person to third person on occasion. Seeing things from Joels perspective (eye level) \n\nThe length vs amount you are paying ratio isn't fantastic. I spent two hours going through the game and taking my time with it. Get this title at a discount, there could have been more content put into this title than what they did. I cannot recommend this game to everyone. It's not for everyone. IMO That Dragon, Cancer is aimed at those who have experience in dealing with cancer and/or for those who want to learn more about oncology and the toll it takes on family members. \n\nOverall 9/10 point removed due to the awkward controls.", "timestamp_created": 1478890064, "timestamp_updated": 1478890064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26531658": {"recommendationid": "26531658", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971042239", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478839979}, "language": "english", "review": "My mother was diagnosed with cancer in end of 2013. It was a tumultuous time, filled with some glimmer of hope, many restless nights, and the occasional crying when nobody was looking. It was a lonely time, despite having the support of family and friends near and far. It was a time when everybody was putting on a brave face, especially my mother, who did not want her family to see her being sad or in pain. She is like that -- she would rather keep her pain to herself than make other people sad or worry about her.\n\nTo this day, the memory of my mother having cancer, despite her being in remission at the time of this review, fills me with sadness and fear. (I wanted to weep as I typed this.) Cancer, or any (possibly) terminal diseases, casts a dark shadow over the victims and their circles of family and friends. Given my experience, I was drawn to 'That Dragon, Cancer' because I want to see how a family uses this medium to grief and to express their sorrow.\n\nI recommend 'That Dragon, Cancer' because it is an artistic work that depicts the impact of cancer on a family. I support it because it is a way for the family to deal with their loss and share their story. If it happens to help them recover part of the cost of the treatment for their child in the meantime, all the better.\n\nDespite my recommendation, I would like to point out that I was disappointed by how 'That Dragon, Cancer' turned out. What follows may contain or be considered spoilers for some people, so be warned.\n\n'That Dragon, Cancer' was advertised as an \"immersive, narrative videogame that retells Joel Green\u2019s 4-year fight against cancer through about two hours of poetic, imaginative gameplay that explores themes of faith, hope and love.\" Yet, it is not so much a \"videogame\", but more of an interactive narrative. Furthermore, the focus of 'That Dragon, Cancer' is not Joel's fight against cancer, but his parents' reaction to his diagnosis, pain, treatment, and death, as well as their feeling of helplessness.\n\nThe version of 'That Dragon, Cancer' that I \"played\" was version 1.0.1. It was very buggy although the initial set of fixes had been applied. It crashed multiple times, thus disrupting the story and my immersion into it. I read online that the developers suggested running 'That Dragon, Cancer' windowed instead of full screen to deal with the crashes. Not only did their recommendation not work, but running the program windowed only further lessened the immersion.\n\n'That Dragon, Cancer' also took a \"poetic\" (avant garde and abstract I guess?) approach to storytelling. I appreciated the earnest attempt to use metaphors and symbols to highlight the nastiness of cancer and the sense of helplessness, but it made the interaction and narrative disjointed. The inclusion of other people's notes and tributes to their own families and friends, while a nice gesture, only distracted from the main story. At the same time, I did not feel the \"dragon\" metaphor was fully explored, though comparing dealing with cancer to being in a dark forest was a nice touch.\n\n'That Dragon, Cancer' worked best when the sound effects and Jon Hillman's soundtrack were at the forefront. The dialogue were melodramatic at times and awkwardly delivered, but I did enjoy the voice acting for the father. I thought the scenes with the father reacting to Joel's crying were particularly poignant. Ironically, it was the showing of pictures of Joel during his various stages of cancer, and not the extravagant symbolism, that made me feel the family's pain and sorrow most because that was when it felt most real.\n\nSo, as a piece of art, I did not enjoy 'That Dragon, Cancer' that much. However, art is subjective, and you may feel differently about this production.

And I am going to explain why I can't advise you to play it.\n\nFirstly, \"That Dragon, Cancer\" is, of course, very personal game - it was created as a memorial for Joel by his loving family. But that is where the biggest misadvantage lies. The other people, who play this game, can not possibly feel all emotions of those who were on-the-spot witnesses of child's life. Compared, for example to other visual story, \"To the Moon\", \"That Dragon, Cancer\" have absolutely no benefits at all - no consistent story (just snippets), no beautiful graphics (of course, it was not priority, but anyway) and no remarkable moments.\n\nOne thing I can outline most is that I love visualisation of cancer itself as a terrifying black trees. And, to my way of thinking, there is only one touching moment in this game - a walk in hospital hallway full of \"goodbye\" postcards. But, unfortunately, this is it - other parts of game are not interesting, sometimes even boring. \n\nWith all due respect to those who create this game - sorry, but I was not impressed, so I clearly can't recommend it.

Die Entwickler von \"That Dragon, Cancer\" erz\u00e4hlen die ganz pers\u00f6nliche Geschichte ihres Sohnes Joel, dessen vier Jahre andauernden Kampfes gegen Krebs und letztlich seinen viel zu fr\u00fchen Tods. Gerade die erste H\u00e4lfte des Spiels vermittelt die Verzweiflung der Eltern im Angesicht des nicht endenden Leids mit einer Wucht, die zu Tr\u00e4nen r\u00fchrt und emotional zu tiefst bewegt. Die Hoffnungs- und Hilflosigkeit wird greifbar, schn\u00fcrrt die Kehle ein, und zumindest ich musste sehr oft an eigene an Krebs verstorbene Verwande denken.\n\nW\u00e4hrend die Entwickler mich anfangs voll mitnehmen konnten, verloren sie mich leider aber dann in der zweiten H\u00e4lfte, wenn sie von ihrer relig\u00f6sen Krise sprechen, von ihren Zweifeln an Gottes Gerechtkeit und Liebe, der Suche nach Antworten, um letztlich zu ihm und Trost im Glauben finden. Die christliche Thematik erreicht mich als nicht religi\u00f6sen Menschen nicht, sie wirkt auf mich hohl und unlogisch.

Leider wird gerade gegen Ende wegen fehlender visueller Hinweise die Suche nach dem n\u00e4chsten Wegpunkt frustrierend, und zumindest bei mir luden mehrfach Skripte nicht, weswegen ich eine Szene dreimal durchspielen musste.\n\nIch habe mir mit dem abschlie\u00dfenden Gesamturteil sehr schwer getan, denn die Geschichte von Joel ist einzigartig, das gesamte Projekt bewunderswert und gerade in die ersten Spielh\u00e4lfte eine echte Erfahrung.

If you are easily affected whilst playing the game, cancer can be cured if found quick, contact your local doctor, general practitioner or cancer centre for more help on how you can combat cancer\n\nI also highly recommend donating to your nearest cancer research centre. After playing this game I will (try to) donate a certain amount of money to Cancer Research UK; www.cancerresearchuk.org and to Dr. Klown; a local Maltese organisation that provides hospitalized children distraction and stress relief through fun and laughter; www.drklown.org [/quote]\n\nThat Dragon, Cancer is an adventure game developed by Numinous Games. This game has gotten a lot of mixed reception with gamers, however the game has gained critical acclaim with reviewers and critics across the board and I can understand both sides of the picture\n\nThat Dragon, Cancer is a linear short story adventure. A videogame developer's love letter to his son. The game is a poetic and playful interactive retelling of Joel\u2019s 4-year fight against cancer \n\nThe length of the game is extremely short (I finished it in over an hour and in one whole sitting) and the asking price is a bit too steep and some of the mechanics are a bit clunky, however, That Dragon, Cancer's story and character development especially with the Green family are nailed perfectly in the game\n\nThe story is well written and travels through the struggle that the Green family had to go through to help Joel's four year fight against cancer and the pain and thick and thin that poor baby Joel had to go through to fight against cancer\n\nI can understand the mixed responses from gamers about That Dragon, Cancer and I can also understand why critics and reviewers gave this game a near perfect score and to me personally I really enjoyed playing through That Dragon, Cancer. True, the length of the game is ridiculously short, however, it was interesting watching the sturggles that the family and Joel himself had to go through fighting against cancer\n\nThat Dragon, Cancer will and has mixed reception but if you are reading this review, then you are dying to know my recommendation. That Dragon, Cancer is a game everyone should try and play and finish in one whole sitting, however, for the retail price it is offering, I would not recommend it at its full price and rather wait for a price drop or a sale\n\nThat Dragon, Cancer is not the game for everyone, especially with the subject matter it is dealing with, however, a majority of gamers should at least give it a try...\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]\n[i] THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

I knew I would feel sad and might cry.. and it did when I finally clicked the play button today. \n\nI was always thinking games can be better than movies in engaging the emotions. Players have to think and move to get through the games. In some games, your moves are everything. You constantly move and do something. This is not that kind of game. You don't need to move much. You can get through it pretty quickly if you want to. But you don't play this game to see the ending. We all know the ending; the ending that nobody wanted. You play this to \"feel\"; and the developers, the parents of Joel's, take you through their emotional turmoil. It's a rather tightly set story. There's one storyline and it seems like there's mostly one way to make progress. You cannot skip a part or scene. You have to go through it like the parents had to go through it. It is painful. However indirect, watching a little baby son dying in your arms is painful; and that makes this game great. After playhing this game, you remember at least three names: Ryan, Amy and Joel Green. \n\nThe part where I felt the power of this medium called \"Game\" is when I was walking down the hallway in the hospital full of cards. I literally opened all the cards. Every single one of them. And I cried. They were the messages to their moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas, uncles and friends who had fought or are fitghting the dragon. While opening them one by one, I was so glad that I was playing this game and that I could open all of them. If it were a movie, they might open one or two of them to tell you what they are and the long shot of the hallway full of the cards would be it. I won't have a choice of acknowledging the messages someone sent to their loved ones.\n\nAll in all, it is not an easy game - playing itself is easy, there's nothing much you need to do. But digesting it is what I mean. But I didn't even get distracted once playing this game for 2 hours.

Also, I would've definitely enjoyed an option to choose to use WSAD to walk instead of point-and-click. I thought it was annoying to use most times and probably lessened my immersion in the game.\n\nAlso, I think this game might have been too short, or maybe I was expecting too much from it. The game felt quite short and anti-climactic, however the pace is painfully slow. Usually scenes will last as long as you let them, which can make certain scenes go on for what feels like forever. It felt to me like they would rather show a slow, symbolic, campy scene rather than the intenseness of how real life must've felt. I dunno. Maybe I was over-estimating this game.\n\nAll in all, there were a few scenes I thought had a very clever mechanic or idea, but I never really felt immersed in this game like I wanted to be.

I loved this game as a whole and the vast majority of the different parts within it.  For me, and I would dare say any parent, it was intensly cathartic.  There was one part that was so perfectly designed to provide the perspective of a parent going through this experience I could barely make it through the game.   When I was done with that part, I don't want to spoil it, my mind was blown!   I barely made it through, it was so emotionally traumatic, so painful, so uncomfortable.   I think if I wasn't so thoroughly enveloped in the experience at the time, and had actually remembered I was using a VR headset, I would have pulled off the vive during the specific part metioned previously!  I was shaking, crying, practically balled up on the floor in agony.   Right after that sequence pulled the tear soaked Vive off my face and I thought: \"WHOA, what was that!  How...wha....WOW!!!\"   \n\nMy poor little three year old son was excessively snuggled, hugged, and kissed a lot more than he was used to after I experienced this game!   \n\nObviously, I highly recommend this game!   I am not sure if I have even reviewed any game before in my life!   Seriously though, it is unique, powerful, and I cherish it's influence.  I think any person, and especially any parent would feel similarly.  I plan to share with some of my friends and family.   \n\nTo the parents this story involves:  Thank you, I am sure this was difficult to make.  It is beautiful, I honestly would describe it as a masterpiece!   Ironically through experiencing something where your hope was lost and tragically, dare I say violently and cruelly murdered even, this story inspires hope in people who may have to endure a similar experience.  You showed others that you can survive it.   You may not come through it the same, or without painful or crippling injury, you showed everyone it is at least possible to get through it.   \n\nI know it may not be possible but making a full VR/native VR experience of this with a few adjustments to take advantage of the increased immersion VR provides would be AMAZING!!!   Even a much shorter version that uses the core of this game would be great to see!   I loved the concept and how well this was implimented.  I just can't get over how much the VR factor seemed to matter and influence the experience for me!

For me, this gave me the opportunity to understand how the different characters were handeling Joel's situation.  The graphics are stunning but different from other games as they show no facial details on the characters, making you imagine what the characters are going through.  I did not know going into the game, but the voice actors were the actual family, and the adorable laughing is Joel's himself; looking at this, I would not want the voice acting any other way as it adds more sentiment to the story.\nMany people are cautious about playing games with sadder topics like about cancer or death, but I think that everyone should give this game a try as it will affect anyone who plays it.  Overall, finding the correct words to describe this game as a whole is difficult as it makes you question uncertain topics on death or if there is an afterlife as well as questioning what would you do if you were in this situation.

It is through that lens that I played this.\n\nIt's impossible to overstate how heavy and depressing this game is. I suppose if you're knowingly playing a game about a child with cancer, this is not a surprise, but I found it to be unflinchingly devastating even knowing that and setting my expectations appropriately. The scene where the father is trying to calm his very sick boy and failing is far too real for my liking. I sincerely hope I never experience anything like this.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that this is a \"walking simulator\" - there's no real gameplay here, you merely exist to move the story along. It's true that there are some mini-games - a racing one and a metroidvania bit, but they require no skill and offer no reward other than doing them.\n\nI know that most people deal with and process grief in their own way, and in that light, I don't begrudge anyone's path through such a horrible event.\n\nThat said, the game takes on a very, very strong religious tone about halfway through, and I found it offputting. In way, this was a relief, because it allowed me to take my focus off the true grief of the game's events and turn it into eye-rolling at the game designers. I found it ham-fisted and at odds with everything else going on. Take out the parables about Jesus, Lazarus, the Jesus in the boat with disciples thing, and the game would take on a much more univeral tone.\n\nBut as I say, I don't begrudge anyone their own personal path through such an event. If it brought them peace, more power to them.\n\nWith that in mind, I'd recomment this with the caveat that the strong Christian preaching may take you wholly out of the experience at key times. Also, be absolutely sure that you're ready to experience a magnitude of grief unlike most anything else.\n\nI'd give this a 3/5.

Yes. Very much so. That Dragon, Cancer contains a story that can only really have been done as interactive software. Never in my years growing up playing on various systems would have I believed that someone would someday use video games to tell a story like this. Its runtime is no longer than that of your average movie, and in that time it shows the whole spectrum of the Greens' experiences with Joel, from the highest joy to the deepest despair. I can only imagine the pain and bravery from the Greens that was required to recollect these experiences to share with us.

Don't buy the game, and instead, donate the money to cancer research or directly to the family (if there is a way) and watch a stream of it. The game is frustrating at times and I feel it distracts from the emotion of the story. \n\n\n\n\nThe question is, do I recommend this 'game'? Game... no. Story, yes. In fact, I think the game aspect actually takes away from the story. \n\nI read the reviews and I read their website. I never watched videos though, because I didn't want to get spoiled. And for the most part, I knew what I was getting into.\n\nI bought this game because I wanted to support the family and I wanted to be sucked into the emotions that they had during this struggle. I wanted to be brought to tears. I wanted to be emotionally hurt. But in the end... I just simply wasn't, and I blame the 'game' side of it. \n\nThere are many times when you just sort of wander/fly around without direction and you aren't entirely sure of where to go (This could be a heavy dose of symbolism, and I get that). The problem with that, is that there is simply NO direction at all. Some in game triggers require you sit in one spot and listen for a while, or you walk back and forth from one area to another, repeat, repeat, repeat until the next event triggers. You spend a lot of time just saying \"I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm just sort of pushing buttons.\" I still don't know what we were supposed to actually do to advance in the story. There are many occasions where you just sort of hit buttons until something happens. But then there are also moments where you sit there and hit buttons..... but nothing ever happens beyond this loop. But you're not told to give up and walk away, so you don't know if you're really supposed to keep hitting those buttons. \n\nSo here is my problem. The story will hit you hard with an emotional moment, but then it will immediately transition to a frustrating \"I just don't know what I'm supposed to be doing???\" moment. And while this could be symbolic, I personally feel that it distracted me from the story. \n\n\nSo at the end of this review, here is my recommendation. I suggest that you take the money you were going to spend on the game to support the family, and either donate it to cancer research or find a means of getting it to the family. After doing so, watch a stream of this game online somewhere. This way, you get to experience the story without having to play the frustrations, but also more than 10% of the money will end up going to charity.  \n\nI think it is a beautiful story and I think it's awesome that this even exists. Leaving it at being simply an homage to their son, it's beautiful. But selling it to people in order for them to indulge in the feeling of tragedy.... it could use a bit of tidying up. But, then again, everyone is different and everyone has their own opinions/stories/reasons for doing/saying/feeling how they do.", "timestamp_created": 1462888125, "timestamp_updated": 1462888125, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22864479": {"recommendationid": "22864479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057432415", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462718196}, "language": "english", "review": "wtf, I came here to have fun, not to feel.

The story (about two hours long) is divided into several scenes of two types - the real descriptive scenes, and spiritual/metaphoric scenes about hope.\n\nWhat I really loved about the game were the scenes showing the real events from mixed point of views - the game is directed to play a lot with the camera point of views. Those are also the scenes that felt immersive and can easily wake the emotions, e.g. talking with the doctor about Joel's cancer for the first time.\n\nThe other type of scenes is more used near the end and I'm more puzzled about that, as I found actually annoying to hear about Jesus and hope in almost every moment; though I must admit it perfectly fits into the characters without doubt. Besides dialogues between the parents, you can (optionally) read many notes about other patients with cancer, and few long letters about Joel. All those important letters, and all dialogues, are voice-acted with the top quality - the voice acting will truly support your empathy towards the characters. You'll be hearing all the despair and sadness, mixed with hope; but what will be your final notion?\n\nPresentation of the game is simply great, as it has arty visual style that requires you to think of the visual metaphores' context. Besides that, it also provides you a lot of optional exploring in the gallery (great artworks and photos), or in the \"spritual scenes\" and the hospital, where all notes and letters are placed. Worth mentioning is also the great idea for subtitles - they aren't just a small text at the bottom of the screen, but they are placed directly into scenes, making even better impression.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nIf you don't mind games which are solely based around empathy for the story's characters, and you don't mind a depressive theme (child's cancer), you'll definitely enjoy this experience.", "timestamp_created": 1460576822, "timestamp_updated": 1466837548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22395797": {"recommendationid": "22395797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017640687", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460486125}, "language": "english", "review": "Get the tissues boys and girls, you need them.\n\n^^i hope that gets me likes. Anyways, this is not a review that only shows the good side, I will show some cons about the game aswell, so be prepared for this review.\n\nThis is quite an incredible game, and it really changes you in a way you wont notice at first. This game is very good at telling the story of Joel Green, a 4 year old boy who died of cancer, through 2 (or less) hours of gameplay. The game is quite short for a 15 euro game, but in that time it hits you. It goes into your heart and touches your feelings, and shows you how terrible it is to have cancer, or have a familymember that has cancer. When i played this game I had chills almost all the way through, and I cried alot. The story is told in a beautiful way, and is quite easy to follow. Sometimes you can get a bit confused with what you have to do (maybe i'm just dumb) but it'll take you like 5 mins to carry on.\n\nThis game can sometimes be a bit boring, as some parts I felt were a bit long timed, like in the end with the keyboard, it took 10 mins before it let me finish, or when you got the bad news, that was also a long part. But even though the bad news part was long, I started crying in the first 2 mins of it, and cried for 20 mins after that. This game will touch you very deeply, and will make you cry atleast 1. The minigame where you are playing as Joel and floating with the balloons, trying to dodge the cancer, is quite a weird one. I found it quite hard to know where a cancer \"cell\" was, and I sadly lost that minigame. The one with the dragon, where you are playing as Joel, the Brave Knight, i found it quite weird that I couldn't kill the dragon, and quickly realized that you probably arent supposed to. \n\nNow and then religion will pop into this game, so if you dont like that stuff, dont play the game. As an atheist i wasn't bothered, as it's just there to add to the story, and it does. 15 euros can also seem quite expensive for a 2 hour game, and it is quite a high price, but it still doesn't mean that the price isn't worth it. I found the 15 euros I used well spent, and i would recommend you to give this game a go.\n\nNow for the story part. As said, the story is about a boy called Joel Green, who sadly lost a 4 year battle with cancer. This gets told in a very beautiful way, and shows that cancer is a hard thing to deal with, and how devestating it can be, to either have, or have a familymember, that has to deal with cancer. It starts off quite slowly, with you just walking places, listening to voicemails, and to conversation between the family Green. But as the game progresses, it'll hit you hard with emotions, and make you realize, that cancer is a piece of shit. It shows hard cancer is to get rid off, and the war you have to fight to get through it. The fight with cancer is a long one, and is one that can be hard to deal with, and this game shows you that. It shows that cancer isn't just going to the hospital and getting chemo, but is also laying with your child, hoping they'll fall asleep soon. Sitting in the hospital, waiting for the final results to come in, and maybe in the end, losing hope, and giving up, thinking the fight is hopeless. But it also shows that hope is a strong thing, and can help you through bad times, even though some people might tell you that you should give up, and just stop trying. If you have known someone who has dealt with cancer, give them a highfive, tell them how proud you are, or if you know someone who has cancer, give them courage. Tell them to keep fighting on, as the fight isn't always hopeless. I send my regards out to all of you who have had familymembers, or friends, who had cancer, but sadly lost the fight in the end.\n\nThis game changed me, but i can't figure out how yet, I can just feel that something has changed in my life. This game made me go through more emotions than i have gone through in a long time. This game showed me how hard it is to live with cancer, or live with someone who has cancer. This game, is the game, that i would recommend you all to buy.\n\nSolid 9/10. Beautiful story telling, beautiful art style, and is a game that will change you.

I absolutely love art-y type games, especially when they're story based things such as this. \n\nAs an overall, I absolutely loved this game, and I do highly suggest to people to play it. Do keep in mind that there is a heavy religion theme throughout, so if that is something you dislike then you may want to just avoid it. I did spot some odd moments where things didn't seem to be the way they should've (in particular, one particular scene with Joel crying yet he's not even invisible even though it seems like he should be there).\n\nThat Dragon, Cancer will make you cry. This is a game you'll likely only play through once however, so I'd highly suggest trying to find it on sale if possible. It is worth the couple hours it'll take to play it though, so once you're able to find it on a sale, pick it up as soon as you can. This game is an easy recommend from me, so long as you keep in mind that it'll likely only last you one playthrough and it has heavy religious themes (they are done well, at least).", "timestamp_created": 1460156041, "timestamp_updated": 1460156041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22304000": {"recommendationid": "22304000", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970286141", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460137040}, "language": "english", "review": "I have never had an experience where playing a game made me want to be a better person.

At the end I will explain why I ended up paying money for this game.\n\nFrom many of the reviews you will see that the game has a great style.  I completely agree with this as the art, the voice acting, the story are each superb in their delivery of an emotionally rife game experience.  They all add up and blend together to pull you in.\n\nI have also seen that the basic mechanics can be difficult and do somewhat hamper the immersive aspect of the game.  Once again, I am in agreement with those points.  There were times where my attention was solely focused on trying to figure out just what the game was expecting me to do and it pulled me out of the moment.\n\nAs has been noted time and again, religious content is also highly visible and presented with a very specific perspective.  Being such a highly charged topic I will only say that you need to decide if you are willing to sit down and hear what the Green's think and feel about their faith and how that plays in their experience with Joel's fight with cancer.  For them it played a significant part and, as this is their story, it is present in the game.  You don't have to agree with or accept what they think, you just need to decide if you want to listen.  Enough said for now.\n\nFor my own overall opinion, the negative points were quite minor and once I was past them they were completely forgotten in light of the deep impact of this story.\n\nTLDR: Now we come to why I bought, played, and reviewed the game and my recommendation and advice.\n\nAs a new \"Dada\", this one hit me right in the tear-box from the video, even before I bought it.  Deeply emotional, I had to consider hard if this was a journey I was willing to make and a subject matter I was willing to immerse myself in.  Ultimately, I bought it because I wanted to support the family.  I could have let it sit there but I played it because... I wanted to see if I could handle it.  I needed to know, on a deeply personal level, if I could be exposed to this sort of situation \"first hand\" and come out the other end intact.  When I finished I was mostly intact but never will I forget what I felt imagining that this was my child.  I will never be the same for witnessing this story in this way.  I look at my child and my time with them very differently now.\n\nBuy it to support the family if that is something you are willing to do.  Buy it if you want to have a very poignant, narrative driven, game experience.  Buy it if you want support the Indie Dev world.  Whatever your reason, make sure that once you've bought it you take time to play through it with an open mind and heart.  If you play it while closed off to the emotions of others you will likely not have a worth-while time with this game.  If you are open, this very likely will change the way you interact with those you love.

It makes the lives of others a reality to us. We get to see into the lives of other people, which is more valuable than most realize.

The Game goes into detail expressing the feelings of the Family when dealing with the disease and the struggles that both Joel and the Parents face.\n\nWith a story such as That Dragon, Cancer a question often asked is would the game would have benefited being a written story or a movie (granted the documentary for the making of the game is going to be released soon and will no doubt show more details regarding the story) rather than a game. I feel that the story of That Dragon, Cancer could not have been told in any other way that would have been more beneficial to the overall tale. This is because the game allows for the player to more deeply connect and empathize with the character\u2019s as they go through their hardships struggling along with the parents of Joel their struggles become the player\u2019s struggles. The struggles are represented through the game\u2019s mechanics and the interactivity allows the player to more deeply connect and empathize with both the parents and Joel as the game dynamics detail what it was really like for them to go through it on a more interactive and close level.\n\nThis technique of using game mechanics to tell a story has been used before, most notably in Anna Anthropy\u2019s Dys4ia where having her story detailed through the mechanics and rule set of a game gave allowed her to tell her story in a way which no other form of media had access to and overall helped her communicate her story in a more meaningful and interesting way. She used the game mechanics to demonstrate to the player how she felt in a way that words never could. That Dragon, Cancer has the same idea but instead of using abstract artistry and design it goes for a much more visceral and direct means of 87617161_green-familycommunicating its message. Visceral is the only way to describe the overwhelming sadness when playing this game as the horrific events come one after the other and give little time for the character\u2019s or the player to have respite. However That Dragon, Cancer is not always sad which makes those sad moments even more so, An example of this is the section of the game where Joel is racing around on his toy car in the hospital, the game turns into a pseudo Mario cart type game. Joel races around on his little car picking up power ups, only these power ups are representative of things to do with chemotherapy. This constantly reminds you that all though the moment right now is joyful, there will be sad moments in the future.\n\nThroughout the game a big emphasis is put on the parents faith. Both Ryan and Amy Green are christian in real life and as such this is shown in the game. During the story both Ryan and Amy have different spiritual experiences. Amy has faith that God will perform and miracle and save her son, she has doubts but thinks that by having doubts that God may not save her son that it lessens the chance of such miracle happening so throughout that-dragon-cancer-park-at-the-edge-of-the-world1the story the player sees that Amy is constantly shoving aside her doubts and trying her best to believe that God will save her son even until the very end. Ryan however has a much different experience, His experience is one of despair as he feels that God will not save his son as he is not \u2018important\u2019 enough in Gods eyes, Ryan feels that God does not have time to save his son and this makes him feel depressed and unworthy throughout the game. However Ryan still tries to maintain faith praying for god to cure his son. During the Game there is a section where the player is in a church and if they go up to the stand the room will go dark and some of the candles will light up, in the background both Ryan and Amy can be heard desperately praying for God to save their son, eventually the candles will go out however the player can light them again. This creates a constant struggle of the player trying to keep as many candles lit as possible even though it is impossible to have them all lit whilst Ryan and Amy are heard in the background desperately praying to try and save their son. This produces the feeling of panic and desperation within the player as they constantly attempt to keep the candles lit similar to how the parents felt at the time praying for their son. The player feels empathetic towards the parents as it feels like they went through those same feelings.\n\nThe saddest part for some player\u2019s in That Dragon, Cancer isn\u2019t specifically the games story or sections, a lot of player\u2019s will find a way that this story relates to a personal experience that they had. Whether that be an experience with cancer or having a sick family member The game manages to bring out those same feelings that the player might of had when they went through that experience, amplifying its emotional effect on the player. This is one of the strongest yet saddest points about the story in That Dragon, Cancer is that the story is relatable. Many of the players will reach the card section of the game and see a card that reminds them of that experience they had, amplifying the effectiveness of the games story as if the players feels like they can relate to the game then they are much more likely to have an emotional reaction to the game as they would if it were in real life.\n\nOverall That Dragon, Cancer is a game that hits the player right where it hurts. The games compelling and interesting yet depressing story draws the player in and outright punches them in the heart with its harrowing tale of a son with cancer.", "timestamp_created": 1459253484, "timestamp_updated": 1459253484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22113009": {"recommendationid": "22113009", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999571292", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459200877}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd only recommend this to someone who has had anyone in their life get cancer (whether or not they won the battle).", "timestamp_created": 1459200930, "timestamp_updated": 1459200930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577259", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22112645": {"recommendationid": "22112645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249223936", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466614123}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game of 2016 hands down \nthis game had me at tears of joy saddness and much more \ni feel so much different about life and how lucky i am to not have to go through what this family has gone through\ni recommend this game to evryone !!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1459199524, "timestamp_updated": 1459199524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22106202": {"recommendationid": "22106202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130053901", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459083908}, "language": "english", "review": "its good.

It is not a \"Christian video game,\" it is a game about Christians. It doesn't attempt to convert you, or even to present a moral. However, faith is a central part of this family's life, and so their faith is a deep part of this game. And there is a lot of sublety going on, which is not common. For example, the title of this game does become deeper towards the end of the game. And another example is [spoiler] near the end, you are in a cathedral, at a prayer service for the child, who is either dying or already dead. You can light candles, but they don't stay lit long enough. You can also play notes on a piano. Most of them are impassioned prayers. Some of them are primitive drums, or notes from a ram's horn. You try to find the right notes to play, as if that would save Joel. It doesn't.

I for one am someone who loves one time, amazing, well crafted narratives and as a game developer myself, I don't believe a game needs to have a complex narrative with branching story plot. \n\nSure you could argue the game would be better as a movie, but it's deliberately made as a game so that users can experience a part of what the Green's were going through and basically...the game is all about emotion and you projecting yourself onto the story arc. \n\nThe soundtrack for this game is amazing, I'm going to buy it ASAP because it's a really nicely done soundtrack, while the low poly art style works well both technically and as a way to project yourself into the arc, which it was intended to do. \n\nThe game definetly relies alot on emotion and if you don't have emotion then this game is not for you. I read as [spoiler] many of the cards as I could in the hospital[/spoiler], until it got so much for me that I started to break down. \n\nThe game also includes briefly other peoples cancer stories and having family members who died of cancer, this part really hits home for me...hard. \n\nI'd recommend this game, however I do agree that the price tag is steep. But then I also believe it shouldn't be brought on sale, it should be brought at full price as I'd feel like I'd ripped off a charitable donation if I brought it on sale. I like the art style, narrative and the soundtrack and I doubt it could have achieved the same effect if done any other way  (say, as a movie). \n\nIt also hit home for me to many other aspects of my life, especially as my name is Joel, the same as one of the Green's sons. Not even just about cancer, but about loss, grief, hope, illnesses (including mental illnesses) and lots of other aspects. \n\nI'd rate it an 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1459028378, "timestamp_updated": 1459028378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.979660", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22067745": {"recommendationid": "22067745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246936928", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459751028}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first heard about That Dragon, Cancer from my children, I couldn't understand what the appeal would be. It is a \"game\" about a child having and dying from cancer. But, they kept asking for it, so when it went on sale, I bought it. I decide I would check it out before telling them. Here is what I learned:\n\nI cried through the whole thing. My husband has been battling stage IV lung cancer since 2012. I write about the journey our family has been on. You have to do something to sort out the emotions you are experiencing, and writing is my gift. \n\nGame development is the gift that Eli's dad has. He has used his gift in an amazing way to share his family's experience with the world. This is an immersive experience, more than a game. It is so real and raw.\n\nSo why would someone want to \"relive\" the cancer experience through a game, or through any other format for that matter? Because in seeing other people's journies, you discover that you are not alone. One of the interesting things in That Dragon, Cancer, was the different ways that each parent coped. The struggles with faith, the reactions to events. It was beautiful to see that other people have the same questions when they face the Dragon. It is also inspiring to see them overcome. \n\nI have been thinking a lot lately about the phrase, \"Walk a mile in my shoes.\"  Until you do that, you really can't impose your value system on others. There has been criticism in some of the reviews about the amount of God and faith in the game. This bothers me because our society has made God and faith taboo. God is how this family overcame the pain of their son's cancer. God is how our family, and many other families, overcome this Dragon.\n\nI would recommend this game highly. Have a box of Kleenex nearby, though.

Mostly one simply clicks on obvious clickable objects and watches plot unfurl. This is not a deal breaker for me, as I can move past game mechanics to story.  With a story though, the expectation is of a good story. This game fails to deliver in that regard, emotional on the surface, but not eliciting that emotion.\n\nThis failure is in many ways muddled by the nature of the subject matter, childhood cancer, which makes me want to instinctively like it because to not feels like an endorsement of cancer and an attack on the people who made this who experienced a definitively tragic event. However, this is another big problem in the creation of the story. This game was created by people with first hand experience in this regard, but they are also the characters in the game, and they have most clearly written themselves into the game in their best Sunday dress. As a result the game is something of a story retold by the people who experienced it, but viewed through their own distorted views of themselves. No one in this game has any sort of flaw whatsoever, and the closest attempts for the characters to have flaws are laughable, amounting to being despondent in a situation where there is no fault feeling as such. The whitewashing crushes the authenticity that could've existed, had this not been a memoir. The entirety of the narration lacked a human feel to it, and made me feel all the worse for not connecting to them as the main character is a cancer patient.\n\nAnother issue is that one of the central arcs of this game is of Christian responses to crisis. I am not religious, nor am I vehement against it. It feels as though I should at least not be against the theme, because to feel so feels like an aspersion on Christianity, but the theme was poorly thought out and written.  Occasionally, the use feels much like a sermon. I don't require characters to forsake their religion, and it is perfectly fine to be a useful coping mechanism, but it fails as a core game mechanic, serving mostly to deflect the very mortal concepts that would be the story's potential strength. It is alienating, and nothing inspiring came from it.\n\nThe artistic feel of the game is bland, and much in the game looked like painted wood with occasional real images jarringly inserted into this world. There are no faces in this game, which is understandable as it would be almost impossible to effectively communicate emotion with such faces, but it is symbolic of how this game fails to communicate emotion. The music in the game does not inspire or reinforce the emotions the game is trying to elicit, and is not noteworthy, which given the emotional nature of the game and that music can elicit, is a shame.\n\nIn the end my emotional response to this game was feeling bad that I didn't feel something from this game, but feeling like I shouldn't criticize it because of what it is. That is not indicative of a quality experience, and at a hefty price tag (15$ as of this writing), that is a very difficult sell, as this game is also quite short. If you think that this is perhaps because of some charitable donation from purchasing this game, then I would look harder, because I could find nothing indicating such a donation, which seems an oversight.\n\n[i]A key was given by the developer for review purposes to the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Original Curator Group[/url], with whom this review is affiliated.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1458996626, "timestamp_updated": 1458996626, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22056561": {"recommendationid": "22056561", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998776409", "num_games_owned": 3348, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458966837}, "language": "english", "review": "It is times like this that I wish that Steam had a maybe thumb for their reviews. The game is by no means a bad game, and there are certain people I would recommend it to. So lemme start off with the things that drew me to it in the first place and what I did like about the game. \n\nFirst off, the aesthetic is just plain beautiful. It is almost like an impressionist painting, just the way no colors are blended and the people within are close approximations of humans. It is a great game to look at no doubt. The voice acting is top notch, due in large part that the voices are given by the family that had to endure this tragedy. The fact that this family just lost their young son to cancer and were then able to create nearly every facet of the game on their own truly is a feat not many could pull off. I love narrative driven \"walking simulators\" so when a new one with a unique look, superb acting, and a real world story of loss came on my radar, I was very intrigued. \n\nThis leads to the reason I am thumbing it down. I was on board with the tragic elements that were unfolding, when suddenly that was all undermined with a literal deus ex machina entering the story. We all process grief in different ways, so while I respect the Green family's turn to God, I couldn't help but feel completely disconnected from the game. I am not a religious person at all, but even looking at this story objectively, they were clearly going for an emotional aspect. If you then swoop in and remind the player that \"Hey, its cool guys, we believe in God and this is God's plan for our kid to die,\" then you rob everyone of the emotional attachment they had. For me the tragedy moved to the Green's themselves, I couldn't help but think these poor people really follow a system in which they think a child's slow and painful death is a gift. \n\nOkay, that sounded harsh perhaps, and I did say I would recommend it to a certain person. I would recommend it to the Christian casual gamer. This game could be a stepping stone for some to experience games with a rich story. And I would recommend it to those who perhaps could overlook the religious aspects as I guess a sort of anthropologic study of those who use faith to help cope with truly saddening events.  Numinous Games has proven they have the chops to design beautiful games and act the hell out of a story.

As someone who doesn't necessarily believe in this faith, it makes it extremely hard to continue with the story. \n\nThe voice acting is relatively bad and downright awful at points. There are a few times where the narration gets so over done you can actually hear the *crackle* of the recording microphone. In a game/story so heavily focused on narration you think this would be better done.\n\nThe controls are clunky and annoying. You shouldn't have to click on the screen five times just to walk in the same direction another five feet.\n\nThe price. This has been mentioned in pretty much any negative review about this game. Since I dropped $15 on this game, I'd expect that there would be some warning about the religious overtones. The description simply suggests that the game explores themes of faith, but it doesn't talk about the fact that a rather large part of the dialogue becomes about religion and God.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nHonestly? Not a lot. I really wanted to love this game. To me, this game was very personal. When I was fourteen my father passed away from colon cancer. As someone who has watched a family member suffer, endure, and then become the victim of such a horrible disease, I expected this story to be very relatable. When you make a game/story about a touchy subject, such as cancer, you really need to make sure you do it justice.\n\nThat being said, there are parts of this game/story that are truly beautiful. Some of the metaphors are spot on when it comes to what the family's of cancer patients are feeling. The story also tries it's best to replicate what cancer patients are feeling as they go through the game. This gets to be an even touchier subject. How can you make a game/story off of the assumptions of how a cancer patient is feeling? Did I really have to be forced to listen to the main narrator sing \"God loves Joel\" for a good five minutes? What is the point?\n\nFor a game that is supposed to be focused on family, cancer, and the entire journey it is EXTREMELY focused on religion. Seriously, I honestly can NOT stress this enough. This game is 100% biased and 100% a religious story. The bible is quoted numerous times and there was one part where the word 'God' is said around fifteen times in the same paragraph.\n\nMy regret? Not reading the reviews before I bought this game, story, whatever you want to call it. I really wish I could go back in time and get my 1.6 hours back.

I am usually not easily sensitive and yet this game had me teary-eyed for the better half of its short narrative.\n\nTo say it is a tragedy is an understatement, though its flawlessly dosed raw emotion is exactly its most alluring distinction. That Dragon, Cancer is as poignant as can be, without the overdone drama one could expect, and is a profoundly human yet distressing interactive tale.\n\nSplendid art direction perfectly alternates between genuine memories and surreal moments, all rendered in stylish and colorful low-poly scenes, with minimal animation. I especially appreciated the subtle d\u00e9cor changes as the player pans the view. Outstanding audio envelops every scene interspersed with real recorded sound bytes. There is never any sense of urgency as the player takes time to fully evoke each moment.\n\nAs a game, and from a purely objective point of view, That Dragon, Cancer fails on many accounts, but that is completely beyond the point of what it aims to be. Crude controls and clunky interactions moderately damper the exploration. Moving about from point to point limits any sense of freedom. Mini games are few and deliberately executed clumsily.\n\nThis game regrettably suffers from its eventual surrender to religious beliefs. This was perhaps inevitable considering the Green family's Christian background but it was never essential to the intended communication. A neutral and measured spiritual position would have been more admirable.\n\nAt the risk of sounding condescending or inconsiderate, I must mention Amy's voice grew a bit grating at times, as was her over-reliance on faith. I found it much easier to relate to Ryan's more down to earth rationale and calm demeanor. One must never lose sight that these are real people, and as such I can only have the utmost respect for their determination.\n\nDespite the game's obvious but forgivable imperfections, it delivers a unique and sincere passage that can only be experienced to be properly understood and deeply felt. That it managed to produce such emotion in me is a testament to its powerful integrity. It projected me into a highly emotional state I did not suspect possible from this medium.

This game is no game. This game is the greatest glimpse into a life I have ever seen. It is.... so, so raw. The pure reality of everything they feel, of everything that happened. Just hearing the ad I am almost crying in remembering moments from it, and I am not your typical crying type.\nI would describe this game as about three things: faith, hope, and love. First, faith. Yes, there is discussion of faith. Its the realest discussion I've seen from art. You do not have to agree with it to understand what is happening. To understand what the emotion in this is. So don't let it turn you away, that would be a regrettable mistake. Second, hope. Closely tied to the first, hope is questioned, confirmed, dismissed, yearned for. And finally, love. Pure, unfiltered, raw love. It touches the entire piece, it is the cleansing, it is the pain, it is the joy. \nIn conclusion, experience it yourself. Take one sitting. Immerse yourself. And just experience another persons life.\n\nNominated for the 'I'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award.

However, I assure you that I am not coming from a place of ill-intent; I am merely being honest with my own personal experience.\n\nThat being said, this is a woefully earnest tale of faith, love, and loss. It presents these mournful concepts with symbolic, and sometimes straightforward minigames that will make you feel something bittersweet. The dialogue is beautifully poetic and somber, and the dramatic impact is futher reinforced by wonderful music and superb vocal performances.\n\nHowever, although it feels pointless to gripe about the mechanical aspects of this title, I have to be honest; the interface is particularly clunky in its restrictive way of navigating the environments and story. I understand that it is a narrative experience more than a traditional game, but I felt that it should be addressed. I was genuniely engaged and wanted to see more, but more often than not, general navigation and interaction was a chore.\n\nAlso, as a warning to those with adverse reactions to the mere mention of religion, this title has prevalent and reoccuring themes of faith that may alienate some players. During these particular segments I personally found it difficult to empathize fully with the game, although I still wholeheartedly understood and sympathized.\n\nIn conclusion, \"That Dragon, Cancer\" is beautiful, but not for everyone. Althought I could not connect with it as much as I had hoped, I am genuinely glad that something like that exists in the medium, even if it wasn't particularly made for me. And them I remember: it wasn't made for me. It was made for Joel, the child who fought so hard and was loved so dearly.", "timestamp_created": 1457851732, "timestamp_updated": 1457851932, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 450, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620004", "comment_count": "36", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21806246": {"recommendationid": "21806246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008498056", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457843976}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't generally write reviews for  games, but this one warrented it.\n\nI picked up and played this game for a series I'm doing with friends, and I wouldn't have heard about it any other way.\n\nThis game is beautifully done.

With medicine designed not only to hurt it, but your own body as well? Through God, who may or may not stay silent throughout your strife, or hope?

It disheartens me to see people who didn't like the game claiming it is an attempt to \"cash in\" on the grief of others due to it being a rather simple, breif venture, because I've seen firsthand just how emotionally engrossed the game's staff was in telling this story. If suffering is art, the very process of developing this game was an artform in and of itself.\n\nWhen it got a release date, I was left unsure how to promote it to others. Saying it was a \"game\" I was \"looking forward\" to \"playing\" felt wrong. Actually, when the game finally released, I purchased it and spent several days staring at it in my Steam library, procrastinating on actually playing it, because I knew I would be doing so much more than just \"playing a game.\" Rather, I would be taking a very personal journey that would both look into the soul of a single human being and encompass the voices of the many, many people - myself included - who have lost a loved one to cancer. \n\nI got exactly what I expected.

A number of blundering mini games and at times confusing story telling devices hurt the pacing and could have been cut completely. The price is quite high for less than two hours of content. Minimal to no replay value. \n[list]\n[*]Price\n[*]Mushy Controls\n[*]Blundering Minigames\n[*]Minimal to no replay value\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\n\nAt first glance you might think that this is a \u201cwalking simulator\u201d, but there is definitely more to the game than that. The game uses a number of point and click sections and a couple scenes that use more traditional style game mechanics to keep players involved in the story, making this much more of an interactive experience than something like Dear Ester.\nThat Dragon, Cancer explores memories of the Green family\u2019s high and low points over their child\u2019s four year battle with cancer. Voice acting in the game is done by the actual family members, or taken from home video recordings with their other children. Despite what your first reaction might be to hearing that professionals didn\u2019t record voice over for the game, the end result is surprisingly personal, and very well suited to the game.\n\nThis is where Dragon shines. The real moments between a family is something that I found very heart warming and sombre at the same time, even not having children of my own. These moments feel so organic and genuine because they actually are, much more than they would have if professional voice actors had recorded dialogue. \n\nAs the story progresses, It is very clear that when the game\u2019s lead developer, Ryan Green, pitches this game as \u201cA videogame developer's love letter to his son\u201d, he means it. A number of chapters are extremely personal and introspective of life and his faith, it is very evident to me that this game was a form of therapy to him in one way or another. \nDragon does set the stage to be a very emotional affair, and having a few friends who have dealt with cancer in their lives, I was expecting to add it to my list of games that made me cry. As the credits started playing however, I was surprised that the game never came close to hitting that emotional tone for me. The family\u2019s faith is featured very prominently during the most emotional sections, which for anyone who is religious is understandable given the situation. I respect the game for addressing the ideas of faith, and for anyone who is religious I imagine these moments are all the more impactful for it. For me however, as someone who is very cynical about faith and religions, especially when involving tragedies like terminal childhood diseases, most of these moments of god talk did little more but distract and take me out of the moment. \nVisually, That Dragon, Cancer is a very pleasant game to look at. While obviously not trying to be the next Crysis benchmark, and not breaking any new ground in the style department, the game makes effective use of the low-poly model look. Strangely I encountered Z-fighting in a few areas, and what I *think* was a strange glitch with a couple of the models. While these issues are minor and nothing game breaking, they are basic problems I would expect to be fixed before release.\n\nFinally we reach the actual game play, something I purposefully left to the end because I believe it to be the worst part of this interactive experience. Much of Dragon is point and click navigation from a first person perspective, with what I think of as \u201careas of interest\u201d; players click to move forward and the camera animates to the next point in the level, giving it a Google Street View vibe. There are more involved \u201cgame play\u201d section, often using a third person perspective and giving real-time control to the player. These sections do nothing but detract from the experience. These mini-games are extremely basic, something I would expect to learn how to make as a first year in a university programming course. While that in and of itself is not a bad thing, I didn\u2019t find them to really contribute to the story telling of the game. What\u2019s worse is that they are poorly executed; the controls are spongy and unresponsive, and half of the time it is not clear what the game wants you to do. One of the climax scenes seemed to be a puzzle I was supposed to solve, I spent a good few minutes trying to figure the game out before I was abruptly thrust into the conclusion. I\u2019m still not sure if I actually managed to get things right out of pure luck or the game was just tired of me trying to figure it out and moved on by itself. There is however, one very good mini game in the form of a short 2D platformer. And while it\u2019s not really difficult, I did enjoy that part of the game and the analogy it contributed to the story.\n\nThese moments, with the exception of the 2D platformer, makes it seem that the game is self-conscious; that it needs to have these sections of game play or else be written off as another Dear Ester walking simulator not worth your time. The prime example of this is the kart racing mini game. Yes, there is a Mario kart, in That Dragon, Cancer, and it is as awkward as it sounds. I personally have never been a lover of the \u201cwalking simulator\u201d style games, but I do think that they have value. The Stanley Parable, The Beginners Guide, both of those games know what they are, embraced it, and are great experiences I thoroughly enjoyed because of that. Dragon could remove these awkward chapters without changing its emotional tone and would be a better experience for it. \n\nAt the end of the day, That Dragon, Cancer is a heartfelt story wrapped up in an inconsistent package. A pretty package, to be sure, but one that left me mostly unsatisfied. For those who are connoisseurs of games in the interactive experience genre, there is probably a lot to like here. For those like me, who do enjoy the occasional interactive experience like The Stanley Parable, might be drawn in by the story, but will leave frustrated after dealing with the poor execution of the game. That Dragon, Cancer gets a solid 6 in my book.\n\nDespite what some might think of as a low score for the game, I actually do want to recommend Dragon to people.

Rather than reaching ever higher for graphical fidelity or ever deeper for the most \u2018movie-like\u2019 experience, this game just puts one in possibly the most powerless and truly human experience one can go through. And it asks of you but one thing, feel this. \n\nI did feel it. And I was weeping, grinding my teeth and hating myself for buying this game. But, I was also so very pleased to see someone pushing the boundaries, trying something new and succeeding with it. \n\nIf you\u2019re able and willing to immerse yourself in the vignettes, to turn off the outside world, which includes critiques outside of what the experience itself is bringing you, I think you\u2019ll find something exceptional here.

There's no other way to put it. The degree this game affects you can vary depending your feelings on very personal subjects (religion, in particular) but, at the end of the day, this is a heavy, very human, very interesting game.\n\nEssentially, this is a mechanically simple point-and-click game. While the player may be distracted by the myriad vistas it has to offer, the path the player must go through to progress is plainly laid out. The style of graphics (a kind of Out of This World-style polygonal format) follows suit with the simplicity of the controls, and does more to attract the player to the story, rather than take away from it. What really matters in That Dragon, Cancer, though, is the writing.\n\nRyan Green's prose is purely sincere, and this sincerity shines through in its range of complexity. At times, he will quote and create passages that would fit well in any poem but, in darker moments, he will discard all pretension and lay out his bare feelings. In either instance, it is always easy to understand his level of distress, anger, fear, despair, and hope each time he speaks. If I had to pick an excellent sample of his writing, I'd choose the following statement he makes near the beginning, presumably speaking of cancer itself:\n\n\"Fear is cancer's preservative. Cancer's embalming oil. And you, oh Accuser, are fear's oil salesman. You're a snake. A serpent. A dragon with snuffed out coal on his breath. Molting, talons broken from the struggle to free yourself of your own skin.\"\n\nWhile it's an excellent bit of writing in itself, the accompanying reading by Ryan hammers home the bitter, personal hatred he has for the disease. It's the combination of writing and voice acting that really kept me hooked, and hearing Ryan emote was just as meaningful, if not more so, than any image provided.\n\nIf there was to be any criticism in my experience with this game, it would be that it's...disjointed. It feels like the game was made when this tragedy was ongoing, which makes it a bit difficult to follow as far as what point in this all the chapters take place. On the other hand, this does give a more raw feel to the whole game, making it seem more like these chapters were made in the moment, rather than a recollection. Still, this can be a bit troubling when trying to follow a timeline.\n\nIn summary: this game was not entertaining. It was not fun. However, I can say with full confidence that this was engaging. I paid full price for this and honestly don't regret a second, as I got an experience that was more emotionally draining and impactful than any game that I have played in recent memory, and quite possibly ever.", "timestamp_created": 1454389290, "timestamp_updated": 1456720723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681257", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20901546": {"recommendationid": "20901546", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970323497", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485661007}, "language": "german", "review": "It was a unique experience.

Playing this game was a very emotional experience for me.\n\nGames like this are tough to review. The emotional power makes us feel like we only have two options:\n\n1. Marvel in the astonishing transcendent beauty of this family's pain, elegantly channelled into this work of art, a testament not only to their own loss but the loss of the millions of others who have walked the same path; or\n\n2. Be a total asshole.\n\nThe heartbreaking emotional texture of this \"game\" obliterates simplistic evaluation criteria, making the common vocabulary of game reviews like \"fun\" and \"objectives\" (and even the word \"game\" itself) obsolete. That said, it's not fair to say that because we all instantly respect the creator and his family, and have compassion for their pain, we therefore cannot react in any way negatively to the craft of this work.\n\nSome of the mechanical elements are maddening -- why must we click three times before we can see a fully-lit work of art, for example? I understand that some of these elements are intentionally maddening; I heard some spoilers on the Radiolab podcast before I played the game, so I knew what was coming in several scenes. I understand that the player is supposed to feel powerless and confused at times. But there is a vital distinction between the desired emotional impressionism (player feels angry because that's what the father felt at that moment) on the one hand, and frustrating gaming experience due to sub-optimal mechanical implementation (a different way of moving around would be more fluid and accessible) on the other. I can't get more specific without spoilers, so I'll leave it here.\n\nThese criticisms -- which I'm sure some will ascribe to mere nit-picking on my part; that's okay, I'm used to it -- reflect my admiration for everything this \"game\" is, and how desperately I wish it were perfect. So it goes.\n\nRegardless of these problems, however, \"That Dragon Cancer\" is a remarkable achievement, providing a shockingly intimate glimpse into the souls of a family slogging through the unimaginable. (While watching my father die was painful, and I felt many specific moments of contact with the journey of Joel's family, there's obviously a unique sort of horror that comes with losing one's child.) \n\nThe music, the use of text on the walls, and -- especially -- the cards that become tiny windows into the vast galaxies of pain endured by so many others: These things really do make the \"game\" transcendant and beautiful. It's obviously not a fun experience (because it's not supposed to be), but it's absolutely worthwhile and well-made.\n\nMy own pantheist cosmology puts me at odds with some of the Christian overtones here, but opens me up to others. I guess the greatest victory a religious video game can claim is to touch the infinite without obviating alternative faiths. TDC succeeds admirably here, even if a few moments had me gnashing my teeth. The metaphors and iconography aren't exactly subtle, but they are compelling and thorough.\n\nIn case you can't tell, I strongly recommend this game.

Tragedy.\n\nTwo words that have ended as synonymous far more often than anyone cares to remember. Cancer and other terminal illnesses are something that almost all of us have been touched by in some way. Whether it be from a person very close to us, ourselves, or just someone that has influenced us in some way. If it hasn't, odds are it will at some point in your life. These diseases invariably impact us in a negative and tragic way. We have experienced loss due to them and watched others suffer unimaginable pain trying to survive and fight to stay alive. \n\nAt the same time there is defintiely something else that comes from experiences of dealing with ternminal illness. While contemplating the losses that are sure to come, one can't help but think of all the ways we discover the true value of beauty, life, and love as it is slipping away. Our senses to these feelings become more acute. We realize what matters to us. What we would really miss if we weren't here. We contemplate wasted time and struggle to determine what is actually valuable and worthwhile while we have such a short time to experience life. \n\nAs we look back on those we lost, we understand that these people are part of human history. Everyone has their own story. We wonder if we may have an impact that can be somewhat immortal after we are gone by making sure we do something that will be remembered. Is this what matters for a life? Is it impacting others in a way that makes them remember us, or is that not really what is important? Is it important to just give as much as we can while we are here to help others, regardless of how long we are remembered, or do we have a duty to leave something behind that lasts well beyond or time on Earth? What is most important?\n\nThose that deal with terminal illnesses where they have a sense of not just how they will die, but roughly when they will die are more likely to contemplate these things I reckon. I know watching someone I care about dying from such an illness makes me think about these things, and how much time I waste on things I deem to be pointless. A story like this makes me think about all these same things. \n\n'That Dragon, Cancer' is a true story about a very small boy that gets cancer when he is only a couple years old. We listen to the voices of his parents, siblings, and of the boy as he fights cancer. We hear the inner dialogues that his parents have with themselves. How distraught they feel, how scared they are, how helpless they feel about it. We also see how they use faith in \"God\" to help them through it. One parent has almost no doubts about their faith, while the other questions it in many ways. \n\nAs a player we can feel an enormous amount of sorrow while playing through it. We know that everyone involved is dealing with cancer on a daily basis and their lives are in a struggle fighting \"That dragon, cancer\" as it is described. The game is broken into several sections in which we see random blocky sort of graphics in an abstract style. There isn't much in the form of mechanics other than clicking on objects to move the world around and get more commentary. IT is a \"walking simulator\". Many of the scenes we hear are live voice acting that I have to assume are either re-enacted, or were saved through video, or recordings when they happened originally. We hear the parents talking to the kids and sharing normal daily moments like singing lullabyes before bedtime, their sons laughing and joking, and many many instances of their son Joel, who has the illness, laughing. (I am guessing this is really him, but I have no idea). It really gives us the feeling of what they are going through and we feel like we are getting to know them as real people. \n\nWe aren't just getting voices form the family, however. As we walk through hospital halls we are able to see some real life artworks from cancer patients and dozens of personal notes, which I assume are those that have come together for the project, or met the developer and family through their own battles with cancer. These are displayed as greeting cards all over tables and hanging on walls throughout hospital rooms during certain sections. Must be at least 100 of these and I read every single one of them, which is why my playtime is higher than most. Some were survivors, some are just positive messages to go on, and some are memorials to those that have lost the fight. Many of which are small children that makes your heart ache that much more. Also, we have personal letters that are read with voice acting in other scenes about the experiences some have had as well. \n\nWhile the major theme of this is dealing with cancer there is another significant theme throughout this game as well that deals with the parents' belief and faith in \"God\" (Christian God since they mention Jesus a few times). As a non-believer this is familiar as we live in a society that is mostly believers so it isn't anything new. What I found interesting here was that it was a great look into the mind of a believer in my eyes. It gives some insight into how they think, as well as a lot of examples of why they do believe, or can convince themselves to. While it may, or may not be intentional to give a counter-point, one of the two characters even has significant doubts and asks many logical questions that many non-believers once asked before they became non-believers. Yet, he does not. This gave me some thoughts of how much one can love a mate, or they have such fears of being alone and losing a mate, that they may simply lie to them, or themselves about belief like this to placate a wife/husband, or to stay together due to a possible breaking of the family. I am sure many believers hide their non-belief due to the possible consequences of being found out. I won't stay on this topic any longer, but belief in a higher power definitely has a significant role in this game. I think most can expect that from a story that portrays a tremendous loss such as a child trying to find answers. This is THEIR story, and they are believers so of course it covers these themes. They aren't writing about me after all. \n\nOverall, the game absolutely should make you cry. If you are in the right mindset and feel like playing such a game then by all means do I recommend it. I don't think rating this game makes sense, or trying to say buy it on sale, or not. If you can relate to, or want to you will play it eventually.  I suggest that you try to immerse yourself into it philosophically as well as emotionally to get as much as you can out of it too. Read all the cards you see, view all the artwork, etc. These all gave me a lot of thoughts about just how important a single person can be to others, and how significant their lives are to the meaning of someone else's. Just how many histories there are out there that deal with this type of loss. It made me want to hug someone I cared about today and let them know that I love them, and that I am glad I have the chance to know them. \n\nTake care. :)\n\nI nominated this for: \"The \u201cI'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye\u201d Award\" in the 2016 Steam Awards :D", "timestamp_created": 1454126776, "timestamp_updated": 1479974012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825335", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20813524": {"recommendationid": "20813524", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969484311", "num_games_owned": 1379, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453947215}, "language": "english", "review": "Back when I was in college, and had more time to read video game blogs, there was a lot of talk about whether the industry could create games that could make people cry. Even then, the question seemed sort of off-base: of course games can make you cry. Black Isle had shut down, and Van Buren was caught in the\u2026 well, fallout. We\u2019d all suffered corrupted save games, impossible boss battles, and game-destroying bugs in the era before widespread patching. I guess there was also that thing where Sepiroth killed some lady, and the whole world cried about that. Admittedly, I didn\u2019t make it that far in FFVII.\n\nAnyway, the question of games evoking complex emotion was a bit silly then, and it\u2019s ridiculous now. In the last few years, I\u2019ve been devastated by more games than I can even count. I place the advent of games routinely making me feel awful somewhere around the release of Spec Ops: The Line, but developers have really ramped up the emotional resonance in the past few years. Games like To the Moon, Gone Home, Actual Sunlight, and Life Is Strange serve all delivery tear-inducing gut punches. Even Telltale\u2019s Walking Dead earned a good cry; I can\u2019t remember, but I think even their Game of Thrones made me tear up a little bit. The medium has grown up, despite the tantrums thrown by some Peter Pan \u201cgamers\u201d desperate to avoid such a fate.\n\nThe question is no longer \u201ccan games make us cry?\u201d The answer is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d The question, it seems, has grown more specific, and yet more diffuse. The medium now poses a series of distinct but interrelated questions, but I\u2019ll start with the easy one: can a game make us cry from beginning to end? \n\nThat brings me to my topic, That Dragon, Cancer: the short, true, and intensely personal story of pediatric cancer and its effects on the Green family, who both suffered through the prolonged illness of their son Joel and then found the strength to make a video game about it. The answer to the question, by the way, is \u201cyes.\u201d And the first of many corollaries is \u201cdo we WANT a game that emotionally exhausting?\u201d\n\nMy answer is a qualified \u201cyes,\u201d by which I mean \u201cyes, I wanted this thing to exist, and yes, I think that it\u2019s a worthwhile experiment that moves the medium forward.\u201d I also mean \u201cyes, I reluctantly Kickstarted this game, not so much because I wanted the experience  it offered but because I wanted the experience to be available,\u201d and \u201cyes, when I had a quiet evening to myself, I turned off the lights and did what I was dreading for several weeks after getting my Steam key: I played the game.\u201d\n\nAm I glad I played it? Yes. An unqualified yes. The game, with its meditative pace, its simple but thoughtful audiovisual configuration, and its unflinching emotional sincerity, is beautiful and harrowing. And it raised a whole crop of questions I didn\u2019t even know I was curious about. \n\nCan a game make me feel paternal? Apparently, it can, much to my surprise. I have no wish to have children; aside from the massive time commitment that I struggle to even comprehend, I\u2019ve always feared passing on my anxieties and neuroses to another generation, continuing the tradition of my mother, and her mother before her. I\u2019ve never seen the allure of parenting, and I\u2019ve never thought I\u2019d be particularly good at it. Yet something about the Greens\u2019 story, wherein they struggle to extract the moments of joy from the short time they have to share with Joel, sometimes succeeding and often failing, made me think that maybe I could handle it. Sure, I was just playing a game, and while the game is remarkably effective and engendering empathy, I didn\u2019t really have to deal with the horror of losing a son.\n\nBut the game played a trick on me. While I was experiencing the story and chewing the scenery, I wanted it to end. I didn\u2019t want to suffer anymore; I was tired of crying. The game is painful. But I knew that this was my one experience with the game. I knew that I would never come back this way again. It was too painful. Throughout my play, I was acutely aware that any snippet of experience I missed this time would be lost to me forever. So I took my time. I tried to hold it all inside me; the sounds, the notes, the hope for a miracle. I read all the cards I could handle reading (Can a Kickstarter reward tier make you cry? Yes). I treasured it all, even as it hurt me. I wanted to finish my experience, but I was also watching Steam notifications telling me that my friends were playing Skyrim or Her Story, and I wanted to know when I could stop and do normal things like they were. I could feel, in my own small way, the desperation the Greens felt, simultaneously hoping for the end while savoring the moment, wishing for a miracle the whole time. \n\nRight. So there\u2019s the miracle stuff. And the God stuff. There\u2019s a lot of God stuff. The Greens are believers. I\u2019m not. So I struggled with another question: \u201cWhat do I do with all this faith, when I firmly believe in a materialist existence that ends with death?\u201d I take it, and despite myself, I ruminate on the mysteries of grace. Obviously, I don\u2019t begrudge the Greens their faith, especially in a time of crisis. Like the game, the faith the Greens rely on is simple and beautiful, not pushy. It\u2019s the faith of Job, and while it doesn\u2019t give me solace, I do understand it. In that sense, That Dragon, Cancer is perhaps the most effective Christian game I\u2019ve ever come across. It doesn\u2019t attempt to proselytize, but it spreads the gospel in a way Left Behind or Super Bible Trivia or whatever could never hope for, because the Greens\u2019 faith is based on hope, and love shines through the biblical platitudes that would make me roll my eyes in any other context. That\u2019s the sort of faith I could stand to see more, and removing it from the game would make the whole experience lose its authenticity and its immediacy. My preferences aren\u2019t germane.\n\nAnyway, the game isn\u2019t perfect. The controls can be clunky. There\u2019s one spot where a bug forced me to restart a scene multiple times. In some scenes, there\u2019s more to hear than there is to see. But these are niggling concerns. It\u2019s tempting to dismiss them as the price of such a personal experience, but instead, I\u2019ll say that they don\u2019t matter. Like Joel, this game creates so many beautiful moments that focusing on the pain is missing the point entirely. \n\nBuy it. Play it.

I knew I would need to approach slowly and methodically, understanding what this game really was. That Dragon Cancer is a memoir to the passing of a real life child named Joel Green who was afflicted with cancer. He died at 5 years old, too young and too short a life by any imaginable standard. His parents Ryan and Amy Green created this game as a tribute, a diary, and a message of who Joel was and as a reflection of what he had to endure at such a young age. While I knew what to expect from the game from the moment of its inception, I never truly knew how affecting it would be until the credits rolled. I truly have not played or experienced a work of art quite like this because it his almost wholly unique. This game lies on a plane beyond gruff action protagonists, high score chasing and the pursuit of dominance or \u201cbad-assery\u201d that the majority of the game industry covets and chases at all costs. It is personal at the highest level, a bittersweet invitation into the hardship and inevitability of a real life struggle that the Green family and numerous others around the world have and continue to face every single day. It\u2019s an in-depth look at the role of faith and God in the lives of everyday people, and how it brings reflection and comfort in the most difficult of times. And while this remains a review of the game you\u2019ll be receiving, it\u2019s also a hesitant, judgment-free and meticulously gentle word to compliment the immense payoff you\u2019ll receive from playing the game.\n\nPresentation:\nThe game has a simplistic and geometric visual style grounded in abstract expression. Many of the textures and details are purposely omitted in favor of primary colors to express concepts and ideas. The visuals evoke many of the games deeply human concepts effortlessly, whether it be mentally in the minds of Ryan, Amy or Joel, or through the depiction of a story accompanied through dialogue and more. Even the digital forms on screen are simple in design but effective enough to know exactly what you are looking at. The music is non-intrusive, harmonious and decisively melancholic, allowing you to get lost in the flowing of emotion on-screen and within ourselves. Even the dialogue spoken by characters is distinctly soft, but poignant due to the subject matter. It\u2019s clear the aesthetics were designed solely so you could get lost in the spirally roller coaster of Joel\u2019s battle with cancer, from his initial diagnosis and all events proceeding it. The games presentation is so hard hitting and vividly affecting because it is all real. These are digital recreations of real events and the thoughts within the Green family\u2019s minds. This is not a video game with a fictional premise or epic narrative. It\u2019s a family surviving the most difficult moment life can bear: the inevitable and helpless loss of a child. Every narrative moment and dialogue delivery held my attention with utmost respect and complicity because I knew these events actually happened. Every moment felt like I had payed to get a personal glimpse into the most haunting and excruciating moment in the Green family\u2019s life, which gave me pause every time the thought crossed my mind.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay, outside of a few sections, continues the trend of non-intrusive interaction. Relying almost entirely of pointing on objects and directions to proceed for the next piece of narrative. The game will often let you interact with its world and writings, but almost always in limited fashion to advance the story. It is purposely minimal in scope and practice, which suits it because it\u2019s difficult to imagine a single genre that could adequately encapsulate and push forward this tale by mere gameplay alone. The game has some diversity in various sections that work beautifully as game-driven storytelling. It has a driving section in the Green\u2019s home where you briefly take a third person driving view within Joel\u2019s wonderful imagination. There is a simple side-scrolling section with a few enemies and the head of a dragon which match a somber story being told to Joel with cancer as this powerful dragon that many of tried to conquer, to no avail. These are mostly solid, but there are times where it feels like the game was grasping at straws trying to find something interactive to do to fill its gameplay sections, even though I would have been fine simply existing in this space as a bystander and not sticking to normal game conventions in this case. Everything fits well in the context of Joel\u2019s imagination though and these sequences often gave us a breath of air in a deeply reflective and contemplative experience, showing how at the darkest of times humans must sometimes retreat and engage our imaginations to escape a terrifying reality. That Dragon Cancer nails this feeling at almost every turn.\n\nOverall Value:\nOnce again, I\u2019m floored at how I feel I must construct this section of the review differently. Value is a very strange metric to measure, since its objective nature leaves it on a person-by-person basis. The game retails for $15 for about 2 hours of game, which is a price/length ratio that has been criticized heavily in the past. However, I believe the subject matter, personal nature of the family\u2019s struggle and general unique atmosphere and drama of the title lends it weight that few other games have ever matched. The price feels like a mere inconvenience in all honesty, a simple step you engage in to gain access to the work and I paid without a second thought merely due to my desire to view their experience close up. You could easily do research on the Internet to find out Joel\u2019s ultimate fate or watch a Let\u2019s Play and save the money, however there is something about supporting the family and viewing it in my own way that was extremely important to me. Objectively though, the game admittedly offers minimal gameplay and interaction, with only a few sections to speak of on that front, with the rest offering a viewing experience or clicking on papers to read with voiceovers. Gamers who focus heavily on gameplay will likely not be satisfied with what\u2019s on offer, however lovers of narrative driven experiences with gameplay as a simple tool to experience the world will love this title. This title will be poignant in the highest regard to players whose friends or own families have been affected by the wide reaching effects of cancer in real life and to those people, it will likely be a quicker decision.\n\nVerdict:\nThat Dragon Cancer is a very special and personal game. No other video game I\u2019ve ever played has ever given such a blunt and harrowing view into the lives of real people. Often times it feels like the player is opening the diary of the family and peering into the darkest recesses of their hopes and fears, all as they fight and eventually accept the ultimate fate of their child. While terribly sad, it also shows the incredible power of hope and how faith can give us strength in impossible circumstances. Engaging with that sense of inevitability and powerlessness is ultimately this game\u2019s most superb yet surreal achievement. The visuals are simple but effective enough to serve the purpose the game is trying to fulfill. Gameplay purists may leave the title with buyer\u2019s remorse, but that may likely be overridden with the other gifts the game can provide. This game will truly offer very different things to different audiences, something powerful that cannot be fully valued. For me, I also leave the experience with a sense of pride in the game industry I haven\u2019t felt in years, learning the lengths that games continue to strive towards to provide artistic experiences. If art is meant to touch the soul of a person and make them reflect on their life, That Dragon Cancer may be one of the finest examples of art our medium has.", "timestamp_created": 1453769611, "timestamp_updated": 1453769611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20747396": {"recommendationid": "20747396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128411704", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453730097}, "language": "english", "review": "That Dragon, Cancer was a good deviation from hardcore action packed games I currently play like Monster Hunter.

The closest experience I've had in a game was probably the Stanley Parable, but unlike the Stanley Parable, this game is pretty much a linear narrative. It's probably more correct to call it an 'interactive story' than a game as games are usually known for. This is important to know, because if you approach this game as a gamer expecting well-designed mini-games to tell this story, you're probably going to be disappointed.\n\nIf you approach this as an interactive story, it's a lot better. The experience reminds me of the interactive experiences you can have on VR headsets like the Google Goggles. It's scripted, but you get some enjoyment from the autonomy of perspective that you choose by looking around. \n\nOnto the story itself: this is the probably the best part of this game. It's based on real life, and the interactivity provides an immersion and intimacy to the struggle of the Greens as they battle cancer together with their son. Like many other players, I was in tears for much of the game. The strength of the interactivity helps you get into the shoes of the Greens, and it's this second-person perspective that makes the game such a powerful experience.\n\nRegarding the Christian parts mentioned in the game: yes, if you do not come from a Christian background, you might find the Christian content offputting. But for many people of any creed, their religion will be a part of their philosophical struggle when they have to confront the death of loved ones. One can find empathy in the pain and difficulty of accepting the death of loved ones, no matter whether you believe in a god or not. Approaching it this way, perhaps a non-Christian can identify with the basic human desire to see their loved ones alive and well.\n\nI'm divided about the graphics. I didn't really like the faceless human models, but I loved the use of light and colour for the scenery. I think I generally found the visuals and imagery beautiful and striking, and combined with the moving soundtrack, this game was generally a positive experience.\n\nHowever, I wish that the controls were less finicky and didn't depend on point-and-click. I would have preferred a WASD free movement, similar to FPSs, with E to interact with surroundings. The best references I can think of for fluid environmental interaction and being guided on a rail while providing the illusion of free movement are Half-Life 2 and The Stanley Parable, both based on the Source Engine.\n\nMy overall conclusion:\nPros: Powerful story, striking visuals, moving music. \nCons: Did not like point-and-click controls, polygon models a bit too rough for me. \nCaveats: Must be aware of Christian content and  nature of gameplay before buying so you know what to expect.\n\nThank you for reading.

The story is done in a typographic font way, with the voice acting carrying the narrative really well, conveying each emotion extremely well. \n\nAnd emotion you will have, because the game's story ends up getting more and more heart breaking the more you get into it. Later on in the game, you end up seeing the sheer pain of what Joel's parents had to go through (there is one particular scene later in the game that can be rather hard on the psyche to have to listen to, I won't say any more than that). The family seems to try to be strong and not let Joel's sickness get in the way of a livelyhood, but the narrative shows just how tough things were for the family, and how tightly knit things were when dealing with the realization of the inevitable. It's carried by a very riviting soundtrack (and yes, the game's recommendation of using headphones to listen IS one you should heed). \n\nThis is not to say the game is perfect, though. Does have a few flaws. There are a few spots in which the game's controls seem somewhat off in a few scenes, and when you get to those sections, you will know what I'm talking about. It also, in a few sections, fails to give the player enough feedback of what they are supposed to do to advance the story. These are few and far between this 3 hour experience, but you'll know them immediately when you get to them. \n\nBut don't let these small flaws hinder you from picking this one up. If you want a truly emotional, heart breaking experience that won't take you a ton of time to finish, then this will be your title. A word of warning: the game does lay on several religious aspects hard, so keep an open mind about those.

It has zero replayability except to show it to others and lasts 2-3 hours. A scene in the middle, dehydration, is one I never want to experience again. Joel is screaming and crying in pain for several minutes on end.\n\nI don't have kids, but I'd imagine this game to heartbreaking or near impossible to play for parents. People I've mentioned the project to have been blown away it's even being tackled as a \"game,\" whatever that means or might mean in the future, if we begin calling such experiences as some other name.\n\nThe game is very approachable in terms of its controls. It plays like a Qaunatic Dream production like Heavy Rain or Beyond Two Souls, where your cursor's actions change based on context, but much less complex than those games. People have complained about clunky controls or not knowing \"what to do\" to complete each scene, but this is trying to convey feelings and is less of a game with levels. The game provides clear cues as to what is happening and I never got stuck. Some parts in the middle of the game present what is I'm assuming to be artwork and letters to and from other sick kids ot members of their families. So this isn't just Joel's story, but a collection for many families and future kids with cancer and other terminal illnesses. \n\nI can see people getting a bit angry at the comparison between the temple of man and the temple of God. The implication is that the Green family or perhaps mostly Ryan sort of scoffs at people deciding to use medicene to heal people, since in his world view this seems to be a kind of arrogance because God is who heals, not man with his weak collection of machines. But that is common among religious people to sort of dislike science and scientists, although of course that doesn't apply to everyone.\n\nI grew up in the Christian faith for 18 years and was confirmed, as were many people but I'm no longer religious. So I understand where they're coming from. Amy and Ryan conflict about how to handle grief and what to expect will happen to Joel and how God should answer their prayers. Obviously non religious people will see this as delusional. Replace God with Aliens and flying saucers and we can start a comparison. But people of faith will likely keep believing no matter what happens or what new evidence they see. It's very deep for them and there is a lot hanging on religious ideas, like keeping alive the place where deceased relatives live. The thought of friends and family possibly dying forever, as Ryan fears insignificance, is too terrifying for most to even acknowledge as a possibility, so heaven and all its implications of god such teachings MUST be true and fought for being proven true forever.\n\nThis game is not jamming beliefs at anyone, it contains a family's experience of a terrible situation and I think everyone can relate to it. There are terribly sad moments, but also joyful ones. Near the end, a pheonix is presented on the floor of a grand cathedral, which I think is a unifying message.

It was my experience, my friends' experiences, and the Green family's experience all melded together. Even if you're not interested in the gameplay, or the way this story is told, you should buy it.

I feel for the family, and to have lost a child is heartbreaking but with all this hype and wide spread media about the game I can't help but think they could do more besides cash their own check...as a \"tribute\" to their son.

It is pretty sad and gives a good view on the horrors of cancer. In a way, this game is pretty incredible.\n\nI really admire the way the creators made this game and were able to create this rough topic very well. The developers shifted the game more into a memorial for Joel(In my opinion is understandable). Each scene is so well created and developed to really give you that feeling. I really enjoyed the poetic, slow pace of the game. There were a few times the controls got a tiny bit irritating but I never had to much of a problem with it. I feel the design of everything appearing and disappearing before switching the surrounding really fits the way this game is about their memory with Joel. \n\nMy most favorite thing about this game is Joel. I loved to make him giggle and everytime I would hear it, I got a smile on my face. Along with hearing the family stories. Some of them really got to me, hearing them all talk about a subject and forget about cancer really made it well. About the second half it really went down the path of god and was really strong with religion (Depending on your beliefs you may or may not enjoy this part). It just made me sad with all the questions that Dad asked himself.\n\nI believe this game has changed the perspective I have on life. I've experienced what the pain of a loved one with cancer is like, but luckily never had to deal with death.

The story comes first, meaning the gameplay itself is simple, which is okay because this game isn\u2019t meant to be a gameplay heavy game.\n\nIt\u2019s a narrative that completely works on so many levels to show the happy, sad and frustrating times about this little boy who has cancer, as seen from the eyes of his family, but mainly from the eyes of his father. And this is when the game shines. When the father would monologue, I was moved by what he says and truly felt an emotional attachment to Joel and everyone else.\n\nThe wife\u2019s speeches were also done well. And her belief that god would save the baby and the utter realization of there not being anyone to help them, made me feel very emotional and even tear up a little. The graphics while pretty bland are actually done well because it didn\u2019t take me away from the narrative but still helped me paint a picture.\n\nThe soundtrack makes the game amazing too. While you won\u2019t find things that really stand out it accompanies the narration and story, and that\u2019s enough. The acting, as I said before are done very well and this is what mainly made the narrative so moving and really let me see how the parents were in their own shoes.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simply clicking and looking around rooms usually being narrated by either the mother or father and the soundtrack in the background.\n\nThe start does this very well even though the boring clicking is there, it\u2019s only there to show the narrative, which makes it wonderful.\n\nBut nearing the end of the game I felt that it started to become too gameplay heavy and while the narration was there, which was done great as it was the whole way through; it still didn\u2019t drown out the boring clicking enough as it became more focussed on gameplay.\n\nBut like I said, the narration is there and other than a small bug forcing me to skip a little part, that there\u2019s nothing really wrong with this game. \n\nSo this game, I\u2019m guessing; was made to show people the story of Joel, and how the up\u2019s and down\u2019s of his story affected the parents; to make us feel what they felt.\n\nAnd this game completely does that, no doubt. With its great soundtrack, graphics which may be dull but good enough to paint the picture, and a moving dialogue, makes this game a must play to all gamers who can enjoy a narrative even though this game has some issues such as a couple bugs and some boring sections nearing the end of the game.\n3.5/5", "timestamp_created": 1453391345, "timestamp_updated": 1453643855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453753", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20661596": {"recommendationid": "20661596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125454073", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453390086}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c.", "timestamp_created": 1453390142, "timestamp_updated": 1453390142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532250", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20657440": {"recommendationid": "20657440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198225252664", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453307334}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5373\u4fbf\u5f88\u8ba4\u771f\u7684\u67e5\u770b\u6240\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u65f6\u957f\u4e5f\u53ea\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u5de6\u53f3\u3002\n\u4f46\u5b83\u5bf9\u7684\u8d77\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\u3002\n\n\u5b83\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u6d89\u53ca\u5931\u53bb\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4fe1\u4ef0\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u6210\u957f\u3002\u7528\u4f4e\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u843d\u4e8e\u5404\u4e2a\u5f62\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u800c\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bf8\u591a\u72ec\u7279\u573a\u666f\u66f4\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e86\u5176\u60c5\u8282\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u7684\u611f\u60c5\u6db5\u4e49\u3002\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u5149\u5f71\u3001\u97f3\u4e50\u4e5f\u968f\u4e4b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e00\u6b65\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u5c06\u73a9\u5bb6\u62c9\u5165\u89d2\u8272\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u70b9\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u5171\u9e23\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e\u57282.7\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f4\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u4e2d\u65ad\u6570\u6b21\u6765\u5e73\u590d\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5fc3\u60c5\u3002\n\n\u4ed6\u8ba9\u6211\u66f4\u60f3\u95ee\u81ea\u5df1\uff0c\u4f55\u65f6\u624d\u80fd\u5236\u4f5c\u51fa\u8fd9\u6837\u80fd\u89e6\u53ca\u5230\u7075\u9b42\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\n\u611f\u8c22Numinous Games\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u5b83\u5f88\u68d2\u3002\n\u52a0\u6cb9\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1453370571, "timestamp_updated": 1453370571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20657408": {"recommendationid": "20657408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059856610", "num_games_owned": 982, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453370588}, "language": "english", "review": "My response at the end of this game was \"F--- you guys for making me feel so much!\" And then the credits say \"In Memory of Joel Green\" and I'm crying again.

That is why it only registers as me having 1 hour. I have finished the game, however.\n\nAlso, mild spoilers.\n\n\"That Dragon, Cancer\" is intended to be a heart-wrenching, tragic depiction of a young boy named Joel's struggle and eventual death at the hands of the most hated disease known to man: cancer. It's based on a true story, and chronicles the parents' emotions, feelings, and spiritual musings as their son's state gradually deteriorates.\n\nHere are my pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n-Beautiful soundtrack.\n-Competent voice acting, considering the voice actors are the parents of the actual boy himself, and are amateurs.\n-Unique and intriguing art style.\n-The emotion in the game is real; if embellished, it's very subtly done.\n\nCONS:\n-Ridiculous $14.99 price tag.\n-Textures clip and animation falters several times.\n-Controls are laggy, counterintuitive, and annoying, even for a sort of point-and-click.\n-Mini games accomplish nothing and often serve to disconnect from the overall theme. They don't convey much emotion and feel out of place.\n-The game has to be finished in one sitting, or you're completely emotionally disconnected and just kinda annoyed.\n-It's often hard to tell what the game wants from you. I spent ten minutes with Dolphin Dad doing underwater flips with no idea what I was supposed to be doing.\n-I completely broke the \"Jesus loves me\" song and ended up with it playing over itself out of sync half a dozen times. Honestly, that was pretty funny. That should be in the pros.\n\n\nNow, to the actual review.\n\n\"That Dragon, Cancer\" is a good story in the form of a terrible game. The artwork, while initially charming, eventually loses its beauty, becoming a confusing miasma of fractured textures and unimpressive design. The controls are laggy, buggy, and sluggish. The minigames feel forced and pointless. I would have enjoyed this a lot more left as a pure walking simulator. \n\nNow to the story.\n\nYou feel the pain of Joel's parents as their child struggles to grow, his disease evident to even his siblings. The beginning of the game is promising, even a bit tear jerking, although I did not cry. (Not to say I'm incapable of crying. Games such as \"Undertale\", \"To The Moon\", \"Among the Sleep\" and \"I am Bread\" made the tears flow liberally.) The parents are struggling as they attempt to find peace through a completely tragic experience, putting their faith and trust in God to save their son. This is a recurring theme, and perhaps even the main theme of the game, more so than Joel's cancer. The father feels angry that God is allowing this. The mother is angry that the father is angry. Where is God? Will Jesus take their son to heaven? Will he live?\n\nThe emotion is often times well conveyed. The hospital scene near the end was one of the painful scenes I've ever played. The utter helplessness you feel annoyed me at first, until I realised that is exactly what I was supposed to feel. At which point, I appreciated it. That I was trying so hard to find a way to escape the room, to escape the crying, was a testament to good storytelling. Either that, or i have 7 youngest siblings, and I hate to hear babies cry. One of the two. On the other hand, sometimes the emotion is horribly portrayed. Like dolphin dad. That was just stupid. \n\nSo this game is a bit up and down. One moment, you'll feel the pain, the emotion, and the beauty that this game is conveying, and the next, you'll be utterly lost. Like that \"Throne of God\" scene. What was I supposed to do with that piano? I just spammed lmb at that point. Which is too bad, because I think that was a really important moment in the game?\n\nAlso, the portrayal of heaven is strange. I mean, that is a lot of pancakes.\n\nSo, in conclusion:\n\nI'm a Christian. I wanted to be touched by this game. I wanted to cry. I wanted to come away with that same feeling of awe that I felt upon finishing \"The Beginner's Guide:\" that feeling that my perspective on something had been integrally changed forever. \n\n But I couldn't. I just couldn't get into it. Every time I would, I would immediately be pushed out of it by something strange and unwieldy the game threw at me.

But to be in that position, to experience something like that, that's something any form of art and medium can show. To have the player exploring those hardships, and the internal thoughts within them.\n\nThat's this game.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]A emotional story that left me thinking\n[*]Simplistic and Beautiful Artstyle with a nice emphasis on polygons\n[*]Memorable setpieces\n\n[*]The presentation is stellar. The way dialogue is displayed is one of my most favorite things about the game.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Nitpicks:[/h1]\n\n[*]The Point-n-Click interface feel off. It's not bad, it's functional, but the poor mouse acceleration and WASD set-up also being used to control the camera made the first few minutes of the game awkward to control.\n[*]The game has a beautiful soundtrack that unfortunately is not as memorable as the rest of the game. No particular tracks stand out. It's not bad though!\n[*]Sometimes the text doesn't become as visible due to something blocking in the way.\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The mini-games serve the game very well, but they're poorly done. They feel broken and stiff.\n[/list]\n[h1]The Review[/h1]\n\nThis is [i]That Dragon, Cancer.[/i] The game's scenes take you through a story about Joel Green, a young boy diagnosed with AT/RT cancer. The story faces a lot of ups and downs, with moments of hope and many of despair. What I feel like is sort of important to note is that despite cancer being a major subject in the game, it's not what the overall message really is about. It's a story about coping with death. The inevitability of it.\n\nI really like just how beautiful it is. It's polygon-bsaed artstyle is unique, it's set-pieces and locations are bizarre, and the way dialogue appears as if it was a typography is really cool. There's really nothing that's like this game in terms of presentation, and that's what makes it shine.\n\nThe game has a lot of themes regarding Christianity, and believing in faith. While I'm not really one to believe in a religion, I do think that it's part of what makes this game so interesting. I'm not a believer of Christ, I don't understand how saying something among the lines of \"God will save me\" or \"God will heal me\" will do anything in a situation like dying. But here, I understand, and that's something I really didn't expect from this game.\n\n[i]MINOR SPOILERS[/i]\n\n[spoiler]What may be a drag in some cases are some of it's interactive elements. I'm OK with games like Gone Home and The Beginner's Guide, but the mouse sensitivity never seemed right for me in the first-person perspective. The interactive minigames, mainly in particular the Mario Kart-themed and Arcade minigames, didn't feel good to control. The Mario Kart minigame was enjoyable and hopeful from a story standpoint, but the controls were awkward and it felt stiff when the kart tried to turn. The arcade game was fine, and actually a cool highlight of the game, but the gameplay itself wasn't interesting. Maybe I'm being too harsh in what are mainly interactive bits from the story, because all of the minigames are fine, it's just those two in particular were the most unpolished aspects of the game. [/spoiler]\n\nSometimes the dialogue is obscured due to certain cases (Such as in one chapter where it is being blocked by water)\n\nWhat I love a lot about this game is how personal it is. The developers of the game are actually Joel's parents, Amy and Ryan Green. It's really their commitment to make such a honorary tribute to their son that made this experience so memorable. \n\n\n[h1]TL;DR - A personal experience that nails it's premise on a artistic level. I appreciate and adore the fact that both Amy and Ryan Green were brave and strong enough to share their story, in something beautiful and so memorable.

The use of audio from home movies makes every bit of unscripted dialouge feel authentic and genuine. The faceless character models and simplistic graphics (which are absolutely beautiful in their own right) make sure that the story isn't washed over by flashy polygons or advanced shaders, allowing the player to truly connect with this family whom they've never known personally.

[/spoiler]\nThe game clocks in right around the 2 hour mark, maybe less if you zip right through without observing any of the content added to the game by the Kickstarter backers, but for me, that was just long enough. I think by making this game so extraordinarily short, sweet, and to the point, it makes it all that much more powerful. [spoiler] Thank God I only had to watch Joel suffer for 2 hours, instead of the years his family had to watch.

We don't ask people what they're feeling. It's a scary topic and we ignore it. We think they don't want to talk about what they've gone through, and while in some cases this may be true I also believe that's an excuse we use to avoid the conversation.\n\nThis videogame brings the issue of child loss to light in a profound and inspiring way.

Read on:\nWhat does it mean to vote up or down? Voting up does NOT mean I enjoyed playing this game. I DID NOT ENJOY IT...\n\nThis is the most emotionally challenging game I've played. But I expected that. The developer walked a tightrope between genuine creative expression and potential sensationalism. I'm certain they struggled with this.\n\nAt its heart, \"That Dragon, Cancer\" gives us a very intimate perspective of a family's struggle with cancer, diagnosed in their youngest and most vulnerable member, baby Joel. Throughout the game, baby Joel becomes our baby. Your baby. And that's where it hits you hardest. That's where it does something no other game has... AND that's where it does something ONLY games can do!\n\nThe art style is simple but effective. Player interaction is also simple, relying mainly on you looking around for cursor prompts to click on. I often felt as though I was waiting on the game to catch up on my intentions. But the game surprised me often enough to keep me interested. And of course, I was busy looking after baby Joel.\n\nFor all its flaws, the game is only successful to me because it forced me to care. And that's something few games do.\n\nAre games the proper medium for this type of content? Maybe. There are a million ways to do this WRONG. But the developer did a lot of things right, and I want to recognize that. This is dangerous territory... And though I'm not a Christian myself, I recognize grace. I'm proud of them and I want to support games like this.\n\nThis is not a fun game and it defies most of the criteria we use to judge games.

If you want that, play the LEGO games or GTA or something like that. That isn't the point of this game. It's a tribute to a lost son and the times he had with his family, but told in a way no movie or book could. When you see or hear a story like this, you empathise and are sad about the pain. But this game makes you feel it. For example [IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE THIS COMPLETELY AUTHENTICALLY, SKIP THE REST OF THIS PARAGRAPH]: in a scene where the doctors tell the family that the cancer is now inoperable, and that Joel -the son in question -is living on borrowed time, you have the option to rewind the scene and experience it from the persepective of each different person in the room. But it starts to rain. No matter how much you rewind, the rain will not stop. It gets worse, until the room is flooded. You find yourself in a rowboat, and Joel is in front. You row around the room, navigating the storm. You try to sail towards Ryan and Amy -Joel's parents -but everything fades to darkness. And soon, Joel and the boat disappear, and you are left floating in a flood, desperately searching for Joel, desperate for hope.\n\nAll the pain, all the joy, all the hopelessness, and all the hopefulness. You don't see it. You feel it. There are moments in the game where you don't know what you have to do to progress, and it's frustrating, but that's the point. It's their frustration, conveyed in a way that we can understand -not in a distant, detached, intellectual way, but in a way that you feel it and know their pain deep within your soul. Some may find the Christian undertones off-putting, and one person seems to have criticised the use of religion as a 'crutch'. But faith was obviously a major part of their struggle, so of course they would include it; this was made from their worldview, not anyone else's. And is it really so bad that, in such a horrific struggle, they found hope and leaned on that hope?\n\nThis may just be the most important video game ever made, not because it is innovative from a technological perspective, but because it uses the medium to let a grieving family to share their pain but also their hope. If you play this game from this perspective, I doubt you will come out of it the same person.\n\nAnd all the proceeds from the sales go to the hospices that helped the family with Joel, so your money won't be wasted regardless of how you feel about the game :)", "timestamp_created": 1452960027, "timestamp_updated": 1452960027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20563548": {"recommendationid": "20563548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031488159", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452888122}, "language": "english", "review": "A masterpiece.

Let's just say it's an interactive experience in the form (or format) of a video game... Know this: instead of walking freely, you click on clearly indicated hotspots and navigate between fixed waypoints where you can freely look around. There are no puzzles and it takes roughly 2 hrs to play through. There is replay value if you go back and read all the messages, study the artwork etc.\n\nIf you think you can't handle the emotional content in this game - it's actually not as sad or depressing as you may think. There is playfulness and laughter here too, surrealistic dreamlike sequences and a few bittersweet minigames. If you feel any of the vignettes is too heavy to handle, you can quickly press Esc and switch to another chapter.\n\nThe Green family are Christians and that is mirrored in how they are coping with hardship and tragedy, but they are not trying to preach or convert you. Rather, this is their very personal struggle with faith and doubt, hope and despair. In the game, the couple are even quarreling over how to handle their emotions and beliefs.\n\nRyan & Amy Green, their kids and their small dev team deserve all the love of the gaming community for daring to share their life and loss in this way.

That Dragon, Cancer is a deeply emotional experience that I think everyone should experience, but it has no reply value. You cannot play this game again and expect the same emotional punch to the gut. It's a tight narrative that emerses you briefly in the world of a dying child and his grieving parents, and then you leave, and move on, and you never play it again.\n\n$15 for a one-time, 2 hour experience is simply unfair. While I recommend you play this game, you should buy it only on sale.\n\nAnyway, the game itself is good. The graphic style is very artist, with high-saturation colours and blurred out faces. It's the sort of look that only works if you like that aesthetic; I thought the game was beautiful, but others might find it lazy and ugly. The gameplay is mostly walking around clicking on objects to start cut scenes, but there are some puzzles. The puzzles are extremely simple and require no real thought; you click until something happens, and if you do get stuck like I did, click harder and angrier, until something finally happens. The controls aren't the best and can exacerbrate little frustrations with puzzles.\n\nThe voice-acting is wonderful. The dialogue feels very authentic , which only adds to the pain of the situation. It jumps between conversations to poetic waxing, but I feel it does this skillfully. There's enough family dialogue to give the characters life, but not so much its boring, and enough poems to allow for introspection, but not so much it feels pretentious.\n\nThis game is very religious. This is neither a good nor a bad thing; much like the artstyle, how someone reacts to this particular aspect depends on their own opinions. I'm not religious at all, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't find the talk of \"God's glory\" somewhat grating, but I understood why they looked towards their god for guidence. It didn't effect how emotional I got or how much the game hurt me.\n\nOverall, That Dragon, Cancer is an extremely emotional and upsetting game with wonky controls, no reply value, and a higher price then it needs. It's a one off experience that leaves you drained, in need of a hug or a nap. It'll make you cry, and curse how unfair life. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1452937648, "timestamp_updated": 1452937648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20556161": {"recommendationid": "20556161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034918135", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452932679}, "language": "english", "review": "If you or anybody you've ever known has been affected by cancer, you owe it to yourself to play this game.

I became a father eleven months ago. My partner, the mother of our daughter, saw me reading about 'That Dragon, Cancer' last month and asked what it was about. When I told her, she looked stunned and asked: 'Why would anyone want to play that?' I had no answer for her, but just knew that I did want to play it. Now that I have, I think I know why, and why I recommend it.\n\nThe death of a loved one is painful and traumatic. We cope with it as best we can; which is to say we utterly fail to cope with it, but try to go on living. I hope never to experience what the Greens went through, watching their son Joel dying, but admire their strength and courage in facing that experience and trying to make something positive of it. For me, the revulsion people feel about the notion of 'playing' this 'game' (I'll admit the words really don't fit) is a shamefully cowardly response - at the end of the day, we can hit Quit, and nothing has changed in our livess. The Greens lived this and did their best to process and communicate it. That's what art is all about, and shying away from it just because it makes us uncomfortable is symptomatic only of our own weakness, our insistence on an artificial safe-zone.\n\nAs a card-carrying atheist, I'm on a polar extreme away from the faith the Greens have, but I still found every moment of this episodic narrative driven audio-visual experience utterly relatable and overwhelmingly human. That's no mean feat, and speaks volumes of the honesty, the sheer soul-bearing earnestness that's gone into this harrowing project. I'll grant that the visuals may not be to everyone's tastes, the thematic examination of faith may be too cerebral for some, and the fundamentally morbid subject matter (but no - this is a celebration of a life, along with all the agony of its too-soon death) will put many off; but accusations of profiteering from their son's death can only sit somewhere on a spectrum between flat-out trolling and plain ignorance. If you sit somewhere toward the latter end, I urge you to play the game and experience it. It won't be much fun, but it will be worthwhile.

I cried.\n\nI sometimes got frustrated with the controls.\n\nBut overall, I really admired what this game is grappling with, sometimes very successfully, sometimes less so. If you're interested in experimental narrative games like Thirty Flights of Loving or The Beginner's Guide, you won't regret picking this game up. Just make sure you approach it in a receptive mood with some extra patience for awkward controls. I would also try not to look too much into the reporting around the game and just play it for what it is first.\n\nAs a non-religious person, not yet a parent, and lucky enough never to have lost anyone close to me to cancer, I could seem like the worst possible audience for this game. However, I actually feel like this game taught me a lot, and that it has helped prepare me for a part of life that we will all have to deal with one day. I can picture myself sitting in a hospital room years or decades from now and thinking back to the raw--but beautiful--imagery of this game and the deep questions that it asks. This is a gift that I will carry with me always. This is what experiential narrative games can be.\n\nAfter reading more about the family and the making of the game itself, I wished that TD,C had gone into more detail about Amy and Ryan as a couple. Amy originally seemed convinced that Joel's miraculous recovery would inspire others in their Christianity, and as that dream slowly fades, I wanted to know more about the impact that had on their faith and their relationship. \n\nBut I can understand why the developers shifted gears to making the game more of a memorial to Joel, when it started out as a game more focused on the impact Joel's cancer had on his parents. Joel only recently passed away. Amy and Ryan agree in-game that \"we ended up in the same place,\" in terms of their faith, but as a player things felt more fragile. This is a game very much written \"from the trenches\" of loss and pain, rather than from the typical distance that developers are able to take from these issues. I think that is what makes this game so unique. Its immediacy and lack of distance can be jarring, and as a player, even one who typically plays narrative games, it can be hard to know how to react. \n\nAt the beginning of this review, when I said I laughed while playing this game, I meant it. I laughed hard at Joe's giggle, at the antics of Joel's siblings and at his parents' witty frustration with \"cancer culture.\" I also mourned, brutally, for the loss at the center of this game. As the game says at one point--and I'm not sure about the exact quote--living through cancer, just like living through life, is \"all the things\"--happiness, joy, sadness, skepticism, sarcasm, irritation, love, and again, so much joy.\n\nThank you to Ryan and Amy Green for sharing your experience with us.

Interactive experiences like this are a new art form that deserve support, but not all experiments bear fruit.\n\nHere's what I liked in no particular order:\n\n1) Nice music, although it got a bit repetitive at times.\n\n2) When viewed from a distance, the abstract human figures looked quite nice. \n\n3) Some of the fanatasy imagry was beautiful. I particualrly liked to see balloons carry Joel ride on constellations come to  life.\n\n4) The cancer ward filled with cards was simple but devastatingly effective. It conveyed how many people had fought to live in those halls.\n\n5) A lot of Ryan's narration was quite moving. I wish we had been \"in his head\" the whole game. I thought the episode where he's trying to get Joel to settle down was well done. It wasn't a bug that Joel was invisible -right? I was able to empathize with Joel much more in that scene than I could at most other times...\n\nHere is what I disliked:\n\n1) The abstact character models were a big, big, turn-off for me when viewed close-up. Whenever I was forced to get physically close to Joel, I was repulsed. I was acutely aware that this thing in front of me was just a collection of polygons, and it just felt \"wrong\" to pretend I was playing with a real toddler. The fact that this was all based on a little kid that had really died made things even worse. I would be as if someone made a doll that looked like Joel and expected me to pretend that lifeless, inert doll was a a living, breathing child.\n\n2) The controls were frustrating. I get that the creators wanted to limit interactivity to help maintain the tone they wanted and to focus the narrative. However, there are better ways to do that which don't have me constantly wondering where I'm allowed to click or what I have to click before I can procede. This might have been less of an issue if there weren't parts of the game that I disliked and wanted to get through ASAP. Still, any time that I'm thinking of how to get through the game as a GAME means I'm stepping back from being immersed in the experience you're trying to create.\n\n3) On that note, the driving and platforming mini-games were clumsy and un-fun.  I enjoyed break from the monotony of click-hunting, but you have a problem when you need mini-games to distract from the tedium of your core gameplay.\n\n4) The one place the clicking around really grated on me was when you're fluttering around the ocean filled with bottles. I didn't know where I had to go and got frustrated.\n\n5) This might seem cruel, but I didn't like Amy's voicework or what she had to say. Because of that, it was a real chore to have to listen to all of those bottles filled with her letters. Her stuff seemed very one-note to me while Ryan had more of an arc. It also seemed like we didn't see her worry, suffer, and grieve as intimately as we saw Ryan do all of those things. I recogize that she doesn't have to do so the same way or as visibly as he does, but it seemed like everything we saw of her was through the lens of her religion while Ryan was more human and nuanced.\n\nThis whole review probably comes off as cruel, but I feel like a public work of art deserves public critcism. If Ryan or Amy ever read this, wish you all the best and commend you for your courage in making this game.", "timestamp_created": 1452886646, "timestamp_updated": 1452886646, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20545157": {"recommendationid": "20545157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098833600", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452885172}, "language": "english", "review": "Brought tears to my eyes, just a wonderful game overall", "timestamp_created": 1452885235, "timestamp_updated": 1452885235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499850", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20544970": {"recommendationid": "20544970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076684919", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452821792}, "language": "english", "review": "Was recently diagosed with four types of cancer myself.

It isnt a \"game\" as much as it's a piece of interactive art. A father's homage to his child, and the memories both good and bad that accompanied his tragically short life. I feel that there is a place for this type of experience alongside the headshot mayhem and murderfests that Steam usually peddles. There are a lot of things I liked about this game, and a few things that I didn't. Regardless, I am happy to take small part in the existence of this small child who stuggled to eat and loved dogs.

Esto trasciende las barreras que conocemos del videojuego y se convierte en arte. Es una obra que nos hace ver a trav\u00e9s de los padres de este ni\u00f1o diagnosticado con c\u00e1ncer.

Dependent on what you were looking for from this game, you will either be satisfied, or you won't be.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what this game does well-\n  - The way that this game captures emotions, and the way it depicts Joel in particular, is astonishing. Making Joel laugh, watching him play, it adds authenticity to an innocent child who is totally oblivious to the horrible reality of his future. The fact that the games events are directly tied to a true story, and the decision to include voice acting from many of the real people who lived it, gives this game a juggernaut of a narrative that cannot be matched by nearly any other narrative-driven game. For these reasons, this was the most tear-jerking game I have ever played. \n\nUnfortunately, there are many things that this game does wrong-\n  - This game tried too many ambitious ideas that either completely fell flat, or were counter-intuitive and insulting to the whole point of the game. First and foremost, the decision to include bizarre mini-games such as the go-kart segment or the dragon \"boss battle\" segment (from which the game's name derives), were both unfortunate inclusion that distracted and dampened the emotional weight of the game. These were wonky, half- baked efforts to diversify the narrative that did more harm than good. \n   - As a game, there's more bad news. There are numerous segments where it is not clear how to advance. This seems to have been done on purpose to force the player to become immersed and only worry about progression later on, but it actually has the opposite effect. It can lead to things like walking around aimlessly for extended periods of time, hearing the same lines of dialogue over and over again before you can figure out what you are actually supposed to do, or watching the same animations repeated over and over.\n  - In addition, the decision to heavily emphasize Christian imagery and beliefs in the second half of the game was questionable. While this may have been a significant factor in the lives of the real people who dealt with these events, this creates issues in the context of a game, and it is for good reason that divisive issues like religion do not usually get included in video games. It dampens the impact of the narrative for people of differing religious beliefs, and, in the worst of cases, could offend some people. \n  - And finally, there is the issue of length. This game does a lot in its short length, but a $15 game that you can beat in 1 to 2 hours is a weak bargain.\n\nFinal Verdict-\nYou may be wondering, if I had so much negative stuff to say about this game, why I still gave it a recommendation. This goes back to what I said earlier- everything depends on what you expect to get out of this game. If you expect a heart- wrenching narrative that explores the life of a young child and his family going through the ultimate test to their willpower, then you will definitely not be disappointed (I definitely was not disappointed personally). However, if you buy this game expecting anything more (a sizeable duration, diverse or engaging gameplay, etc.) you will be disappointed. Consider how important these things are to you before you make a decision about buying the game.", "timestamp_created": 1452752844, "timestamp_updated": 1452752957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705209", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20517683": {"recommendationid": "20517683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046115718", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452748699}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not sure exactly what I thought of this game - or, interactive emotional experience, rather than a game. (That part is fine with me, actually. This kind of \"non-game\" interactive art is something I love.) \n\nThe problem was with the execution. I would have been more immersed in it if the controls didn't feel so clunky. I was pulled out of a lot of emotional moments when the mouse was acting up, or when I wasn't sure what I needed to do for the scene to progress. There were times I was bored standing in place just listening to the voices in the background. I wanted to hear the whole dialogue, so I was unable to move much or I would miss out on the sounds. I would have liked more interactivity in those bits, or more ability to explore without going out of rance of the dialogue.\n\nFor the price, it could have been much more polished than it was. I don't think it was worth $15. It would have been worth $15 if it was either longer or more polished. I'm hoping that maybe the game will have some updates to make it feel more fluid and seamless. It feels unfair that some scenes were stripped of their full emotional potential because of my annoyance at the game mechanics.\n\nParents will probably be more deeply touched by the game despite the technical problems. Personally, it reminded me of all the reasons why I don't want children. I don't mean that rudely at all - parents are amazing and we need them to raise the next generation. I am so thankful for all of you who take on the huge responsibility and vulnerability of having children. I doubt that there is a worse feeling than the death of a child. One reason I don't want kids is because I am not willing to take on the risk of feeling that. Well, that and the sound of kids crying.\n\nI was still touched, though. Some of it hit close to home. Spoiler for the last scene of the game: [spoiler]I know a boy who died recently who also loved blowing bubbles, and I've liked to imagine that maybe he's in heaven blowing bubbles. So blowing bubbles for Joel, in what I'm assuming was a depiction of what Joel's heaven might be like, made me cry a little.[/spoiler] Also, I was frustrated with Joel's mother for believing so strongly that Joel would be healed through a miracle. There was a situation like that in my own family that, well, caused some people to make bad decisions. It's good, in my eyes, if a game can make us feel such things.\n\nI wish Steam had a \"maybe\" option for recommendations. But I'll go with a yes, just with some reservations. I enjoyed it more than I would have a movie of the same length, because of the interactivity and creativity.

Talking about gameplay or graphics seems like a hollow exercise for a game like this. For the uninitiated, the game consists of point and click vignettes chroicling the Green family's struggle through their son Joel's battle with cancer. I was surprised at the tone, as I really expected a big sadfest from start to finish. The game takes surprising turns, though, with very happy memories, along with the sad ones. The game explores a number of themes, including crises of faith, grief & loss, strength in adversity, and the struggle for normalcy. \n\nTo address the elephant in the living room, the topic of faith (especially that of Christian faith) is very present throughout the game, but really only in the context of how the Greens feel, and not once did the game feel preachy. It's a delicate balance that's well maintained.  The game feels extremely genuine, with very personal topics the Greens went through laid bare, including marital strife as a result of Joel's cancer. Throughout the game, you'll vire the events through different perspectives, including Joel's. \n\nThe art direction is superb, with different pieces of the narrative popping in once you look away from an item on screen and look back. The sound design is equally well done; the music through the game is varied and always appropriate. \n\nThis game was one of the most difficult games I've ever played, As a parent, I constantly projected my own kids into my perception of events, and it made it all the more difficult. The tone of the game, however, isn't one of blatant misery, but really a very pensive reflection of how this particular family dealt with tragedy, and as such, can be appreciated by those without kids. The game leaves plenty of room for reflection and interpretation, and I'm sure there will be hundreds of different opinions on what different points in the narrative mean. \n\nThe Greens (and the rest of the dev team) have created a thoughtful narrative that must have been very difficult to make, and those of us who play it, quite frankly, are going to be better for it.

There are moments when the Greens did an amazing job of capturing the frustration, self doubt, and myriad of emotions that one goes through during an experience such as this.\n\nIt felt *real*. And up until about the halfway point in the game it felt like one of the *realest* experiences I've ever played through.\n\nThat was until the Greens, specifically Amy, began to use religion as a crutch. While this is obviously their story, and it would have not served them well to leave out the ways they coped, for me I could not relate to these parts. I found myself cringing at every piece of narrative that invoked God or Jesus, and there are times when the scenes are, nearly literally, drowning in these references.\n\nAt this point I realized the story was less about Joel and more about their struggle with their faith. Admittedly, I felt as though there was a bit of bait and switch and play here. And I found myself sad for what the game could have been versus what it actually is.\n\nI'm not suggesting the game should be different. I'm simply disappointed that something that was so emotional suddenly took a sharp left into territory I could no longer relate to. Something that dealt with the fear and terror of loosing a child that doesn't begin to rationalize it all away by invoking heaven and God's plans, etc... would have been much more relate-able to me.\n\nWhile the Green's faith is obviously real to them... to someone on the outside it really felt like more of a delusion. Their anger at God for taking their son quickly turns to the tried and true mantras of \"just have faith\" and \"God know's best\". Going so far as to have the player go through a story of Jesus and his disciples rowing a boat across a lake in a storm.\n\nI don't fault Ryan and Amy Green for their faith, or even for implementing their faith into the game. This is their story and I'm glad they have decided to share it. But I do feel that people who don't share their faith should be aware of exactly where this story is heading. It can be quite a shock to go from a scene where I am crying due to how well they invoke the frustration of a child you can not heal to feeling uncomfortable as I listen to another conversation where Amy professes her blind faith that Joel will be OK. \n\nThat said, I don't regret my play through. I simply regret that a universal story of loss and grief becomes niche and is no longer relate-able to many non Christians by the second half. In many ways it was an amazing game.... it just wasn't a game for me.\n\nThe gameplay itself can be quite frustrating as well sometimes. There are no choices in the game, you simply move forward and let the story unfold. It is possible to get stuck if you don't go the right direction. Other times the player gets stuck on purpose, as Ryan designed certain sections to be frustrating to mirror his own frustrations. Unfortunately the lack of context clues can either be seen as clever or poor design. It all depends on how patient the player is. Anyone would be hard pressed to call the controls anything but clunky, however the controls don't necessarily need to be smooth in a narrative like this. Ultimately, if you choose to play this game, don't expect a challenge, don' expect smooth controls, do expect to move slowly through the game, and be prepared for a faith heavy last half.\n\nedit:\nA continual misinterpretation with my review was that I was offended by the faith in the game, when I feel that I was pretty clear that I simply could not relate to it. The assumption that faith is universal, and therefor all people should be able to play this game and relate to it is completely ignorant. Faith is no more universal than any other belief.\n\nTo be clear here, had the game ended with aliens abducting Joel, I would not have been able to relate to that either. Had the game ended with Joel suddenly gaining mutant super powers, destroying cancer, and then flying to the center of the earth to procure a cure for all cancer patients, then again, I would not have been able to relate to this either.\n\nThe best parts of the game were the REAL ones. The frustrating night(s), the memories, the moments of just Joel and his parents, the final prognosis.... These parts of the game were absolutely fantastic. They are universal because human suffering is universal. You don't have to have lost a child to sympathize with the pain the Green's describe in these sections.\n\nRyan actually has one of the best lines in the game. Near the end Amy is apologizing to him for being upset that they took different routes through grief to arrive at the same place. And she wraps up by saying, \"But at least we both know Joel will be ok.\" Ryan responds, \"I don't.\". Amy asks, \"You don't what?\" And Ryan finishes by saying, \"I don't know that he will be ok. I hope he will... but I don't know that he will.\"\n\nThat is the \"delusion\" I was speaking of. The delusion of believing he will be ok no matter what the doctor says, no matter how far Joel deteriorates, and no matter how harsh reality is. And Ryan has lucid moments during those times where he questions these things, but ultimately, Joel's death is too much for him and he rushes back to his faith for that final comfort. As I said originally, I do not fault the Green's for their faith. I would never ask them to change this game. It is their experience. But to say that I, or anyone/everyone else should be able to relate to this experience is absolutely ignorant. If I were to design a game that dealt with the loss of a loved one with zero with zero faith, or even overt denials of faith, then would it be realistic for me to blindly state that everyone should be able to relate to my point of view? Not at all.\n\nEdit 2:\nIt's been nearly a year since I've published this review and I have had to delete nearly 100 comments that are along the lines of \"go kill yourself\", \"fuck you athiest\", and other wannabe creative insults comprised of nothing more than curse words and personal attacks based on nothing more than the fact that I was unable to relate to this game.\n\nIt reflects negatively on this subset of christians whom are incapable of understanding that there are people in this world that don't share their extremely specific view of how and why the universe exists.", "timestamp_created": 1452720429, "timestamp_updated": 1481078006, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3104, "votes_funny": 89, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710078", "comment_count": "319", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20512151": {"recommendationid": "20512151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145450810", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452719726}, "language": "english", "review": "\"WOW!\" is pretty much all I can say right now.

This brave hero was a young kid that had to fight a very very big bad dragon going by the name of Cancer. And Cancer had also a huge impact on his parents and family. From trying to make him smile by playing with him to keep him company in a place where doctors are trying to cure and defeat Cancer, Joel will never be alone.\n\nAnd what Joel doesn't know is the phone calls between his daddy and mommy, their thoughts during grow-up talks, their darkest moments but also their unwaiving love and faith. And besides, for Joel, when he goes home, it's like a giant Super Mario Kart's party. When there is a story to tell, he's the brave knight. And Joel isn't alone. Daddy is there to give him hugs, mommy is singing.\n\nBut That Dragon, Cancer is also a tribute to those who survived Cancer and those who died and remembered fondly by their family. True, you'll cry. Joel is playing, you stop and he's not here anymore. You read cards and letters from survivors and family having lost a dear one and you're torn between hope and sadness.\n\nThe only thing you can do is to walk, to explore, to read and listen to Joel's parents thoughts, whether it's filled with life or filled with anger/sadness/depression. You play. The only thing that matters is to listen to Joel (or anyone voicing him, because Joel was mute because of Cancer) and to make him laugh. That's your goal. Care for him. Anyone knowing the history behind the game knows the end.\n\nAnd the game is so colorful and so dark by moments. But always filled with hope. Love. Faith because God is mentionned a lot as the family is believing in Him. You can be from any religion, from any belief, even the atheist one, you'll be touched.\n\nPlaying that game is paying a tribute to everyone who lost againt Cancer, to everyone that pinned down Cancer so Cancer leaves them alone, to everyone that saw Cancer attacking their loved one and that were feeling so powerless that the only thing they could do was caring, holding an hand, crying and mainly giving so much love so that their loved one don't feel alone or unloved, to keep at bay the darkness, to try to find the light when the darkness is too much...\n\nThis game is also a way to find life again for the Green family. Everyone have to find a way to live after loosing someone to Cancer. I've a story family with: my great-grandfather, my great-grandmother and my grandmother died of that sickness. I'm at risk as it's one of these cancers that could be genetical (you know, ovaries, breasts, etc...). Even the game isn't representing what I lived as a family member, not that I was too young, but because I had my own problems at the time, I still remember the day I've learned about it. I still remember the day my grandmother couldn't walk anymore, couldn't eat anymore, staying in an hospital bed. I still remember the ER, the hospital room, the wig (we laughed about it because she had the same haircut as me)...\n\nI don't care if I didn't really review this game, though I've said what I would say normally in other words.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. ***\n\n'That Dragon, Cancer' is one of those games that I don't think I could recommend easily, because it lacks in actual gameplay. If you're into games of this genre, then Yes. Definitely play this game. The little gameplay to be found is made up with enthralling moments, amazing story-telling, incredible art and sound, and probably one of the best stories I've read/experienced in some time.\n\nYou 'play' as Ryan Green, the father of a young baby named Joel that has cancer. You experience the lives of Ryan, Amy & Joel during this period in their lives, from their amazing highs (playing in the park, feeding ducks, 'leaving the hospital' party) to their dreaded lows (conversation with doctor, final moments with Joel). The experience is truly something worthwhile.\n\nThat being said, for me personally, I did not particularly enjoy the ocean/drowning section of the game, when Ryan seems to go on a lot about God & Jesus. I understand that this was Ryan's way of dealing/coping; I am fine with that, I have nothing against it. My problem is, it pulls you away slightly from the immersion of a father trying to enjoy the last moments he has with his son, and it becomes more about him justifying having faith when he didn't before. \n\nAgain, I'm not bashing it; if that's what he used to help him get through those last few days, I wholly understand why. I just think that it pulled away from what made the game great FOR ME. The ending, however, is probably one of the best endings I've experienced in some time; seeing Joel with the puppy and the pancakes made me grin from ear to ear.\n\nAll in all, I loved this game. It was worth every penny. The game has as much replayability as watching a movie, in my opinion. I hope we see more games like this is in the future, because they're incredible when done right.\n\nAnd 'That Dragon, Cancer'?

I've only made it through a few of the scenes, but I can tell that this is going to be a heart-breaking, painful story to follow- especially after reading the background of the couple who endured this story.\n\nMany comments and reviews have questioned why someone would sell this game, not give the money to charity/research, etc. These questions can be answered by having empathy for the creator and his wife, the parents of the child displayed in this story. Not only do medical bills pile up, but also to continue making this game and deal with the grief of losing their son, this family lived off of savings for several months to finish this game, this masterpiece, to help not only themselves, but also (hopefully) others through the loss of a child in this manner. \n\nThe score of background music fits so well with the scenes of the game. The narration feels real and the script is on point. The mechanics of the game are easy to follow and smooth, not much thought process in the beginning (again, I haven't played through), as most is explore, point, and click. The colors, sounds, and overall feelings of each scene are truly cathartic and calming at some points. \n\nI highly recommend \"That Dragon, Cancer\" to anyone who is looking for something with true meaning, something that is mechanically easy, and something that will allow them to go down a slide as many times as they want with no time constraint or urgent mission to accomplish. \n\nThis is a game that I cannot wait to finish, then play again throughout my life.

I've cried during games before, but it's always been inside a crafted narrative, played out by fictional characters, and that facet of \"this is fake\" was always in the back of my mind. In contrast, That Dragon, Cancer is less performance (I think that as a game, performance is a necessary part) and more conversation. Human to human. It felt like Ryan, Amy, and their family were not just telling but showing me their story, in the way that only visual media can. And I was there, crying and laughing along with them, like we were old friends.\n\nIt's small in scope as games go, but the striking, hyper-realistic audio coupled with the minimalist UI and low-poly visuals creates a quick sense of immersion. At once both vivid and dreamlike, mirroring the emotional state of Ryan and Amy. And in the first 20-30 minutes, I reached that place too. I felt like I was walking along with them all the way until The End, about 160 minutes in my playthrough.\n\nI ran into a couple bugs that were annoying enough to warrant mention. I had to restart a chapter because the scripting broke, there was a voicemail I couldn't click, and a single letter played at 10% volume relative to the others. Annoying not in their own right but because I wanted so much for this story to play how it was intended. I will note though that I was immersed again within minutes, and the bugs ultimately didn't take anything away from the story.\n\nIf you're interested in That Dragon, Cancer, then you probably know at least a little bit about it, and I'm not going to spoil anything. Just buy it and play it, alone or with a loved one. It's a tragic and hopeful human story. It's not about the glorious triumph of faith, it's about the endurance of faith even when it's seemingly failed. It's gorgeous, moving, and well-told.

While the game did exactly that, several times over, it was a relief to find just how much of a testament to life, hope, and joy the game was despite its grim subject matter. Regardless of your history or whether you've had to deal with tragedy regarding loved ones, there's a good chance this will resonate with your humanity.\n\nI loved how That Dragon, Cancer balances interaction and gameplay with its story and presentation. Rather than limit things to one point of view, you essentially get a glimpse of events through every set of eyes involved, some of which I didn't even expect. The visual style is haunting even in its brightest moments, and music is interwoven as a perfect complement to your progress as you carry on. My favorite element, however, would have to be how the different Kickstarter backer submissions were included. I started getting choked up working through the hall full of art and photographs, and I nearly had to step away from the keyboard once there were cards to read. That's when the whole thing really hit home.\n\nIt was also nice to have the more gamified asides at certain points, like a kart race and a knight's adventure, to both lighten the mood and give you more of a sense of control. With the situation spiraling as it was for Joel's parents, there's a certain helplessness to only being able to stand by and listen to their retelling of it.\n\nI'm sure I missed a thing or two on the first playthrough, so I'm glad there's a scene select option, but I'm gonna need some time before I dive back in.

Yes, and I think you will too.\n\nBut let's be honest here, this game is being published on Steam as a game. Is it a commercial release? No. Is it an art game? Yes. It has a message and a point it wants to drive home. But honestly, this game is almost utterly devoid of gameplay whatsoever. And the little existing gameplay is frustrating, hard to interpret, and repetitive. Is it a good game? No.\n\nThe game has essentially been constructed as a linear walkthrough of several mnemonic palaces or rooms. The player is herded from point to point, triggering memories, sound clips, letters, experiences with Joel. It is certainly touching, but also excruciatingly boring at times. The interface is so minimalist that it drives you to spam clicking, hoping an action will be triggered. Part of this is deliberate, since the game is communicating Ryan and Amy's frustration and lack of power, there is no question about that. However, it is also true that the game is asking to be treated like a game, and as such it should be judged on its own merits and demerits. The fact of the matter is that the clunky controls, linearity, and lack of clear direction distract the player and detract from the greater purpose.\n\nI think Ryan and Amy deserve sympathy for suffering through Joel's death after a long, frustrating, and painful battle with terminal disease.  But they also deserve praise for the love they displayed by memorializing Joel's brief life. They also showed courage by bearing their own raw grief in a way that is unprecedented for games and may also be unprecedented in other media. People will remember this game for its originality of concept, its tenderness, and for the fact that it was a labor of love, a heartbreaking commemoration of a life barely lived. Because the game delivers such a powerful message of loss, Joel too will be remembered and missed by everyone who plays this.\n\nI'd recommend this game, especially the scene where Joel will not stop crying late into the night, to young single people who haven't yet experienced the intense love a parent feels for a child. It will put you in that place mentally where all of us parents have been, and I would say that it is the game's strongest scene. I wish Ryan and Amy all the best.", "timestamp_created": 1452654775, "timestamp_updated": 1452654775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20498885": {"recommendationid": "20498885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022453808", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452654406}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never felt so close to people that I've never met than I have when playing this game.

I'm just stuck looking at the chair in the middle of the room. There seems to be no fix for it, as I've tried restarting the game and also tried replaying through the first two scenes again. It just gets stuck and i have to exit the game. Until that gets fixed, this was a waste of 15 dollars, since it does not work on my screen. I installed it on my roommates computer and it worked fine on his 16:9 display, but i don't have access to his computer constantly.\n\nThis is a warning to those that have 21:9 displays, stay away until they fix this issue. I will update this review accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n****I MANAGED TO FINISH THE GAME, I BORROWED MY ROOMMATES MONITOR FOR THE NIGHT*****\n\nThe following is my review of the actual game itself;\n\nI went into this game expecting to cry a lot. My family is no stranger to cancer. My grandmother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer when I was around 15 years old. She beat it, or so we thought. It reappeared in her lymph nodes when i was 19. By the time I had turned 21, it was back full force. I was away for most of the year after I joined the military, and when I finally came back home, she was no longer the strong woman I once looked up to. She was one of the closest people in my life and the struggle of watching her deteriorate absolutely broke me. There is still a feeling of guilt and remorse to this day for personal reasons I don't wish to divulge. But now my Aunt is also struggling with terminal cancer, she's already living past when the doctors expected. My mother just underwent surgery on her lip for a cancerous group of cells. My grandfather had skin cancer on his nose. My other grandfather battled with prostate cancer. This game was going to hit very hard in a very tender spot for me.\n\nAll that being said, I was crying by the second scene. By the time I hit the scene with all of the cards (you'll see) I was an absolute mess. Tears, snot, shaking uncontrollably, all of it. I had to walk away from the computer for an entire hour to compose myself. It hit too close to home. I couldn't read any more of those god damned cards. By the time I had finished the game, I almost felt a shred of relief. But the credits even got me going again.\n\nThis game also deals with a struggle of faith in christianity, none of which I can personally relate to as I am agnostic. But it might reach out to some of you folks more than it did for me.\n\nAs for the actual game itself, the controls felt a little clunky, and even upping the look sensitivity felt a little too slow still.\n\nThere were quite a few completely unneeded mini-games strewn throughout as well, often not giving you any sort of instructions. I feel that these interrupted the flow of the story being told, and were too distracting. This would function better as an interactive experience instead of feeling like it was forced to have more game like qualities.\n\n\nIn short, I got more than I bargained for in the emotional department.\nThe game tries too hard to be a game sometimes instead of focusing on the storytelling experience.\nOverall, if you enjoy extremely emotional (and true) stories, it's worth playing through. Just be prepared for the occasional mini-game that feels out of place.", "timestamp_created": 1452653027, "timestamp_updated": 1452669123, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 145, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.365104", "comment_count": "17", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20498515": {"recommendationid": "20498515", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995694836", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452652618}, "language": "english", "review": "WOW.

A beautifully personal experience with a series of unique scenes that illicited a range of emotions. From wonderment to intense discomfort and fear, the game has a constant human edge and fragility that makes it quite unique and engaging.\n\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks that should be acknowledged. As far as gameplay the pacing takes a few moments to adjust to and largely remains consistent, however there were definitely several moments where the game stalls a few seconds too long and I was left looking around for the next object to click or place to move, but I just had to wait for the scene to progress. The point and click movement style also in general was hit and miss for me. In some scenes, such as the bird ones it felt natural. However others where you are walking around, I couldn't help but wish it used wasd+mouse. Finding things to click felt a little clunky at times because of this.  Also the weird mouse de-accelleration was clearly included to help with the pacing and slower style of the game but it made it a little difficult to find a good mouse sensitivity for me and looking around was a bit of a chore sometimes. These mechanical elements were a little frustrating and occasionally broke my immersion in the game, but ultimately were mostly trivial to the overall experience.\n\nAlso, it should be noted for those going into the game that there are several scenes that are densely Christian. This includes bible passages and personal stories laden with devout faith in God and a grapplig with questioning of this faith. I personally found this quite alienating and offputting, this is probably partially due to it being a little unexpected (I didn't overly research this game prior to purchasing). So for those like myself, I think knowig that it is coming from a devout Christian perspective is probably useful when starting the game. Keep in mind that this religious element is not present in every scene and I personally found the most profound and intense scenes to have it entirely absent (scenes from the doctors office and hospital come to mind). This isn't really a criticism of the game as such, as it is obviously a very personal story about a family's experience and that family happens to be Christian.\n\nRegardless of this I would definitely recommend the game for its uniqueness, its humanity, its beauty and its intensity.", "timestamp_created": 1452648033, "timestamp_updated": 1452648033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651110", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20497401": {"recommendationid": "20497401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065353838", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452646795}, "language": "english", "review": "Beauitful game.

No, not really, not in any conventional sense.  It's a personal, frank, honest and (I believe) accurate exploration of looking after a critically ill child.  Whilst it's short (~2 hours), it has to rank as the single most emotional and moving experience I've had in games, in fact it worked better than I ever thought it possible to.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something I can say I \u201cenjoyed\u201d, I wept fairly openly at several points, but it\u2019s something I\u2019m glad I experienced and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest.\n\nFull disclosure, I backed this at the time of the Kickstarter in November 2014.  At the time my son was about 9 months post bone marrow transplant for Leukaemia, and we had been immersed in \u201cThat Dragon\u201d (for want of a better phrase), and all it entailed, for just under 18 months at that point.  I didn\u2019t know whether I would ever play it, all I knew was that I wanted this to exist.\n\nFast forward another 14 months, our path has taken a more positive note than Joel\u2019s.  Sadly many of the friends we made on the way are still fighting or were not so lucky, so it was with some fear I clicked on the download button.  Was this going to be some mawkish \u201csuffering porn\u201d?  Would I recognise the feelings expressed?  I knew there was a religious bent (the Green\u2019s are strongly committed Christians), would it rub the atheist in me the wrong way?  Fortunately as I played through the first few scenes, my fears were soon shown to be unfounded.  The game unfolds as a series of vignettes with relatively basic controls, playing much like a simple point and click adventure for the most part, though it will never win awards on the basis of game mechanics.  Where it shines is in the openness with which the Green\u2019s hopes, fears, concerns and dreams are worked in, and how they have managed to capture everything from the hope of treatment, to the all-consuming nature of the care that Joel requires, to the despair of setbacks (and in Joel\u2019s case, terminal diagnosis), to brief moments of levity in the hospital.  The Green\u2019s feelings, whilst couched in more religious terms than I would personally use, are perfectly relatable and beautifully expressed, capturing well the range and nuances of the emotions that families in this situation face, the religious beliefs are obvious but are neither evangelical nor off-putting in any way.\n\nIt\u2019s worth pausing on the point about moments of levity, as I\u2019ve seen a couple of publications question whether they make sense in context; my view is that they make perfect sense.  Anyone that has spent any time on a paediatric oncology/haematology ward or in the related clinics will attest to the fact that an awful lot of time and effort is expended by everyone (not least the parents) to make the whole thing as un-miserable for the kids as possible.  I\u2019ve lost count of the number of dads I\u2019ve seen racing up and down ward corridors, kids on their shoulders or in prams, making racing car noises or rat-a-tat-tat sounds, or dodged a small child on a trike only to nearly bump into their carer pushing along a stand full of infusion pumps, each of which is attached to said child.  Whilst I appreciate this might seem odd in the context of a game that you would expect to be straight-up and po-faced, it captures perfectly the need to create levity wherever and whenever possible, for the child\u2019s sake if nothing else.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a beautifully crafted interactive experience and can rightly be considered as gaming putting it\u2019s best foot forwards as a serious medium for exploring weighty topics.", "timestamp_created": 1452641206, "timestamp_updated": 1452641412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20496303": {"recommendationid": "20496303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040981043", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452638760}, "language": "english", "review": "What an amzing game.

This is exemplified in the very best use of Kickstarter backers I\u2019ve seen in a game, reading real letters to those who have been lost, but not forgotten; grandparents, parents, friends, and children. There are stories of a deceased parent never seeing their children grow up and ones of children that never got the chance to live.

These moments combined with you taking part in some of the events of the Greens\u2019 experiences make for an engaging game that didn\u2019t deviate in making me think that they didn't take advantage of being a game. The game also tends to shy away from being cloying or schmaltzy, it is brutally honest as it details the Greens struggles, their pain, their happiness, and their questioning of faith. May you be religious or not, the Greens get at the core of an ancient question for humanity \u201cwhy do the good and innocent suffer\u201d? And as I said, this is a game that isn\u2019t just meant as a memorial to Joel Green, it\u2019s meant for everyone, to try and help people explore that grief and despair, but as well as the appreciation and love of those who were a part of our lives. That Dragon, Cancer is not a fun game and I can only imagine how even more brutal it must be for those who lost loved ones too soon and/or are parents.

was cathartic. In a snese, the pain that the Greens went through were several degrees worse than when my father fought for his life. Every hope and anguish is stiflingly recreated or recorded in real-life, making this game one of the most heartwrenching games for 2016.\n\nJuvenile cancer doesn't lead to a punchline or a joke. It is an illness as frustrating as Alzheimer's, Parkinsons, multiple schlerosis, etc. that slowly makes one wither away from the living world. Every day, you hope for a cure and some sort of reprieve from the agony of the regular chemotherapy visits and the brain haze felt after radiotherapy. However, you are tasked to live with it, even if you are cured from it.\n\nThe Greens' experience as parents with two other healthy kids whilst facing this horrible, delibitating disease on their third and youngest after being born twelve months before has to be lived. The game does not serve as an epitaph to little Joel. The game serves to remind us that life is short and happiness can be found in the simplest of things. For baby Joel, it was feeding the ducks at the pond, playing in the playground, or just being with his \"dah-dah.\" This will be the closest baby Joel will ever come to forming actual words.\n\nThe disease will ravage everyone you love and the person who suffers from it.\n\nI remember watching my father fight it. He did what he did: buy a farm and tour the world with his family. He ate carefully, but still enjoyed the wine that flowed into his goblet. He lived his life fully for 2 whole years. His last six months were a torture on us and him. He was withdrawn as he began to feel the effects of the cancer that spread to his brain. The neuropathy was getting to him. The radiotherapy that was supposed to reduce the seizures make him babble incoherently. His lungs rattled up coughs violent in the night, giving the family countless sleepless nights. I had some regrets of becoming angry at him for instances that still haunt me to my very core.\n\nThe game isn't an epitaph for Joel. It is closure for the Green family. Whilst I was playing this game, I felt every nuance that a person who is going through this disease feels. Right now, TotalBiscuit who is suffering from terminal liver cancer has I think played this game. He might become a sobbing little whingey bitch (see comment made by me at the comment section for clarification on this statement). But he too will begin to accept the inevitable. Whether he can fight this proverbial dragon called cancer, like little Joel, is really up to God. Even you don't believe in the existence of one, only the cosmos knows.\n\nThe game is not about mechanics. It's about a lived experience.\n\nI highly recommend this game to everyone. Not as a tearjerker, but as a Bible towards finding closure in the face of a long fought battle against the tides of death.", "timestamp_created": 1452617134, "timestamp_updated": 1452664665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 781, "votes_funny": 53, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911425", "comment_count": "45", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20489756": {"recommendationid": "20489756", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989132185", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453394590}, "language": "english", "review": "This is heavy. Far too heavy to really write about. One has to approach a project like this with a certain degree of carefulness as to not pinch a nerve. It's a short experience, game, call it whatever \u2013 it is not of interest, it is not appropriate to consider \u2013 but it has a lot of talking points. Themes run through this game in a very condensed manner, through minimalist artistry and an ambient atmosphere soundscape sharply conveyed in tandem with the subject matter. As most games tend to some extent be grand and impersonal, with an amount of graphical detail that That Dragon, Cancer cannot match, few games come close to the intimacy of this game. Even with facelessness there is character, and the voice acting portrays the countenance of despair better than any animation could. Here we are not shown a narrative on a grand scale, instead the focal point runs inward, towards the core family dynamic in the process of losing one of its members, and it hurts.\n\nWhat one could call levels in other games are perhaps best put as scenes in That Dragon, Cancer. The player, or observer, inhabits the bird's eye view, although quite literally which does not fit with the term \u201cbird's eye view\u201d. One is loaded into a scene of varying degree of bizarreness depending on whether or not it's in a symbolic realm or in a scene attempting to, with a minimalist impressionist style, capture a memory as is. While the game, I assume, tries to mix up the somberness of this very dire subject matter with some depictions of joyous memories, I found the merriment to be most gut-wrenching. Before death, that which negates the positive experience of joy, I feel the diminishing of each such moment to no longer be a fight, a hopefulness or an alignment with God, but a mirror to the great negator. A mirror situated before the face of death. God is the great escape. As the knight in Seventh Seal puts it: [i] We must make an idol of our fear, and that idol we shall call God.[/i]  \n\nPerhaps in this intimate setting, where we follow a family in their dealings with death, the religious experience, or where faith becomes a supplement for knowledge, we find the grandness that perhaps did not belong. When tragedy is belied, misconstrued as a test of faith, or when the symbolic obfuscation of the true object of fear creates an \u201cout\u201d, we no longer find intimacy, we find absolute oblivion. Any form of true interaction between humans is interchanged with an ersatz of divine comfort. And this escape, which is portrayed in this game to the nth degree, is what is most forlorn in the face of death. Because once, if, let's say, as a thought experiment, we do not capitulate to the grace of God, what then? What comfort is there in our pain? If our pain is insignificant for the other, especially for the big Other. The game alludes to the troubles of flatus vocis, a category wherein God belongs at least to me, but to the game, to this family, it is a trouble of the weakness of platitudes. What are words compared to the suffering of this child? Of the people who love this child? What are words in comparison to the actual death of flesh that we are all facing. I cannot begrudge the plead for something that would calcify our significance in this world, perhaps especially our departing from it, that death should have significance for it to not ruin us. My issue is only with the ease of which one disappears from the horror of natural life, from our lifeworld/lebenswelt by way of God or any sort of deus ex machina for the despairing narrative of our subjects.\n\nNo matter what your religious leanings or non-leanings may be, there is immense beauty encapsulated in this experience. I was brought out of the experience once due to a somewhat silent and weird bubble-blowing scene that was a bit too long for its emotional impact, but that might also just have been my own disregard for the religious detour and its beauty. Other than this incidence, most of it hits you hard. You know it is real and it hits you hard. The visuals are as stated before, minimalist, but vibrant and oddly enough fits perfectly with the idea of this being a looking-back, a memory not vividly there. It is not being lived, it is a reliving with everything fitting that oneiric haze of a memory. There is a lot of imagery that fits with this existential depth one falls into when dealing with death, there is the clich\u00e9d cosmic indifference that come with 1900th century scientism and the subsequent dehiscence between man and faith, all adding to the effect that introspection already should have had on you.\n\nMusically there is a similar finesse to every scene. Noise, drone and ambiance when focus is on something else, where the soundscape is tailor made to enhance a visual or a voice actor's performance, and silent sections with a more instrumental punch where the music speaks for itself. There is an elegance to the production of this game, an understanding of what is at hand here in terms of themes and portrayal of something very close to many people, especially themselves. \n\nEverything in That Dragon, Cancer has been made with so much care. Obviously with a game like this you cannot haphazardly throw something together, you can't make it cynical, you cannot fail in any regard whatsoever for to do so would be to squander an opportunity for a heart-wrenchingly personal game that I'm sure resonate deeply with a lot of people. I sincerely do not think anything here is a failure. This game is a depiction of both the process of dying and death, of being an other, being \u201chere\u201d while that somebody is \u201cthere\u201d, being helpless, falling victim to the unknown and the desperation it brings out in people; and it was effective. Nothing about this is easy. I don't think it ever will be, or ever should be. However, I do think it is important. I think it's important to know, to encroach on this otherwise very personal story through this medium. Moreover, I think it's important to know what you cannot know. I think it's important being able to feel \u201cthis\u201d, and letting others deal with that in whatever way they see fit. To feel the lack of the unknown, to feel the negation of life, and to be an observer of the onerous path towards it, both physically and mentally. \n\nThere is a lot more to say, a lot more to discover and think about, a lot more to feel. Succinctly put: I'd recommend you just play it and find out by yourself.

With that said, the vulnerability and honesty presented in this game is more abundant than any work, game or otherwise, that I've ever encountered. There are no pulled punches, and yet the end result (for me, at least) is a feeling of hope, not despair.\n\nThe sound carries most of the narrative weight, allowing those involved in the story to tell it from their hearts, with the abstract graphics removing any risk of distracting by the false facial expressions and out-of-place animations so common in games, and instead focusing on broad strokes of color and texture. \n\nThis game carries such a powerful story and presents it so well that I consider it a must-play. I believe that you will, too.\n\n(EDIT: Since I've had to delete more than a few comments from readers that misread the opening line: I do not mean for you to infer that gamers are not human beings. Rather, the scope of this game encompasses broader themes than can be tackled solely from a gamer's perspective.

It's an interactive, narrative experience.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nIt's a story of Joel Green, a kid who fought a 4-year battle with cancer.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nIt's not about how it looks, but rather about what you can see. And it's a surreal mixture of reality, dreams, nightmares, hopes and sadness.\nFrom a technical point of view - I've had issues playing on 2560x1080 resolution - it was displaying the game at 1920x1080 with black bars on both sides of my screen.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nIt's mostly some sad, background music with voice recordings on top of it. And those are Joel's parents conversations, voicemails, letters, discussions with doctors, etc.\n\n[h1]Mechanics[/h1]\nVery limited. Every once in a while you have to click somewhere to either walk to that location or interact with something.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nLike I said, there isn't much here. You click on one location, move there, trigger an action, watch something happen or listen to a dialogue, repeat. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's difficult to even call this a video game. It's a narrative experience. And it's a very powerful one. I feel sad for the Green family and I am very sorry for their loss.\nI also understand that people in difficult situations turn to God for help, but there was way too much religious content here.\nPersonally, I didn't enjoy this. Maybe [i]\"enjoy\"[/i] isn't the right word, I don't think anyone was supposed to enjoy this.

While such titles tend to have little actual gameplay and may not be what you could call \"entertaining\", they often use the medium in interesting ways to tell stories or evoke some sort of emotional response from the player that's different from what might be possible with more traditional forms of media like film or literature. \n\nLike Gone Home, Depression Quest, or To the Moon, That Dragon, Cancer, is one such game. \nIf you have an interest in unique, narrative-focused games and are thinking about testing this one out, I'd suggest you pick up one of the other titles I just mentioned instead. \n\nI was drawn to That Dragon, Cancer by glowing reviews from critics and testaments from players that the game could reduce even the most hardened of men to bawling wrecks. Now I'm a susceptible to certain films starring Anne Hathaway or any story featuring a dead dog plotline as the next person, but I was surprised to find myself completely dry-eyed at the end of this. \n\nSo maybe I'm cold and heartless for failing to be moved by this story about the tragic death of a five-year-old from cancer, or maybe this game is just hugely overrated. \n\nBefore I get into what specifically I disliked about That Dragon, Cancer, I want to say that I'm grateful that games like this exist, and I respect the Greens' using a game as a way of sharing their painful experience with the world. Despite all that, personally, it just wasn't worth my Saturday afternoon. \n\nI did try to engage with That Dragon, Cancer, but something always kept throwing me off, whether it be the game's clunky mechanics, which left me wondering what exactly I had to do to progress to the next level, or slightly hackneyed monologues that expressed the characters' thoughts and feelings a little too overtly for my liking. \n\nThe biggest thing that threw me was That Dragon, Cancer's preoccupation with Christianity. While I understand that faith is important to the Greens and their in-game counterparts, the Christian elements of the game were so overwhelming that they drowned out pretty much everything else. I feel like the developers took a story that could have potentially been relatable to everybody, and made it relatable only to those who share their beliefs. \n\nFrom the soundtrack to the letters written by loved ones of those who have passed away from cancer scattered throughout the game, almost everything had a Christian element, making this game feel like two parts religious allegory and only one part personal tragedy. \n\nI'd rather not end on a sour note, so I won't sign off without first mentioning a few things that I did like about That Dragon, Cancer. The game's most subtle moments are it's best. Snippets of conversations with the family's elder children, and the messages left from Amy on Ryan's phone, which offer a glimpse at the couple's everyday life caring for a sick child, but also carry an undercurrent of hope and love. \n\nAs gaming continues to evolve, I hope that other developers will be inspired by games like this to tell stories in a creative way. Even if the execution isn't great, That Dragon, Cancer offers a glimpse at what a game can be.", "timestamp_created": 1519376952, "timestamp_updated": 1519376952, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513274", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39943542": {"recommendationid": "39943542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146284874", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518139675}, "language": "english", "review": "So let me get this out of the way first, this is less of a game than it is a point and click visual novel. If you're expecting a shoot em up or something like that this isnt it.

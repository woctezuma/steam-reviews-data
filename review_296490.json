It's a great game and while it may take a couple rounds to truly begin to figure everything out, you'll be hooked once you do.\n\nI found the original when it was a free game on some Flash game website a while back. Most of those Flash era games are glorified timewasters but the original GemCraft was on a totally different level.

Yes, yes, and yes. This is a massive game with outstanding replayability, hundreds of achievements, and many choices. You will lose over and over again until you master it. \n\nThis is an incredibly deep and addictive game and it gives you new items and abilities slowly. You receive shadow cores to spend on abilities, but spend too many shadow cores and your starting mana is lower, making it harder to start each level. The gems you use can either be used by themselves and upgraded or can be combined with any type and number of other gems. The gems are all different, like poison, increased hit or critical hit chance, decreased armour, decreased healing, etc. You can also build walls and use gems in traps. One main strategy is to build fewer towers with stronger gems and traps with gems. Use your bolts and beams wisely as they take time to recharge. You can throw gem bombs.\n\nSeeing fast enemies and giants can make you panic. You don't want them to reach your orb. Just build a combination of towers and traps and make sure you use poison a lot. Keep upgrading gems as you go and make sure you put them at strategic points. Walls can also help a lot if you make your enemies travel as far as possible so the gems can do their damage.\n\nI keep coming back to play more of this game because it is such a fun, challenging, and massive game. Achievement hunters will love it. If you like tower defense games or just a good challenge, play this game.

Boy am I glad, this game hasn't disappointed my memories of GemCraft - it's freaking awesome!\n\nThe main game consists of 168 pre-made maps. Monster spawns and paths are pre-set, while you generally build towers and sometimes mazes. The towers only serve as sockets for gems, which is where the game is starting to open up. There are 9 colours with different base stats and special effects and it is completely up to you how you combine and level up gems. Do you want slow-down, poison and armour tearing in a single gem? You can do that!\n\nMeanwhile each beaten level causes you to get stronger and stronger both via the XP and skill system and via picked-up talisman fragments. You discover new gem colours and 6 different spells (e.g. freezing), adding a dynamic component to what otherwise might be relatively passive levels.\n\nThe progression is where this game really shines. If a monster with 1.000 HP seems unbeatable at first, after a few dozen hours monsters with trillions of HP will be trivial to kill. And the most astonishing thing is, the game always keeps up with your power level. After unlocking them, you have available 3 difficulties and 9 different \"traits\" to enhance each level and after the base level you can always enter Endurance Mode up to wave 999. With the wrong settings you can go back to level 1 and find yourself utterly out-classed. With the right settings and tactics you can go back to level 1 and upgrade your score from 100 XP to 100 billion XP, feeding back into growing stronger.\n\nPersonally I really enjoyed the ridiculous exponential levelling, culminating in beating my first Endurance Mode against a final \"e45\" wave, meaning its monsters' HP were numbers with 46 digits (aka a quattuordecillion). But at this point you are running into severe technical problems. With around 10.000 monsters on screen, my game grinds to a near-halt with less than 1 FPS. So even after 140 hours there is still much content left, but it's super grindy and little fun to stare at a slide-show for hours.\n\nIf all that power grind is not for you - don't worry! Grinding makes the game much much easier, but it is not required at all. And if you never crank up the difficulty, the game is actually pretty casual and relaxing. There are 23 \"Vision Fields\", that fully turn the genre around into a puzzle game. Here your progression doesn't matter as you have to beat challenges with pre-defined tools. This is taken to the extreme in Iron Wizard Mode, where you can run through the 168 levels of the base-game with a capped progression and no possibility to grind. After 80 hours in the main game, Iron Wizard Mode was still a really interesting challenge and made me think about the game in a different way, because overpowering brute force wasn't an option anymore.\n\nThere is just so much to do! Discovering 191 different maps, trying out new skill combinations and strategies, revisiting old levels with new challenges, etc! Many levels even feature interesting achievements, requiring you to think and play outside of your comfort zone (e.g. using only poison or building no towers). There is a very flimsy story arc with nice artwork, but don't expect a proper narrative. The graphics are decent, as is the sound. But let's be honest, the focus is clearly on gameplay first and foremost and this is where the game excels.\n\nThis is easily the best Tower Defense game out there and worth every penny! I have never seen such a variety and depth in a Tower Defense game with such a rock solid core gameplay.

That's not good.\n\nIt does have some redeeming features. For example the targeting system is pretty nice. It could be better, with some options to combine the parameters. For example targeting the giant with lowest hp would be nice in some cases.\n\nBasically it's the ultimate grindfest, but the problem is that it keeps on repeating itself. There's only 3 types of monsters and 9 different towers. The problem is that in most maps your tower options are severely limited. Usually you get to build 3-5 different types of towers. You can combine the types, theoretically increasing the amount of different towers to dozens, but it has its downsides and doesn't really add variety.\n\nOne other problem with the game is how its mechanics works. Basically all monsters heal and all monsters have armour. This means that in your first tower cluster you need towers that rip the monsters armour and in the second cluster the towers which you want to do the killing. There's yet one another problem how you deal damage with towers in this game. I also don't like how the support towers function and how the focus is to build one super high level damage tower since the building space is limited on most levels.\n\nAfter reaching wizard level high enough in the normal game you need to manually increase the difficulty of each wave, which becomes extremely tedious as well.\n\nThe numbers also become extreme.

Considering i spent 140 hours (-10 hours afk) and my achievement count still shows up as 100% (418/419) i will call this game done for now.\n\n-\n\nGemcraft is an awesome and iconic 2D Tower Defense Game with an abundant choice of upgrades and difficulty options that you can change easily between 150+ levels. It got a unique and mystical story that i really got into while playing the game but that's not necessary to pay attention to, if you just want to progress in the game. The art and setting are really fitting as well.\n\nIf you're looking for a 2D Tower Defense Game, there are a few things you can expect right away, like different difficulties for different maps, an arsenal of different towers ranging from standard to unique towers all having a place and use case in the game, replayability and upgrades!\n\nIn my opinions Gemcraft exceeds in all of the listed points. You get more maps than you asked for but just enough to feed your endless craving for more, you get an extensive unlockable difficulty system to revisit beaten maps, you get levels out the oven to feed an immense scaling system with skill points and there are easter eggs and details left and right. You really feel how much thought was put into this game.\n\nThe tower system uses 9 different gems which incorporate skill effects corresponding to their color and you can mix and match them to your strategical needs. You drop the gems in the tower and upgrade them as you go. You can switch them out too, put them in traps, amplifiers or shrines. There is really a whole lot going on.\n\nIf you look for a tower defense game or if you're interested after reading this review you won't be disappointed by spending a few bucks.\n\nNotes / Personal Milestones:\n- Beat the storyline after 50 hours\n- Reached level 1000 after 70 hours\n- After 100 hours i reached level 1800, unlocked 98% of the achievements and finished 85% of the maps on a 70x difficulty multiplier\n- 115 hours / lvl 2000 / 99% achievements (6 to go) / 90% maps\n- After that i just finished the missing maps on hard mode without additional difficulty, started a new run for the last achievement but ultimately the grind grinded my gears and now i'm happy to let this game go, i got a little burnt out chasing achievements :')\n\nI think there are many stages in the game and you have to decide for yourself how much time you want to invest into it. There are probably more casual players who wouldn't have the nerves to finish the storyline but get 20+ hours entertainment out of the game before they feel the repitition kicking in, then there are people who grind another 50 hours for high difficulty in every map, or maybe you want to grind all the 419 achievements. \n\nThat said, in the late-late-stage of the game, you can learn how to do some real funky sh't with your gems to create \"supergems\", as i call them, and i'm with 2000+ levels at the stage where i could learn that, but i'm honestly done for now. It's just remarkable what you can do with this game though. The most popular guide for this game starts at lvl 2000+ but aims for people at lvl 5000+ too.\n\nI can whole-heartedly recommend this game for anyone somewhat interested in Tower Defense Games for all the reasons i listed above and more (i definitely forgot some things), the only downside is the repetitive aspect found in many TD Games, but some people actually want that. I'd say you get easily 30 hours of gameplay experience out of Gemcraft without feeling the repetition too much. The game got a great way to unlock features and you'll be improving and changing up your playstyle frequently (if you want to) until you hit the \"optimal setup\".\n\nLove the game, recommend the game, i'm donezo.

They have an empty  slot that holds a gem, and the gem dictates what the tower does. The gems themselves don't have much pizzazz, only 9 in total and when placed in a tower they all look and behave very similarly except for color. Similar range, damage, etc. with some modifiers. (Slow, chaining, steals currency,...) The gimmick is that you can combine gems to mix their effects. They don't generate new effects (see the super cool Android game Myth Defense to see what that's like) but that makes them easier to understand, which can be good because the game has a lot going on at any given moment. \n\nResource management, tower placement, path shaping, are all there, but there's many small systems on top that make the game as a whole remarkably complex. The uses for gems are the biggest contributor - aside from using gems for towers and floor-based \"traps\" (alternate tower essentially) you can also use gems as bombs, permanently destroying them instead of slotting them into a tower. You can also bomb the UI icon for an upcoming wave of enemies to \"enrage\" the wave and make it more difficult, increasing the number of enemies and their health and armor. Additionally, each tower has a handful of AI settings as well to fine-tune your monster-killing apparatus.\n\nOutside of the moment-to-moment action, the game is most comparable to Dungeon Warfare due to (1) the ability to use modifiers to make the game intentionally harder so that you can get more XP from a stage, (2) having XP level the player up, and (3) having levels translate to skill points that you allot on various abilities before entering battle. The skills are more varied than DW though, and the penalties you can apply to yourself are in many cases more impactful. On top of this are a couple of interwoven systems of acquiring and leveling up collectible items that augment your game, something rarely seen in TD games and a welcome layer of complexity here. These systems make it so the strategy outside the game, before you even enter a stage, are a game unto themselves.\n\nAll in all easily worth $20 so a total steal at the usual $10 and a no-brainer when it's on sale.\n\nCompared to other pure TD games I've played on Steam, it sits alongside Defense Grid, Dungeon Warfare, Defender's Quest, Creeper World 3, and Super Sanctum TD as games that are more than worth their money.", "timestamp_created": 1506599089, "timestamp_updated": 1506599089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35258027": {"recommendationid": "35258027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088106272", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1515273040}, "language": "german", "review": "GemCraft - Chasing Shadows ist ein Musterbeispiel f\u00fcr Spielmechaniken, die kinderleicht (und mit minimalem Tutorial) zu erlernen sind, aber auch schnell extrem schwer werden k\u00f6nnen. \n\nDas Grundprinzip ist einfach: Man hat verschiedene Edelsteine, die man in T\u00fcrme packt und die dann auf Monster schie\u00dfen. Die Komplexit\u00e4t kommt dann dadurch zustande, dass es neun verschiedene Arten von Edelsteinen gibt, die man weiter upgraden und kombinieren kann, in dem Levelsystem, womit man durch XP in F\u00e4higkeiten investieren kann die einem im Spiel helfen, und durch die immer brutaler werdenden Monster [spoiler] von denen das fieseste auch im Pause-Modus weiter agieren kann [/spoiler] . Man kann auch durch den Talisman seine Kampfbedingungen beeinflussen (z.B. bestimmten Monstern mehr Schaden zuf\u00fcgen, F\u00e4higkeiten schneller aufladen oder mehr XP bekommen) und das Spiel nach eigenem Gusto schwerer machen. \n\nJe schwerer man sich ein Level einstellt, desto mehr XP bekommt man nat\u00fcrlich, und das beste daran ist meiner Meinung nach wie viel Freiheit man dabei hat. Man kann zum Beispiel wenn man zus\u00e4tzliche Monster hinzuf\u00fcgt nur Giganten beigeben, oder die Wellen schneller kommen lassen. Je nachdem wie schwer man es sich machen m\u00f6chte kann man erstmal alle Felder ohne zus\u00e4tzliche Monster oder Behinderungen aufdecken (wie eine Art Story Mode) oder gleich Hardcore an alles rangehen und sich daf\u00fcr mit einer echten Challenge und vielen XP belohnen lassen. Da man das von Level zu Level entscheiden kann muss man sich auf nichts festlegen, und au\u00dfer Zeit ist auch nichts verloren wenn man ein Level mal nicht schafft. \n\nZu sehr sollte man sich aber nicht auf seine F\u00e4higkeiten und Verbesserungen verlassen, denn es gibt optionale Felder bei denen man diese nicht mit ins Level nimmt. Dort kommt es allein auf die Strategie und das Timing an, und diese sind meiner Meinung nach brutal schwer und ich habe schon so einige z\u00e4hneknirschende Stunden mit ihnen verbracht. Das ist aber nichts im Vergleich zu dem Triumph, die Nuss endlich geknackt zu haben!\n\nDer Preis von 10\u20ac ist es auf jeden Fall Wert, dieses Schmuckst\u00fcck in seiner Bibliothek zu haben und sich hin und wieder dran zu setzen. Es ist toll sich an einem verregneten Tag zu einem guten H\u00f6rbuch und einer Tasse Tee vor dieses Spiel zu setzen und ein paar Stunden lang auf Monster zu schie\u00dfen. Da ich selbst kein gro\u00dfer Fan von expliziter Gewalt bin gef\u00e4llt mir das Design gut, das die d\u00fcstere Stimmung perfekt r\u00fcberbringt, ohne auf realistische Gewalt zur\u00fcckgreifen zu m\u00fcssen. \n\nEin perfektes Spiel f\u00fcr zwischendurch wegen des leicht zu verstehenden Systems und des frei verstellbaren Schwierigkeitsgrades und f\u00fcr die ganz harten mit beinahe unm\u00f6glichen Schwierigkeiten und Endlosmodus f\u00fcr jedes Level, nachdem man es geschafft hat (dabei werden die Wellen immer st\u00e4rker, aber man kann weiter XP farmen).

Your aim is to defend your main base with gems from waves of enemies. There are nine types of gems like critical hit gem, poison gem, etc and you can combine your gems. To use these gems, first of all you need to make a tower. All of these costs mana and you gain mana from slaying beasts.\n\nGameplay is also fun, if you don\u2019t want to wait that much at a level, you can press the 3x speed button. Also, if you count on your defense, you can spawn other waves of enemies at once.\n\nLevel designs are good, so you never get bored and feel like you\u2019re playing the same thing over and over again. Moreover, there is a skill system where you can spend your points gained from leveling up.\n\nAll in all, i think it\u2019s a must-buy if you love Tower Defense games.

The longer you play it the more rewarding a single game becomes. Like the previous flash games you start pretty small, and work your way to higher power. Once you're in the level 2,000+ range you probably have a pretty good strategy down. \nVision fields are going to challange you, ecspecially if you don't use a guide. I'm still struggling to figure out how to beat some of them. \nIf anyone is interested in playing this game, I highly recommend you check out GemCombiner, which is 3rd party. The way the number system in the game works, you can exploit how the gem combinations result. (Better combinations = better damage and effects.) It's not something you couldn't do on your own, but the software automatically combines up to thousands of gems for you without any effort. \nI started using the combiner about 1/4 of the way through the game, and it improved my experience by a landslide. \n\nAll in all, the game is terrific as far as tower defense games go, probably the very pinnacle of tower defense. \nAgain, it starts a little slow, but once you have put some hours in it will pay off!", "timestamp_created": 1500038564, "timestamp_updated": 1500038564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33526831": {"recommendationid": "33526831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056132080", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508119844}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyable, typical tower defence game with a few twists.", "timestamp_created": 1500000469, "timestamp_updated": 1500000469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33492562": {"recommendationid": "33492562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074261605", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482869012}, "language": "english", "review": "The absolute tower defense.", "timestamp_created": 1499907943, "timestamp_updated": 1499907943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33487889": {"recommendationid": "33487889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134431469", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510086358}, "language": "english", "review": "As a long-time fan of tower defense games (and a fan of the original GemCraft), I really love this game.

Like, yeah, technically it is, but...\nIf anything, it's in many regards way more similar to old RPGs like Diablo where you'd set up skill points, gear, sockets, loot, and all of that stuff in order to kick ass and do a bunch of crazy stuff like chain hits that freeze enemies and leech mana while doing crit damage and whatever the hell.\nEverything is put together very cleverly and in a way that lets the player experiment to their heart's content instead of limiting them with garbage caps and artificial difficulty. (Many skills have unlimited level caps, they just increase the point cost per level to balance it out)\nI used to play the browser version but now I can finally play the Steam version to let everyone know I'm busy jerking off.\n\nBiggest pro: Lets you get away with hilarious game-breaking combos if you're smart enough and try a lot of things. I've gotten to a point where enemies have broken numbers of hit points IE: 2.7781+e15 and I still one-shot them. (That eventually comes to bite you in the ass in endurance mode anyway so I guess it isn't that game-breaking)\n\nBiggest con: Very VERY grindy. You technically have to do every field 3 times (there's hundreds of them) if you want to get your hands on every skillpoint you can get from them.

Basicly speaking all you have to do is to attach the gems you're given for each stage into towers and traps and their effect varies depending of the gem level, type and where you use it and how you use it. Also, the game offers you a way to increase the challenge in the way you seems fit for you game style with a risk/reward system that can be activated before the stage or during it as the waves of enemies comes in (by calling more waves at once or empowering each wave with the cost of a gem used as a bomb). As you become more powerful and earns the ability to build new towers and traps, you'll feel the urge to try to get a higher score on a previous map or how long you can last during an endurance run.

Gemcraft - CS is based on the original Flash game (haven't played it at time of writing, but I should get around to it sooner or late). I've played a lot of Flash tower defense games, but Gemcraft is very unique, for many reasons:\n\n[b]Gameplay & Mechanics:[/b] Is similar to other top-down TD games, in which your sole objective is to defend your base (in this case, your Orb) from hordes of enemies. You do this by placing gems into towers and traps. It's a simple premise, but the game incorporates so many elements that complicate matters. Every gem type has a different special effect, and many factors, such as the shape of the field, the gems you have available (you don't unlock all the gems for use on every map until later in the game), and the skills/abilities you have, just to name a few. You can also speed up time, which is very useful as things WILL get slow at times, or pause time entirely while you make decisions. This sounds broken, but I assure you, it isn't. You can even play in Iron Wizard mode, which disables most of the extra bonuses and makes the game more like a typical TD experience, with the difficulty being thrown at you head-on. Much of the game is the player investing more in their talisman bonuses and skill points to challenge more difficult maps and make more progress in endurance runs.\n\n[b]Sound:[/b] Nothing too fancy, the music is ambient and fits the mood of the game, while the sounds do what they need to. Nothing I'd mind if they were muted, but not bad.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] Same as the Sound department. Not bad at all, and the gems are pretty to look at, but nothing incredibly fancy. It looks exactly like a Flash game.\n\n[b]Performance:[/b] The game runs very well overall, but there can be significant lag due to all the enemies and effects on the screen if you progress far enough in waves. A lot of people complain about this, but this is a very common, and often unavoidable problem in games. I have seen a couple of apparent fixes for this, but have yet to try them. However, it shouldn't be too hard to run this game decently.\n\n[b]Replayability:[/b] When the store page tells you that this game has an emphasis on strategy and replayability, it is [i]not[/i] lying to you. There are dozens of maps to play and as you level up and discover new strategies, you can replay stages you've beaten to gain more XP and go for rarer talisman fragments to further power up, and you decide how much harder to make your endurance runs. All this adds to many hours of replaying, which makes the game grindy, but to me it rarely feels like just a monotonous grind because I enjoy seeing how much stronger I've become since the last time I played a particular map, and regardless if it is a new map or not, it's fun to me. In addition, there are hundreds of achivements, and while some are freebies, the majority require at least a bit of skill to obtain. Your level can soar into the thousands and there is a lot of complicated math with the game's inner workings, for those who like solving that stuff (too intimidating for me). There is a lot to do in this game for dedicated TD fans, but more casual players may prefer a simpler experience.\n\nI love this game, and out of all the TD games I've played, this is one of the most unique I've played. If you're a longtime fan of the genre, you should give it a chance. You likely won't be disappointed.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n\n- Simple gameplay at its core\n\n- Many ways to customize your abilities and challenge level\n\n- Many, many maps and achievements, offering immense replayability for a TD game; the desire to keep earning things can become addicting\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n\n- The many facets of micro-managing various gameplay elements may turn off those looking for a simpler experience\n\n- This game is inherently grindy, especially with the randomization of talisman fragment drops and certain enemies that may or may not appear in a given run, so people who are bothered by grinding in games should probably stay away\n\n- Some people like an immediate challenge, but this game is only as hard as you make it, which some may not prefer", "timestamp_created": 1491863994, "timestamp_updated": 1491864229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671034", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31028315": {"recommendationid": "31028315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302852132", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494620101}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito bom tower defense, da pra jogar em mapas simultaneos mas tambem e possivel jogar no modo endurance onde, em um so mapa infinitas ondas tem que ser derrotadas. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1491692575, "timestamp_updated": 1491692575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31025167": {"recommendationid": "31025167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080367123", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505676010}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito bom, viciante e otimo level design", "timestamp_created": 1491680753, "timestamp_updated": 1491680753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30938909": {"recommendationid": "30938909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017635851", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506845428}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, tower defense at its best.

After a while you start receiving upgradable gemstones for your talisman that give you passive bonuses. They might be x% damage to a specific enemy type, faster tower reload rate, more mana, slower killchain decrease rate etc. That alone lets you build a \"character\" for a specific playstyle. \nBut wait, there's more!\nWe have skills that also give passive bonuses, different tower types of course and combination of those tower types. You can either build a \"pure\" tower with one element, or a combination of 2 or more different types. So far i've been in levels that offered me 6 different types at the same time, and i could make a combination of all of them in the same tower. It costs a lot though! In addition to towers we have traps that are built on the ground for bad guys to walk over. Like towers, they can be equipped with one element, or a combination. We also have spells that give special attacks to your towers or traps. \n\nThere are a lot of levels. Some of them are pure classic tower defense, some feature additional objectives like destroying a certain targets before the last wave, either by simply shooting them with your towers or using some specific spell/level gem to bomb them with. The design seemed first very linear, but after a while they started opening up, and we can build proper mazes on many levels! That's the most fun part of TD game in my eyes, and not many TD games offer us that, for some strange reason. After the waves you can start Endurance mode for more exp, enemies and talisman stones! If you want more challenge on the levels, you unlock battle traits when progressing in the game. They increase the exp in addition to the difficulty.\n\nI haven't experienced a single bug, everything runs smooth.\n\n[b] Shuold you buy it?[/b]\n\nYES!

Every single part of the game is smoothly intertwined with others. Leveling gives you skill points, which tweak your gems and spells, which define your towers and play style. All of this is impacted by fragments, allowing you to further tweak your build and play style. Even getting achievements is tied into the game by giving you skill points!\n\nEven with everything I've said, so much was left uncovered. This game is crazy with content, all of which is fantastic. It even has an interesting story! This is not your usual tower defense game. It's the pinnacle of the genre. If you don't play this game, you are doing yourself a tremendous disservice. \n\nBuy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1488460445, "timestamp_updated": 1488460445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Playing these games made Kingdom Rush and similar look so boring and dumb that I never even bothered with them.\n\nGemCraft plays differently than other TDs. It starts out painfully easy, but as the game goes on you unlock various ways to make the game harder for yourself, increasing both difficulty and rewards. Endurance mode is the epitome of all this; most \"infinite\" modes are just that, infinite. GemCraft's ends at 999, and it's no cakewalk.\n\nHere's generally how the game goes, from what I can tell:\n- Early-game: Playing maps on easy, playing with difficulty as you unlock it, gaining skills/power\n- Mid-game: Finishing up the remaining maps, going back to earlier maps and overloading them with difficulty modifiers to get lots of XP, completing challenge cheevos\n- Late-game: Endurance runs\n- Post-game: Trying to beat your high score on that max difficulty endurance run\n\nSince GemCraft ends up being quite a different experience, I recommend playing this and its earlier titles online first (but not the first one, it's not as good). You can find them on Armor Games or Kongregate.\n\nAlso, Mac or Linux users: just because this game is Windows-only doesn't mean you can't play it! Just run Steam inside of Wine, install the game, and you should be good to go! (Disclaimer: Not all games work that well with Wine. This one just happens to be one of the good ones.

There _are_ higher difficulty options, but you have to _unlock_ them through grinding for countless, boring hours. \n- The active-pause doesn't make this better. Using active-pause in a tower defense is just breaking the game. \n- The leveling up is ridiculous. Not only do you get xp for things like \"Select an enemy\" or \"Place a wall\", i.e. just for _anything_, but almost all skills are just passive boons not altering the gameplay in any way. \n- Also, while there are many different types of gems, their effects don't differ _that_ much actually. It really doesn't matter if you do extra damage by having a chance of \"critical hit\" or a chance of \"chain hit\". \n- While combining the gems does stack effects in synergistic ways, those synergies are ways too obvious, making everything even more simple. \n\nSo, if you want an epic time sink and some _very_ shallow sence of achievement, or are just a die-hard fan of the genre, you might have fun with gemcraft.

You play as a sorcerer who uses magical gems to protect his \"orb of presence\" (the command centre or flag, if you will) from waves of monsters. This Fantasy theme was what made me buy this game in the first place, and I did not regret it.\n\nIn comparison to other TD games I have played, the gems used in towers and traps have a particularly wide variety of effects, including but not limited to single target or multiple target damage, damage over time, slowing down, armor piercing, mana leeching (mana is the currency you spend for more gems, gem upgrades and buildings, and at the same time, it serves as the \"health bar\" of your orb - a connection with major tactical consequences) ... you can also apply special effects like freezing enemies in an area of effect or adding bolts to do higher damage where the battle situation makes it necessary. \n\nThe monsters only come in a few different shapes and sizes, but the occasional attacks of flying gem thieves who can easily destroy your main front create exciting situations anyway. As there are so many things going on, I had no time to get bored of the attackers, and even if this would have been the case: The developer offers you the option to change the speed of time flow and even pause, a player service well-appreciated.\n\nThe single levels, connected by an expanding map that offers you some freedom of strategical choice where to attack next, not only display the usual patterns of roads, building ground, pre-made buildings and so on, but also loot chests, mana pools, destructable monster nests and many other special features that help to avoid repetitivity. \n\nScrolls, relics and crafting materials you loot on those battlegrounds are used to improve your character, give you new buffs and spells and thereby the power to master difficult challenges on the map in which you were defeated in your first attempt - which makes the final victory even sweeter. \n\nTalking about accomplishments: Apart from being an entertaining and surprisingly deep TD game, this is a real achievement factory. You get those for every single little step and discovery, and as there are many (see above), you are practically showered in them. I think I received around 80 in the first five hours of gameplay (more than Skyrim has in total!), and there are more than 400 to earn here. If you are on a hunt for Steam achievements, go and get this title!\n\nGraphics and sound are functional, they add some nice details to the whole experience, but the dynamic gameplay is definitely the major strength of this product.

It was on a 80% off sale s\nit piqued my interest and as several of my friends had it I gave it a shot. I give this\ngame a 10/10 for its design, polish and addictive gameplay and would dare to say its\nworth even full prize.\n\n\nCONTENT\nI spent several hours already and even tho its always the same (protect your orb and \nkill off any critters before they can reach you) theres a ton of diversity in form of \ngems, skills, map types, special challenges, tasks etc etc. I didnt yet uncover the \nwhole map or unlock every skill or tower or gem but so far I m busy whenever I find \nthe time to log in. It shows that this game isnt \"new\" as it got additional content \nen masse over time and being faced with all of it now is kinda overwhelming but also \nvery exciting as I realize I ll play this for a looooooooooong time.\n\nTHE GOAL\nYou ll be thrown into a maze with 1 orb at the end and 1 or multiple entries for \ncritters. Sometimes the map also has Monster spawners in them including even more \ncritters per wave. Each map has a pre-defined number of waves coming at you and \nalso pre-determined critter strenghts. Each passing second will contribute you with \nmana, killing a critter adds yet more mana and of course there are other means to \ntap mana (environmental, gems, shrines). You use that mana in order to build stuff, \ncreate gems or upgrade existing gems. You can also just let it collect which enables \nyou to increase your \"mana level\" representing your \"interest\" known from other games. \nBasically the more interest you can accumulate the higher the bonuses you ll get so \nthe game \"taunts\" you with trying to beat the map with the least necessary tools \nforcing you to keep trying new combinations in order to maximize your result.\n\nTOWERS\nI call em towers but in reality these only represent the bases of your mazes (hey, \nthat rhymed). Things like a tower foundation or trap foundation or booster \nfoundations. All of these dont do anything on their own but require gems placed into \nthem in order to damage critters.\n\nGEMS\nThere is a whole list of different gems with different attributes. Some damage, others \ndebuff or buff. You dont have access to all of them at all times. The map you play \ndecides which gem types are available to you. Gems can be placed or upgraded as PURE \nwhich means their attribute is especially strong or you can combine different colors \nof gems in order to combine their attributes. This means that both attributes become \nweaker then in a pure gem but the obvious advantage is that you now use 2 attributes \nat the same time. You can combine as many as 4 different colors in a single gem. \nUsing multi-colored gems will increase their upgrade cost as well. Theres a whole \nsegment of theory crafting behind the combination of gems. I didnt get all of it yet \nbut I realize it supports rather INSANE combos which enables you to push  your results \ninto incredible heights.\n\nSKILLS and TALISMANS\nThese represent a kind of progression curve for you. Skill points are mostly dependant \non your level (each level grants you a certain number of points and also certain feats \nand tasks in the game do the same) and let you \"purchase\" bonuses in certain areas. \nMaybe you d like to get more mana per kill or make certain types of gems stronger? \nThere are 25 skills to chose from and each one can be upgraded \"unknown\" times (my \nhighest so far is 15 and I dont think it ends there anytime soon). In addition unspent \nskill points increase your starting mana so again you are faced with hard decisions as \nbeing able to create and place strong gems before the first wave appears can represent \neasy-mode. You can reset your skills and redistribute your skills at any time allowing \nyou to micro-manage for specific maps.\n\nTalismans on the other hand are fueled by shadow cores and these are aquired by \ndefeating enemies in general and certain critter types. Before you can use shadow cores \nyou gonna need talismans and getting them is kind of a lottery thing. Theres a whole \nlist of different types at different rarities. You have a \"wheel\" of amulettes enabling \nyou to place a finite amount of them so replacing or keeping them in stock is a good \nidea later on once you start to \"optimize\" your amulets for the maps you run. The ones \nI used so far only have minor bonuses (up to +9% on certain things) but I havent found \nany higher rarity ones yet. You can use your shadow cores to boost the rarity chance of \nany talismans as well.\n\n\nMAPS\nMaps are unique in design and each one of them has a specific list of gems it allows to\nuse. That doesnt mean you have access to all of them at the start as certain gem types \nneed to be unlocked first before you can use them.\"Mazing\" is a critical thing inside \nmaps which you accomplish by placing walls in a pattern to force critters to take a \nlonger route or come by certain spots multiple times in order to increase your possible \nkill time or make your placed gems more valuable (by being able to attack passing matters \nmore then once with the same gem). Many maps also have structures or other specials \nwhich represent additional challenges. This could be mana wells, monster dens, shrines, \nspectres and (probably) many more (those are the only ones I had so far).\n\nENDGAME\nI m still busy unlocking stuff so probably havent seen half of everything but I spotted \nthe \"Endurance mode\" already which is activatable whenever you beat a map and represents \n\"open mode\". Probably not \"open\" as they have a finite number of waves but the ones I \nsampled so far ramp up so quickly in difficulty that I gonna need a lot more levels, \nskills and resources in general to get em done. I read that some of them require \n\"multiple hours\" to complete so looking forward to the fun. At the moment my wizard is \nto weak and cannot beat more then a couple waves in endurance mode before he gets overrun.\n\nThere are not really any \"hard limits\" on stuff like in other TD games where you can upgrade \nyour towers a finite number of times before you reach the \"max\". I ve seen videos with \nincredible gem levels, wizard levels and overall numbers shown on the screen rivaling a T13\nrift run in Diablo3 (sorry). None of these can be reached with simply beating a map. You \ngonna need certain wizard levels, certain skill levels, certaon talisman set-ups and \ncertain gem combinations in order to unlock them. Its the carrot which pushes you even \nfurther. I know I ll be there eventually myself but first I need to unlock all the required \nskills, farm more shadow cores, get more skill points etc etc in order to be prepared.\n\n\n\nYou dont start a new map completely at zero. All the shadow cores, skill points, skills \nand talismans you aquire beforehand are at your disposal and stay with you in between \nmaps making your wizard stronger the longer and more you play. I love this \"nurturing\" \nof a character of mine and seeing myself become stronger over time\n\nAnother strong point for the game is that unlike other TD games you can use multiple \nstrategies to beat a map. There are certain set-ups which allow you optimal results and \nthese get fine-tuned all the time by hard-core players going after the elusive high-score \n(each map saves your highest score as a taunt for you to beat) but you have a lot more leeway \nto beat maps \"regulary\" giving you a lot of freedom and choice.\n\n\nUNKNOWN STUFF\nI stumbled across things like a \"compass\" which I can manipulate but dont have a clue what\nto do with yet. Combining stuff also is obvious at first but there are detals to it that\nwill be hidden to you until you start to experiment around. I havent seen half the maps yet \nbut many hold extra challenges which force you to think about what you do and WHEN to do it.\nThe game seems to evolve constantly and doesnt remain static. It fascinates me and hours keep \ngoing by at an alarming rate. \n\nI dont regret buying this game and recommend it 100%", "timestamp_created": 1483128518, "timestamp_updated": 1483128518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505586", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28767677": {"recommendationid": "28767677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058211283", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505166520}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Bu g\u00fczel oyun neden ilgi g\u00f6rmez merak ediyorum do\u011frusu?", "timestamp_created": 1482961771, "timestamp_updated": 1482961771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28746410": {"recommendationid": "28746410", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999538321", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1515617632}, "language": "polish", "review": "Niesamowity po\u017ceracz czasu ;)", "timestamp_created": 1482920414, "timestamp_updated": 1482920414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28724048": {"recommendationid": "28724048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171251965", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482028630}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those games I find it hard to recommend to many people. However for a Tower Defense game, GemCraft - Chasing Shadows is pretty great.\n\nI won't be discussing the plot of the series, but I will say there are four games in the series so far. The first three being flash games: Chapter One: The Forgotten, Chapter Zero: The Gem of Eternity, Lost Chapter: Labyrinth, and finally Chapter 2: Chasing Shadows.\n\nThe gameplay is very much of what you expect of a Tower Defense game. Place some towers, set up defenses, and don't let the monsters get to your base. However it isn't bright and colorful in this world. Everything is grim, dark, and depressing. After all, the world is much of a wasteland with those monsters around.\n\nYour main line of defense is gems. Yes, gems. These are your \"defense units\" of the game. There are a total of 9 colors of gems in the game, each with their unqiue own effects (note that Lime from Labyrinth is removed and White and Black are added).\n\nBesides being able to build towers, you are able to build walls, amplifiers (which are towers that power other towers..but they need a gem equipped to be used), and traps (which focus on effects more than damage).\n\n..I'd go on to cover the rest of the gameplay, but I'd run out of space by the time I do so. Plus there's an in-game tutorial feature that helps you learn over time about almost everything gameplay wise.\n\nThe presentation as I said before is dark and depressing. However I did not mention how..enchanting the music is. It's hard to explain, but there's just something about the soundtrack that I really enjoy. While we're talking about presentation, the game obviously looks better than the first three games due to it not being limited as a flash game this time around. Heck, I can say it runs better as well.\n\n\nOverall, I do enjoy GemCraft - Chasing Shadows. Now there's one thing I lacked to mention. The game is [b]very[/b] grind heavy. You'll end up grinding and backtracking to various levels to level up, just to be able to take on new levels, or possibly just to unlock something you missed before such as a Skill Tome or Battle Trait. There is also the overabundance of achievements, 419 to be specific. Most of which are simple, but eventually it will be difficult or possibly time wasting. There is also the \"Iron Wizard\" mode that can be unlocked. Meaning, you guessed it, this grind heavy game just got harder. Also there's a single achievement tied to it. \"Good luck.\"\n\nIf you're a \"Completionist\" or happen to be a casual player, you're better off turning back now as this is a long game. A [i]very[/i] long game. However if you're looking for something to spend your time on, and don't mind the repetitive grinding, I may as well recommend this game to ya.

This game is a must-have for any tower defense enthusiasts, and even if you don't play tower defense, I highly recommend you give it a try :)", "timestamp_created": 1482803959, "timestamp_updated": 1482803959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28679761": {"recommendationid": "28679761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030758514", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 43634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511724287}, "language": "dutch", "review": "FUN! addictive", "timestamp_created": 1482773734, "timestamp_updated": 1482773734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28668328": {"recommendationid": "28668328", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991399313", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "last_played": 1515374951}, "language": "german", "review": "GemCraft habe ich vor Jahren schon auf Armorgames gespielt.

The first few maps were a breeze, then I got to this one, and it has stopped everything I've tried about 40 times...  It even seems to be getting more difficult, for some reason.  I have literally no idea how to progress past this map, other than grinding the passive benefits and such, which I find to be a bit odd, since I normally expect these kinds of games to revolve around just strategy.  Well, as I have made it pretty far a couple of time, but for whatever reason, (even when duplicating the build order that was successful) I cannot get further than the third wave now, which makes absolutely no sense at all.  It is literally as if the map got harder between tries.\n\nI'm going to keep pounding away at it, and I'll update my review as I hopefully progress further in the game and can provide more helpful feedback.

I got h this one on sale, let it sit for a bit, and then decided to check it out. And... I am glad I did. Yeah, I know. I don't have a ton of time in. Yet. That will change, \n\nPros:\n[list][*]Singleplayer. No a-holes coming in and destroying your defenses just for sheets and giggles. It's all on you, you vs. the AI. I like that. Idiot griefers in MP TD games in the past are why I stopped playing. Not having to deal with them here is a HUGE plus. [*]Not \"easy\". It is easy to pick up, but  can already tell in my short playtime, that it will not be easy to master. You need good strategy and planning, even early on. [*]Interersting story to the game. Reading the pages as you unlock them adds a nice element. [*] Nice graphics and audio. Nothing spectacular, but nothing ugly either. It's bright enough and colorful enough to captivate, without being blinding with flashes and flying particles everywhere. The ambient sounds are realistic and not overwhemingly loud or distracting. [/list]\n\nCons:\n[list][*]Needs a little more of a Tutorial for new players, and those who are not familiar with Tower Defense games. But this is a minor thing, there is a Tutorial Booklet with all of the neccessary commands, it just does not explain to a first-timer how things work, and how they work together or against each other. Game is forgiving though- you can go back and replay any field until you get the hang of it. [*]May be a bit overpriced at full price ($10 USD), for what you are getting. [*]Steam Achievements- if you are hoping for a quick and easy 100% game, this isn't the game for you, lol! There are 400+ Achievements, and the global stats show that many of them take a ton of time and effort to get.  (But if you like challenging Achievements- this [b]IS[/b] a game for you!)

Suddenly everything happens in orders of magnitude.\n\nThe lag is the only downside really. It is a flash game originally, and at some point you start sending continuous waves of enemies with increased speed. This kills the fps. So playing an late-game endurance run is kind of a nerd thing.

And things to destroy. And special objectives to unlock skills and traits.\n\nJust 9 gem types but all the combinations are possible. And they do different things in towers, traps and amplifiers. And you can also use them as bombs. Or to enrage waves for more challenge.\n\nThe game is simplistic but never boring thanks to a lot of variation in what happens, what you need to do (apart from building towers), and what you can do.\n\nDozens of levels, very cool \"spell crafting\" mechanic, very customizable and rewarding difficulty system, hundreds of achievements (which give a bonus so you're motivated to get them). All the systems (looting, crafting, talisman, skills, environments, achievements, traits, gem bombs, enraging, towers/traps/amplifiers, flying ones, beacons...) everything is well designed and smart. And the game is still interesting even after you played hundreds of times because it's never the same thing twice, and by increasing the difficulty you are always challenged.\n\nI'm almost 400 hours into the game and I'm not done.

Looking at GemCraft's screenshots or even trailer, I've put it in \"No, thanks\" category. It looks like another generic, Adobe Flash based tower defence, and it's true. This painfully simple looking game has it's roots in flash, as it was released in web some time ago. What caught my attention were positive reviews of GemCraft. I bit the bullet and boy was I surprised!\n\nQuickly, you are enveloped in minimalistic but eerie and mystical atmosphere. Curious, slowly unfolding story and dark music made it complete. With that, you slowly get to know GemCrafts mechanics. As you progress, you'll be gradually realising how big of a game GemCraft is. Though gameplay rules aren't revolutionary, the amount of features is overwhelming.\n\nAs the title says, you'll be crafting gems to defend yourself from incoming waves of monsters. That's simple, right? You'll receive a massive amount of gems that have different roles and characteristics. You'll have basic attack towers, enhancement towers and traps which you can upgrade. That's still simple and familiar. Now, here's the thing - you're free to combine and mix gems you want. You want to have highly damaging tower that also freezes enemies? Or maybe you want it to also poison and lower armour grade? Sure you can. Everything combination you can think of is possible. It's the core of the game - not only you have to decide where to place the towers, what gems to choose, how much to upgrade them but also mix them just right from your own recipe.\n\nAnd it gets better. Looking at the map in between missions you'll see how gigantic it is. Even more so, you can shape missions just like a mix your gems. As you level up, gradually unlocked game modifiers can drastically transform the mission so much that your previous, perfect tactics become completely uselss. Many skills and mods offer a high reward at a price of high risk. That breaths a new life in levels that you would normally tick off as completed. As a cherry on top of the cake there are secrets that are cryptical enough to keep your curious.\n\nThat being said, GemCraft is a top notch tower defense game that despite poor initial impression will keep you playing for long. If you plan to highscore endurance levels, it will perhaps last a lifetime.\n\nFinal score : 8/10\n\nThe  good :\n\n- Ridiculous amount of gameplay\n- Great, dark atmosphere and music\n- Freedom to create your own tactics\n\n\nThe bad :\n\n- Somewhat basic graphics\n- It will devour your free time and ask for more", "timestamp_created": 1478177641, "timestamp_updated": 1478177641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26381320": {"recommendationid": "26381320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014677818", "num_games_owned": 637, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508472492}, "language": "english", "review": "Epic Tower Defense.

By the end of the game you are given nine seperate gem colors that all affect the battlefield in a diffferent way.  Along with this you are given traps, towers and amplifiers which all use the gems differently on the battlefield.  Combining the nine gem colors in different ways alters the way that the tower, trap or amplifier fight for you on the battlefield.\n\nThe skill system is a great way to boost your performance on a level to level base.  The great twist is that you have to complete levels throughout the game to unlock these skills and then decide how you want to spend your points.  They can affect anything.  From directly boosting all gem damage to allowing your amplifiers to increase attack, you get to decide what the best lay out is for your play style.\n\nAfter the first few tilesets, the maps really branch out in interesting and unique ways.\n\nThe campaign for this game lasts for quite some time.  You are offered several paths to go as you progress through the game, each allowing you to unlock more game features.  Even after you beat the game, there are three difficulties tied to each map.  On top of that you have the option of setting traits before each map starts to make the battle harder for you, but as a reward offering you more experience.  Additionaly once you beat the game, you can unlock iron wizard mode which is a fun challenge.\n\nOne of the best features of this game is the community.  There are several great guides out, and after you have progressed through the game on your own I encourage you to look at the great work in the community tab to help you further your progress within the game.\n\nThere are unfortunately a few negative things within GemCraft.  One of the biggest problems is not being able to save or macro gem combinations.  There are a couple external programs, that the truely devout use, but it would have been great for them to include a save mechanic in game for commonly crafted gems so you didn't always have to combine them by hand or use and external service.  DO NOT GET ME WRONG, this is in no way game breaking and does not affect someone who is just playing through the game the first time.  This is a grievance for end game play.\n\nLastly, one of the biggest let downs with GemCraft becomes the repetitveness of the actual game.  Once you understand the key fundamentals at all difficulties it is more or less a rinse and repeat.\n\nOverall, GemCraft is in my opinion the pinnacle of what a tower defense game should be.  This game should be an instant buy when on sale.

Can't really be that fun, right? \nWRONG!\n\nThis is a strangely addictive game. First couple of maps that one plays won't probably leave lasting impressions. The graphics are ok but nothing special, the storyline (there actually is one) isn't memorable and initially the tactics at the player's disposal are limited. You may even be tempted to put the game back in your (virtual) library shelves, but you'd make a BIG mistake.\n\nGive it a few rounds and you'll start unlocking skills and building up an amulet that can enhance specific traits. And your scores start to soar as you unlock more maps, So you start thinking: \"I'll give it just another go\" and then something new pops up.  Eventually you'll get stuck on a seemingly impossible level. But then you realise that if you go back to older maps and replay them with the newly acquired skills your old score will multiply unlocking even more skills.\nAnd that's when you get really hooked! \n\nYou play a wizard committed on stopping a demon called \"The Forgotten\" that will summon hordes of monsters on each map level hurling them at you. Basically it's a matter of constructing \"choke points\" manned by towers and traps to obliterate ever-larger waves of fiends preventing them to overwhelm your \"Orb of Presence\". Towers and traps are powered by gems. Gems can be combined to achieve powerful combos, or used as \"pure\" (convinient if high on the \"Pure Colours\" skill), On completing maps players will acquire skill points that can be spent to get more powerful levels of particular skills as well as amulet fragments. Skills need to be unlocked by acquiring the relevant wizard skill tome in some maps, a sub-objective of the main objective of staying alive as long as possible. Invariably you will eventually be overwhelmed on each map, but the challenge is to push that boundary a little further each time, unlock new skills and try new tactics.\n\nSkill points can be reassigned at the beginning of each map so you are not stuck with a bad choice of skills and this encourages the player to experiment.

I have persevered with this game for a long time (years in fact), coming back to it several times since I purchased it, but ive come to the conclusion that its just not that enthtalling and I often find myself looking for alternatives.\n\nAs good as previous episodes of Gemcraft were, this is WAAAAAAAAYYYYY too micro management intensive and has an almost impenetrably dense damage calculation system that you have to learn if you want to progress in the game.  its a bit like learning to speak a foriegn language just to ask for a sandwich.  Once you have learned it, you realise very quickly that 80% of the game engine is pointless fluff and you just need 3/4 colours of gems to do anything in this game.  \n\nAlso, I think for any new player, be aware that there are far too many eliteist players on forums not willing to help new players and have turned this game (and i fear the entire series) into a complete waste of time.  Gemcraft: Labyrinth was amazing, but the micromanagement changes to this game leave you cold.  \n\nThe graphics and sound are amazing and epic and set the mood nicely, and the narrative story is enthralling, but as soon as you get to the point of completing the single player campaign, it soon becomes a repetitive grind/slog through endless and unbeatable endurance runs to increase your level to the point that you have enough skill points to actually stand a chance to get past level 400. \n As much as the online guides are good, the fact that someone has made a guide that calculated damage output to such detail fills me with a deflated sense of \"why am I playing this?\".  What first seems to be endless fun becomes an endless drag.  \n\nQuite simply, after the initial enthrallment of this game, the boring endless annoyance sets in and you ask yourself why you are bothering.  If playing 45+hour levels are acceptable to you, may I suggest as an alternative that you turn the computer off and go outside?.  Theres a whole life out there that youre missing out on.  Life is too short for the level of dedication you require to just complete ONE LEVEL OF THIS BLOATED GAME, let along progress to the point where you can clear 999 waves of monsters consistantly.  \n\nAnd thats before we get to the lag..... OMG YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A GAME LAG LIKE THIS!!!!  this should be the defacto standard of playing games.  If your system can handle an endurance run without lagging, its good.  if not, dont bother!\n\nIve played this game many times, completed the single player campaign, completed all fields on every difficulty with every trait enabled... completed all the vision fields and I am currently level 2764..., but I am still nowhere near completing a single endurance run on this, and that is why this game fails.  buy it because its cheap... lament at the stupid comments on forums and the unplayable endurance mode", "timestamp_created": 1471706731, "timestamp_updated": 1506383907, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24970493": {"recommendationid": "24970493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186471975", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 2877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479339012}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is\nF =  is friends that do stuff together\nU =  is for you and me\nN =  is for anywhere at anytime at all, here in the deep blue sea.", "timestamp_created": 1471427812, "timestamp_updated": 1471427812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24904076": {"recommendationid": "24904076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044218150", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483840847}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game to pass some time at.", "timestamp_created": 1471153316, "timestamp_updated": 1471153316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24899110": {"recommendationid": "24899110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031986513", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470699853}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best Tower Defence games I've ever played.

I had a good time playing through it and all the following gemcraft games after that. After Labyrinth, I rarely looked up news about possible new sequel over 3-4 years until I found out that it would be available to buy on steam or playable on Armorgames again. I was happy, but I had other games to play and decided to wait for a steam release along with a discount.\n\nThen one day, a new killer bundle comes up from Bundle Stars and I take a look at it - Chasing Shadows is right there, so I decide to buy. At this time I was still playing other games, so I didn't install it until a few days ago.\n\nThe game is very fun and rewarding as there is a lot of variety! You can use various abilities on enemies, drop bombs on enemies and waves, place many kinds of towers, combine towers to upgrade them, add various rules that increase your exp gain, craft items and upgrade those items for various benefits all at your own pace (you can press space to pause wave and do whatever as long as you have the spell charges and mana for it). There is a big amount of achievements too. \n\nI've failed some stages because of bombing waves too much, but it hasn't frustrated me. You can restart the stage after learning from your mistakes and use 9x speed to get back to where you lost rather quickly.\n\nIf you like getting achievements and playing tower defense games, I would recommend to buy this game.\n\n10/10 (might edit this more later..)", "timestamp_created": 1469538181, "timestamp_updated": 1471808399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24527667": {"recommendationid": "24527667", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995566759", "num_games_owned": 728, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 2301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465519343}, "language": "french", "review": "Gemcraft est un bon jeu pour faire passer le temps apr\u00e8s le travail ou quand il pleut.

Chasing Shadows is the latest game in the Gemcraft series, which have appeared on flash sites before this; they have an ongoing storyline, but it generally features you playing as a nameless wizard, fighting monsters using gems, as the title implies. Much like Kingdom Rush, Chasing Shadows is a paid version of the game with all the premium content unlocked.\n\nChasing Shadows is considered the second chapter of the game, and has apparently been in development since 2011. It certainly shows, as the game has a great deal of polish, and also looks quite nice considering it's a flash game. You play as an unnamed wizard who has just recovered from being possessed by a demon known as the Forgotten, which happened at the end of Chapter 1. Now free from your body, she aims to invade the Spiritforge, a citadel where the other wizards of the world are hiding out. From his old tower, your wizard aims to trap her before she can do this, which entails projecting himself into the lands ahead to free them of monsters and gather strength.\n\nYou have quite a bit of freedom in Chasing Shadows. The game uses sort of a grid system, and you can build a tower anywhere there's four spaces free. You power them by slotting in gems, from a set selection in each level, although at some later point it seems you do unlock the ability to use types of them whenever you want. There's no real 'base' gem, as all of them have some special power, from a chance to hit multiple enemies, to poison, to stealing mana (the main resource of the game). You can also combine them, creating a tower that does multiple things at once. Not long in the game, you unlock traps, which make the gems deal far less damage but amplify their effects. Much later, there are also amplifiers, which buff adjacent towers and traps. Finally there are walls, which divert enemy paths. This all comes together to give you a lot of freedom with how you approach levels.\n\nEach gem has twelve ranks to it, which require increasingly large amounts of mana to create. This ties into the game's level-up system, where you gain more base mana every level, with an additional amount for the skill points you've accrued (three every level, plus a certain amount for each of the game's many, -many- achievements) but haven't invested. It feels like a game meant to appeal to gamers that like watching their numbers get bigger and bigger, not unlike Disgaea. And much like that series, Chasing Shadows gives you a lot of shortcuts to grinding, since the game allows - dares, really - you to play chicken with it at every turn.\n\nOther Tower Defense games let you call a wave early for bonuses. Chasing Shadows does that too, but also allows you to call multiple waves at once, including a specific key combination for calling every single wave still remaining to come charging in at once. Before that, you can drop gem bombs on the markers indicating them, causing more of them to spawn and tougher. Throughout the game you also acquire Battle Trait scrolls, which you can set at a level from one to nine before a level, spawning an extra wave for each and giving the enemy certain bonuses, but also increasing your total experience dramatically if you're daring enough. Since the first difficulty isn't very taxing while playing normally, this can spice up your experience a lot.\n\nThere are quite a few levels in Chasing Shadows, but it tries its best to keep things from being boring, and most of them tend to have some set-pieces about them. This ranges from simple things like abandoned buildings or chests you can blow open for minor rewards, to ones that seriously affect a given level, such as Tome Chambers, which unlock a skill for you provided you kill a certain amount of enemies in its range, or Wizard Towers, which unlock further sections of the map if you break all the locks around them - and you should, since they'll fail the level for you if you don't.\n\nCompared to the other games I've covered, this one has a more solitary feel to it; there's no real music, and not too many sound effects, so if you want a game to chill out with while you're listening to something you won't be missing out on much. And if you want a lot of bang for your buck or a game that has a lot of avenues for improvement, it can offer that too.

Monsters go for your orb and you have to murder them before they reach it. \n\nThe game is like the title says, based on gems, you can place gems in towers where they'll shoot enemies, or in traps where they'll damage those who walk on them. You can also use them as bombs, use them to boost your tower, to protect your orb, you can sacrifice them to shrines or you can expend them to make your enemies stronger. In fact, you can do pretty much anything with your gems.\n\n[h1] Customization options are near infinite. [/h1]\n\nThere are 9 base colors, each of them have a different side effect, you can upgrade, combine, destroy, level up your gems in any possible combination.\n\nYou can build your own structures, towers, traps, mazes, depending on the geography of the level.\n\nThere are a lot and a lot and a lot of levels. Enough to say you won't see the end of the game for a very long time.\n\nYou can customize your level of difficulty to the ultimate detail. There are 3 base levels to choose from, but after that you can add some random combination of traits, add a wave of this or a wave of that, boost the enemy armor or their speed etc... You can call down multiple waves at the same time during levels, Sacrifice gems to add more enemies and other weird stuff.\n\nFor adding difficulty you get more XP and drops as a reward. Those drops can be used to customize your Talisman, giving you a variety of skil bonuses. The XP you also use to customize your skills and boost certain gems or certain abilities.\n\nI'm not sure I have listed all the possibilities of customization for this game, in fact I'm not sure I have discovered them all.\n\n[h1] Choose your own adventure, kinda.\t[/h1]\n\nThe game isn't particularly hard, especially since you can pretty much pick your own difficulty, so if you wish you can also make it hard for yourself at your very leasure. It does take a lot of hours to reach the end and then you can replay everything to oblivion.  And there are also side challenges, where you can't pick the difficulty. Those range from easy-ish to beyond impossible. Honestly I have no idea how some of these challenge are even possible to be completed. I just fail horribly 10 times then I move on. Thankfully they're all optional.\n\n[h1] Millions of achievements.\t[/h1]\n\nAnd then there are achievements. So many of them. Hundreds! Millions! Probably a quarter of all my Steam achievements come from this game. They aren't hard to get, they just take a little grinding and sometimes an interesting challenge, so they're a nice +. If you want to boost your number of steam achievments then this is the game for you.\n\nSo all in all, there are just so many things to do with this game... but yet in terms of content it doesn't change that much. The levels get a bit same-ish. The waves keep coming and coming and coming and coming and coming.\n\n[h1] Like a Potato.\t[/h1]\n\nYou can do so many things with this game, just like with potato. You can dice it, boil it, bake it, fry it. Turn it into crisps, croquettes and salad. You can have it with Ketchup, mayo, hot sauce and combine all of the above until you realize in the end, it's still just the same old Potato and not much more.\n\nBut then, it's cheap and you can probably live off it for a very long time.", "timestamp_created": 1467743048, "timestamp_updated": 1467743521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481279", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24096504": {"recommendationid": "24096504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045051131", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491515039}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the web version of gemcraft labyrinth years ago.

That's how much enjoyment I've had with this game. It's a Tower Defense game with a story line, which is what initially attracted me to Gemcraft in the first place (been playing since the original back in 07). On top of that, it's a well executed game within the genre.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] The replayability has to be the biggest pro. I've beaten the game twice (once on Flash and once again on Steam, they didn't have a transfer at the time, I don't know if they ever got one), and I still play for high scores. The motivation to get further and further in endurance mode is very driving.\n[*] When playing through the game, there's over 150 different maps you can try. Some of them are homages to previous games (the epic battles and first levels mostly). And most of the maps are not simply reskinned versions of other maps. Each one has its challenges that make it harder.\n[*] The sound. Well done sounds should convey what is going on very quickly (everything is working, wait now nothing is dying wtf). But the music should be unnoticable. It should blend perfectly with the game, and this music does that. It works very well with the settings.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[*] The game has one set strategy for the end game. Basically the goal is to try and unlock mana, chain, bloodbound and crit gems and put them in traps. Then gem bomb the hell out of the end game. While the depths to the game actually give quite a bit of difficulty, once you know what you need to do it's very straight forward. My strategy has barely changed since I started running for high scores, regardless of map.\n[*] That's it, really just the one con.\n[/list]\n\nThis game is easily worth every cent.

And with better than 100 fields, it never gets old.\n\nGet this game if:  You are a tower defense fan, even a casual one; You enjoy puzzles and strategy; You like a lot of playtime for the dollar input.\n\nDo not get this if:  You need maximum use of your videocard; you dislike grinding to level up, even a little bit; You require roleplay elements in your game at all.", "timestamp_created": 1463463783, "timestamp_updated": 1463463783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22998835": {"recommendationid": "22998835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036837761", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478366502}, "language": "french", "review": "bon peutit jeu pour toute personne qui aime reflechir.\n\ncomme tout tower defence, il y a des limites, mais 50h de jeu pour se prix, c'est un bon ratio.", "timestamp_created": 1463316499, "timestamp_updated": 1463316499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22995823": {"recommendationid": "22995823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067212622", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481544884}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game if you have played the other GemCraft games and loved them.

Es realmente muy entretenido, y puede violar tu cerebro y tu barra de salud de una manera bastante salvaje. Sin invitarte a cenar ni nada, 10.000 monstruos te est\u00e1n dando rabo. Llevo jugando Tower Defense desde pr\u00e1cticamente toda mi vida, y es natural que despu\u00e9s de tantos a\u00f1os, tenga un preferido y un estilo que se asemeje a mis gustos.

surpresa achei o jogo maravilhoso, n\u00e3o conseguia parar de jogar, zerei com perfei\u00e7\u00e3o, dai comecei a procurar por outras vers\u00f5es e encontrei, zerei mais uma vez com perfei\u00e7\u00e3o.\nEnfim, zerei o:\nGemcraft Chapter 1 (The Forgotten)\nGemcraft Chapter 0 (Gem of Eternity)\nGemcraft Labyrinth\n\nDerrepente, anos depois me deparo com Gemcraft Chapter 2 (Chasing Shadows) na steam, nem pensei, tive de comprar e como sempre o jogo me surpreendeu e mais uma vez zerei com perfei\u00e7\u00e3o e agora na steam e realizando todas as proezas.\n\nResumindo: se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o conhece a franquia Gem Craft e gosta de um bom Tower Defense voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode deixar de jogar todos, te garanto, lhe rendera horas e horas de divers\u00e3o.\n\nPROEZAS

There are 9 types of gem in total: Mana Leech, Critical Hit, Chain Hit, Armor Tearing, Supressing, Poison, Slow, Poolbound and Bloodbound, each plays a different role in the defence. Combine gems with different components to have more than one special power, . Place your gems in a tower or a trap which defends in different ways, or might as well place them in a amplifier to strengthen other gems; they can also be used as bombs to kill monsters, enrage waves, heat a spark or strengthen your orb.\n\n[*]RPG mechanics\nReveal an epic story as you process. Unlock skills by opening tome chambers, unlock battle traits by unlocking wizard towers and gain talisman fragments to permanantly improve your play. Beat a level to gain XP, level up and spend skill points deliberately (although can be reset for free) Boost your gems using enhancement spells ---- Bolt, Beam and Barrage; weaken monsters by strike spells ---- Freeze, Curse and Wake of Eternity.\n\n[*]Difficulty scales variously\nThere are 3 difficulties and 9 battle traits. One can easily beat the game on lowest difficulty with no battle traits. However, with \"Hatred\" trait set to level 10, monsters have +1,000,000% more hit points and +7% wave hit point increment, it can be quite challanging. You can also enrage to have more and stronger monsters, in result more mana and XP. Frankly, it's a \"choose your own difficulty\" tower defence -- great for both casual and hardcore players.\n\n[*]Huge replay value\nReplay previous levels on higher difficulty with some battle traits for more XP. Move on to endurance and see how far you can go. You can even finish endurance with flawless skilz and patience, but it's far from easy ---- 999 waves and hit points grow exponentially (as far as I know, there's no one who can beat a Haunting Hatred 10 endurance :P) When you become skillful and confident, there's Iron Wizard mode waiting for you ---- No XP or level, finishing a field grants you 5 skill points. A pure skill test without grinding, which I found really challenging and time consuming.\n\n[*]Epic story\nThere are 4 games in Gemcraft series ---- \"Chapter 1: The Forgotten\", \"Chapter 0: Gem of Eternity\", \"Labyrinth\" and \"Chapter 2: Chasing Shadows\". Chapter 1 focuses on a young wizard sent to fight an evil wizard in the East, at the end he was astonished that the evil wizard was possessed by a creature known as \"The Forgotten\". Chapter 0 is a prequel about the release of The Forgotten by the evil wizard. Labyrinth tells a story about a gembearer crafting \"Gem of Eternity\", elaborating the only way to fight The Forgotten ---- \"We fight her desperately to no end... We do not know any way to kill her, only seal her away temporarily with the Gem of Eternity. But she always gets free after a few decades... After being forgotten...\" And in Chapter 2, we follow the young wizard racing to the Spiritforge to seal The Forgotten, but ends in a very dramatical way. We encountered a shadow in the Labyrinth as a boss, but soon figured out there are lots of them wandering outside, killing them directly weakens The Forgotten ---- and this is why it's called \"Chasing Shadows\".\n\n[*]Achievements\n419 achievements in total and finishing them actually gives you skill points in the game\n[/list]\n\nLast but not least, it's faily cheap even not on a sale\nBuy and you won't regret it", "timestamp_created": 1460124417, "timestamp_updated": 1460124569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620126", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22290123": {"recommendationid": "22290123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085768482", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512653284}, "language": "french", "review": "Petit passe temps agr\u00e9able, avec une bonne m\u00e9moire on prend plaisir \u00e0 relancer une petite partie de temps en temps!", "timestamp_created": 1460059397, "timestamp_updated": 1460059397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22278046": {"recommendationid": "22278046", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992117106", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460080436}, "language": "english", "review": "Best tower defence of all time, wish the others in the series would come to steam, there are at least 2 others, this being the most recent beats them in every way.", "timestamp_created": 1459992083, "timestamp_updated": 1459992083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22277956": {"recommendationid": "22277956", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960288733", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459993214}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best tower defence games that I have played.", "timestamp_created": 1459991484, "timestamp_updated": 1459991484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22275968": {"recommendationid": "22275968", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970684682", "num_games_owned": 740, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 8095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498899678}, "language": "english", "review": "I was introduced to GemCraft while it was a \"simple\" Flash-Game (the first one) a few years ago (damn i'm old) .

Gemcraft Labyrinth was perhaps equal to this one. I played the limited free flash versions. So I picked this up on a bargain and played with access to all the elements of the game, and it is nearly poorer than the limited version. And I am sad to give it a negative review. For these reasons:\nIt's strong suit is that you can scale the difficulty quite well by cranking up the challenge. However if you get good at it you end up with getting to big of a reward for this and with the added bonus you get from things the pay version it soon becomes to easy. You advance way too fast and nothing becomes more of a challenge than you make it and even that becomes hard after a while. By playing skilled through maybe a third of the stages you can easily just click \"send all\" on the rest of them and finish them in seconds, if you like.\nThe above would be fine if you could actually scale the challenge up, but can't because it lags really bad after a certain point. My rig isn't the best of rigs, but it plays worse than the web browser flash version. So at some point you start not play the best you can, but rather at how you can avoid lag. Which only works so far before that also more or less breaks down because even that becomes easy.\nThen it is the graphics itself, I kind of expected this to be scaleable so that it would render to any screen resolution. It doesn't, so if you go full screen (which increase lags) it is gets grainy and blurred.\n\nIf you have never played it and it is a bargain I can recommend it for the time you spend to learn it, which is enjoyable and less laggy. Also if you have played previous free versions and wanna throw Game in a Bottle a few coins. And maybe the iron wizard mode is enjoyable which cranks up the challenge by removing some of the things that made the series great.", "timestamp_created": 1457987475, "timestamp_updated": 1457987475,

Problems I have with the game include:\n\n- I played about 15 levels, none had an interesting level design, they all seemed very \"samey\". On a good TD game, I can remember the details of a level long after I finished it.\n\n- I only encountered two different monster types. I know there are more, but two types after 15 levels? Look at the gameplay video, almost all the levels shown in the video have the same few monster types.\n\n- You end up setting the difficulty of each level yourself. I don't mean that you chose, for example, normal or hard difficulty. There are no difficulty levels like that, at least not for quite a while. By default, the early levels are trivial to finish. You are suppose to hit waves of monsters with gem bombs before they launch to increase the difficulty.

Et maintenant j'y suis accro.\n\nComme dans tout tower-defense, on doit d\u00e9truire des vagues de monstres et les emp\u00eacher d'atteindre un certain point (ici, il s'agit d'un orbe). Dans GemCraft, on doit cr\u00e9er des gemmes afin d'alimenter les tours et attaquer les monstres. Ces gemmes n\u00e9cessitent de la mana pour \u00eatre cr\u00e9\u00e9es. Mais la mana sert \u00e9galement de barre de vie face aux monstres : quand un monstre atteint l'orbe, ce dernier consomme de la mana afin de le bannir. Et du coup s'il n'y a plus de mana... eh ben y a plus d'orbe.\n\nIl existe 9 types de gemmes : celle qui empoisonne, celle qui ralentit, celle qui fait des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts multipli\u00e9s (je l'aime bien celle-l\u00e0), celle qui fait des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts de zone, celle qui absorbe la mana des monstres, et j'en passe... Rien qu'avec \u00e7a il y a de quoi faire, mais on peut upgrader et combiner les gemmes afin de cumuler leurs effets, ce qui augmente nettement les possibilit\u00e9s.\n\nAu fur et \u00e0 mesure du jeu, on d\u00e9bloque des skills. Les skills peuvent \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9s en d\u00e9pensant des points gagn\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'XP des combats. Ces skills peuvent donner des bonus de mana ou d'XP, r\u00e9duire les co\u00fbts de cr\u00e9ation de gemmes/tours, rendre les gemmes plus puissantes, mais aussi permettre de lancer des sorts offensifs sur les ennemis (gel, mal\u00e9diction...), ou des sorts d'am\u00e9lioration des gemmes (une gemme qui se met \u00e0 tirer un rayon laser, c'est plut\u00f4t pas mal). On peut r\u00e9partir nos points sur les skills, mais on peut tout r\u00e9initialiser en cas d'erreur, et les points non d\u00e9pens\u00e9s donnent de la mana suppl\u00e9mentaire.\n\nLe jeu est globalement facile, mais vous pouvez tr\u00e8s bien le rendre hardcore si vous le voulez. En plus de modifier la difficult\u00e9 de base (il n'y en a qu'une au d\u00e9but, les autres niveaux de difficult\u00e9 se d\u00e9bloquent apr\u00e8s), vous pouvez \u00e9galement activer des \"battle traits\" (eux aussi d\u00e9bloquables), qui peuvent renforcer davantage les monstres, infliger des grosses p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s en cas de bannissement, faire arriver les vagues plus rapidement, etc... Les traits sont bien s\u00fbr cumulables, ce qui augmente la difficult\u00e9... et l'XP gagn\u00e9e. Si \u00e7a ne vous suffit pas, vous pouvez vous lancer dans le mode Endurance, je pense pas avoir besoin d'expliquer le principe. :)\n\nBref, que vous soyez d\u00e9butant ou expert dans les tower-defense, vous y trouverez votre compte. Le jeu vous laisse une grande libert\u00e9 au niveau des strat\u00e9gies et des possibilit\u00e9s. Et encore, je suis loin d'avoir tout dit.\n\nNiveau sonore, les musiques sont plut\u00f4t discr\u00e8tes mais servent tr\u00e8s bien l'atmosph\u00e8re sombre du jeu.

It is a hidden little gem i picked up for $0.21. This is a puzzle platformer that is so fun because the puzzles are very satisfying to solve. At the beginning of the game i was a confused but I quickly picked up the game mechanics due to the games perfect learning curve. In other words when the game teaches a new mechanic, it starts off easy until you are familar with the mechanic, then harder till it becomes secondhand knowledge, and THEN thats when the game shows you the next new mechanic. Of course this is not to say that you will never be stumped at some parts, after all it is what makes a puzzle game a puzzle game and takes some creative thinking BUT is never anything ridiculous to solve. The main part about this game that is kept me so hooked were all the puzzles. The harder puzzles are extreamly satisfying to solve (plenty of \"OHHH!!\" moments) and secrets are very rewarding to find. The puzzles in this game will never become stale, thats because even though the puzzles are essentially the same, the variations and new mechanics keep it very fun, enjoyable, and interesting to play.

Das Spiel l\u00e4uft fl\u00fcssig und es gibt keine Grafikfehler.\n\n\nSound: 13/15\nDer Sound ist bei Tower-Defense-Spielen immer eine Sache f\u00fcr sich. Im Men\u00fc h\u00e4lt er sich im Hintergrund und passt somit auch zum Spiel, w\u00e4hrend des spielens ist er auch nicht nervig. Leider kann ich hier zu nicht mehr schreiben da bei diesen Spielen ehr kompliziert ist den Sound zu bewerten.\n\n\nStory\\Gameplay: 60/60\nIm ersten Moment denkt man das alle Tower-Defense-Spiele gleich oder sehr \u00e4hnlich sind, dass trifft auch auf die Meisten zu. GemCraft aber, ist sehr komplex und hat auch ein Verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig langes Gameplay. ich fasse es nachfolgen \"kurz\" zusammen.\n\nFallen und Tower:\nDie Tower und Fallen haben nur die Funktion Gems zu halten und evtl. den Weg zu blockieren.\n\nGems:\nDie sogenannten Gems sind das was GemCraft von anderen Spielen unterscheidet, bei anderen Spielen gibt es nur verschiedene Tower die man upgraden kann. Dies kann man zwar auch mit Gems, man kann sie allerdings auch direkt mit einer hohen Stufe kaufen oder Verschmelzen. Es gibt 9 verschiedene Gems die man alle mit einander kombinieren kann, so kann man Gems zu einem Verschmelzen, der alle Eigenschaften besitzt.\n\nWizard-Level und Skill-Punkte:\nSkill-Punkte erh\u00e4lt man wenn Errungenschaften freigeschalten werden oder ein neues Wizard-Level erreicht ist. Die Punkte kann man auf insgesamt 25 Kategorien verteilen, die auch nach und nach freigeschalten werden. Vor dem Spiel kann man noch zus\u00e4tzliche Level-Optionen treffen die es das Spiel schwerer machen aber auch mehr XP geben. Sobald man auf einem Spielstand Wizard-Level 100 erreicht kann man bei einem neuen Spielstand den Iron-Wizard Modus ausw\u00e4hlen, der das Skill-System ver\u00e4ndert.\n\nTalisman:\nMan kriegt im Verlauf des Spiels verschiedene Fragmente die auch sofort verwenden kann. Sie geben z.B. mehr XP oder Mana.\n\nMana und Shadowcores:\nDas Mana ist die W\u00e4hrung innerhalb des Spiels, wenn man eine bestimmte Menge Mana im Manapool hat steigt sein Level und es wird mehr Mana generiert. Mit Shadowcores kann man Fragmente upgraden, Skill-Punkte kaufen oder die Qualit\u00e4t der als n\u00e4chstes zu findenen Fragmente erh\u00f6ren. Man erh\u00e4lt Shadowcores w\u00e4hrend des spielens oder wenn man Fragmente zerst\u00f6rt.\n\nEs gibt noch viele weitere Features, doch alle zu beschreiben w\u00fcrde zu lange dauern. Das Spiel ist nur auf englisch, man muss allerdings nicht unbedingt englisch hierf\u00fcr k\u00f6nnen m\u00fcssen. \n\n\nGesamt: 98/100*\nNote: 1\n\n* Aufgrund des langen und komplexen Gameplays z\u00e4hlt GemCraft in meinem Bewertungssystem nicht als Gelegenheitsspiel sondern als Vollwertiges Spiel", "timestamp_created": 1454942461, "timestamp_updated": 1456252594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21047804": {"recommendationid": "21047804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012545565", "num_games_owned": 957, "num_reviews": 157, "playtime_forever": 18498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511354143}, "language": "english", "review": "*** DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS HARDCORE ELITEST CRAP ***\n\nIgnore the overwhelmingly positive reviews.

After that, the game becomes almost impossible to play.\n\nThis game is highly addictive garbage, that higher levels are way too hard, making the game pathetic!\n\nKill X amount of a specific enemy, how, when there is not actually that many to kill!\n\nThe brain dead developers made it much harder than it needs to be. I will never buy any of their other titles as long as I live!!!!!\n\nThis is not a game, it is a punishment simulator!!!\n\nThe game is now deleted, and never to be played again!\n\nIt makes no sense at all to make the easiest mode on this game so pathetically hard. After 152 hours, if you are like me, you will eventually get one thrid of the way through if that (roughly once the wave count gets over 60 (after that, you realise that the game is nothing but flooded with ennemies that you have no hope of defeating, because your towers can not shoot fast enough)), before giving up in fustration. Easy moode should almost play its self, uiding you through the maps, preparing you for play on the harder modes, not this garbage that hammers you from go to failed!\n\nThe following is just some of the problems I have had trying to play it.\n\n\nGet all the way through a map, defeating all of the enemy, only to have three guardians appear. Two of these have 30,000 hit points, the oother, have three hundred thousand.Here's the kick, you only have a tower that does max damage of 200. So,long before you can even kill one of the guardians with less hit points, the all start heading to what you are protecting. Guess what happens then. DEFEATED!!!!\n\n\nThis game is so finely tuned that 99% of the time, you will fail, simply because yoou did not do exactly what you needed to do, to be ready for thee final wave.The imbecile developers apparently think it is a great joke, to let you waste 10 - 20 minutes, defeating 50 or so waves, and then with several level 7 and 8 towers, wham, you get hit with the final wave,, that has so many enemy, that you have absolutely no hope at all of defeating them. Towers can only shoot so many shots per second. These same enemy that get through, will reappear at starting locations, and goo again, looping until you kill them oor run out of manor. This is simply a mongrel act on the part of the developers!\n\nThis game is complete garbage: The developers did add a ton of content. Hoowever, they made it that hard to pllay that is is garbage. And by hard to play, I mean, they give you so many enemy that you get over run 99.9% of the tiime. And when this tactic does not work and it looks like you are going to actually beat a map, they send in flying crap that has one purpose and one purpose only, To steal the gem out of your strongest tower. This renders the map as just another fail.\n\nThere is no grinding for exp, because if you do redo a map, all you get is around 8 points. Guess how many times you are going to need to grind the same maps, just to make your self .001% stronger, with 100 points required for each increment!\n\nPROS:\n\nGame will take the rest of your life to complete (this is of course also a con, do you really want to sppend the rest of your life playing just one game!)\n\nCONS:\n\n!!!!!!!!! THIS GAME HAS A FATAL ERROR THAT MAKES IT CRASH (sometimes, it will crash bad enough to wipe out your entire system, forcing a restart) !!!!!!!!!\n(One map I was playing, crahed, then crashed again after restarting. I did eventually get through the map, so it is not game breaking, but very annoying)\n\nRepeating levels until you figure out what you need too do to complete it (There is no exp to be had by repeating the leve, so don't bother thinking that if you just repeat it enough, you will get stronger and thus able to beat itl)!\n\nWhat sort of imbecile instantly overloads the game with enemy, before it even gives you enough of anything to repel the enemy. \n\nWhat sort of imbecile instantly overloads the game with enemy that have a zillion hit points and goes that fast that iif you did hit it, you would do no damage to it any way.\n\nWhat sort of imbecile  gives you a map that has absolutely nowhere that you can actually place towers, and traps do no damage at all, bloody clueless developers!\n\nThe best idea the developers could come up with was to have far too enemy in the game, and not enough mana to build anywhere near enough towers to stop them. \n\nThe game is designed so that, even if you do let some through, you still achieve completion for the level, provided you are not defeated. There is no star rating where you lose points for noot stopping them all.\n\nHonestly, there are that many enemy and they are moving that fast, that you have no chance at all of completing 90% of the maps in this game, with out going away from the game and thinking about it for hours. This makes playing the game pointless, simply because you want to be actually playing, not shutting down your PC, and scratching your head for hours at a time.When devising a strategy, don't even bother trying to actually use it in the game, not until you have thought up about 50 different strategies, because this is how many you will need!\n\nSeems that if you decide to upgrade a gem over what thhe developers decide is required to do the map, a ghost will appear and steal you gem, sometimes appearig right next to it, so you have no chance of killing it before it steals the gem. This can render the level to a fail status, becuse you no long have any thing to battle with!\n\nThis pathetic game NEVER gets any easier!!! \n\nOVERALL:\n\nI give up, I am very stubborn, so played this for a long time, but it never gets easier, so they can stick their pathetically hard game where the sun never shines, right up there in the nosebleed section!\n\nI have now played every map with less than 60 waves, anything over that forget it!\n\nIMBECILES MADE THIIS GARBAGE!!!\n\nI repeat *** IMBECILES MADE THIIS GARBAGE ***, and in case you never saw that: *** IMBECILES MADE THIIS GARBAGE ***, one last time: *** IMBECILES MADE THIIS GARBAGE ***!!!!!!!!!\n\nVery disapointed, when they make is so bloody hard to play on easy mode, that it is not actually worth playing. There is nothing to give incentive to keep going. Why even bother having difficulty levels at all. Just set it to extreme and forget!\n\nAlmost forgot: *** IMBECILES MADE THIIS GARBAGE ***!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1454923804, "timestamp_updated": 1504600720, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21042861": {"recommendationid": "21042861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043396934", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456507111}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing tower defense that pleases casual players and has alot of depth.

If you \"kind of\" like tower defense, you should probably just play the flash version, and you'll get bored before you hit the point where you would need to pay. If the prospect of >100 slightly varying tower defense maps appeals to you, and more so when I tell you you can go past 100 waves of monsters on each, and then more when I tell you about all the difficulty dials you can fine tune, then this is a good tower defense game to spend 100+ hours on.\n\nI particularly recommend GemCraft for the highly customizable difficulty. Over the course of the game, you unlock nine different difficulty dials, like \"more and stronger giants\" or \"send mana every minute instead of as I accummulate it\", and three difficulty settings; plus you can increase the difficulty of a wave by calling it sooner or \"enraging\" it by dropping gems on it, spending your mana to make the waves tougher and increasing the number of monsters; plus achievements for level-specific handicaps like \"only use slowing gems\"; plus an \"Iron Wizard\" mode that takes away your ability to out-level the difficulty curve. Just beating the levels is not all that difficult, apart from scattered puzzle levels. GemCraft excels in letting you make the game as hard as you want it to be, and it rewards you for pushing yourself to the bleeding edge of how difficult you can make it. And with those rewards, you can play the level again, with difficulty turned up just a little higher...

But there's a point in the game where you go from having nothing to having everything (and beyond) and the challenge fades away.\n\nOnce you \"get\" how to really play this game, it becomes very repetitive and unchallenging. Certain gem combinations mean easy access to literally billions of EXP. I played this game from level 1 to 130 without using these especially deadly/plentiful gem combos, but as soon as I found them, I went from level 130 to 2200 in a matter of days playing pretty casually (I left the game open, so my hours plays doesn't really mean anything). \n\nAlso, because this game is built on Flash, it runs very poorly on even the best of setups \u2013 the problem being thousands and thousands of monsters on-screen at the same time. When every wave has 999 monsters coming and you're sending them in advance at the highest of speeds (which you'll have to do, since you'll be pretty bored watching everything die), the frames hover around 10 fps for me. It doesn't matter that much because I'm not doing anything besides upgrading gems (to 45+) and enraging waves (which includes repeatedly clicking everything... also boring). \n\nIt's almost as if people figured out how to exploit this game and then the developers sort of went along with it.

From the very start you are underwhelmed with a simple tower-defense game that runs smoothly and entertains you even when you lose. Achievements are abundant and pleasing to, well, achieve, and it will take you hundreds of hours to complete all of them. Later on, you are overwhelmed with gem-recipes and strategies that will take you into the thousands of Wizard Levels and hundreds of endurance levels. The goal? Beat endurance. Sure, there is a heroing story line following the wizard you play as, destroying the evils that curse the land in their seemingly infinite numbers. But that isn't as important as the dedication of upgrading your gems individually and in the right pattern to create the mana leeching gems that farms need. Confused and slightly scared? You should be. Gem-crafting is no laughing matter. Math like you thought you would never have to use again is useful to an infinite degree in this game, as gem-recipes can become so complex that it may make the faint-of-heart whimper with fear. \n\nHave you bought a game and finished it in a day and loved it? Each level can be played for many hours on end, gaining you billions upon billions of exp. Some players go on 20-100 hour games to farm as much exp. in the hopes of beating endurance.

At first it seemed like a fun game with lots of mechanics. Past 30 hours and a few unlocks it reveals itself as a really poorly made TD game... \n-So it's all about gems - there are 9 types of gems, 6 of them are barely have any use, other 4 are a must have if you want to beat a difficult map (and unless you unlock them you're limited to what developers give you on that map)\n-Gems have different effects on monsters but every tower is the same single target cannon (exception is a chain gem with which your shots deal damage to several monsters in a chain)\n-What seemed to be a lot of mechanics is actually a pretty shallow set of similar things, half of which arent even viable like combination of more than 4 types of gems, cause you will LOSE a lot of damage because of a skill that buffs only up to 4 gem combination... or traps... traps are essentially useless cause they can't get even close to what a buffed tower will do... or gem bombing which is only \"useful\" to make waves stronger to get more exp/mana... or barrage spell which travel so slowly it lands when tower shots already killed everything and if your barage is actually killing something then you probably buffed waves too hard and might just die anyway\n-WAY too many waves... WAY. 1 map can take an hour to beat on high difficulty and you use lots of traits and also enraging waves...\n-It lags like any other game won't ever lag, cause to match your power you need to buff waves more and more resulting in thousands of monsters on the map\n-It's insanely unforgiving... you can sit for an hour on a map with like 150-200 waves, enraging them, then you accidentally (cause of lags or losing patience) enrage them for a bit more than you can actually hanlde and there it is - youre fucked, start the map over again\n-Limited demolitions... WHY THE FUCK? You are carefully building a labyrinth and bam you placed something wrong a couple of times, well you better be precise next time cause you can't remove it anymore...\n-Annoying shit coming out of nowhere without any warning ranging from a harmless ghost flying by to a huge fat fuckness requiring lots of dps or it will oneshot you or how about losing control for 20 seconds? Sounds fun right?\n\nIf it was developers first project then these flaws might be actually somewhat forgivable (is it even a word?), but looks like it's already a game series (it might be just an updated version, i'm not sure). \nWhat i liked is the style and maybe some challenges.

The RPG mechanics and lore give it life and purpose. Highly recommended.\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[h1][b]Pros:[/b][/h1]\n+ Graphics: I like the variety between bleak and vivid colors.\n+ Audio: Not amazing, but the hit & death sounds are quite satisfying.\n+ Concept: Gem-enhanced towers? Gem bombs? Gem traps? Gem amplifiers? Yes.\n+ Difficulty: Slightly easy after a spike. You can then increase the difficulty for more reward.\n+ Replayability: I enjoy replaying levels with extra challenge to see what I can pull off.\n+ RPG Mechanics: Unlockables, upgrades, levels, skills & spells, and story.\n+ Lore: Well written, simple, given in scraps, great for those that do or don't want it.\n+ UI: Simply put, the UI is extremely well done. Simple, appealing, aesthetically pleasing.\n+ Variety: There's a gem for every playstyle, and many levels offering various gems.\n\n[h1][b]Cons:[/b][/h1]\n- Brevity: Eventually, going through all the basic levels to get to unlocks can get monotonous. I would prefer fewer levels, offering more tight design and unique challenges.\n- Rewards: I'm nitpicking here, but I dislike how getting really far in endurance offers much less experience than getting through the normal map on a higher difficulty or with trials on.\n\n[h1][b]Neutral:[/b][/h1]\n+/- Graphics and audio are well designed, but could be better looking/sounding.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[h1][b]Introduction:[/b][/h1]\nWelcome to Gemcraft - Chasing Shadows, the tower defense game where you use various gems and combinations thereof to make your towers methodically destroy your opposition. Gemcraft brings so much to the table with its lore, mechanics, and fitting design aesthetics. There are many options to suit your playstyle, and a lovely coming together of genres to make your experience fresh and exciting. Let's take a deeper look:\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay:[/b][/h1]\nYou have 9 gems at your disposal: Red, yellow, orange, green, blue, cyan, purple, white, black; or chain hit, critical hit, mana leeching, poison, slowing, suppressing, armor tearing, poolbound, and bloodbound respectively. You are given select gems to beat every field with. You can use bombs, traps, towers, and amplifiers. A gem-enhanced entity that has a single or 'pure' gem will always be the strongest form of that gem. If you are to fuse gems, the individual components will be weaker, but the overall effect could be much stronger; an easy example of this would be combining almost any of them with the red gem, chain hit. I also should point out that you can fuse two pure gems of the same level to get them to the next level. (This works with hybrids, as well.) Some gems work better as traps than towers, green (or poison) being a good example of this, however, you are generally free to make things work however you wish, utilizing many or few of the tools at your disposal. On a final note on gems and their killing mechanics, I should mention that amplifiers don't seem to benefit from having their gems upgraded, they simply need any ol' gem present to provide a flat bonus.\n\nMoving away from gems, you have 25 skills that can be unlocked. Examples include cheaper construction, more effective gem bombs, and spell enhancement. Some of these are crucial, while others come down to preference. You can reset them at any time. You also have six spells. Examples are an AOE freeze and a special beam or barrage for your towers. There are two ways of unlocking skills and spells, tomes and wizard towers. Tomes require you to kill certain enemies such as 50 giants that have been frozen in their presence. Wizard towers require you to break locks, usually by hitting them directly in different ways. You recieve talismans from beating maps, rarity based on difficulty, which do things like increase damage or experience and make gems heavier. You have a limited amount of slots for talismans. You can upgrade talismans with shadow cores or scrap them to get more. Most shadow cores will come from killing spectres. Later on, you can spend shadow cores to increase the rarity of drops.\n\nInitially the game's difficulty will spike but once you get the mechanics down it becomes much easier. Then you have 9 trials and 3 difficulty modes to utilize. Trials are modifiers that impact the gameplay, but greatly boost your rewards. An early one adds waves and makes them arrive earlier. I recommend using this when you become familiar with a level so you can get a lot of experience. Be careful, however, because there is a mechanic where XP rewarded = current exp - previous highest exp.\n\nYou can use these mechanics to unlock field tokens, which add levels and hexes to the map. Clearing a level could unlock one or more field tokens, (and perhaps a scrap of lore) allowing you the option to prioritize certain paths through the game's fields which enables you to get to unlocks faster, or put off a tough stage. The flexibility and depth presented in Gemcraft makes for a very compelling experience not found even in most AAA TD games.\n\n[h1][b]Graphics:[/b][/h1]\nThe graphics in Gemcraft are serviceable. They are great on some points, but mainly the UI. The UI has everything just the right size. It is thematic but not overly fancy or convoluted. Things are properly highlighted or out of the way. Some aspects may be large and visual as opposed to other aspects being smaller and text-based, tucked away for those that desire more information. Everything is very well laid out, easy to get to, and navigation is quick and simple. With the amount of options present, this is a great boon for Gemcraft. The map is quite beautiful, the field level icons and gem graphics are nice, and the enemies look alright. I wish the enemies had a bit more variety though, being mostly variations of bugs. The textures could also use improvement in resolution, and perhaps some in their design. Many of the stages end up looking bland because of said design flaws of the textures.\n\n[h1][b]Audio:[/b][/h1]\nThe music is good, not too obtrusive. The hit and death sounds are satisfying. Everything that needs a sound, has one, and usually they are nice. Like the graphics, however, I can't help but feel like there is a certain level of polish missing, that slight flair that can take something from amateur to professional. Noting, however, that Gemcraft - Chasing Shadows is also a free browser based tower defense game, this is all actually quite impressive.\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b][/h1]\nSo, in conclusion, Gemcraft - Chasing Shadows is an excellent tower defense game with fun, depth, and style in spades. The concept is  beautiful. There are numerous options available, offering satisfying levels of control, and the excellent UI makes it exceptionally easy to play and navigate. The game can be as casual or hardcore as you'd like, and would be great for kids, adults, newbies and veterans alike. I recommend Gemcraft at full price. On sale is fine, too. On a deep sale, is also fine, however, you should definitely purchase this title, one way or the other. The dev deserves support, and the game is easily worth the money even at double the full price.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n[i]No drama, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/justreviews]Just Reviews[/url].[/i]\n\nIf you like my reviews, you can easily keep up with them [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/nonreviews]here.[/url]\n[h1]======================================[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1453417648, "timestamp_updated": 1453418786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784039", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20667002": {"recommendationid": "20667002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024390355", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512668024}, "language": "english", "review": "Yet another GemCraft game and it brings new elements to play with.

HAR HAR\n*ahem* Anyway, this is a ridiculously good tower defense. I thought Defense Grid was good, but this pretty much blows it away. I can't really put my finger on any one thing that makes it so good; it's just fun. There are a lot of decisions to be made not just in your defense build, but also in between missions with skills, talisman slots, traits, etc. Plenty of content and depth here. I also really like that you can seamlessly transition from any mission into the endless mode. If you're having fun with your build on a particular map or the layout of the map itself, you can continue playing on it in endless and just see how much XP you can rack up. About the only thing I would wish for is that the different gem types had more distinctive visual effects, instead of just different colors of the little bolts, but that's a pretty minor gripe.

Though, It should be noted that holding the shift key, while building and moving gems, will slow your game no mater the circumstance (no enemys/good hardware). To remedy this: simply pause the game as it is a single player experence; there is no need to rush. I have encountered few problems otherwise. The game is finished with the expected, but well executed pixelish graphical style of its type. This TD will give you a great varriety of strategic choice both durring the levels, and throughout the meta-game/overworld. It is the one game in the sea of thousands that I would comfortably recomend buying off-sale. It is truely worth the ~$10, and would give the creative genius behind the series what they deserve for such a well thought-through, risk/reward strategy title. It really does feel like the game has been fully fleshed out. It is far from what a browser flash game is normally.\n\nNow, I know I haven't told you many specifics about Gem Craft, but this is because you can easily experience the mechanics with the browser version yourself. And if you are too lazy for that, there are many, many more reviews that actually break the game down properly for what it is.\n\n\n\nThis is my first review, and will likely be my only one for a while.

Raw damage is important but it isn't everthing. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1452373214, "timestamp_updated": 1452373214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20430660": {"recommendationid": "20430660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065537150", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452369670}, "language": "english", "review": "Great way to pass time on a well polished TD game!", "timestamp_created": 1452371152, "timestamp_updated": 1452371152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20426201": {"recommendationid": "20426201", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991680123", "num_games_owned": 821, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452359800}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "A tower defense j\u00e1t\u00e9kok egyik kiv\u00e1l\u00f3s\u00e1ga!

In comparison with the web free version, you'll get more content on the Steam version. Since the very first GemCraft, I was amazed of how a tower defense game could be so wonderful. I've played a lot, then have focused on playing 'Chasing Shadows', which comes after 'Labyrinth'.\n\n[h1] First Sight (TL;DR) [/h1]\n\nYou might think that it's some simple, boring, sketchy tower defense games like those on Armor Games, Kongregate and so forth. Not so! This is a tower defense game made properly, with love and basically revolutionizes the genre itself!\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nYou're presented with a field composed out of roads which lead the monsters to your orb. What [i]exactly[/i] is the orb? The orb is the point you have to defend from the monsters that swarm all over, that rush towards your orb to vanquish it. If a monster touches the orb, don't fret! Yet, if you let way too many monsters at it, it will get crippled. Once your mana pool is depleted and one last monster touches the orb, it's game over. The mana acts like a shield, protecting the orb from destruction. Dropping a gem bomb (Done by pressing B (default assigned key) and dragging a gem over a spot) on the orb will decrease the banishment cost and will furthermore decrease the damage received by the monsters. \nMana is your single resource in the whole game, used in conjuring gems, towers, traps, amplifiers, combining gems as well as in gem bombs. How is mana acquired? It is acquired by slaying monsters and mining from mana shards with a tower which has a gem equipped.\nDefense of the orb is done by creating gems of a respective trait (colour) and grade. The gems can be combined altogether, the traits being distributed by half if the gem has two traits (colours), you can figure the rest out. These gems can be socketed in towers traps and amplifiers or thrown as bombs. In most fields, you will encounter shrines which can be activated by dropping a gem on them. Depending on the grade of the gem dropped on it the damage will be increased, the shrine will inflict the properties on the monsters. Walls can be used to create new paths for the monsters to follow. Traps are built on the road to inflict damage especially on the swarmlings which are quite fast, while amplifiers are built next to towers to amplify damage and properties of the gem it is amplifying. The gems can also be assigned on what to target, a building or a monster. Slowly you'll gain three area-of-effect spells and three gem enchantments, with a specific cooldown. Throughout the game you'll get talisman fragments to randomly drop which you can socket into their respective slot in the panel displayed in the 'Talisman' tab.\nThe level of difficulty can be easily customized, by adding traits at the beginning of the level, dropping gems on the wave tablets to enrage the monsters which will yield more mana and you can also call waves in earlier which will give you mana as well.\nThis game also has an experience system which rewards the player with skill points at every level gained and also with every achievement, said skill points can be spent on wizard traits that enhance your playthrough. The skill points can be stashed for a starting mana pool bonus.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nNot much can be said about the graphics but that everything is detailed quite nicely, the effects being absolutely wonderful and the way the vivid colours combine when mixing a gem with another of a different colour is overly pleasing. \n\n[h1] OST & SFX [/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack gives an eerie feeling when playing, driving you to think of how deeply horrifying the story is, fitting [i] exactly [/i] to the theme.\n\n[h1] Pros 'n' Cons [/h1]\n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n\n+More than 150 fields to battle on\n+Eerie, atmospheric music\n+Variety of gems each with its own trait\n+Different modes to play\n+Personalization of the challenge\n+Rewarding XP system\n+Lots of achievements\n+Infinite replayability\n+Addicting\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n\n-Might witness lag on certain occasions\n\n[h1] Should you buy it? [/h1]\nTotally! Highly recommended!\n\n\n[quote=] For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LotsOGiveaways] Lot's O Giveaway's [/url] group curations [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LotsOGiveaways#curation] here!

The graphics are too basic.  It could easily have been programmed that way in the 20th century.  Its pixellated, almost retro and not even isometric.  For such primitive visuals it loads slowly.\n\nThere is little to differentiate the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy.  Tower selection and placement doesn't seem to matter much.  Weapon strikes and dying enemies have forgettable animations.  There is very little strategy and gem type availability seems to be random for each level. I quickly became bored of the gameplay.\n\nThe gem-crafting aspects seem tedious and overly complicated.  The best evidence of this comes from the wordy tips.  These may be helpful but the design is dated.  Unless you come back to the game a few times in the one day it is easy to forget the details.\n\nThe various aspects of the game don't seem to mesh at all.

There are tons of levels, most with alterable paths.

There are 9 gems which can each be merged with each other in endless combinations. You can set those into powers, floor traps, and amplification towers. There are more skills, stats, upgrades, unlockables, and achievements than you will know what to do with at the start.\n\nThere are very few penalites for changing you towers around. You can drag and drop finished gems to different towers and they just need a couple of seconds to load into the tower. If you find you've made a gem you no longer need, it can be returned to your mana pool to get back 70% of its total crafting cost. There are hot keys to duplicate a complicated gem (hit D) for its crafting cost, or to upgrade one with a copy of itself (press U). You can drop gems as Bombs (with B) to destroy enemies on screen that passed your towers, or you can boost imcoming waves strength by dropping bombs on their text before they arrive.\n\nIf you like top-down tower-defense games, I think you will enjoy this.

Mehr muss dazu auch nicht gesagt werden. Chasing Shadows ist der aktuellste Teil einer Serie, die eigentlich als Flashgame auf einschl\u00e4gigen Browsergame-Seiten ver\u00f6ffentlich wurde.\nAnders als bei anderen TD-Spielen sind aber noch viele weitere Spielmechaniken verf\u00fcgbar, zum Beispiel die vielf\u00e4ltigen M\u00f6glichkeiten T\u00fcrme zu gestalten, miteinander zu kombinieren und so perfekt ausgekl\u00fcgelte Systeme aus T\u00fcrmen, Fallen und Verst\u00e4rkern aufzubauen. Freaks finden hier eine Spielwiese zum Austoben und ausprobieren, Freizeitzocker k\u00f6nnen einfach Level f\u00fcr Level spielen und sich am machbaren Schwierigkeitsgrad erfreuen.\nGemCraft enth\u00e4lt viele Rollenspiel-Elemente. Dies wird nicht nur durch Setting und Story (beides steht obwohl liebevoll gestaltet eher im Hintergrund) deutlich, sondern vor allem durch ein XP- und Item-System. Hiermit lassen sich zwischen den einzelnen Leveln die Eigenschaften der T\u00fcrme, Fallen und Zauberspr\u00fcche verbessern. \n[u]Grafik:[/u]\nDie Grafik ist in einfachem 2D gehalten. Von der Pixel-Optik der ersten Teile ist nur noch ansatzweise etwas zu erkennen, die visuellen Effekte wie Explosionen, Partikeleffekte und Wetter h\u00fcbschen die eher d\u00fcstere Optik ordentlich auf. Die Hauptlast liegt auf dem Prozessor.\n[u]Steuerung:[/u]\nDas Spiel wird eigentlich mit der Maus gesteuert, ist aber mit einer Vielzahl von Hotkeys ausgestattet, deren Verwendung ich ausdr\u00fccklich empfehle. Die Hotkeys sind dabei oft so belegt, dass sie den Anfangsbuchstaben der Funktionen entsprechen und nicht einer anatomisch angenehmen Anordnung auf der Tastatur. Umbelegen lassen sich die Hotkeys leider nicht.\n[u]Langzeitmotivation:[/u]\nIm Vergleich zu anderen Spielen ist die Langzeitmotivation relativ hoch. Das eigentliche Spiel bietet bereits eine ansehnliche Spielzeit von je nach Spielweise bestimmt 20 Stunden. Auf dem direkten Weg zum finalen Level l\u00e4sst man jedoch das eine oder andere Nebenlevel liegen, was dann nach dem Abspann noch gespielt werden kann. Dar\u00fcber hinaus gibt es eine Vielzahl an geheimen Leveln und versteckten Features und auch das F\u00e4higkeiten- und Itemsystem animiert zum weiteren Erkunden. Dabei kann jedes Level so oft wiederholt werden, wie man m\u00f6chte. F\u00fcr h\u00f6here XP-Ausbeute kann die Schwierigkeit fast unbegrenzt erh\u00f6ht werden. Die Langzeitmotivation leidet unter dem Fehlen einer Obergrenze bei Attributen. So levelt man seine F\u00e4higkeiten h\u00f6her, nur um die Level noch schwieriger stellen zu k\u00f6nnen. Es fehlt ein wirkliches Ziel. Problem hierbei vor allem: Um bei meinem Level noch eine Herausforderung zu haben muss man sehr viele Monster spawnen lassen. Dies f\u00fchrt auf auf Gaming-Hardware der neuesten Generation zu unertr\u00e4glichen Lags.\n\n[u]Fazit:[/u]\n[i]Pro:[/i]\n-\tEinmalig-geniale Spielmechanik\n-\tViel Freiheit beim Spielverlauf\n-\tLangzeitmotivation f\u00fcr dreistellige Spielstundenzahl\n\n[i]Kontra: [/i]\n-\tLags bei hoher Monsterzahl\n-\tNach Erreichen eines sehr hohen Levels stark abfallende Motivation\n\n[b]-->\tBestes Towerdefence-Spiel auf dem Markt[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1451861347, "timestamp_updated": 1451861395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20272023": {"recommendationid": "20272023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049737824", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482750403}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043b \u043b\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u0431\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438. \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b \u0448\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043b\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u044b\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432 \u043e\u0440\u0431, \u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u043e\u043c\u044b. \n10 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0431\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1451858868, "timestamp_updated": 1451858868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20271711": {"recommendationid": "20271711", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971194660", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 6501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513427781}, "language": "polish", "review": "\u015awietna gra, dobra na kr\u00f3tkie, szybkie sesyjki, jak i wielogodzinne granie.

It's about gems, of course, you spend mana (which also represents your life bar) to conjure more and more powerful gems in any combination of 9 flavours, each one bringing a different special ability to the final product. Then you socket these gems into stationary assets you build on the field, such as towers, traps, and amplifiers. And then, in time, you'll unlock three area-of-effect spells and three gem enchantments, all on separate cooldown. And then you'll get talisman fragments to randomly drop, and will socket and upgrade up to 15 of them into a large panel, securing a number of additional bonuses and perks. And then you'll gather xp at the end of every mission and invest them in the 25 skills available, or stash them in order to get a different kind of bonus. And then you'll move up and unlock all of the 150+ battlefields available, up to the Spiritforge. And then you'll want to try vision battlefields, where skills and talismans and all that stuff don't matter and you're alone and scared like the first time. And then you'll want to try Iron Wizard mode, with different rules to the game. And that's just scratching the surface.\n\nOn top of all that, you can drastically personalize the level of challenge: each battlefield can be played in one of three different difficulty settings, and up to 9 crippling traits can be enabled to different extents in order to make the game more engaging/unforgiving. And even then, you can increase the challenge dynamically by calling in waves ahead of time and even 'enrage' them, which is to say 'spend mana to increase number, healthpool and armor of foes in a wave'.\n\nThis little gem (hah) has a lot going for it, so if in doubt, trust a random stranger on the interwebs and buy this game!", "timestamp_created": 1451837094, "timestamp_updated": 1451837094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.996004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20259172": {"recommendationid": "20259172", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998965249", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478419519}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like tower defense games, get it as soon as possible", "timestamp_created": 1451835306, "timestamp_updated": 1451835306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20258975": {"recommendationid": "20258975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035299984", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452356532}, "language": "english", "review": "When I was a child, I played lots of flash games on the internetet (like most of us, duh...).

This is really a pretty engaging and fun game with more options and more involved gameplay than even the trailer makes it seem (unfortunately not a very great endorsement for the game there.) You have six types of structure, nine types of gem, and every gem types can be mixed together to produce different types beyond the basic ones across several levels of gem strength which all adds onto map positioning, bombings (just throwing gems at things instead of socketing them), enraging waves, early calls, and other mechanics. I expected a pretty dull time waster but Gemcraft put a lot of tools on the table here and made every new map feel different than the last and a fun challenge to find out how to make sure you survive past the last wave...\n\nAnd then you can even hit a button when you finish for a no risk continuation of infinite waves to see how well your setup actually would fare past what it needed to which usually results in a horrible failure 15 minutes into but awards you with extra experience for the effort. Oh and did I mention the skills, spells, and talisman systems? Those are nifty too. The game even rewards you for NOT spending experience so just about everything is a choice you're making between one of several options, even deciding to spend experience. \n\nThis isn't a perfect game but it's a pretty fucking good one. The graphics are really poor, Flash is still Flash, and you'll have heard your fill of sound effects and music in the first few hours easily but what it does do it does it too well to dock it too much for that.

The learning curve for this game is smooth, with only a few spikes that grab your attention to the hints on the maps that help tower noobies to learn how to take advantage of your starting materials and the environment. \n\nGemcraft also features RPG elements such as a leveling system along with skills and equipable fragments for the tailsman, allowing you to gain an advantage in levels that were previously too difficult to complete (this means that you can grind to help you progress through the game if you'd like). If you think that grinding might make the game too easy, there are additional handicaps that the player can set on themselves to give more EXP and shadow cores for upgrading fragments. Achievements in the game are plenty and serve as milestones, giving the player skill points as a reward and keeping the difficult of the game from becoming to troublesome at later points in the game. \n\nGemcraft is a huge game for a tower defense game, which is incredible since the entire game can be played on the web for free at ArmorGames.

It's a lot of fun to get accustomed to new abilities or structures, and the game is only punishing if you want it to be.\nAside from common features such as custom targeting, fast-forward (up to 9x), mazing and calling waves early, there's many unique concepts, lots of different structures to keep things diverse, and the ideas from previous GemCraft games have been vastly improved.\nSlightly annoying: demolitions are costly and limited even in the preparation phase, so if you make a mistake with wall building you may have to restart and build everything again.\nChasing Shadows' main problem is that it runs on Flash, so there's no linux support. For a flash game it runs well though, lag is only an issue at extremely high levels.\nThere's a lot of content.

And best of all, tons of achievments that actually give you in-game bonus points to use in upgrading your skills.  Finally, we achievment hunters can have a legitimate reason for getting achievements!\n\nNow I must warn you that I have not completed the game yet.  But 20 hours in and I haven't seen anything to change my mind that this game is highly reccommended.  \n\nOk, so this is tower defense.  You build towers (traps, too!) and hope that they kill off the incoming line of enemies.  Only in this game the towers are powered by gems.  Each color does something different.  The green poison gem is my current favorite.  The red chain hit one is good too.  There's gems that steal mana from the enemy, deplete enemy armor, prevent enemies from regenerating their health, and more.  \n\nGems are created with mana.  You start with some mana but also gain mana slowly and by killing enemies.  Use the mana to create more gems or upgrade your existing gems to higher levels.  You can have gems from levels 1-12, but so far I have only been able to afford up to level 8.  Each level costs more than the previous level to create a gem.  You can also move gems around, but there is a short wait time for the gem to socket before it can start attacking.   Gems can also be used to bomb enemies with wasp stings, but I haven't found that very effective.  \n\nEach time  you complete a level it unlocks one or more new levels.  Map sections are hexogonal and eventually it opens up two pathway options.  So the game is not completely linear, which I love.  You gain experience and also get shadow cores to use to upgrade your abilities.  \n\nThere is so much customization in this game, so you can play it in your own style.  You can redistribute your ability points any time you want, so you're not stuck with your upgrades.  Or you can spend the shadow cores to increase your chance of getting better loot and rare items.  The maps have quite a variety of pathways.   And you can build little walls to make a maze to slow the monsters down.\n\nGraphics are seen from a top down angle, and the most realistic looking graphics that I've seen in a tower defense game, though I haven't seen them all.  Most of the games in this genre seem to be cartoon-like, but this game has lush forests, stone pathways, and dark insect-looking monsters!\n\nMusic is more of a kind of ethereal chorus or extended chords.  Not a tune.  But it's perfect for this game.  It really adds to the monstrous ambiance.\n\nReplay value is huge.  As far as I know you can replay levels as much as you want, to grind for experience and to get the hard achievements.    But like I said, I haven't finished it yet so I dont' know if there might be a reason not to take too much time.\n\nControls are done with the mouse and there are keyboard shortcuts.\n\nStory-wise, there are sometimes pages that tell the story but mostly it's just killing monsters.  Maybe there's more story later on, I dont' know.  This game won't appeal to someone who just wants to play once through a game.  It's for people who like to do the same thing over and over again.  I like to challenge myself to use the least amount of mana and still make it through the level, and stuff like that.  So, if that sounds like you, then buy this game without waiting!  It is well worth the price.  No need to wait for a sale.  \n\nThe only bad thing is I'm neglecting my other games to play this one.

And that is kinda the important part: Even though I highly consider myself a person that doesn't like change, I was familiarizing really quick with the new elements and wouldn't want to go back. The new additions make the game more customizable as ever before, so you can play your own style of game and still succeed more than likely.\n\nI already put above 30 hours into the game and it still doesn't look like I have come close anywhere near the end. Up until the point where I am, maps also don't seem repetitive to me and coming back for them, when you acquired new gear or skills can make them feel totally different again.\n\nMy only con to the game is the performance which sometimes (even on waves around 100) can go down, especially after casting certain spells. I feel like it's a limitation of the engine they used, I don't think it's my system :]\n\nIn conclusion: If you like crafty games, where you can choose your own methods and if you enjoyed any of the predecessors or similiar games from the tower/lane defense genres (like \"Orcs Must Die!\" or \"Plants vs. Zombies\"), then do yourself a favor and pick this gem up.\n\nIn the course of 2016's Steam Autumn sale I nominate this game for the \"Just 5 More Minutes\" Award, because of how addictive and long-lasting the challenge of this game is.", "timestamp_created": 1449555932, "timestamp_updated": 1479968018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19552514": {"recommendationid": "19552514", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978131107", "num_games_owned": 1364, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 2487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450551457}, "language": "english", "review": "The year is 2016.

E olha que j\u00e1 joguei muitos por n\u00e3o ter um PC muito avantajado na \u00e9poca. E agora vou recitar o que eu pensei quando eu abri o primeiro jogo:\n-Que joguinho zoado, vou jogar uma partida s\u00f3 pra ver.\n-Beleza, terminei, deixa eu jogar outra partida.\n-Consegui! Vamos a pr\u00f3xima.\n-Boa, joguei bem. Opa, liberei skill nova? Vamos testar.\n-P\u00f4, essa skill deixou muito mais desafiador, gostei.\n\nTive esse mesmo pensamento quando comprei na Steam, s\u00f3 que troca o \"joguinho zoado\" por \"Opa, GemCraft\", o resto n\u00e3o muda.\nE assim voc\u00ea continua pelas pr\u00f3ximas d\u00fazias de horas.\n\n\nSobre a an\u00e1lise do jogo:\nPr\u00f3s:\nJogo MUITO grande comparados a outros jogos do tipo. Voc\u00ea talvez levar\u00e1 mais de 20 horas para finaliz\u00e1-lo completamente.\nH\u00e1 muitos desafios em um mesmo mapa como deixar mais dif\u00edcil, fazer com que sumone mais gigantes, ter mana recuperada somente a cada x segundos, etc.\nO jogo inteiro \u00e9 bem sombrio, te envolve bastante no gameplay.\nN\u00e3o notei nenhuma queda de desempenho, com todos os gr\u00e1ficos ao m\u00e1ximo.\n\nContras:\nO jogo \u00e9 simples, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 muitos detalhes gr\u00e1ficos e nem muita defini\u00e7\u00e3o neles, eles somente pegaram o .swf (formato flash) e transformaram para .exe.\nO jogo vai aumentando a dificuldade constantemente te obrigando a voltar em miss\u00f5es j\u00e1 feitas para conseguir XP e melhorar alguma skil. (Tudo bem, parece normal, muitos outros jogos fazem isso. Mas pelo menos nesse GemCraft, a dificuldade vai aumentando tanto que \u00e0s vezes perco a vontade de jogar)\nO jogo n\u00e3o possui outras formas de jogar, \u00e9 simplesmente construir a torre, construir a gema, colocar a gema na torre e defender sua orb. N\u00e3o que isso seja totalmente ruim, mas poderia ter algo diferente.\n\nAgora estou esperando a\u00ed que nesse 2016 eu perca o BV e que lance outro GemCraft, mas totalmente para a Steam.

The world map is a grid sytem each tile on the grid is a letter of the alphabet with probably 4 maybe 5 levels in each tile, so there are a lot of levels which is good :) but... for a game that used to be a flash game on the internet i was expecting alot more from an executable that now costs \u00a34.99.\n\nAll in all Still the best Tower Deffence Game out there im just dissapointed that there wasnt more new content that the other free games already did.\n\nVerdict -  The game is still very good and i still play it even though ive completed all levels, if you cant bring yourself to pay for the game my advice is go online and play gemcraft: Labrinth for free then if you like that one finish it and buy this new one. it is still worth it, and you never know they might rectify the price sometime down the line :)", "timestamp_created": 1443100412, "timestamp_updated": 1443100412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18169980": {"recommendationid": "18169980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192961933", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443997287}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine a free game that is so good that you buy the paid version even if you are not really willing to play it for another 100 hours.\n\nWelcome to Gemcraft.\n\nIf you can play reverse capitalism with the product you are selling, it's gotta mean you are selling some really good shit.", "timestamp_created": 1443088746, "timestamp_updated": 1443088746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18162851": {"recommendationid": "18162851", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970409135", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464500272}, "language": "german", "review": "10 \u20ac  that price is more than ok ! \nHonestly didnt expect this much content!\nMust have for tower defense fans!", "timestamp_created": 1443034729, "timestamp_updated": 1443034729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18153629": {"recommendationid": "18153629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213530113", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474712133}, "language": "koreana", "review": "I like this game!", "timestamp_created": 1442973404, "timestamp_updated": 1442973404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18143421": {"recommendationid": "18143421", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968708287", "num_games_owned": 721, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 5030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445008617}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the best, the most unique and advanced series of Tower Defense genre.

If you like solving tasks and shooting evil monsters for kicks. This game is great fun to play and I really enjoy playing through the levels at will and while the levels are quite easy at first. This is deliberate, so that you are settled into the game before moving onto the much more tougher levels.\n\nThe Objectives:\nThis can vary from level to level. But in order to successfully pass the level. It is imperitive that you keep your orb intact and to protect from banishment from the monsters because if the mana pool reaches zero or a lower number than the banishment cost from the monster and the monster touches the orb in this state. Its Game Over and you would need to start the level again. While this is not going to be an issue in the early levels as these levels have a lower waves of monsters, you will find this more challenging in the later levels that have tougher enemies and more waves of monsters that you must defeat in order to complete the level. Its doesn't stop there however because some levels have tome chambers that will have to opened by meeting certain criterias to unlock vital skills and also you will still need to survive all enemy waves to complete the level AND to gain the skill from the tome chamber.\n\nMana:\nThe Mana bar is your lifeline as it used to buy gems, build buildings and traps as well as to sustain banishment charges from those monsters that are successful in banishing your orb. Careful planning and conservative use of the mana in levels will gain you extra mana to use at the start of other levels. So its wise to conserve as much mana as you can muster in early levels. This is a method that I learned the hard way when I was playing the light version of this game online. \n\nMy thoughts:\nIf you are into tactical games like I am and want to challenge yourself. Give this game a try as you will need to use your tactical skills to conquer the more harder levels and you may need to replay some levels to give you more mana for the later levels so that you can buy more powerful gems at the start. Even things like the placement of a tower on the level to the strength of a gem can mean the difference of success or failure.\n\nVerdict:\nThe key thing to have with this tactical game is PATIENCE and planning. If you rush through the early levels without giving much thought to points that I have mentioned. Then the later levels could be frustrating to some players if they do not plan their motives carefully. Patience and tactics are the road to completion of this game.\n\nOverall Rating: 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1442259600, "timestamp_updated": 1442259600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18028884": {"recommendationid": "18028884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084491244", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442926641}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent tower-defense.

Well, not that much. I mean, it's not a TD game for everyone, that I will admit. With 190 levels, a gazillion ways to tweak skills and difficulty settings, and the way to combine gems to create just what you want, it does have a higher treshold of entry than most such games. But if it does get its hooks in you, then wave goodbye to the next 100+ hours or so of your gaming schedule. And so this review should pretty much end.\n\nHowever, I'd like to also respond to some of the negative criticisms in the game, which is going to take up a lot more space:\n\n[b]\"It's too random, what with the specters and shadows.\"[/b]\nWhile it's technically true that these add an element of uncertainty, it's not that random (for one thing, you get warnings beforehand that it's about to happen), and it's therefore most certainly possible to plan for it. In fact, once you know how to deal with those things, then even if a shadow show up on wave 5, they'll never be a problem. And personally, the levels I've felt where randomness was more of an issue are the special Vision levels, because they're meant to be tight fights at all times. Sometimes they're so tight, that if your gems in the first wave tends to end up doing minimum damage shots, you've already lost. Then the next time you try said gems shoot maximum damage, and you survive and move on to clear the whole damn level.\n\nAside from that, I've hardly ever played any TD game that is -less- random than this game (maybe the previous games in the series, but they too had it, if in different forms)! For one thing, like I said, the difficulty setting is completely and utterly under your control, and never feels arbitrary. Take Kingdom Rush in comparison; the game's later mission levels on that game requires a lot of planning -and- early wave luck (i.e. good damage on the first few hits)... And that was on casual difficulty. Normal and Difficult requires nothing less than utter perfection in every single detail there. And Cursed Treasure 2 has levels entirely depending on early mana flask drops if you want three stars. This game, mana flow is forever something you can do something about, and you have a lot more freedom in placing your towers. There's nothing happening in this game that you cannot react to (except the aforementioned low-damage early shots in the vision fields).\n\nOh, and it seems like the amount of Shadows appearing has been severely downgraded compared to earlier versions of the game. I'm currently \n\n[b]\"It is too grindy, especially if you want a complete game.\"[/b]\nWell... Yes. It's true. I mean, if you know what you're doing, you can sweep through the main levels doing them all only one time each, and the Vision levels are completely set in terms of what gems and spells you have, so obviously any amount of grinding won't help you beat them. But if you want a complete game, you'll have to replay levels, yes. And yes, the levels are pretty long too, because this game is about making a set-up.\n\n...Which is something you do in every TD game that's worth a damn anyway. And at least if you want to grind here, you have to be clever about it, since it will always only be the highest score you get in any given level that counts. Also, don't forget Gemcraft Chapter 0. If you wanted a complete game there (i.e. each level completely shining), you had to replay every level 8 times. 8. Frickin'. Times. Here, you can get away with twice each (once on Looming and once on Haunting difficulty, ignoring Glaring), and if you unlock Haunting early, a fair few can be beaten with only one attempt.\n\n[b]\"There's barely any mazing.\"[/b]\nAgain, pretty much true. You don't spend that much time setting up walls to lead the monsters exactly where you want... And that is a bloody good thing too, because every TD I've played that's required excessive mazing on every level are immensely boring; with the fields usually being mainly empty except for a few ocstables that prevents you from optimal mazing every time. Who needs that crap? I sure don't.\n\n[b]\"Once you find the optimal strategy, it's nothing else to do.\"[/b]\nAgain true (I sense a pattern here)... And I'm not going to defend this per se, except saying that in the Gemcraft series as a whole, much of the point is about figuring out how to exploit everything. And I personally -like- games that gives you the option of doing that, provided they make sure that (barring going online and looking up other people's work) it's a challenge to find out how to exploit it. And this game's got that challenge. Way back when I first played this on AG, I thought I had a pretty good deal going on with the things I'd made up... and then I read about how other people had found stuff that put my strategies to utter shame (though they had the Magician's Pouch; I hadn't. I still wouldn't have figured out that other stuff in a million years, though). \n\nStill, my non-Magician Pouch based strategy was good enough for me to then beat field O6 at Wizard Level 56. Others had problems with that field 30 or more wizard levels above mine, so that was nice. :D\n\nAnyway, as you can see, I'm not always disagreeing with these criticisms, and you as a buyer should take them into consideration, as that this is a very, very specialised Tower Defense game. But I certainly like it, and since it is available to try out for free on several flash game websites, you'll have the opportunity to try it out for yourself. And I think you should. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1441984043, "timestamp_updated": 1441984043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17974681": {"recommendationid": "17974681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025964308", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 7976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470496509}, "language": "german", "review": "Die Grafik ist leider potth\u00e4sslich - man erkennt die Monster nicht einmal als solche - absoluter Pixelbrei.

You have an assortment of spells that you must use to counteract sudden bursts of strong enemies, which keeps you on your toes. Unlocking new skills requires smart use of these spells.\n+ Huge amount of content, with nearly 200 maps.\n+ Very atmospheric with creepy graphical effects. When the antagonist starts showing up, the game actually gets quite scary without ever relying on jump scares. \n\nNeutral:\no Lots of grinding. If you like power leveling your characters in RPGs, this will be a pro for you.\no The game isn't inherently challenging. You have to set up your own mix of difficulty options to match your current level and find a sweet spot.\n\nNegative:\n- Hilarious balancing issues. A strong yellow-white dual gem will have over a million DPS, whereas all other gem types usually only have a couple thousand. Monsters can heal over time, but even bosses only regenerate like 15.000 HP per minute. Your one million DPS uber gem will laugh at this, and gems that cancel out those healing powers are oboslete. A strong poison gem in a trap will deal about 7.000 HP of poison damage over time to every monster it hits - not quite so useful when even the swarmer type enemies have 150.000 HP each.\n- Higher difficulties hardly strengthen the first wave of enemies, but the rate at which waves get stronger increases dramatically. You could beat wave 60 without any effort, but then get stomped by wave 80 on the same map. This means that you'll just be sitting there for 20 minutes to then see if you can beat the final few waves.\n- If you use the Chasing Shadows mod, there's huge reliance on RNG. If a Shadow shows up early, its armor is so thick that you cannot damage it and you just die. This adds nothing to the game, it just means that you have to restart the map until no Shadows show up for the first 5-10 waves.\n\nIn the end, the pros still outweigh the cons, especially because most of these flaws are related to high-level play and will not be relevant to you before you've already more than gotten your money's worth out of this game.

For the higher difficulties you need to balance the amount of gems you enrage upcoming waves with, and the amount of mana you spent to upgrade the gems to help kill the incoming enemies.

You build a couple (1-3) towers, upgrade it and, nothing else. The rest of the game is spreadsheet work. Tower types are boring - tower types only differ in how they do damage. There's barely any mazing (you have to build walls, like, 2-3 of them every few maps, but that's it) because most paths are still narrow. There's barely any need to think about coverage/good positioning, because as mentioned earlier you build only a few of them (sometimes even 1) and towers shoot so fast you don't need to think about mobs of weak enemies vs single strong enemy.\n\nThe main depth of the game is in the numerical works, if you're into it. There are only 3 different type of mobs - small medium and large. They differ in armor, regen, may be some extra wacky special but can be summarized as \"tanky stats\". Your tower is pretty much the same, hit armor, hit regen, crit, etc just different way to deal damage. Then there are talismans, which are small bonuses to your damage, mana etc and skills, which allow you to build tower cheapers, deal more damage etc So basically A LOT of numbers and your goal is to balance them until you win. \n\nSo I suppose it's probably fun for people who enjoy a lot of spreadsheet works.

Ridiculus amounts of content and depth for a \"simple\" tower defense game and at a decent price. I have absolutely nothing but warm recommendations for this game. But, in the interest of diversity, I will mention a fair few flaws or gripes.\n\nThe game runs on Flash via Air. This means there's no hope of running this natively on Linux as it stands. It also means it will lag like crazy when you get to wizard levels 1000 and above and you really start to abuse the enrage mechanic and get thousands of monsters on screen at once. For simple story mode or casual play, you'll never notice. But if you're hardcore, lag will become a factor eventually.\n\nIt also means that the entire client will bog down and not respond to inputs as the game lags, this can make controlling the game hard when there's a bajillion things going on at once. Remember to pause your game before issuing commands if you are going into those deep-enrage endurance games.\n\nThe story is about as throwaway as it gets. It gets unraveled as you play and is presented in chunks of text with some basic (but neat) artwork. It's a continuation of a series, so unless you played the previous games, the story may seem a bit disjointed but I feel the devs made a good effort to \"fill you in\" even if you missed the first three. \n\nOtherwise I have nothing but positives for the game. I absolutely detest the tower defense genre. Nothing but uncreative, pretty, cow-clicky games with zero depth and no strategy. They all end up having one super awesome strategy that always works, or having only one solution per level.  Gemcraft though? Totally breaks the mold and makes even a hater love it.

The basic idea is the same: there are paths that the monsters take to your orb and you have to build defenses to stop them. However, GemCraft has by far the most unique features of any TD game. Let's go through a few of them.\n\n-Rather than having a few types of towers with different abilities, you have one tower. Which, upon placing it, does nothing. You need to socket gems in it. There are 9 types of gems, each with their own effects. I hear you think, 'how is this different from 9 types of towers?'. The answer to that is that you can combine each of these gems with other types to your liking. For example, you could have a pure poison gem, that does a lot of poison damage, but mediocre attack damage. You could also make a dual slowing/armor shredding gem, which would both slow enemies and decrease their armor, although both effects will be weaker than if they were in an pure gem. However, the dual gems damage would be higher.\n\n-In addition to towers there are also traps, which will enhance a gems specials, but decrease its damage. The final building you can place are amplifiers, which will boost adjacent gems stats and (if the same type) specials.\n\n-Your currency, mana, is also your health. When a monster reaches your orb you automatically spend a small amount of mana to banish the monster so it reappears at the start of the path. This makes the player be more considerate about upgrading gems, since too little mana reserve means that a few monsters could destroy your orb.\n\n-The ability to anger waves. You can drop a gem bomb on a wavestone, using mana, which will make that wave have more and stronger monsters. However, they will also give more xp and mana! Try to see how much you can anger without getting overwhelmed.\n\n-Every one of the ~190 maps can be beaten on 3 difficulties, and with 9 battle traits to increase both the difficulty and xp gain. If certain new maps become too difficult, try going back and beating some older maps with more traits to gain more xp.\n\n-There are many ways to play. Grinding is never needed to beat the game, but if you want to grind, the option is there, although it would probably make the rest of the game more boring. Maybe you want to use a bunch of gems that are lower grades, or stick to a single gem that is more powerful You could just play through the story and be done with it, or you could push the game to its limits, seeing how far you can get on endurance.\n\n-There are 25 skills that can make you stronger. However, the cost increases with the level of your skills, and skill points also give you some more mana to start maps with, so it is wise not to spend them all.\n\nThe one and only complaint I have about this game is its horrible preformance. Since it runs on flash it will drop to 1 fps or even less when there are thousands upon thousands of enemies on the screen. However, these situations will only be encountered if you want to push the game's limits. If you are a casual player you will not have any problems with this.\n\nGemCraft is one of the best games I've ever played and I would definitely recommend it, especially for tower defense fans: prepare for a game that will change the way you view the tower defense genre!

Car c'est l\u00e0 la grande force de GemCraft : la libert\u00e9.\n\nLes TD fonctionnent souvent sur des rails. Tr\u00e8s immobiles et rapidement contemplatifs, ils finissent par lasser. Ici, vous cr\u00e9ez des gemmes comme vous le sentez, et vous les ench\u00e2ssez dans des tours. Vous pouvez cr\u00e9er des emplacements de tours, en supprimer, combiner des gemmes entre elles, renforcer leur puissance, etc. Il n'y a pratiquement aucune limite et plut\u00f4t que de proposer un level design t\u00e9l\u00e9guid\u00e9, GemCraft fait appel \u00e0 l'imagination du joueur. Il n'y a pas une, ou deux, ou m\u00eame trois fa\u00e7ons de passer un niveau, mais bien des dizaines. De ce point de vue, on peut dire que GemCraft le Spacechem des Tower Defense.\n\nAutre point tr\u00e8s fort de ce jeu : sa pr\u00e9cision. La plupart des TD se contentent d'indications approximatives, du genre : archer fort contre volant, feu efficace contre eau. Ici, il y a des pourcentahes, des chiffres pr\u00e9cis qu'on cherche \u00e0 optimiser, des cadences indiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 la seconde pr\u00e8s. Cette dimension apporte \u00e0 GemCraft un c\u00f4t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s technique.

You can then craft gems, combine gems, upgrade gems and socket them into these tower base. \n\nCompleting levels give you exp. You can make the levels/waves tougher and add exp modifiers. This exp is used to level up your character. Each level gives you 7 skill points, which can be spent on unlocked skills. Skills are unlocked by completing objectives in certain levels.\n\n2. Level Design: 5/10\n\nThe levels are rather quite restrictive. Most of the times it's quite obvious as to where to build the towers. There are very few levels which encourage heavy mazing.\n\nIn the 8 hours I played this game, I found the gameplay to be rather repititive, specially because of the level design.\n\n3. Soundtrack: 2/10\n4. Story: Irrelevant/can be ignored.\n5. Aesthetics: 4/10\n6. 1080p, fullscreen/borderless window: YES.\n\n7. Final thoughts\n\nThe game is worth picking up because you will defintely enjoy the first 10 hours. After that, it's kind of a hit or miss. I, personally, abandoned the game after 8 hours simply because I got my fill out of it.

The ability to combine gems in any manner you choose gives you an insane amount of possibilities for how to build your defences, as well as having traps, towers, and amplifiers to place those gems in. \n\nEvery field is a different challenge that requires different strategies to beat, and with 191 of them, that's a lot of strategies you can use. (Ok, really there's about a dozen different strategies, but you can implement them in a lot of different ways).\n\nThis is by far the best 2D tower defence game I have ever played (or seen, for that matter) and I would personally rank it in the top 3 of all TD games.

It is the most extensive and in depth Tower Defense game.\n\nIt is at the same size as the 3rd part GC:Labyrinth or maybe even a bit larger, hard to say. It is mostly about the endgame and the path you take to it. While in GCL you were 95% of the endgame afk and waited for the remaining ~1100 waves (of 1337) to destroy, in GCCS you have to stay vigilant till the last of the 999 waves. Even with a good Wizard Level you will have a hard time destroying the last 10 waves on harder dificulty. This is because the HP and armor isn't capped compared to GCL. At some point of the game you have all data presented you in exponential style.\nSome here say that you need to grind older levels to progress, that is definitly not true. In my current game I've redone only about 10 lvls so far. To get more exp out the levels I cramp up the difficulty for new levels too, that way I don't need to redo them over and over again to get to the end.\n\nThe gem crafting is more indepth as it looks on the first glance. When you reach a certain point in the game, gems combined in a special way are stronger than just normal 'u'pped gems. There are several guides and even a gem combining tool to help out with the crafting.\n\nWhile there is a free version in the Internet, it is limited in some aspects (less skills, no endless mode, etc).

Previous games in the series were free flash games -- one of which has an option to register your copy for $5, to get some XP and unlock a few skills.  Which I did twice, on different websites, without hesitation.  To see if you'll like this game, google Gemcraft Labyrinth and try five or eight levels.\n\nCons; this installment has a short but noticeable loading screen before every level.  Also, if it's anything like the others, it will also have an exponential difficulty curve, making the later levels hard as hell.\n\nPros, games in this series have tons and tons of levels, and can take weeks to months to beat into submission.  It has all of the user interface improvements that the series has gradually been accumulating (keyboard shortcuts particularly), plus a few new little tweaks here and there.  There are also enough tiny little tricks to learn, that skill and practice do seem to help, though not as much as strategy.  There is also an endless version of each level, letting you hypothetically keep leveling up forever.\n\n[edit] Fifty-some gameplay hours later, the above holds true.  Previous entries in the series had a difficulty curve that periodically jerked upwards, providing these little areas where you could get stuck if you hadn't leveled up enough (especially near bosses).  This game has those moments too, but they're much less steep and much further apart -- meaning you can go back, replay the first 5 levels with your new skills and powers, and come out of it with enough levels and XP to get past the part you were struggling with.  A+.\n\n[edit 2] Two hundred hours in.  There are achievements for gaining levels, the highest one is for level 200.  I'm in the mid 800's now.  I think I overleveled.  Some levels are still hard.  I accidentally won yesterday, but I'm not done collecting all of the things.  Going for 100%, only 50-some achievements left to go.

Mana = money, with it you craft gem types to place in towers for different effects (chain damage, slowing, armor break, and a lot of effects not normally seen in tower defense actually). You can also make 'gem bombs' any time for aoe damage or to destroy one of your own structures (the base structures cannot be sold). I like the sort of old-school feel of the maps, and minor path-building is available, except on the few maps I've tried the paths are too thin to lengthen much yet. \n\nTons of skill points to spend (unspent goes to initial money/mana, I think that's a cool mechanic), talismans, and other goodies. Hundreds of achievements. Lots of menu options too, all with mouseover explanations. \n\nOther notes: \nThey seem to still be releasing updates like bug fixes and such\nHas 2 window size modes, full screen and drag to any size. I love drag to resize, but for some reason this disables Steam overlay/ screenshots for this particular game. \nIt has some story too, which I never care about, but the good thing is they dont bother you with it. It's just there in notes if you want to read them. Nicely done!\n\n\nOverall:\nThis game won't put you in awe, but it seems to be a very good quality game; it feels solid.  Definitely worth a few bucks on sale (66% or better) for TD fans, otherwise, I probably wouldn't go for full price.

You can still play it there for free with a majority of the content there. I am not exactly sure what exactly is missing because I purchased this oon steam as soon as I saw it but if it is anything like the other games in the series you can get agreat taste for the game for free. I played the other gemcraft games for hundreds of hours before I donated to the developer. I just hope that the older games will get moved to steam as well, I would love to play them through again just for the story.\n\nFor some cons, at the end of the day its still a flash tower defense game, if $10 feels like it is a bit steep for something you can play online for free then thats perfectly ok. I purchased it because I love this dev and want to see more. After a while it can feel repetative, but I feel that that only happens to me when I don't bother to increase the difficulty of the levels and in this version it gives you even more options to do so. But if you don't want to have to manage your own difficulty level to suit your needs then maybe look elsewhere. The game is long and if you play each level on the easiest difficulty then you probably will get bored eventually. If this is your first foray into the series you will be lost in the story. It picks up where the last gemcraft ended and provides you with some backstory but not nearly as much as I would have liked. However, the other games are all free so there is no reason not to go back and play them if you want. The graphics are not spectacular, but they have their unique style and it helps when you have something like 400 units coming on the screen at one time and being attacked by 20 different towers. \n\nOverall this is a great game in a great series and I cant wait to see more from this dev.

Sure, some of its graphics aren't HD and look a little bit shoddy, but I don't mind at all as the actual mechanics are excellent. The use of traps, various spells, gem bombs, gem specialization and the different ways you can approach a certain map/level (e.g. by the use of traits) make the game so much more than just regular ol' Tower Defense where you build a maze for monsters to walk through and occasionally cast a fireball or something.\n\nWhile you are expected to replay maps in order to level up, I don't feel like it's too \"grindy\" because different difficulty levels and traits keep each map playthrough interesting and fresh.\n\nMy minor annoyances with the game are interface/accessibility based (i.e. no ability to rebind hotkeys).\n\nI'm almost at 40 hours and I don't even think I'm half-way through the game yet. I can't stress enough how cost-efficient Gemcraft is for $10. Overall, I'm just super happy with my purchase. I would recommend Gemcraft to any Strategy fan who doesn't mind pixelated graphics, even if they're new to Tower Defense games. Although the game is complex, I don't believe that it's too complex for those new to Tower Defense (the tutorial book inside the game is excellent).\n\nThere's a free web-based version of Gemcraft also available on http://www.armorgames.com. To view the differences between the Steam version and the free web-based version, read this: http://steamcommunity.com/games/296490/announcements/detail/218766097301703024\n\nOn a final note, you might have heard of Kingdom Rush and/or Plants Vs.

As an avid GemTD, Wintermaul, and ElementTD player, I can say that GemCraft is the BEST TD I've played yet. Here's why:\n\n[b]Mazing in a Map[/b]\nOne of the problems with games like ElementTD was that you were never able to maze. At the mercy of the map players are forced into placing their powerful towers in obvious places. Oh look, there's a bend where my tower is able to get as much exposure as possible, guess I'd be foolish to not put it there. \n\nIn GemCraft players are allowed, and encouraged, to manipulate the creeps' pathing. On multiple -- and frequent --  occasions the player is presented with a variety of choices as to how they want the creeps to move throughout the map. Not only that but, after you destroy spawning huts (located on certain levels) you're able to dynamically reorient your choke points [the game will warn you if you're trying to 'block' the creeps from getting to your orb] making you pay attention at all times. \n\n[b]Gems and Their Mechanics[/b]\nGems come in 9 different types all with effects ranging from slowing enemies to breaking their armor and can be upgraded, combined, and even  spent on making waves harder (more on this later). Unlike towers in most TD games gems can be repositioned without any cost to the player's resource, the only downside is that the gem needs to resocket itself which takes a few seconds. \n\nWhat sets GemCraft outside of traditional TDs is how gems interact with traps, bombs, tower pedestals, wave enhancements, and amplifiers. Unlike most TDs players can place trap slots throughout their mazes. These slots do not block movement and the gems inside trigger when enemies pass over them -- they are not consumed and can be moved to tower pedestals at the player's will. What's interesting is that the damage of the gem is greatly reduced (%80) however its effect is multiplied by an enormous amount. In some maps I never used a tower what so ever, just a lot of traps and some powerful synergy between the game's progression and RPG elements. \n\nTower pedestals are slots for gems that allow them to function like towers. Gems will attack monsters that pass by and inflict their special effects if they can. Pedestals can be placed all over the map so long as they don't block the creeps from the orb (though they can redirect them).\n\nAmplifies are placed adjacent to pedestals and increase the damage, attack speed, range, and special effect modifiers of the gems inside the towers. The cost: the gems can't attack. A balance between leveling the primary gem and the gems in the amplifiers is needed for best results.\n\nBombs are essentially consumed gems which a player can drop anywhere on the battlefield. Their damage and effects are increased and help players mop up monsters that pass through their defences. Though I haven't focused on bombing or specializing into it I certainly like the idea of making a skill build that supports their use. \n\nBombs can also be used to enhance incoming monster waves by increasing their stats (HP/Armor) and by spawning more monsters \n\n[i]Mechanic: both high and low level gems will increase the incoming wave's stats by a fixed amount that rises the more gem bombs you use to enhance the wave. Higher level gems will increase the monster spawn count by a larger amount depending on level. Confused? Allow me to elaborate.\n\n\nYou have a wave that consists of 10 reavers, each with 100 hp and 5 armor. If you drop a low ranked gem bomb (rank 1) the wave will have an additional 2 reavers, instead of 100 hp and 5 armor they will now all have 110hp and 7 armor. However, if you use a high gem rank (let's say 10+) the wave will gain an additional 20 reavers all of which will have 110 hp and 7 armor. If you wanted to you could get the wave to spawn an additional 20 reavers with rank 1 gems however the stats of the reavers in that wave would be ridiculous -- probably 500 hp and 100 armor.[/i]\n\nSo why the hell would you want to fight and kill more reavers?! The trick is that it helps you later on. The added reavers all grant experience and mana (the game's currency and life support) and, if you're demolishing the early waves, can help you stock pile experience and mana for the later parts of the game. In essence the game's difficulty is dynamic and influenced by the player, every wave is as hard or as easy as the player wants it to be. \n\n[b]RPG Elements Hooooo![/b]\nAs a player accumulates more experience and ventures through the hexgrid they will gain skill points, skills, spells, enhancements, talisman fragments, and battle traits. \n\nSkills are more like talents in that they are all passive. Some of the skills in the game include effects like: gems placed into traps have their special modifiers increased, poison from poison gems is more effective, monsters reward more mana per kill, decreased cost of building and combining gems .... the list goes on and on. The best part: most skills have no maximum level! This seems OP right? Well it isn't. Each time a skill is leveled it requires 1 more skill point to level up: \n\nRank 0 to 1 [1 skill point]\nRank 1 to 2 [2 skill points]\nRank 2 to 3 [3 skill points] \n\nSee the trend? \n\n[b]There's a catch.[/b] For every skill point you don't spend on skills you gain 7 initial mana. So if you had 100 skill points you'd start with 700 more mana. Allocate too many points and you might find that the early waves demolish you. Balance is the key. \n\nThe only spell I have right now is the freeze spell. Usable anywhere and instantaneously deployable the freeze spell .... freezes monsters. Not much else to say but hey, you can spec into reducing the cooldown of freeze if you like it a lot. I'm sure there are more but I've yet to come across them.\n\nEnhancements are temporary, or when used on a trap permanent, buffs that recharge over time and can be bestowed upon any tower or trap on the map. My favorite by far is the beam enhancement which, you guessed it, makes the gem shoot a beam of armor ignoring blazing light to enemies who are within the tower's range. This lasts 12 seconds and can be increased to 16 with enough points (probably more if I spent more points on the skill). \n\nTalisman Fragments is the game's equivalent to gear, although much less interesting and impactful. Fragments can be slotted, upgraded, and their effects span from increased damage to reavers (screw reavers ... man) to increasing the player's starting mana. The fragments drop randomly from monsters and have a rarity system. I'm hoping to find some fragments that increase length of my beam enhancement...\n\nBattle traits are map modifiers that increase the level's experience multiplier. Often times they make the game harder however, stack enough of them in a single map and you could be pulling in 8 times the experience for each monster slain! Off the top of my hard is a trait that makes waves come faster while another makes giants more resilient (+HP/+Armor) and slightly more mobile. Traits have 7 levels of effectiveness and multiply experience gain by +0.3 (or 30% MORE exp).\n\n[b]Closing[/b]\nSeriously, the game is $9.99 and it's worth every virtual penny. There's a lot I didn't mention about the game including skill synergy, particular gem combinations, and endurance mode. If you're looking for a cross between a TD and an RPG, along with a metric crap-ton of replay value then I urge you to purchase this game. \n\nThere are very few games that are challenging these days and GemCraft is one that will make you think, pause frequently, and hate yourself for being overzealous -- 300 swarmlings at wave level 10?

It distinguishes itself from other games in that you don't really have different towers to build, but you can mix different types of gems together in order to build/customize exactly the gem you want.\n\nSome pro's:\n- Tons of content (lots of levels, multiple modes of play, multiple difficulties)\n- Tons of customization (skills, talismans, battle traits, difficulty, crafting your own gems)\n- Lots of depth, the game has many interesting mechanics, such as banishment, amplifiers, enraging.\n- Fairly good tutorial\n- Quite some secrets\n\nSo basically it has everything you could ever want from a tower defence game. Here's some cons:\n- The optimization is terrible. When you do endurance runs, be prepared for about 1fps. My computer was top of the crop about a year ago, and it dies playing this simple flash game.\n- It can be very grindy. This depends on what you do though. If your goal is to beat endurance run, be prepared for a very long grind. \n- Making the perfect gem combinations is extremely tedious and full of weird math. Some people like this, I personally don't.

Die Eigenschaften k\u00f6nnen dabei wie im Vorg\u00e4nger auch frei kombiniert werden, so kann man beispielsweise einen der namensgebenden Gems herstellen, dessen Schaden auf nahegelegene Gegner \u00fcberspringt, die Gegner verlangsamt und vergiftet. Das funktioniert intuitiv und ist vom Balancing her im normalen Spielverlauf durchaus gelungen.\n\nEs sei erw\u00e4hnt, dass es das Spiel auf einigen Webseiten als Flashversion gibt, die beschr\u00e4nkt kostenlos spielbar ist. Grenzt sich die Steam Version also gen\u00fcgend on dieser ab, um den Kauf zu rechtfertigen? Jein. Einerseits bekommt man durch die Steam Version Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud Save (bzw. muss so nicht noch einen weiteren Account erstellen, falls man bei der Konkurrenz noch keinen hat) sowie die M\u00f6glichkeit ohne Browser zu spielen, jedoch hat sich die Performance des Spiels kaum verbessert. Selbst mit minimalen Details kommt es bei gro\u00dfen Gegnermassen auf dem Bildschirm regelm\u00e4\u00dfig nur zu einer einstelligen Anzahl an Bildern pro Sekunde. Dies mag anhand der puren Menge an Ereignissen (Tausend Gegner mal tausend Geschosse pro Sekunde mal Schadensweiterleitung vom Ziel zu umstehenden Zielen), ist jedoch \u00e4u\u00dferst \u00e4rgerlich. Dies tritt w\u00e4hrend der Kampagne selten auf, im Aushalte-Modus jedoch st\u00e4ndig, wenn man denn m\u00f6glichst viele (Erfahrungs-)punkte bekommen m\u00f6chte. Aber auch wenn gerade nur moderat viele Gegner auf dem Bildschirm zu sehen sind, bleibt das Spiel auf 30 Bilder pro Sekunde beschr\u00e4nkt.\n\nEine wirkliche Neuerung in der Steam Version ist der Iron Wizard Modus mit dem Ziel, das Spiel in einer etwas pureren Form abzuschlie\u00dfen. Diese Herausforderung wird mit einem Achievement belohnt und ist durchaus strategisch wesentlich anspruchsvoller als der normale Modus, in dem man die einzelnen Levels erneut spielen kann um mehr Erfahrungspunkte und damit Punkte f\u00fcr kleine Verbesserungen sowie einen Talisman sein Eigen nennt, in dem man passive Verbesserungen f\u00fcr die eigene Spielweise anwenden kann. Dieser Iron Wizard Modus (IWM) macht dabei durchaus Spa\u00df, kann aber nicht dar\u00fcber hinwegt\u00e4uschen, dass er keine neuen Level mitbringt, und man so im Zweifelsfalle zumindest schoneinmal das Mazing f\u00fcr das Level ausgearbeitet hat. Leider ist der Modus dabei nicht vom Start an verf\u00fcgbar, sodass man zumindest einige der Levels - und die ersten sind im IWM dadurch extrem einfach - im normalen Modus spielen muss.\n\nWer Levels nicht gerne wiederholt verpasst indes im normalen Spiel die Jagd nach immer h\u00f6heren Zauberer-Leveln, die durch immer extremer einstellbare Levels erlangt werden k\u00f6nnen. Wer andere Ziele f\u00fcr sein Spiel sucht, kann dabei auf die Achievement-Jagd gehen. Davon gibt es \u00fcber 400 St\u00fcck, die von tutorialartigen Nicht-Herausforderungen (wie etwa das anklicken eines Gegners) \u00fcber bestimmte Spielarten (benutze Modifizerung x auf Level y mit mindestens St\u00e4rke z) bis hin zu absichtlichem kurz-vor-knapp-Spielen und dahingehenden Risiken zum Verlust des Levels beim Versuch, diese zu erlangen. Die Achievements sind dabei ingame eingebunden - so werden levelbeschr\u00e4nkte Achievements bei diesen als Hinweis gezeigt - und geben marginale spielerische Vorteile. Wer beides nicht mag wird naturgem\u00e4\u00df wenig Wiederspielwert finden.\n\nDie Benutzerfreundlichkeit ist im Spiel dabei vorbildlich, Tutorials sind in die Kampagne eingebaut, ohne dabei Funktionen zu beschr\u00e4nken, die Steuerung ist intuitiv und die Anpassbarkeit der Levels vorbildlich. Die Grafik ist dabei recht gut, aber weit davon entfernt, Preise zu gewinnen oder die Levelhintergr\u00fcnde in 1080p nativ dargestellt zu werden. Das Spiel bietet dabei an, die Grafikeffekte anhand der Bildrate anzupasen, wie jedoch erw\u00e4hnt bringt dies nur bis zu einem bestimmten Punkt etwas. Anfangs lassen sich auch kurze Partien spielen, die jedoch sp\u00e4ter oder im Aushalte-Modus durchaus lange andauern k\u00f6nnen. Die kurzen Levels am Anfang eignen sich jedoch aufgrund der unangenehm langen Ladezeiten trotzdem wenig f\u00fcr zwischendurch. \u00c4rgerlich ist zudem das Fehlen einer Schnell-R\u00fccksetz Funktion, wenn man sich am Anfang eines Levels vertut. Ebenfalls fehlen Speicherpunkte innerhalb der Levels, offizielle Ranglisten oder weitere offizielle Herausforderungen neben dem Iron Wizard Modus.\n\nIm Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen ein gelungenes Spiel mit deutlichen Schw\u00e4chen in Bereichen, die sich verschmerzen lassen, wenn man Zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig denkt und zu etwas Frust bereit ist, wenn man mal wieder zu hoch gepokert hat.", "timestamp_created": 1433510792, "timestamp_updated": 1433510792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16200672": {"recommendationid": "16200672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076667081", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433807886}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc5b4\ub835\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc5b4\uc694!!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1433492979, "timestamp_updated": 1433492979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.940886", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16196944": {"recommendationid": "16196944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016411652", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475456807}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is phenomenal.

The tower defence genre is possibly me favourite genre beside RPG, so I was excited to see that the series is classed as one of the best in the genre. It works exactly like any other tower defence, the enemies have a set path to follow and you build your defense around said path. What I found to be very interested with GemCraft is, that your resource supply that you use to build your defences, is also actually your health pool of the crystal you are defending. As you kill the enemies, you gain mana, and in turn this increases your crystal's health, I found that to be an excellent feature and one that I had not seen before. \n\nNo, the graphics aren't anything to rave about, but you don't need anything fancy for this type of game, all of the enemy sprites are nicely drawn as well as the environments you play in.  Each stage has a different path layout, along with different features on each map, such as gate locks, which have to be destroyed by your towers in so many turns before they automatically wipe your crystal out, this along with plenty other different scenarios (not all negative ones, some actually help you) make it that little bit more interesting to play. \n\nI found the difficulty/learning curve to be quite high here, the first two or three levels are really quite easy, but as soon as you start hitting level 4+, bearing in mind that there is 190 levels in this game, the difficulty really starts to pick up. I'm on about level 30 and each stage takes me a good four or five attempt before I manage to work out the best way to complete it. \n\nGiven the amount of levels, achievements and replayability in GemCraft, I can easily say that there is well over a hundred hours of content if you want to put the effort in. That is an amazing amount of gameplay for a game like this. \n\nTower defence lovers will almost certainly love GemCraft, and if this is a genre you always wanted to try, GemCraft is one of the classics that will keep you entertained for hours on end. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

(about half of it spent with Gemcraft Labyrinth).\n\nGemcraft has always been my favourite tower defense game by far, the difference between this series and any other TD is just ridiculous. Main reasons why I love this series as a whole:\n\n[list]\n [*][b]Pause button and ability to act during pause[/b]. I hate TD's where I need to act quickly. This allows me to think about what to do at any time I want to.\n\n [*][b]Pretty much everything has a hotkey[/b], which makes the gameplay a bit smoother compared to clicking everything.\n\n [*][b]You're always doing something.[/b] It's really rare that you get through a wave without building or doing some micromanagement with your towers.\n\n [*][b]The math in the game. Everything is told with calculatable numbers.[/b] I hate TD's that only tell something like \"A high damage, low speed missile tower\" with no numbers to tell me what it really does.\n\n [*][b]148 levels.[/b] This is not some basic \"get high score in these 10 levels\" tower defense, but it has a story/lore, hidden stuff, multiple ways of progression/upgrades, etc.\n\n [*][b]The insanely good difficulty scaling.[/b] It's not an automatic scaling, but I can choose how difficult I want the game to be. At easiest, it's pretty easy (and boring) to be honest. But you can adjust stuff that changes the gameplay a lot like \"next wave comes faster\", \"you gain mana in waves instead of a constant stream\", \"faster scaling\", \"reduced effect of Slow\", and of course, endurance mode in any level. You can enable multiple different things at once, and harder settings means more exp = more skills = you can go for even higher difficulty.\n\n [*][b]Difficulty scaling from \"easier than breathing\" to \"failed in first wave\" also means that this game has a difficulty for anyone.[/b] Want casual click-and-watch-explosions? You got it. Want to see how long you can survive against impossible odds? You got it.\n\n [*][b]Every fail is caused by you and you only.[/b] The problem I see with most TD's is the situation where you think \"I have no idea which order I should build these towers to complete this level\". But because of the difficulty scaling and the complexity of the game in general, I've never had that feeling in Gemcraft. The difficulty scaling causes me to always try harder settings before hitting a wall of \"oh sh*t I went too high\". But because it was my own choice to begin with, it's just a facepalm moment and retry, instead of feeling that the game is peeing in my cereals.\n\n [*][b]Continuing with difficulty scaling: even in mid-fight, you can make any wave of monsters harder by spending mana on it[/b]. Killing these waves rewards you with even more mana, but doing this requires you to really know your limits: anger them too much and they'll eat you alive. Using this mechanic is pretty much required to beat the hardest levels and difficulties, and it turns the game to a constant balancing of \"how much can I take?\". This mechanic is unique among the TD's that I've played, and it's also one of the many reasons I love this game.\nThe usual \"get a bonus by sending in the next wave earlier\" is there aswell.\n\n [*][b]The whole series is pretty much like Dark Souls of the tower defense genre.[/b] If you get into it, you'll say that it's the best one. The caveat is that it isn't the easiest game to get into, and it isn't for everyone.\n[/list]\n\n\nThe free version of this game can be found at http://armorgames.com/play/15760/gemcraft-chasing-shadows. I'm not even sure what's the difference because I bought this edition instantly after noticing it's on Steam. But I'd say go try the free one, and if you notice that you run out of content before getting bored with the game, come back here.\n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b] In the end it's still a tower defense game, but it's filled with loads of unique ideas/mechanics and [i]everything[/i] is polished to the limit and above. For me it's the game that made every other TD suck just because they aren't nearly as good as Gemcraft.", "timestamp_created": 1431928883, "timestamp_updated": 1492583454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 192, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.921521", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15881786": {"recommendationid": "15881786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096892058", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 10426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485974388}, "language": "english", "review": "GemCraft is a genre-defining masterpiece.

(Cue the \"Lrn 2 Play\" people) It should be random, and not structured, because that's part of the challenge. But there really should be some sort of control. Minimum wave before the first shadow, or minimum wave between shadows, or maximum number of shadows per number of waves. Something to make 107/7 not equal 3 more often than not.\n\nThis is a pretty minor complaint in the grand scheme of things though. You are not obligated to activate that trait.

There are tons of ways to customize the level and difficulty, both before and during the level. It's kind of like an old arcade game, where you're trying to reach the high score and there is no defined ending.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does suffer a bit because of it. There's never a need to stop and reconsider your strategy, you can always just go around grinding for exp until you can brute force through the game. The monsters are just walking numbers with hardly any relevant features. The bosses are nice, but you usually don't need any special strategies to beat them, just keep shooting with your strongest gem. The gem types aren't well balanced at all, you always need to go for highest damage output and ignore utility because monsters will get exponentially more healthy as the time goes, but they will not get significantly faster or regen more health or anything that would make you want to use utility gems.\n\nThis is very unlike games like Kingdom Rush where you have only 4 tower types (can be upgraded into some specialist towers later), huge variety of opponents and only few places to place your towers. In that game, you need build specific things to counter specific enemies. In Gemcraft? Nope, just combine yellow with red and upgrade whenever you can.\n\nThere are probably some techniques needed to beat endurance (1337 waves I think) or get grade 100 gems, but even then it's mostly about grinding enough experience to be able to do it.\n\nThe strong point of Gemcraft is all the customization. There's really a ton of ways you can play. But why would you? If you go too far with the difficulty buffs, you're not gonna beat it no matter what. If you go too low, you'll be bored to death. It's hard to find the sweet spot. It never feels like there's a challenge that needs strategy and wit because you can beat everything if you grind for more experience.\n\nIt's a good time waster when you're tired and just want to get instant gratification by doing nothing. But 10 bucks... Nah.  Don't.

Nothing special here. :D\n\nIt is maybe comparable in quality with Kingdom Rush, but (much) more complex, and way darker in style. I know no other relevant tower defense game to compare with.\n\nYou defend yourself on many stages (levels, maps) against waves of bug-like monsters coming through predefined (but not limited) path to your wizard core. Your defense consist of firing towers along the path you can equip with different types of gems. These gems define what kind of attack shot will tower use (for example slowing, poison, chain, mana steal), and gem types can be combined together. You buy towers and gems for mana that is slowly replenishing by itself, but mostly you gain it from killing monsters. Funny twist is that your wizard core can \"banish\" monsters reaching it in exchange for some of your mana burning up, if you have enough of it (and there are ways to decrease banishment cost). You usually lose a stage when your core is reached by a monster and you have no mana left for banishment at the same time. And this is just core mechanics. \nBut did you know, that on stages you can also: use gems as one shot bombs alone or to activate powerful shrines, build power amplifiers for gem towers, use several special skills and spells to curse monsters or enhance gem tower damage, collect special rewards from destructible buildings, boost your mana pool from harvesting mana shards, kill mysterious apparitions for more rewards?\nAnd if it is not too much for you yet, there is campaign map, where you progress through stages and explore new areas, there are exp and levels that contribute to your skill points, and there are talismans you can equip for various bonuses ingame.\nAnd surprisingly it is not complicated game to play. If you wish to play brutally simply you can. And if you feel like you are up for challenge, you can try to use all of your options at the same time.\n\nTo sum it up:\n+ Solid but original and complex tower defense\n+ Control over many aspects of game difficulty, before starting and during battle, so you can push your limits\n+ Nine gem types to combine, several meaningful skills and spells, talisman system bonuses, over 400 achievements\n+ Background storyline about wizards, forgotten evil and lost rituals\n+ \"Dark-themed\" visual style and storyline are nice contrast to some \"lightly\" taken TD games\n+- There are many, many stages to beat\n+- You can reach ridiculous wizard levels if you are dedicated enough \n- Lets face it, it gets repetitive after some time\n- No gamma correction means less visible details, unless you brighten your display settings\n- There are some disbalancing, yet not game breaking mechanics, especially on higher levels\n\nFinal conclusion:\nStrongly recommend this game!", "timestamp_created": 1430942411, "timestamp_updated": 1431064227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527993", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15716970": {"recommendationid": "15716970", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969931877", "num_games_owned": 596, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431563557}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the culminating game in the GemCraft series.

Russian review: http://igrotop.com/games/gemcraft_chapter_2_chasing_shadows/posts/obzor_gemcraft_2_chasing_shadows\n\n'King's Bounty' series is the best tower defense game for pc in my oppinion, yet Gemcraft Chapter 2 is right next to it and will definetly take much more time from me. This is well polished and super content-wide game. The problem with most tower defense games is their short campaign, but here we have a hundreds of levels X 3 difficulties, so its always enaught things to do. The amulet is really good idea for a game, which makes it feel more like RPG (Diablo-style). Not that many games feature such a nice randomisation of monsters and items (talisman fragments).\n\nThe other good side is very wide options, so every player can work around visuals a lot. Resolution looks good on my 1920x1080 and FPS is high at max settings with quite an old PC. Also its rare to find a good atmosphere for towers-game \u2014 thanks to those graphics, visuals and weather it feels deep and satisfying. But the most significant is the traits system, which makes this game super unique even among RPG-s and H&S genres.\n\nThe only problem is: to play it at full power, i will have to find and deliver a whole day just for Gemcraft 2. And thats good, since Terraria and Titan Quest was the only games being able to cause such interest for me. And this game is pretty much cheap for its wide content.\n\n-----\n\nAnd a negatice article... I really dont like an idea of getting 2-7 or even more wizard levels at once after beating a single map at the early-game. The leveling system would feel much better if you could gain those levels slowly. Also for me its pretty hard to figure out which map was first beaten and which was the second and so on. After you upgrade and gain more strenght you are coming to replay old levels, but, unfortunatly, there is no good guide or assistence on understanding which map you should re-clear right now to get benefits. That causing a confusion, since i am forsed to note every single level after beating it. Moreover, its hard to find levels placements, since they all look the same from World Map view and there is no even explanation which letter is first / second / etc. But hey, thats just my own problems with game, it dosnt mean everyone will suffer from similar feelings.", "timestamp_created": 1430935614, "timestamp_updated": 1430935614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447464", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15714427": {"recommendationid": "15714427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108699917", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 417, "last_played": 1515234359}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc720\ub2db \ud569\uce58\uae30\n\uc720\ub2db \uc0c1\ud55c\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc5c5\uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\n20\uac00\uc9c0 \uc2a4\ud0ac(+\uc5c5\uae00 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc120\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc2a4\ud0ac)\n\ucd94\uac00 \ud328\uc2dc\ube0c \ub2a5\ub825 \uc544\uc774\ud15c15\uce78\n\uc0c1\ud55c\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc720\uc800\ub808\ubca8\n\uac8c\uc784\uc2dc\uc791\uc804 \ud2b9\uc218\uae30\ub2a5 9\uac00\uc9c0(\uc801 \ud53c\ud1b5\uc99d\uac00,\uc801 \uc774\ub3d9\uc18d\ub3d9\ub3c4 \uc99d\uac00 \ub4f1\ub4f1)\n\uc6e8\uc774\ube0c \uac15\ud654(\uc6d0\ud558\ub294\ub9cc\ud07c \uac15\ub825\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uacbd\ud5d8\uce58\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568)\n\uc5d4\ub4dc\ub9ac\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub4dc\n\uac8c\uc784 \uc911\uac04\uc911\uac04\uc5d0 \ub098\uc624\ub294 \ubc29\ud574\uafbc\ub4e4\n\ub4f1\ub4f1 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub514\ud39c\uc2a4 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcfc \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.......\n\ud2b9\ud788 \uc774\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4...\uadf8\ub798\uc11c \ub354\uc6b1 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778\uac70 \uac19\uc544\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1430928404, "timestamp_updated": 1447330224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15714020": {"recommendationid": "15714020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009907235", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474643024}, "language": "english", "review": "A well polished game.

While a classic tower defense game requires you to build and upgrade static towers, in Gemcraft the only static part you will place, are sockets for gems (two entirely different socket types are available). And costs for sockets will become neglectable in the later game. The gem placed in a socket again does all the shooting and killing monsters. This gives the incredible advantage to combine and relocate shooting power at will.\n\nGemcraft - Chasing Shadows is part of the Gemcraft series, which can be found on Armor Games. I spent nights over nights and countless hours playing Gemcraft Labyrinth. I also dislike in-game purchases, so the Steam release, which delivers the full game (and more) for a one time purchase, is really awesome.\n\nOne interesting thing about Gemcraft is, that everything works exponentially. If you have a thing for numbers, you'll probably love this. For example a grade 2 gem features roughly twice the power of a grade 1 gem and a grade 3 gem twice the power of a grade 2 gem and so on. Costs also increase at the same rate and enemy strength does as well. So in lategame you will find yourself surrounded by very interesting looking numbers. :)\n\nBesides the main tower defense action, Gemcraft features a variety to improve yourself like skill points, which will provide most advantage when precisely balanced between skills and unspent points, or talisman fragments, which feature a random loot and enhancing system. It's also possible to make the game harder. Alot harder. Just add your favourite battle traits to the battle.\n\nFurther than that there are also countless other features, like gem bombing, dwellings, monster nests, mana pool management, shrines, apparations, and more.\n\nAll together there is little I can not recommend in this game.\nGo, play this game now, it's awesome!", "timestamp_created": 1430912242, "timestamp_updated": 1430941521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15710642": {"recommendationid": "15710642", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987787088", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433064451}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best tower defense games I have ever played, the way you mold your gems to create different tower attributes is one of the best features I have seen.", "timestamp_created": 1430906912, "timestamp_updated": 1430907652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15710136": {"recommendationid": "15710136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015072699", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480646940}, "language": "english", "review": "The game that essentially took the cake with the genre has finally come to Steam!

So its good for every1.\n\nStop reading and just go play lol\n\nLots of replayabilities and Lots of replayabilities :)\n\nI would give it a 5 out of 5\n\nSorry if my english was bad and i hope you will enjoy this game \n\nMelovia", "timestamp_created": 1430897092, "timestamp_updated": 1430897258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580155", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15709302": {"recommendationid": "15709302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096526092", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479179520}, "language": "schinese", "review": " \u70ba\u4e86\u8b93 \u66f4\u591a\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u9019\u500b\u6e2c\u8a55\uff0c\u5c08\u9580\u7528\u4e86\u6b63\u9ad4\u5b57 \uff1a\uff09\n\n\u73a9\u5bb6\u626e\u6f14\u7684\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u5c08\u7cbe\u4f7f\u7528\u5404\u7a2e\u5bf6\u77f3\u7684\u5deb\u5e2b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528mana\u7149\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\u985e\u578b\u7684\u5bf6\u77f3\uff08\u95dc\u5361\u6703\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u5bf6\u77f3\u985e\u578b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u628a\u5bf6\u77f3\u7528\u4f86\u9632\u79a6\u5404\u7a2e\u9b54\u7269\u7684\u9032\u653b\u3002\n\u5bf6\u77f3\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u6709\uff1a\u88dd\u7f6e\u5728\u5854\u5167\uff0c\u4e0d\u65b7\u653b\u64ca\u6575\u4eba\uff08\u5c31\u662f\u666e\u901a\u5854\u9632\u7684\u70ae\u5854\u6a5f\u5236\uff09\uff1b\n\u88dd\u7f6e\u5165\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\uff0c\u6e1b\u5c1180%\u50b7\u5bb3\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u589e\u52a0\u5bf6\u77f3\u7684\u7279\u6548\u53ca\u653b\u64ca\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u76ee\u524d\u73a9\u4e86\u5341\u5e7e\u95dc\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u7528\u7684\u9084\u662f\u6bd2\u85e5\u9677\u9631\uff09\uff1b\n\u628a\u5bf6\u77f3\u4f5c\u70ba\u70b8\u5f48\u4e1f\u5411\u6575\u4eba\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bf6\u77f3\u7206\u70b8\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\n\n\n\u512a\u9ede\uff1a\n\u5bf6\u77f3\u8ff7\u9663 \uff08GEMCRAFT\uff09\u7684\u6b63\u7d71\u7e8c\u4f5c\uff0c\u6bd4\u738b\u570b\u5b88\u885b\u8ecd\uff08KINGDOM RUSH\uff09\u7cfb\u5217\u66f4\u65e9\uff0c\u540c\u70baFLASH\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a3\u5927\u5854\u9632\u904a\u6232\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\n\u591a\u7a2e\u6230\u5834\u5e72\u9810\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u66ab\u505c\uff0c\u7dca\u5f35\u4e4b\u9918\u4e0d\u4e4b\u9918\u50cfKINGDOM RUSH\u7cfb\u5217\u4e00\u6a23\u624b\u5fd9\u8173\u4e82\u3002\n\u975e\u5e38\u591a\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u3001\u5347\u7d1a\u3001\u6311\u6230\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u4f86\u3002\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u8abf\u7bc0\u7684\u96e3\u5ea6\uff0c\u6e96\u5099\u597d\u63a5\u53d7\u6311\u6230\u5427\uff0c\u5976\u98db\u5929\uff01\u6211\u6703\u544a\u8a34\u4f60\uff0c\u621140\u7d1a\u4e86\u56de\u982d\u6253\u7b2c\u4e00\u95dc+14\u6ce2\u602a\u7269\u6253\u4e0d\u904e\u561b\n\n\u7f3a\u9ede\uff1a\u50cf\u7d20\u7d1a\u5225\uff0c10\u5e74\u5982\u4e00\u65e5\u7684\u756b\u9762\n\u6559\u7a0b\u7a0d\u5fae\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\n\n\u7e3d\u9ad4\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u756b\u9762\u62d6\u7d2f\uff0c\u7d66\u500b8/10\u5427\u3002\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1430895092, "timestamp_updated": 1430895092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15708684": {"recommendationid": "15708684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157322724", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448623565}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't let the cheap price and lame screenshots trick you!

You place gems in towers and let them shoot monsters -- different types of gems have different effects (slowing, poison, multiple hits, etc).  You try to kill all of them before they reach your orb.\n\nAlong the way, you accrue experience points in order to gain skill points that make you more effective.  As you progress through the game, you come across \"traits\" that you can use to make a battle harder in exchange for more xp.  \n\nPros:\n- Super addictive gameplay.  \n- There are a lot (a /lot/) of maps to play and things to do.\n- Over four hundred achievements\n- User-defined difficulty.  I like this.  Overall, each battle is pretty easy, but you're given many, many tools to make them harder (in exchange for more xp)...but it's all at your own discretion.\n- The game progresses at a nice pace.  You can go back to a map that gave you trouble ten levels later and walk all over it, or try it again with more difficulty.\n\nCons:\n- Can feel very grindy.  As stated, there are /a lot/ of levels. \n- Enemy scaling (in terms of health or armor) isn't visually apparent -- if your towers are one-shotting monsters now, it is not apparent when that will stop until it happens.\n- Optimizing the angering of waves still involves annoying mathematical calculations \n\nShould you get this game?

They are all free to play on various sites (Kongregate/Armorgames).  While this game may seem like a rather normal tower defense game, it's much more complex than others.\n\nYou build a tower which has nothing in it.  For the tower to do anything, you must place gems.  These gems start off weak, but can be combined with other similar gems or different gems to create very complex gems with a ton of various stats.  There's no \"build bomb tower\" or \"build barracks tower\".  You instead have gems like \"Slow the enemy by x\" and \"Chain in X range\".  They start off weak, but get much stronger as you invest into them.  You have to figure out which gems and gem combinations work best.   You can also place your specialized gems in other towers by just swapping them around, as well as traps and support towers(gives buffs depending on gem).  The player even has the ability to create a gem and THROW it at the enemies, doing damage/effects equal to the gem you used.  \n\nThere are over 190 levels and each level can be customized (as you unlock the features by playing) to increase the difficulty, the wave amount, the amount of monsters, etc.  Each level feels different from the last, and it doesn't seem to ever get tiresome.  The game offers over 400 achievements, which while may not appealing to some, gives you skill points to spend on the various skills.   The skillpoints can be allocated in 25 various skills, all being able to be reset and toyed with at any time.  There is also an interesting \"talisman\" system which allows you to boost various things, sort of like rarer skill points.  \n\nWhy buy it on steam and not play it for free? \nThe steam version comes with new levels, better graphics, full screen, steam cloud, and achievements.

(you also have floor traps but that is a bit later)\n\nInstead of having say the typical gatling gun, cannon, missle, etc you have one type of Tower, this tower just kind of shoots stuff within range. But the tower is actually useless until you put a gem within it! The gem you place within it then shoots and has special abilities.\n\nChain: can hit multiple enemies\n\nSlow\n\nPoison\n\ndrain mana (low damage but fills your mana some each time it attacks)\n\narmor destorying\n\nand two buff types\n\nblood (boosts off of its own attacking, after 30-50 etc it gets a bit stronger)\n\nMana: The mana gem is more so a booster gem, your mana works in a pretty cool way, you have mana limits, but when you reach the mana limit you upgrade your limit, the Mana Gem works off your ManaPool level, so the more mana you store the stronger they get! Upgrading your mana pool also offers passives like more EXP, faster auto mana regen and such!\n\nThe complexity of the game is not in making towers, instead it is all about crafting, with the 9 gem types you have you can upgrade and mingle their powers!\n\nGems can go through levels 1-12 FREAKING TWELVE levels! You can level gems up by comboing them \n1-1=2 \n2-2=3 and so on! Or if you have enough mana you can just buy a Pure Gem of that type which is upgraded, but has only that type of gem in it.\n\nComboing gems is cheaper though, and if done right faster leveling up your gear!\n\nAlong side all the crafting you have other skills too!\n\nBomb, you don't need that gem? Too many baddies in an area? Make a gem and select Bomb and you can just drop that sucker right on all those jerks heads! Using a bomb also makes Mana Wasps which linger and cause a stunning affect!\n\nFloor traps. A gem type trap, mostly great for posion as far as I have played, but they are special since you can only play them on the monster path, but hey its more damage!\n\nSpells, eventually you get spells, allowing you to do things like freeze a group of enemies! Frozen enemies even EXLPODE on death dealing damage to more baddies!\n\nYou also get Binding powers, much like a spell, but they are passive buffs you can give your traps. Floor ones get it forever, towers get a nice big buff for a few shots.\n\nThis game is brilliant! There are even challenge missions where you have no passive skills and have to figure it out more puzzle style than most challenges.\n\nBest part of this game though for me? NO RATINGS! Always mad when you have to do the entire challenge again cause ONE guy got through some how? Don't care! All that sucker does is eat through a bit of your mana and you keep trucking!\n\nAnother great thing is Endless mode being there right from the start! When you complete a stage you can do Endless on it with all the gear you already laid out, and just test yourself against ever growing enemies! Mind you, in Endless you can not get anything aside from EXP and accessories! But you get everything from the challenge you already gained even if you go for the Endless mode, so try it and get extra EXP! :D", "timestamp_created": 1430718383, "timestamp_updated": 1430718383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555930", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15680527": {"recommendationid": "15680527", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995193697", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499650588}, "language": "english", "review": "GemCraft is the quintessential tower defence series.

You are generally given a few select spots to build your Towers in, and you are only given a few (maybe as many as 10 or 15) actual towers to build, of various types.  A few others let you build your Towers almost anywhere, allowing you to Maze your enemies, but are still limited by the types of Towers you can build.  \n\nGemcraft is different.  Towers are generic.  There are only two types of Tower in Gemcraft : basic Towers, and Amplifiers.  Its how they're used that is absolutely brilliant, and different from every other TD game I've ever heard of.\n\nYou see, a Tower does noting in this game, on its own.  Its not until you put a Gem into that Tower that you have something capable of defeating the creeps.  And not only are there various gem types (orange gems leech mana, yellow gems can crit, and so on) but the gems have their own levels, as well.  A Grade 2 orange gem is more powerful than a Grade 1 orange gem.  Leveling the gems up is as simple as combining two of them.  If their levels are the same, the resulting gem is one level (or Grade) higher.  If their levels were not the same, then the higher level one gains a little of the lower level one's powers, without an increase in level.\n\nThis means that you can make for some really interesting Towers.  A Tower that has a gem combining Chain Hit and Critical can be capable of putting out an incredible amount of damage, with less regard for the number of creeps approaching.  A Tower that combines Slow and Mana Leech not only reduces the speed of the creeps it hits, but gets mana for you to use in doing other things.\n\nAmplifiers do what you would expect, they amplify damage, range, shot speed, and most of the special effects of gems.  However, their exact effects are based upon the gems inserted into them.  An amplifier that has a Red gem in it won't be boosting the Poison effect of the gem in the Tower next to it.\n\nNow, all of this flexibility is awesome.  That, however, brings me to the one BIG glaring drawback to the system : it is unbalanced.  There is really only four general types of gems that you will be using once you get far enough into the game and have done your homework.  Basically, once you are powerful enough, the only optimal means of playing a stage is through what is called a Manafarm.  That means you will need 4 gem types : a killing gem made of yellow, red, and black gems, pure yellow amplifier gems for that killing gem, a managem made of orange, red, and black gems, and pure orange amplifier gems for the managem.  The managem gets you additional mana to improve your gems, the killing gem kills the creeps that pass over it in its trap.  Continue to bomb the wavestones so that you get the most creeps, that won't be killed by your managem but will be killed by the killgem, and continue to upgrade everything with all the mana you get from the farm.\n\nPrior to reaching that point, the game is incredibly fun.  I've spent I don't know how many hours playing the game on armorgames.com.  The only reason I stopped playing the game there was I got bored with the manafarming after reaching a Wizard Level of 5611 and helping with the Gemcraft CS Extreme end game guide found on armorgames.com and ported here.", "timestamp_created": 1430712412, "timestamp_updated": 1430712412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15679842": {"recommendationid": "15679842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055156797", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493091209}, "language": "english", "review": "Been a fan of this game since the original gemcraft, best one yet!

Use your XP to create custom builds that suit your play style.  Like traps?  Invest in trap buffs.  Towers?  Get tower buffs.  Like the effects of a specific gem?  Spend XP on that gem type, and it is now available in every map. \n\nLike a challenge?  Unlockable modes allow you to buff enemies or handicap yourself.  Finishing stages with these conditions can significantly boost your XP gain.  But, as said before, you can completely ignore those modifiers and simply play the stages.  \n\nCasual to hardcore, Gemcraft has broad appeal.

I have spent a lot of hours on it on armorgames.com (in case you were wondering: dude, already a review with barely any hours on it?), and I'm absolutely sold. What makes it so special compared with the enormous amount of other games available in the genre? Here are some key words (tl;dr: read only key words):\n\n1.) Experimentation: \nMost TD games are quite simple: you have a limited amount of towers types that can be upgraded, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Strategy is mainly finding the right combos and placement.\nIn gemcraft however, you build up defenses by forging gems and building defensive buildings separately, to then combine them. With 9 different gem types (all with their own colour) that have each a specific power and 3 different tower designs, you have a lot of freedom when creating your defenses against the demon hordes. Gems of different colours can be fused together to form powerfull combogems and can even be converted to gem bombs to rain death and destruction from above on a specific target.\n\n2.) Create your own dungeon:\nIn most TD games you have 2 areas: the path that enemies follow to reach your base, and areas suitable to build your defenses. Sometimes it's a grid area that makes you puzzle for ideal placement, sometimes it is restricted to a few spots limiting the amount of towers you can build. Gemcraft has only one rule: There must be at least one route that enemies can follow to reach your base. As long as there is a path of one square wide with horizontal or vertical connections, you can build your towers on any surface that allows building. Aside from your towers, you also have the ability to build walls. Wide path? Make it narrow and windy by adding a lot of walls forcing enemies to follow a zigzag pattern! Multiple routes to your base? Block them untill there is one left! Create choke points with deadly traps waiting to turn unaware enemies into dust! Be carefull though, buildings and gems are build from the same recource pool (mana), so you are forced to be efficient.\n\n3. From sandbox to nightmare with one click\nEver had that feeling during a mission when you were like: man, my defense is impenetrable, this is no longer a challenge, this is boring. Gemcraft allows you to suddenly turn the mission from an evil minion's deathwall to a tense fight for your live.  You can make the mission harder in various ways. First, like a lot of TD games, you have the option to early call waves. Only now you can decide to early call multiple waves at a time (if you are brave enough). All waves are displayed as 'wave stones' on the left of your screen, and they are all visible from the beginning. If you really want it, you can scroll down to the bottom, click the final round stone, and watch the fireworks (or your ultimate doom).Early calling a wave gives bonus mana and xp, so it's not just for fun. Another way is using gems. As I said earlier, gems can be turned into gem bombs to lay waste on the battlefield. However, when used on a wave stone, the targeted wave will be enraged: enemies become stronger, faster, more resistant, and more numerous. The stronger the gem bomb or the more gem bombs dropped, the stronger the wave becomes, and the higher the exp reward. Last but not least, you have the option to activate mission handicaps before starting the mission, such as less time between different waves, monsters receiving damage resistance on a direct hit, and much more. This can be very helpfull when you want to replay lower levels to rise enough in level to beat the harder fields.\n\nMy verdict: Gemcraft is a landmark in the TD genre: it is challenging, tactical, allows a lot of experimentation, and is not short at all (you WILL require a lot of hours of gameplay to even reach the hardest fields).", "timestamp_created": 1430513613, "timestamp_updated": 1430520418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15641726": {"recommendationid": "15641726", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995740295", "num_games_owned": 1107, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 2840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452038414}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally a game of this masterpiece saga of the tower defense genre gets to steam.\n\nTLDR review:\n\n+ Good port of this game, finally you'll be able to do the endurance mode without fearing for flash to crash!\n+ Gameplay is still solid as a rock\n+ Long, long game.

Soon after that they tried to seal again and again, even with the power of the ultimate gem ... but she broke free.\n\nThis game (the 4th one) picks up after the events of a previous one, where a young mage (you) tried to stop her from reaching the world's most powerful place ... \n\nIf you want to check the gameplay first (or even read the story as it unfolds) I strongly recoment going to Armorgames and play them. \n\nBeware, this game is addictive.

Here goes:\n\nIf you haven't played the Armor Games version, then this is definitely worth getting here.  Especially with the early Special Promotion offer.  If you've got the AG version, then it's totally up to you, as to whether you want to support the developer or not.  Either way, it is guranteed to give anyone who likes Tower Defense games many, many hours of gameplay.  Each level alone can give you 2 or 3 hours or more in a single Endurance run, and there are over a hundred different levels, starting with the 'F' hex, where 'F1' has 3 waves of a few monsters each, and they go up in difficulty from there.\n\nSome changes I've noticed-- there is an extra save slot here on Steam.  Also, you don't start off with Orblets or with a Red gem.  It's odd playing the first few maps without 'battle traits,' but here you don't pick up your first one until F4.  Also, it's nice being able to play in full-screen mode.  And it's alway fun racking up Steam Achievements-- this game has 419 of them.  And in 'Chasing Shadows,' it's not pointless to rack up these achievements-- each one that you get gives you a free skill point to improve your abilities with.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, the way Gemcraft Labyrinth was, as Shrines aren't fun anymore: now they show up randomly, at random times and in random locations.  And I don't agree with the decision to tie the amount of times you anger a wave to the amount of beacons that appear-- in both cases I wish that I, the player, had more control over such decisions.  So some casual fans might find the game overly difficult at the start.  \n\nBut for the fans, be it of Gemcraft or of Tower Defense games in general, these sort of decisions will only improve your gameplay as many of you now have a year of gameplay experience and already know when to use a white gem or when to use a black one, where to farm for mana and which maps are the best for early endurance runs.  I don't need to tell you guys anything as you already know and love the game.  \n\nSo I'll add this one last point just for new players: don't be afraid to experiment.  There are plenty of guides out there if you get stuck, but sometimes it's fun to figure it out on your own.  Once you've played a few hours and want to optimize your gem ratios (and this can be as easy as deciding to make it out of two yellows, one red and one orange and four whites, or as hard as following the various high-level gem speccing guides which read like this: 2o+o+o+o+o+o+o+0(2o+b) + (2o+(o+r)+b+2b)+(2b+b+b+b+b+2b+(2o+b+2b) where r, b, and o stand for red,blue and orange gems. But you lose nothing by screwing around: even losing a level gives you shadow core, so if you want to try some prismatic gem to see what it does, go for it.  If you want to just keep playing F1 a dozen times before doing anything else, then do that.

The game contains tons of achievements and levels which are really different to play.\n\nCON\nThe author did not bother to make this version an HD version so its the same old graphics - which are beautiful - BUT for low resolution. In 1920p this game simply looks horribly upscaled and I do recommend everyon to switch to window mode and play it there - no one was bothered by this when it was a browser game, so why now? Because now the game is 8.99\u20ac and I really think, this should have been the one important thing for a steam release. The game was already amazing and I would have bought the old version here on steam as well, as long as they were fit to a modern screen.\n\nThe original resolution seems to be at least half the size of current screens.\n\nStill: If i play a tower defense for whatever reason, it is this series and no other. I grown up with the first tower defenses in starcraft and played them a lot through all of the blizz game titles and many of the popular flash games back then. I also tried some of the new mobile TDs but even if they look much more beautiful (new graphics vs old graphics upscaled) they all lack the creativity and possibilities of this one.

Well, then you are at the right spot! GemCraft - Chasing Shadows is one of the most brilliant TDG!\nThe story never fails to amaze me even though i have already played it as browser version.\nI am still frightened when the shadows shoo over the map whispering creepy noises. And yes you will get startled at some point. \nThe storyline is narrated by book pages you find on your adventure telling you what is happening. Also an overview about the former series of Gemcraft is given by summing the whole plot up. \nAs a beginner one gets used to the mechanics really fast. During the first levels many hints are given bit by bit so you dont get overwhelmed by the information. Anyway the lategame is still challenging due to the \"Endurance Mode\" which causes monster to spawn endlessly giving you a hard time but also lots of XP!\nEach wizard level grants several skill points which can be distributed into many different skills improving for example your  gem damage or reducing the charge time of your spells.\nMoreover during the stages talisman fragments are dropped which award even more bonus stats! \nGemcraft has a distinctive achievment system with up to 419 achievments! They can also grant up to 3skill points giving you another goal to achieve!\nThe stages are beautiful and challenging designed. On every map you have to think of a strategy before starting the first wave. Will you use traps or towers? Maybe both? Is there a way to stretch the monsters way by building mazes? Which one the 9 different gems will you use? \nIf you get stuck just replay some stages at higher difficulty to get even bettter rewards! \nOverall i highly recommend GemCraft - Chasing Shadows!

"english", "review": "Gemcraft series is the ultimate Tower Defense experience for me, and \"Chasing Shadows\" is the best instalment so far. \n\nAt first glance it may work and look like a standard TD game - monsters enter the map in waves, walk to our base along predefined paths and we have to defend it by building towers and traps, as well as occasionally using some spells. However, not only Gemcraft does it superbly but it also offers depth and complexity you won't find in most TD games.\n\nThe most unique and fun feature of the game, in my opinion, is the wave angering. Player can spend some mana to make monster waves stronger (by increasing monster numbers and stats), which allows you to gain more mana and experience from killing the monsters... IF you can kill them that is. This one feature changes the gameplay from simple defense to the \"how far can I push it\" competition.\n\nAnother feature, which adds extra replayability value, is the ability to customize levels. It's pretty fun to return to some of early levels later in the game to see how much stronger you have become by beating the level with some extra difficulty settings. You can add more waves, make monsters stronger, faster, tougher or tweak some game rules to get a harder map with higher experience multiplayer. \n\nAh, the experience - player character can gain levels and unlock various skills and spells which will increase his efficiency in killing monster filth. There is no level cap, however some skills (not all) have a limit to which they can be improved. Add to it a wizard's talisman which can be socketed with talisman fragments gathered along your journey and you get quite a few ways of progressing, improving and specialising your character.\n\nHowever, Gemcraft originally being a flash game, has some shortcomings. To many people graphics would be the biggest one. Despite it being pretty \"clean\", readable and fitting the game's darker theme, it's still 2D graphics in low resolution without all those fireworks that other games have nowadays. Personally I prefer it that way, but to each his own.\n\nI have spent dozens of hours (flash version on ArmorGames, so obviously Steam won't show this time) with this game and can safely recommend it to other Tower Defense games fans. If you are unsure then you may try the free version of the game on ArmorGames to see if you like it. In any case be advised that GemCraft is not a game you can finish in a few hours. There are dozens of levels and some of the later ones can take as much as an hour to finish.", "timestamp_created": 1430424928, "timestamp_updated": 1430470215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 164, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919323", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15627705": {"recommendationid": "15627705", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962319490", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431198831}, "language": "english", "review": "Now that I've spend some more time with the game, it's time to write an extended review.\n\nDon't mistake this title for your standard tower defense game that is fun for a few hours and then you've seen every gameplay aspect. No, this game is quite on the contrary. The gameplay mechanics offer sheer endless possibilites.\n\nThere are 9 distinct gems, each one having a different special. These gems can be put in towers (mostly damage), traps (mostly special effect), and amplifiers (buff adjacent towers or traps). You can also combine gems of different types and upgrade them. Instead of placing gems in towers or traps you can also throw them directly on the monsters for massive damage or buff the next minion, receiving even more mana and experience when killing them. You can call waves early, decide to save your mana for some seconds to gain increased mana regeneration, build walls to control the movement path of the monsters. There are different spells to cast and objects on the map to interact with.\n\nAm I done yet? No, I've hardly listed half of the gameplay elements. The rest is for you to discover in the game!\n\nPro:\n- Gameplay mechanics\n- Replayability\n- Different play styles and tactics for levels\n- Customize the level difficulty in different ways\n- Hours and hours of fun (there is no real ending in this game, you can always level and improve some more)\n- Dark, moody atmosphere and story. I liked it a lot.\n\nCon:\n- Graphics are for the most part not HD, especially the land tiles may seem rather blurry / rough.\n- Complex game mechanics may be overwhelming for new players (but hey, is this really a con?)\n- Game slows down when a lot of action is going on, even on high end pcs. There are a lot of options to improve performance in the menu though, including a setting to automatically reduce graphic settings temporarily when the framerate drops.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is a must-buy for all tower defense fans, and even if you're new to the genre or don't like it in general, you should give it a try.

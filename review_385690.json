You have a board full of tiles, some of them are numbered. Numbered tiles send waves into the direction of your choice, with length corresponding to the numbers on the tiles. The wave inverts the color of the tiles it affects (including the original tile itself), then the number of the tile decreases by one. You need to eliminate all numbered tiles by decreasing their value to 0, and at the same time the board's tiles need to correspond to the color defined by the board.\n\nThe game starts out fun and easy, then the difficulty starts to increase. While all the puzzles can be solved by logic, you will need to consider more and more subsequent waves in order to ensure that a certain move is right. At some point, your brain is liable to run out of capacity - for me, it was the halfway point in stage 6 where more and more 4s started to creep into the puzzles. Actually, it was fun up to the end of level 5, and increasingly tedious afterwards.\n\nWave Mechanics generates its puzzles procedurally, which is very impressive on one hand as the generated puzzles are quite good, however, as the difficulty increases, I certainly miss the human touch to make some of the levels a bit more approachable. I had one nightmare level in stage 4, but then those didn't return until stage 6. I also doubt that many people find the game fun on or past stage 6 - I may be wrong, though.\n\nCertainly recommended, but be on the lookout for the levels where you feel more like wasting time than having fun. You get the best experience out of the game if you stop there - maybe use the procedural generator to your advantage and generate a new level set and play the lower stages once again.\n", "timestamp_created": 1504032289, "timestamp_updated": 1504032289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521411", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33920233": {"recommendationid": "33920233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059225023", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454262199}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most amazing mechanics I've ever seen!\n\nAnd one of the most difficult puzzles I've ever played!\n\nSo surely this is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played and one of my favorites!\n\nFor those who like puzzles, I think this is a must! :)", "timestamp_created": 1501475851, "timestamp_updated": 1501476351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485520", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32110748": {"recommendationid": "32110748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072586558", "num_games_owned": 679, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 2347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496334713}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0430.\n\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u044b:\n+ \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\n+ \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c\u043d\u043e \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b (\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043f\u0435 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e)\n\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b:\n- \u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0438\u0444\u0440\u044b (\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439)\n\u0412 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0447\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433, \u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1496334998, "timestamp_updated": 1496334998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507106", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31961610": {"recommendationid": "31961610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112366621", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496903978}, "language": "english", "review": "They might as well have called this game \"Undo Mechanics\" with the amount of time you'll spend doing just that.

But that's not a Minesweeper or Picross, it's something new! The gameplay revolves around swapping colors between the squares to get the required color scheme. \n\nIt's easy to learn but hard to master - after one third of the game the difficulty gets higher. Since you can't fully rely on your instinct (you'll be making mistakes pretty often), the developer implemented an undo button. That'll save you many times, keeping you in flow instead of making angry and frustrated.\n\nThere are totally 49 levels (procedurally generated) divided into 7 chapters - each chapter makes the game harder, with more specific requirement to the state of the grid. The graphic style is minimalistic and in combination with relaxing sounds and music this game is a great casual puzzler with a low price tag.

Since there are no upper cases you might be screwed, if you got a different keyboard layout than US. That is a big thing, if you use steamOS and used chose german or french keyboard due setup. Setting steam back to US in the steam settings didn't work properly and even textinput using steam controller did not work, unbelievable but true.\n\nThis game has an interesting story, the more it saddens me, that it is ripped into pieces \"because it's getting to large\" (as it  was stated by the maker in this game in this damn commentarys). The game is played through in about 1 hour, with comments (which are part of 1 achievement, oh glory, oh glory) it is a lot more time you can spend listening to a game-designer on an egotrip, disrupting the gameflow after 2 sentences more than once, talking & talking of making the game and whatnot. This time had better be put in content of the actual game, not talking on how to. If I want to hear a speech I go to the church. Don't get me wrong. It could be a nice gimmick, but if it takes a multiple of the actual gametime plus you are forced to listen for an achievement ... anyway: If a painter has to interpret his own picture, there might be something wrong. \nIf you are desperate, get the whole series on sale, otherwise: hands off.", "timestamp_created": 1516387975, "timestamp_updated": 1516427674, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39329112": {"recommendationid": "39329112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036797139", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 122, "last_played": 1515906646}, "language": "english", "review": "Let's get the ambiguity out of the way, this is the SECOND game in the series.

Anche la colonna sonora \u00e8 migliorata considerevolmente.\n\nQuel che non \u00e8 migliorato \u00e8 la qualit\u00e0 grafica; \u00e8 sostanzialmente la stessa del primo gioco a livello di qualit\u00e0, con fondali e personaggi generamente ben disegnati, fatta qualche eccezione un po' poco ispirata. Il problema principale \u00e8 che gli scenari di [i]Blackwell Unbound[/i] sono spesso un po' vuoti: ci sono in scena sempre trai due e i quattro personaggi, senza altre figure di passaggio o anche solo di sfondo. Questo fa apparire un po' desolata la New York del gioco, cosa che prende se vogliamo in contropiede anche perch\u00e8 il centro di New York non \u00e8 un posto deserto. Bisogna comunque dire che era passato solo un anno dalla pubblicazione di [i]The Blackwell Legacy[/i] e che ragionevolmente il budget di produzione o lo studio della Wadjet Eye non poteva essersi ingrandito pi\u00f9 di tanto. Peraltro il 2007 era anche un anno in cui doveva nascere la consapevolezza della pixel-art che si ha invece oggi, quando invece capita di vedere giochi splendidi. Per cui gliela si perdona - specie sapendo che, comunque, negli episodi successivi anche su questo punto la qualit\u00e0 andr\u00e0 crescendo.\n\nDevo invece rivolgere una critica agli enigmi del gioco. Avevo trovato quelli del primo molto ben fatti in quanto a funzionamento, specie per l'uso di Joey e del taccuino. Qui invece l'uso del taccuino \u00e8 estremamente limitato, l'uso di Joey non \u00e8 tanto significativo quanto in [i]The Blackwell Legacy[/i] e il controllo misto trai due personaggi deve ancora essere ottimizzato. La qualit\u00e0 degli enigmi dunque si fa un po' pi\u00f9 scontata, e v\u00e0 a scadere nel momento in cui arrivano dei casi in cui tutto ci\u00f2 che c'\u00e8 da fare per procedere \u00e8 continuare a porre sempre le stesse domande ai personaggi con cui si sta interagendo, perch\u00e8 questi cambiano risposta di volta in volta.\n\nRimane breve, ma non vedo la cosa come un limite. Come indicato nella recensione di [i]The Blackwell Legacy[/i] trovo anzi la cosa piuttosto intrigante.\n\nIn breve: qualit\u00e0 del gioco comunque buona, assolutamente superiore al costo a cui viene venduto, specie quando in bundle E scontato. In generale si mantiene sulla linea del gioco precedente: realizzazione tecnica moderatamente superiore, qualit\u00e0 degli enigmi leggermente inferiore.

the previous protagonist, Rosangela.  A stark contrast to the timid bookworm we're used to, Lauren is a chainsmoking toughgirl with a sharp wit and a bit of a mean streak.  She is joined by Joey, and the player gets to experience what Rosa's aunt was really like in her prime.\n\nLike in Legacy, Unbound focuses on finding ghosts stuck in the world and helping them move to the next.  The more historical setting works fairly well; things like researching on the computer is replaced with typing terms into a phonebook to find numbers and addresses, which feels fairly interactive and rewarding.  While there's still a lot of running from place to place to unlock topics, there are more interactive puzzles this time around, and overall the game feels more freeform, if only just a little.\n\nAn interesting gameplay change is that you can now directly control Joey in addition to Lauren, letting you investigate through walls and observe things Lauren can't.  This adds a lot to the gameplay potential and was a welcome change for me.\n\nThe talking portraits disappeared for this installment, which I honestly didn't mind.  The art is mostly the same as before, though the Google Maps screen was replaced with a lovely skyline of New York.  I'm not entirely sure, but I think Joey's sprites might have been updated as well, which is a nice touch.\n\nThe voices of Lauren and Joey are pretty good this time around, though several of the supporting roles suffered.  Several of the supporting roles (two black men, and two old ladies, in particular) sounded more like someone doing a (bad) voice rather than actually fitting the part.  One of the old ladies was very clearly a much younger woman doing her best \"old lady\" voice and it fell spectacularly flat.  But like I said with Legacy, I got used to it fairly quickly so I can't say that it detracted terribly from the experience for me.  It's almost turning into a sort of charm.\n\nI finished this game in 3 hours, and like Legacy, I paid $1.25 for it.  I feel pretty good about the game given that price, but I don't think I would if I'd paid full price.  If you've read this far and still find yourself interested, I'd encourage you to give it a shot for yourself, but I can't say I can recommend this unless it's on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1511662333, "timestamp_updated": 1511662333, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463710", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35428721": {"recommendationid": "35428721", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971643454", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506903844}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a nice series and this furthers my interest in it.", "timestamp_created": 1506978794, "timestamp_updated": 1506978794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35141255": {"recommendationid": "35141255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088068809", "num_games_owned": 731, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506128841}, "language": "english", "review": "I fell in love with the voice of Lauren after her first line.

However, the less linear story mixed with those new mechanics and the same flaws that were present in the previous game can make this game a pixel hunting back and forth drudge at times.\n\nThe production quality is the same as the previous game. Pixel art and voice acting get a passing grade but no high marks. What has changed is new game play mechanics.  You can now switch control of between Joey and Lauren. It is an interesting concept, Joey, being a ghost, can pass through walls and explore places unencumbered by privacy concerns. But the previous limitation where Joey cannot stray far from his medium is still present, so it does not add as much freedom as you might think. Moreover, inventory items can now be used with the environment, a standard feature of point and clicks that was missing in the previous game.\n\nAside from the additions to the mechanics the gameplay is largely the same; find clues, interview people, and draw conclusions.  This time around though the pixel hunting gets worse as, on multiple occasions, objects that I needed to interact with were sandwiched between two other large objects.  This is not good game design. Needing to click the 12 pixel cluster between two things is just annoying.  That aside the overall gameplay is still pretty solid. The detective work is well suited for the point and click genre.\n\nStory also improves a bit. It removes linearity giving you two cases to work in tandem.  However, in my play through, I did not notice that Joey could enter another area until after I completed one of the cases. So, for me, the play through was more akin to having 2 consecutive cases.  As the cases build, there is more teasing to the fate mediums, building up tension for future games in the series.\n\nAll in all, Blackwell Unbound still gets a recommendation. The annoyances with pixel hunting were not so great as to hinder the gameplay.  If you are looking for a detective genre gameplay, this might be up your ally.\n", "timestamp_created": 1503537742, "timestamp_updated": 1503537742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34331789": {"recommendationid": "34331789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034068809", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502478317}, "language": "spanish", "review": "I bought the game through the Blackwell Bundle.

However, the games don't suffer from one flaw that exists in many quests, and that is excessive use of items. In some quest games you usually stack up a lot of items and end up trying every combination of item and something clickable on the screen until you find that absurd combination that makes you progress. The Blackwell series doesn't have that flaw as items aren't the main part of the game. Also, when places become irrelevant you can't access them anymore, which also prevents having to go back and try to find something useful in every place that you've been through at the endgame.\n\nThe progression in the game is made by combining the abilities of Rosa (or Lauren in Blackwell Unbound) and Joey, which complete each other. Joey can enter locked rooms but cannot interact with anything, and Rosa can do the opposite. Only by combining their abilities you will make progress. There's also a built in search engine inside a game in which you have to use in order to progress, which makes you feel that you're doing detective work and not just trying to figure out how to use your inventory.\n\nThe plot becomes \"bigger\" in each episode and ends with a grand finale in Blackwell Epiphany, so you don't feel like you're doing that same thing in each game.\n\nI really enjoyed the series and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1500017027, "timestamp_updated": 1500017027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33243270": {"recommendationid": "33243270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141342558", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498280848}, "language": "english", "review": "The second one of the Blackwell series.

For example Joey can move through walls. The story this time is set several years prior to Legacy, so much so that Rosa is either not yet born, or she's just a baby. Your task is to help two ghosts depart while trying to find a connection between the two. Sounds simple, but let me tell you: \"It ain't\".

Wir sind im Jahre 1973. Der Familiengeist Joey h\u00e4ngt ihr st\u00e4ndig an den Hacken, denn sie ist dummerweise ein Medium. Es gilt, anderen Geistern, die in der Zwischenwelt h\u00e4ngengeblieben sind, zu helfen. \n\nDas Gameplay ist ganz typisches Point-and-Click. Auf Screens begutachten wir Gegenst\u00e4nde, sammeln sie auf und packen sie in unser Inventar und reden vor allem mit allen m\u00f6glichen und unm\u00f6glichen NPCs. Dabei funktioniert das Game im Kern wie eine Detektivgeschichte. Hierf\u00fcr haben wir unser Notizbuch, in dem wir einzelne Hinweise miteinander kombinieren k\u00f6nnen und so zu neuen Schlu\u00dffolgerungen gelangen k\u00f6nnen. \n\nIn diesem Teil k\u00f6nnen und m\u00fcssen wir immer wieder zwischen Lauren und Joey wechseln, denn Joey kann direkt mit Geistern reden oder auch durch W\u00e4nde gelangen, die f\u00fcr Lauren un\u00fcberwindlich sind. Da dieser Teil noch mehr auf die Story fokussiert ist und Inventar-R\u00e4tsel noch weiter in den Hintergrund treten, ist diese Mechanik sehr sinnvoll.\n\nDie recht lineare Geschichte entfaltet sich dramaturgisch sinnvoll und gekonnt und bleibt durch liebenswerte oder nervige Charakterzeichnungen stets spannend. Erstaunlich, da\u00df das Spiel einen schmalen Grad zwischen Ironie und Ernst so zielsicher trifft. Mit Witz und Sarkasmus werden auch sehr ernste und bittere Themen behandelt, ohne, da\u00df sich das Spiel je l\u00e4cherlich \u00fcber diese Themen macht.  \n\nDie Grafik und Stilistik erinnert entfernt an alte LucasArts Titel. Alles ist bewu\u00dft pixelig, reduziert und retro. Dadurch entsteht ein wunderbar nostalgischer Charme, der viel zum Spielspa\u00df beitr\u00e4gt. Die (englische) Synchronisation ist gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils stark, die Charaktere sind teils durchaus patzig und \u00fcbelgelaunt und die Sprecher treffen die einzelnen Haltungen auch ad\u00e4quat. Unverst\u00e4ndlich allerdings, da\u00df die Aufnahmen technisch nicht gerade ausgefeilt daherkommen. Ein Pop-schutz w\u00e4re eine durchaus sinnvolle Investition gewesen. \n\nGr\u00f6\u00dfter Kritikpunkt mag die L\u00e4nge des Spiels sein. In nur 2-3 Stunden kann man durch sein. Allerdings war \"Blackwell Unbound\" stets als Teil einer Spieleserie geplant und so kann man die verschiedenen Blackwell-Titel auch insgesamt als ein gro\u00dfes Episoden-Adventure verstehen.\n\nTolle Figuren, intelligente Geschichte, viel Witz, ohne albern zu sein.

I find the artwork a bit (and only a bit) lacking as compared to the original game's art, except for the area inside the main character's mind (I love how Lauren's mind place looks as compared to Rosa's). The \"quest/case\" menu definitely lacked the first game's case menu originality. The music is still pretty good (although for the sax music, it sounds synthesized.. because it didn't quite sound like the fully body of an alto or a tenor [appearance varied depending on perspective... ghost sax looked alto, portrait sax looked tenor... but the sound was closer to alto] sax sound like I was expecting (I played for several years, as long as I could), Joey's vocals and lines are still by far the best, and the story is... well, it is what it is. I know this isn't a raving review, but it's not necessarily negative either. I feel like this part of the story was meant more for the creator than the fans. \n\nThere are a lot of little nuances that don't necessarily appeal to me--Joseph Mitchell and his vocals irritate the snot out of me, the Shivah achievement is purely a nod to the creator's previous work and therefore comes across self-aggrandizing, the commentary achievement (ack, again?!) is still annoying (but thank goodness he told us about being able to skip over them), and the two different smoking achievements... not clever forcing the people to replay the game more than they may want just to get an achievement. If I'm getting all of these other achievements, I might as well have all of them... right? Ha.\n\nOverall, the story--worth it. The addition of the Countess was a brilliant idea and I can see where this might go in the next three games. At least, I hope some form of this character is revisited somehow (hopefully, no spoilers here).

Forget L.A. Noire, this game makes you feel like a true detective. This can be kind of said about all of the Blackwell series games, but for some reason I felt like it shone the most in this one. (maybe its the chain smoking of the main character)\n\nFirst of all, important events get written down in your notebook, but instead of your character reaching conclusions on their own, you have to actually connect important notes yourself, to either make educated guesses, figure out if characters are lying or just notice that two cases might be connected. I have never seen such mechanic in a point and click adventure game before. Some people felt like it was annoying so they took it out in the next game, but it has since made a return in the fourth.\n\nSomething which they have improved from the first game is the way you do research. In that game, you would use your clues in the notebook to research things, which meant that it would sometimes come down to you trying all the options to progress. In this one however, you need to actually type in the thing you want to search for, which means that you actually have to notice clues in things like letters, photos or the enviroment, which the playable characters won't even mention. This is actually the first time a game made me draw a mindmap on a piece of paper to note down all the suspicions I had and important figures and their interactions with oneanother.\n\nAnother addition from the first game is having control over your little ghost partner, this leads to some clever puzzle solutions where you have to send him to scout out areas which you don't have access to, or create distractions for you to take advantage of, something which has since been much refined in the later games.\n\nThe only issue I had with the game stems from it being made out of material cut from the next game Blackwell Convergence. You see all of this game was originally supposed to be a flashback in the next game. While this hasn't hurt the games length, it does kind of create a problem with the order youre supposed to play the games in. If you play this before Convergence, it will kind of....ruin the mystery a bit (I'm trying not to spoil anything). Whereas if you play Convergence first and then this one, you will already know how everything will play out. Best way would be to play Convergence up to a certain point, then switch to this, then switch back, and so on, and so on. But the issue with this is that you won't know the moments when to switch without knowing the whole story, so you would need someone to tell you when to switch, and I can't really write the moments when to switch here, because the moments themselves would be a spoiler.....\n\nIt might be just something bugging me personally, and it definitely doesn't hurt the game as a whole.", "timestamp_created": 1483625434, "timestamp_updated": 1483625434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29028023": {"recommendationid": "29028023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281888703", "num_games_owned": 501, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483603263}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9996\u5148\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u8eab\u8fd8\u51d1\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u90a3\u4e2a\u7535\u8bdd\u672c\u67e5\u7535\u8bdd\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u723d\uff0c\u5c31\u597d\u50cf\u597d\u597d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u4f60\u975e\u8981\u52a0\u4e00\u9053\u586b\u7a7a\u9898\u5728\u91cc\u9762\u4e00\u6837\u7a81\u5140\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u8eab\u5dee\u8bc4\u3002\u800c\u4e14\u5361\u5173\u5361\u4e86\u597d\u4e45\u5b9e\u5728\u8fc7\u4e0d\u53bb\u67e5\u653b\u7565\u624d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u5149\u67e5\u4eba\u540d\u7684\u7535\u8bdd\u8fd8\u80fd\u67e5\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u5b66\u6821\u7684\u7535\u8bdd\uff0c\u4e00\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u5783\u573e\u3002\n\n\u7136\u540e\u6211\u662f\u7528Mac\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u73a9\u5b8c\u4e4b\u663e\u793a\u5b8c\u5236\u4f5c\u540d\u5355\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u9690\u85cf\u7167\u7247\u4e86\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u4e00\u6309exit\u6e38\u620f\u5c31\u9000\u51fa\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff01\u6210\u5c31\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u89e3\u9501\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\n\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u9762\u6210\u5c31\u662f\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662fsteam\u4e0a\u770b\u4e0d\u5230\u3002\n\n\u8bd5\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u6b21\uff0c\u770b\u5f88\u591acredits\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u90fd\u662f\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u5783\u573e\uff01\n\n\u8fd9\u70b9\u4f53\u9a8c\u5b8c\u5168\u6bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6211\u53ea\u80fd\u7ed9\u5dee\u8bc4\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u662fMac\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4f60\u522b\u4e70\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u518d\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5dee\u8bc4\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u4e91\u5b58\u50a8Mac\u548cWin\u4e0d\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5373\u4f7fWin\u91cc\u9762\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u9501\u6210\u5c31\u6211\u4e5f\u5f97\u91cd\u65b0\u73a9\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u5988\u7684\u667a\u969c\u3002\n\n\nEnglish Version:\n\nGame stuck at Photo Album screen after finish it, while If i click EXIT, the game exit totally instead of go back to title screen, and my achievements is NOT unlocked in steam!!!\n\nTried many tines, still the same.\n\nSo, do not buy this one for MAC OS.", "timestamp_created": 1483602134, "timestamp_updated": 1483602512, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28994359": {"recommendationid": "28994359", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964345647", "num_games_owned": 855, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483496393}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely not for the price!\n\nI would say that each of these Blackwell games I have played belong in a complete came, at one price!\n\nThey have been interesting, but very short.\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:  These are my opinions about the experience I had playing this game.

If you're not familiar with this series, I'd suggest you just start off with the first game, the Blackwell Legacy.\n\nAnyway, here we are back in the 1970's as Lauren Blackwell, Rosangela's aunt and her medium predecessor. I have to say this game has a much more involved story line, and it's a wonderful step forward for the series. I really enjoyed the prequel angle, jumping in time and seeing what it is like being a medium from another perspective. Lauren is a more interesting character in my opinion, though I may grow to really like Rosa in the later games.\n\nUnbound has a very noir feel to it, it taking place all in one single night. You investigate two deaths, one of a saxophone player and the other of a woman who shut herself in her own apartment for years. These two stories are written quite confidently, and I especially enjoyed the one about the musician. There's something really compelling about investigating the deaths of these characters. You're digging into the past, step by step you learn about people and their issues.\n\nBut the real highlight was the end. Obviously I won't spoil it for you here, but just know that this game isn't just about two random cases without any more personal connection to Lauren. When the credits rolled, I found myself empathising with her a whole lot, and it really cast a spotlight on Rosangela and the things that lay in wait for her.\n\nBlackwell Unbound is an excellent continuation in the series, offers the usual great banter between Joey and the main character, has interesting cases to solve and above all raises the stakes for our heroine(s).

For the main focus of this review, I will compare the previous game, Blackwell Legacy, with this game.\n\nSo far, Legacy was a precursor to what was about to come, it was just a taste. It focused on that one case, but Unbound focused on two, which seems unrelated till we recognise that there are connections aside.\n\nI liked how Unbound fleshed out the character of Lauren Blackwell, which to most of the audiences, thought she was a strange case of dementia. Her dynamics with Joey Mallone was snarky but when fleshed out, it's fantastic. It is interesting on how their relationship works. I liked the banter between them and enjoyed it the most. \n\nAt first though, I seem to get lost with the game. I didn't know what to do, but I started to find my feet after humdrums of clicking them. The stories were interesting. I got really sad about the stories, but I was invested enough to finish the game myself. \n\nI enjoy the game and the graphics seems to be better this time around. At least I can read it.

The game certainly took me by surprised and when I saw the next game in this saga, Blackwell Unbound, I didn\u2019t want to play it as I thought it couldn\u2019t live up to its standards. Well I simply caved in and installed the game. Once completed, this one moved me more than the first (Blackwell Legacy) with even better character development. There were also slightly more technical improvements however the puzzle elements were the same; that is wasn\u2019t challenging enough and lack thereof.\n\nBlackwell Unbound takes place in 1973, meaning it served as a prequel to Legacy. The game assumes the player\u2019s knowledge of the main character Joey and introduces a new one, Lauren. Lauren is the aunt for Rosa from Legacy and her demeanour is considerably different as Lauren is more confident in her abilities as a medium. Then again, it didn\u2019t explain at all of how Lauren was introduced to Joey in the first place. Nevertheless it\u2019s a refreshing outlook of Lauren\u2019s more assertive personality considering she is a chain smoker from hell. I guess that\u2019s the 70s for ya.\n\nThe gameplay is in the style of a point and click variety \u2013 that is you literally just do that, point at a hotspot like an item or person and it will interact. Right click the mouse for the character to analyse and left click to interact. There is some inventory management where only Lauren can access (as after all, Joey is a ghost) and the neat notebook feature is here again. What this feature does, once it gets an update prompt, you can join sentences together to form another. Yet to those who\u2019d played Legacy, there\u2019s a new feature where you get to control both Joey and Lauren individually. This is pretty neat considering some puzzles requires swapping between characters.\n\nSpeaking of which, there are only a handful of puzzles to solve yet thankfully, they are all logical so they are no mind-bending at all. For some, this maybe a put-off however the plotline and game\u2019s pacing hits the spot as there\u2019s momentum instead of having a difficult puzzle to bottleneck the tempo. Also the storyline is so well written with realistic problems that\u2019s very welcoming. The general mood is sombre yet well fitted for the plotline.\n\nThankfully to enhance the sombre mood, the musical scores by Thomas Regin is nothing short but exceptional. All the scores are well suited for this game and has that jazz feel. Not overdone however very welcoming and professionally composed. It\u2019s that good I purchased the soundtrack in iTunes for USD $10. Graphically it is powered by the Adventure Game Studio (AGS), graphic artist Erin Robinson made some alterations, mainly with the characters and done a wonderful job at it. They are all dressed up as if it was the 70s and there\u2019s little to be said about pixel hunting. Yet the opening screen where is shows the Statue of Liberty overlooking the Manhattan skyline at night is lovely to see.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty rare that an adventure game sucks me in as well as Unbound did. The game\u2019s length, depending upon your detective skills I guess, could take around the five hours mark. However I really cannot let go of this game until completion as mentioned before, the game\u2019s pacing and storytelling is simply fantastic. Granted there\u2019s a couple of bugs where the written text and spoken words differ and at one occasion, the text is there however the voice is muted however, and thankfully so, didn\u2019t ruin the game. There\u2019s obvious love and care poured into this game and the game\u2019s ending, as much as I did actually panic, feels like I need to perform a standing ovation!

Solid story and good voice-acting. Requires some good thinking to solve[/h1]\n\nBlackwell Unbound, the second in the Blackwell series by Wadjet Eye Games reverberates some of he more in-depth adventure games that used to be around; Even though it can be a bit short in playtime.\n\nThe solid storyline and good voice-acting from the first epidode (The Blackwell Legacy) is continued as we pick up the Blackwell family history with Lauren Blackwell in 1973. The family legacy is a 'spirit guide' in the form of the ever present, but ghostly, Joey.\n\nThe scriptwriter(s) get the relationship between Joey and Lauren just right and the fine voice-cast excels in making the most of the dialogues. The game also gets the music just right. Never intrusive, but flowing and sometimes catchy. The atmosphere of seventies New York is is quietly blended in the background to give room to the characters which are key in the game.\n\nThis all results in a immersed gameplay experience even though the graphics are retro (similar to most Lucasarts and other adventure titles from the early nineties).\n\nLike in those games, lots of questions and interaction with all the protagonists are required if you want to make headway, and even the most experienced adventurers sometimes will have a hard time making the next step. Because the game is so engrossing this never really irritates. I found myself curious about the next part of the story for almost every part of the game.\n\nA nice feature is the bonus content that can be unlocked which provides for some re-playability (ofcourse this takes the form of \"Achievements\" if you play under Steam).

Very good storyline and game mechanics. It kept me up late at night several times because I just wanted to know how the story ended. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that the story ended after part five. But that is probably a good thing because you do not want to ruin a good story by stretching it thin.\n\nYou play this adventure with two main characters: Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Malone. Part two is kind of a prequel in which Rosangela is replaced by her Aunt Lauren Blackwell.\nRosangela and Lauren are mediums and Joey Malone is their spirit guide. Together they help the souls of dead people (ghosts) that are stuck in this world to move on. Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.\n\nJoey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.\n\nA very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information. By cross-referencing the right information you will learn new things which will help you to further progress into the game. Some information you have to lookup on the internet (in game) and emails play an important role too in this game.\n\nThe Blackwell series consists of five separate parts:\n\n1. The Blackwell Legacy\n2. Blackwell Unbound\n3. Blackwell Convergence\n4. Blackwell Deception\n5. Blackwell Epiphany\n\nBe sure to play them in that order because it is in fact one big story divided over five parts.", "timestamp_created": 1454844925, "timestamp_updated": 1454844925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20570293": {"recommendationid": "20570293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045521420", "num_games_owned": 593, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452569086}, "language": "english", "review": "My experience with Blackwell Unbound was completely different than my experience with The Blackwell Legacy, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. Some of the problems I had with the first entry were remedied in Blackwell Unbound, while some of the shining points in the first game were surprisingly absent from this game. \n\nThe story premise has really started to interest me. I think it has the same kind of longevity as some template-based TV serials like X-Files or Star Trek. In his commentary track, Dave Gilbert discusses the \"lingering ghost\" trope and why it's interesting, and he's right--it is interesting. As far as the story goes, I am now \"on-board\" with the Blackwell games (although the final scene of Blackwell Unbound posed a huge moral problem for me). It was really cool to play as Lauren; she is an interesting character, especially alongside Joey. I wish I could have seen more interaction between them. \n\nThe gameplay of Blackwell Unbound differs from its predecessor by allowing the player to switch between playing as Joey and playing as Lauren. I think this is and always has been a cool mechanic. Unfortunately, unlike some other successful adventure games who have used this mechanic, like Maniac Mansion and The Cave, Blackwell Unbound doesn't really make good use of the ability to switch characters. Joey is only necessary for a couple of small actions, and he is otherwise unnecessary. However, Gilbert does explain in the commentary track that Blackwell Unbound was meant to be a short project to tide players over until the more ambitious Blackwell Convergence was finished, so I assume that the character-switching will be put to better use in the next game in the series.\n\nThe graphics and voice acting are other pieces of evidence that Blackwell Unbound seems to have been given less thought and attention than the first game (I have not yet played Convergence, so I can't compare). I was really impressed with The Blackwell Legacy's graphics and voice acting; everything looked really painstakingly drawn, and the voice actors gave great performances. Although some of the environments in Blackwell Unbound look really great (Jambalaya Records, Lauren's apartment) some of the environments looked pretty rushed (the map screen, the construction site), and there were a couple times I turned down my speakers because I was embarrassed that someone might hear the terrible voice acting. The problem with the voice acting seems to be that the actors were not very well-matched for the roles they played. Three of the characters (The Countess, Harriet Sherman, and Joseph Mitchell) are 50+ years old but are voiced by young people trying to imitate \"old\" voices, which makes for some really cringe-worthy moments. Another character, Dwayne, has a pretty embarrassing Jamaican accent and in the credits he appears to be voiced by a white guy. I hate to criticize peoples' acting abilities, especially since I'm certain I'd be absolutely terrible at it, but I feel like the voice performances in Blackwell Unbound really got in the way of my enjoying the game. \n\nThe puzzle logic in Blackwell Unbound really irked me, too. Obviously, in a series like Blackwell, the player needs to discover clues to progress. In Blackwell Unbound, there's a really cool mechanic that tasks the player with remembering and manually entering into a phonebook names that other characters mention in dialogue. I love it when games make me pull out a pad of paper and a pencil to solve a puzzle. My problem is that most of the \"clues\" seem really obvious and unnaturally forced into the dialogue (\"That's how we treat your kind at [b]Johnny Ivory's[/b]!\"), so it felt like Gilbert left a really obvious trail of breadcrumbs for me to follow. \n\nThe commentary track this time features Gilbert alongside one of the game's artists. It is sometimes interesting to hear about the processes they went through in designing the game. Dave Gilbert wasn't as annoying to me as he was in the commentary for The Blackwell Legacy; maybe he's growing on me. \n\nIn summary, Blackwell Unbound was a much more interesting game than The Blackwell Legacy, but I think The Blackwell Legacy had a greater level of polish and seemed more like a complete game.

Once again, real New York scenery and elements are intertwined with the Blackwell fiction, creating a perfect hybrid that feels like it could have happened were there more ghosts hanging around. Lauren is a nice change of pace from Rosa as well; their personalities differ enough to provide a change of pace, but at the same time, you can see where Rosa gets some of her sass. Also changed this time around is the in-game art style, having been handed off to a different artist this time around. The visual shift is also a nice change, and further cements the differences between Rosa and her aunt. Personally, I think Unbound's representation of the door before the afterlife is my favorite in the entire series.\n\nDespite it being a jump back from the series' start, Blackwell Unbound is still worth playing, both for the context it provides and some of the groundwork it lays later on.

Here, we take the chance of experiencing the previous generation of the Legacy, with Lauren Blackwell. I have to say that the previous game left me with such great expectations, I rushed to play this one and first, was quite confused not the find Rosa. The city, the time, even Joey's attitude was different. Then I realized that finding Lauren instead, was a welcoming surprise in the end.\n\nIn this game we play as Lauren Blackwell, Rosa's witty and daring aunt back in 1970s. She is a chain smoker, a lady with an attitude and she has the guts that Rosa lacked in the previous game. She takes the day as it comes, and doesn't rest until a case is closed. Alongside Joey - the famous legacy himself - they investigate many potential cases and guide restless spirits to their after lives. In this specific period of their partnership however, they shall meet a strange old lady and end up witnessing a darker shade of what being a medium actually means.\n\nThis game is a bit grim in tone compared to [i]the Blackwell Legacy[/i]. Dialogues carry sharp, two sided meanings, heavy with bittersweet feelings and a burdening suspense. The nature of the cases, and their resulting situation reveals a darker, shadier side to the medium business. Since we already know how Lauren's story will end eventually, seeing her venturing further down into her end is somehow heartbreaking.\n\nLauren is a strong character, as I briefly described before. She is so driven and so courageous, she ends up being downright suicidal sometimes. Her relationship with Joey is completely different whence compared to Rosa's relationship. We experience the advantage that Lauren and Joey already knew each other for a long time. So there is no awkwardness in their relationship. There is no \"Oh no, ghosts are real?\" period. I wondered if there would even be a little romance between them! I personally think this was a great opportunity to discover further background and in-depth personality to Joey and Lauren Blackwell.\n\nThe gameplay is nearly the same as before, yet the loveliest addition to the game is that Joey has become a playable character now. You are welcome to send him through walls or use his perception to check on the environment to catch a small nuance that may help you to progress in the case. I have to add that the voice acting was remarkably improved compared to the first game also. Alongside the commentary feature which we are already familiar with, you can enjoy some backdrop jokes, concept arts and various unused recordings when you finish the game.\n\nAll in all, I liked this one and now I feel more attracted to the Blackwell series altogether, witnessing Lauren and Joey in their time. Whence you look up on a family tree and compare the generations, it is not possible not to connect yourself better with given history. I cannot wait to play the third part and see what Rosa has been up to!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1439842410, "timestamp_updated": 1456612674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.771525", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17361388": {"recommendationid": "17361388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104350086", "num_games_owned": 886, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499221429}, "language": "english", "review": "A prequel to Blackwell Legacy that sets quite a bit of things in motion for the rest of the series", "timestamp_created": 1438576387, "timestamp_updated": 1438576387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17205871": {"recommendationid": "17205871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095076403", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436399827}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]Malditas precuelas[/h1]\n\nCada tanto me pregunt\u00f3 el porqu\u00e9 de las precuelas en el cine, en los libros o en los video juegos.

I don't want to say 'not recommended' as it's not actively bad, but it's not great either. So I'll just summarise a few of the pros and cons and hopefully that will help you decide whether this game is for you or not. As context, I played Blackwell Legacy immediately before I played this, and I started off liking that, but by the end of the second game I think some of the mechanics are wearing a little thin.\n\nPros\n- Music much better than Blackwell Legacy (which was pretty irritating and there seemed to be no option to turn it off)\n- Interesting enough story/concept\n- Characters OK-ish, writing OK-ish\n- Good to be able to swap between the main characters this time around\n- Good to have two cases to solve rather than one this time.\n\nCons\n- The game is too short for the price and quality. It's being sold on steam as five separate games, but really they are ,pre like episodes and probably should be billed as such\n- I did not enjoy the graphics. I am a loverof classic point and click games and I realise that's where they were going with the style, but to me it felt they went a little too far back in time. The graphics style just didn't seem to fit.\n- The vast majority of the game is walking back and forth to the same destinations to talk to the same people to see if you can ask them anything else that will incrementally advance the game. It feels pretty repetitive.\n- The voice acting and sound quality is terrible. Really terrible. You can hear breathing/distortion from their mics (something I've never before noticed in a game - apart from Blackwell legacy...) and the voices themselves for the most part are cringeworthy, to the point that it felt comedic when it wasn't supposed to. One of the characters almost sounded like the 'Drugs are bad, mmmkay' chap from South Park. There were a few terrible 'old lady' impressions. This game would be improved by not having any voice acting at all. (And it would fit more with the retro point and click vibe to have no in-game speech, so I'm honestly not sure why they included it)\n\nIn short, I don't honestly think this game is worth the money at full price, it's aleady short and a lot of the game feels like back-and-fort padding.

Lauren and her spirit guide, Joey, have been working together for some time by the start of this game and so the introductions and surprise of the last game have been replaced with an easy rapport. The transition of protagonist could have been disruptive, but considering the previous game ends on the question of Lauren's life and career, the chance to learn more about her was a welcome one. By making a full game of the answer instead of gaining this information through flashback or exposition (either from lost letters or Joey himself), you get a chance to see Lauren and Joey really interact with one another. In fact, moments where Joey has to comfort Lauren or talk her through the problem at hand are a common mechanic used to pause and sort through a twisted, interconnected set of cases. This installment has everything the past one did: retro/pixel graphics, great writing backed by great voice acting, and puzzles that are engaging as well as logical. Most importantly, this installment builds the same need to learn more, to see where this is going, as the last one did. I'm not sure if I'm excited to actually play the next game (I did play this immediately after finishing Legacy), but I am eager to learn more about the Blackwells and their relationship with the spirit world.", "timestamp_created": 1430653420, "timestamp_updated": 1430653420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15664166": {"recommendationid": "15664166", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999926754", "num_games_owned": 494, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430625971}, "language": "english", "review": "New Features: Unbound (episode 2 and a prequel to Legacy) improves on the first game by making it possible to manually control either Lauren or Joey. This proves useful, as Joey can do certain things as a ghost that Lauren cannot. Unbound also replaces the ability to research leads via computer with researching leads via phonebook/telephone. This new research method is actually very fun, and once you realize how it works, you'll enjoy using it every time.\n\nItem / Inventory Use: Definitely in there, and you'll definitely use items on environment and also combine items; however item/inventory use is relatively downplayed compared to a lot of other point-and-clicks.\n\nPuzzle Quality: Very good! Puzzles are sort of \"L.A. Noir\" in nature. You interview NPCs to acquire information on particular subjects, and the important information you find is jotted down in a notebook. You can then use the idea in your notebook like inventory items during interviews with other NPCs to pry for new information. You can also combine ideas in your notebook if you think there is a connection, which can create new ideas and generate new leads to investigate. There are also inventory type puzzles, but the interview puzzles are the main attraction.\n\nSolution Quality: Very good solutions to puzzles and solutions make perfect sense. (Just make sure you exhaust all dialogues!) I never felt like solutions were illogical or overwrought nonsense. It's safe to say that this game avoids the hugest problem that games in this genre usually have.\n\nStory/Characters: Very good! In fact, this point-and-click emphasizes these aspects the most, so if those are the most important thing to you in a point-and-click, then you don't wanna miss out on the Blackwell games.\n\nDialogue Quality: Very good! Lots of dialogue to explore, and the character dialogue is well-written, believable, and interesting.\n\nLength: Very short! Games in the Blackwell series are more like \"episodes\".

This one is actually a budget prequel, starring Rosa's auntie and jazzy setting of older New York.\n\nThe engine is quite old, but trusty and should work just fine, despite sometime being weird about using anti-aliasing over the pixel-art. Mostly when characters sprites are being scaled. It has a weird thing where all dialogue would be insta-skipped after pressing Shift+Tab, commonly used for Steam overlay. Pressing Tab will fix it.\n\nAs you can see, this game is a prequel, starring Lauern, Rosa's auntie along with Joey the sidekick ghost in older New York. And as you can actually see, it feels like a prequel with more of budget animation, the pixel-art isn't more simple and isn't as amazing. Still does job done. The odd thing that annoyes me is talking animation, for some reason everybody bobs whole head down upon opening mouth. The music is heavely using jazz in pretty much anything, which gives a special atmosphere to game's setting, but I like it less than in the first game.\n\nAnd yes, it's a modern point-n-click, with no deaths or dead ends. This time puzzles are a little better, though some notebook combinations don't make perfect sense. A good innovation is ability to switch between two character, though Joey doesn't have as much of use. Still makes it more like a team.\n\nThe plot starts dynamically right off the bad, unlike the first game where half of the game was you wandering around aimlessly. Here you got two seemingly unrelated cases. Yes, investigating in same time and deciding which clues belong to which one. Doesn't have big plot motivation to push you forward though. The plot also sets things going for the third game, so you shouldn't miss this game either.\nLauern is also more of mature character than Rosa, and the way that two main heroes interact with each other, with ability to chit chat, is quite fun. With unique part of being a heavy smoker.\n\nAchievements are quite usual, and there are two that are related to amount of times Lauren smoked through the game... So in one walkthrough you wil spend some time watching her picking on cigarrete and another one you better be speedrunning. Aha.\n\nAnd yes, game once again delivers on extra content. The commentaries mode is still there and this has drawing artist speaking sometimes too. Game designer's commentaries are there too and once again he mostly speaks about his experience with voice acting.\nAnd once you beat a game, while abusing people by doing photographs, you will unlock other extra content, including voice acting bloober and now also having a collection of early versions of music and even concept art for the third, upcoming by then, game in the series. No worries, pixel art is different in final version of the third game, will not spoil too hard.\n\nSo yes, another solid entry in the series. Sets things up for the third game and is good enough to be stand-alone. Favourite among fans and developers, despite being more of budget title.

And yet, somehow, Blackwell Unbound pulls it off admirably, all while adding some well-considered features and enhancements to the formula of the previous game.\n\nTo be fair, the characters explored in Unbound aren't completely unrelated.  Returning (or pre-existing) from the previous entry is ghostly sidekick Joey Mallone, this time teamed up with Lauren Blackwell, aunt of the previous game's Rosangela Blackwell.  Much of Lauren's past was shrouded in mystery in the previous game, dialog hinting only vaguely at her life as a medium.  While this game doesn't give you all the answers, or even most of them, it does at least give you a pretty decent glimpse into her life before Rosa.\n\nThe interface in Unbound is much the same as it was before: your standard Adventure Game interface, but with the added twist of a Notes page that lets you review and combine clues and facts.  Unbound adds another, very welcome feature: the ability to control Joey directly.  Rather than being little more than an object you interact with to complete certain puzzles, you can now float around in Joey's (lack of) shoes.  This makes Joey feel much more like a partner, vital to completing certain puzzles even, rather than a floating bit of comedic relief.\n\nMost of this game seems like a huge step forward for the series, despite chronologically being a step backward.  The dialog, the interface, even the ambiance and tone of the game all feel a bit more well developed and thought out.  This is still a short game - episodic and all - but despite the brief time spent in the game's version of 1973 New York you are still left with a very clear image of the city... at least as the game's developer meant to portray it.\n\nTo be concise, Blackwell Unbound is a short-but-excellent example of the classic point-and-click Adventure game genre, and a worth sequel to the original Blackwell Legacy.  Despite the change in setting it does a good job of carrying the torch, so to speak, and provides an interesting plot complete with entertaining characters and clever-but-not-frustratingly-illogical puzzles.

Unbound isn\u2019t so much about her adventures with Joey though, as it is a foreshadowing of what we already know happens to her.\n\nIn many ways she\u2019s the spitting image of her niece, though certainly more confident and assertive than the depressed Rosa we met in Legacy, yet tied by the common thread of having largely given up on the world. Lauren has devoted herself to helping lingering ghosts move on to the afterlife, but otherwise is unsure for what purpose she\u2019s living for. Or at least that\u2019s what she tells herself, but when caught up in an investigation she becomes a wholly different person.\n\nLauren is persistent and dedicated to doing whatever is necessary to finish a case, no matter if it means pressing people for information they\u2019d rather forget, or putting her life on the line to catch a killer. Maybe it\u2019s because she feels she has no other purpose that she\u2019s able to so readily move forward, unafraid of how dangerous it could become. By abandoning her worry she\u2019s able to fully embody her role as a medium, as if she too was a ghost and nothing could harm her. She\u2019s a refreshingly capable heroine in a landscape of unstable sex objects, who manages to be tough without losing her humanity. There\u2019s the feeling she\u2019s still scared underneath her fearless exterior, and allows herself to become vulnerable at times to avoid a complete breakdown, but she\u2019s always in control of any situation she puts herself in whether interrogating a witness or firing back when Joey gets brash.\n\nIt\u2019s in the final moments of Unbound though that are the most affecting. We\u2019ve already been told what eventually happens to Lauren in Legacy, but it\u2019s seeing it and hearing Joey\u2019s ignorant condolences that made me almost angry at what his presence has done and continues to do to the Blackwells. It casts Lauren and Rosa\u2019s relationship with him in a different light and made me question his every word, now unsure if I could trust him the way I was, wondering if he had a more nefarious purpose for being there all along. Much of Unbound feels inessential, like another episode in a show you enjoy but could afford to miss, but its implications on the larger whole of the Blackwell saga is perhaps the most significant bit of exposition in the series thus far.

One example is with one npc who refuses to talk to you in detail about a particular subject no matter how you come at it. It takes the player having to switch to the ghost, having the ghost look at a particular item next to the character, then starting the dialogue all over again.

Algunos personajes tienen m\u00e1s profundidad en su desarrollo que otros, pero me sorprende que cada personaje tenga su propia personalidad aun cuando a veces tienen pocas l\u00edneas de dialogo.\n- La narrativa, es decir, la forma de contar la historia. Algunas l\u00edneas de dialogo parecen simples pero creo que est\u00e1n bien estudiadas: me gusta que a veces no sea necesario decirlo todo con palabras, sino que sea necesario leer entre l\u00edneas para deducir lo que falta.\n- La importancia que el autor del videojuego da a la actuaci\u00f3n de voces. Incluso si hay errores, me gusta que ponga mimo en eso.\n- Si bien no es una obra maestra, la banda sonora casa a la perfecci\u00f3n con el ambiente jazz del juego y es de una alt\u00edsima calidad pese a ser un estudio de videojuegos independiente y de pocos recursos.\n- Las referencias a otros juegos de la misma serie u otros juegos de la productora.\n- Los extras (tomas falsas, dise\u00f1os conceptuales, canciones extra, etc.).\n- Los comentarios del autor explicando el proceso de creaci\u00f3n del videojuego y la toma de decisiones.\n- Aun pese a que alguna mec\u00e1nica y alg\u00fan puzle no me ha gustado, s\u00ed el que se sienta una evoluci\u00f3n y perfeccionamiento en comparaci\u00f3n con el anterior juego de la misma saga, me gusta que se sienta un poco diferente. Aunque est\u00e9 aun en pa\u00f1ales, considero un acierto lo de controlar a los dos personajes.\n\nNo me ha gustado:\n- Esto es muy personal, pero no me ha gustado algunos puzles, s\u00f3lo algunos. En mi caso me resulta frustrante cuando veo la resoluci\u00f3n de un puzle antes de que mi personaje lo vea, y tener que hacer algo dentro del juego con mi personaje para activar el script que me permite avanzar. Es decir, no me gusta cuando ya sabes de antemano qu\u00e9 necesitas y qu\u00e9 es lo siguiente que va a pasar, s\u00f3lo que no sabes c\u00f3mo activarlo porque no lo ves dentro del juego. Es algo que no sent\u00ed con The Blackwell Legacy y que s\u00ed he sentido con este. Afortunadamente, muchos puzles de este juego s\u00ed han sido l\u00f3gicos, pero mentir\u00eda si dijera que no me ha pasado con alguno.\n- La linealidad en la resoluci\u00f3n de puzles. Me gusta que haya m\u00e1s de una forma de resolverlos.\n- Algunos logros de Steam. Ciertos logros me han parecido simp\u00e1ticos, pero aun as\u00ed hay ciertos logros que son imposibles de obtener de una forma natural al jugar, necesitas gu\u00eda para saber c\u00f3mo obtenerlos. Tras finalizar el juego sin gu\u00eda, he le\u00eddo una para saber c\u00f3mo obtener los logros que me faltaban y he visto que o bien es necesario saber de antemano lo que va a pasar o bien hay t\u00e9cnicas espec\u00edficas para obtenerlos, no es algo que pueda obtenerse jugando normal. En cualquier caso, necesitas gu\u00eda, y aunque estos logros a\u00f1aden un punto de rejugabilidad, usar gu\u00eda creo que arruina la experiencia de juego. En mi caso, uno de los logros que me falta es el de escuchar los comentarios del autor pese a que s\u00ed los he escuchado todos desde el principio y sin salt\u00e1rmelos. Como no lo he activado desde la pantalla principal sino desde la pantalla de opciones nada m\u00e1s empezar el juego, no cuenta. Y sin la gu\u00eda no hubiera sabido por qu\u00e9 no he obtenido el logro aun habiendo hecho lo que se ped\u00eda.\n- El motor del juego. Aunque ya sab\u00eda lo que compraba, y sab\u00eda que eran juegos hechos con AGS, no paro de pensar mientras lo juego que es un motor con muchas limitaciones t\u00e9cnicas, y podr\u00eda haber sido un juego con m\u00e1s posibilidades narrativas y con mec\u00e1nicas diferentes si se hubiera contruido con otro motor. Ojo, no me molesta el apartado visual, hasta me parece que tiene encanto, muy a los 90, me refiero a limitaciones para, por ejemplo, crear mec\u00e1nicas diferentes para resolver puzles o crear una historia menos lineal, con m\u00e1s variables. \n- La corta duraci\u00f3n, aunque entiendo la motivaci\u00f3n del autor y la toma de decisiones, as\u00ed que es una cr\u00edtica menor.\n- Que no est\u00e9 en espa\u00f1ol. Soy biling\u00fce y me da igual que est\u00e9 o no en mi idioma nativo, pero es una limitaci\u00f3n para otros hispanohablantes.\n\nEn conjunto, es un juego que, en caso de hablar ingl\u00e9s, recomiendo porque hay m\u00e1s cosas favorables que desfavorables, y aquellas criticadas entiendo que son muy personales y debatibles. Adem\u00e1s, siempre creo que es importante tener en cuenta no s\u00f3lo la t\u00e9cnica de un juego, sino lo que un juego te hace sentir, y en mi caso he disfrutado de este juego y me ha entretenido como cuando jugaba a otros Point&Click en su \u00e9poca dorada.", "timestamp_created": 1419446315, "timestamp_updated": 1419446393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13499649": {"recommendationid": "13499649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035345900", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 126, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415536574}, "language": "english", "review": "its ok", "timestamp_created": 1419174167, "timestamp_updated": 1419174167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477499", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13375567": {"recommendationid": "13375567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002467735", "num_games_owned": 985, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418632688}, "language": "polish", "review": "Druga cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 lepsza od pierwszej.

Having known very little about the series going in, I have to say I enjoyed it, while not being particularly overwhelmed by it.  Before tackling this second game, I did a little bit of reading on it.  The general gist I got was that most people felt this second game was inferior to the first, and that it might be a little to short or too slight in content.\n\nI could not disagree more.  Whereas the first game was a nice enjoyable story, I found this second one leaps and bounds superior.  I did not find it too short (and really, what does \"too short\" mean when you're only paying a few bucks for a game?).  And the ending was pretty darn clever from a plot standpoint.  Unlike the first game, there is a consistent tone to Unbound, helped tremendously by the excellent jazz-tinged music score.  Unbound takes place in the span of one night--and the everpresent night scenes coupled with the themes of loss and regret gives Unbound a wonderful sense of poetry, of sadness.  And considering that this is a low-resolution game in the graphical spirit of early LucasArts games, it's somewhat miraculous that such a tone could be achieved.  \n\nAnother criticism I've come across (and also disagree with) is that the game doesn't \"help you\" enough in terms of the notebook feature.  Some people have gone really overboard and called the notebook \"broken.\"  The complaint seems to center around the idea that you as a player in real life shouldn't have to make any logical deductions on your own, but rather have the game itself spell it all out for you in Lauren's notebook.  It's ironic.  On the one hand people complain that the game is too short, on the other, they don't seem to want to take the time to ponder puzzles or be stuck on them.  I think in this modern age some people don't remember that adventure games traditionally had \"being stuck on a puzzle\" time factored INTO their play time.  So when you'd read descriptions of old King's Quest games and they claim to have 30 hours of game time, that's assuming the players don't just read from a walkthrough like some digital version of paint by numbers.  You're kind of supposed to have to think over things and figure things out in adventure games.  \n\nBesides, it's all rather moot.  I mostly found it pretty self-evident when the game wanted you to write down specific names that came up and look them up on your own.  The one (rather clever) puzzle, that I indeed was stuck on for a time, had to do with making observations about a photograph in Lauren's inventory.  I think some people honestly wanted the game to make this observation for the player and spell it out in Lauren's notebook without any intuitive thinking required..  But frankly, if the game had done such things, it would've robbed the player of so much of the point of experiences like this.\n\nIn Unbound there is a different protagonist than the rest of the Blackwell games.  And that proves to be a double-edged sword in a way, as I actually liked this character (Lauren) better than Rosa, the other lead.  I will say that it does make for some mixed feelings regarding Lauren given that she--SPOILER ALERT--apparently spends the last 25 years of her life a miserable vegetable in a mental hospital.  (That's what we learned about her in the first game.)  So the bittersweet ending of this has that extra edge to it.\n\nI'm curious if the subsequent games ever bring some kind of satisfying resolution--impossible as it may seem--to Lauren's fate.\n\nSo to sum up:  Blackwell Unbound is a great throwback to point and click, low-resolution, plot-centric adventure gaming.  And frankly, given the strength of its writing and the richness of tone (again, gotta love that jazz), in many ways it's better than a lot of the games that came from the so-called \"golden\" era.

I would recommend starting with \"Blackwell Legacy\", as that is the first game in the series and \"Blackwell Unbound\" is the second one. \n\nIn contrast to the first game you won't see any major flaws in game design in this one (like huge infodumps and the infamous first rather boring puzzle with the doorman). The plot pacing is a lot faster and the puzzles are a bit more interesting. However, the game length stays about the same, depends how quick you solve all the puzzles, as does the general gameplay. You still got your notebook and puzzles are mostly solved via dialogues and said notebook and rarely with items in your inventory.\n\nPersonally, this is my favourite game of the series. I thought the relationship between Lauren and Joey was much more interesting than the one between Rosa and Joey, the dialogues were really good and fleshed out the characters really well. Besides that, I REALLY loved that voice of Lauren <3.

The plot is similar, some characters are the same, and the gameplay in general is that of a nicely crafted adventure game. There are however some differences also, such as different art style, different dynamic between characters, and some adjustments to gameplay from the first game. \n\nWithout going into spoilers too much, here are pros and cons, according to me.\n\nPROS: \nLow price;\nReally good story, better than the first game, in my opinion;\nInteresting dialogue;\nBetter puzzles, didn't get stuck as much as the first one;\n\nCONS:\nAbsolutely completely remarkably poor choice of achievements, some are impossible to find without the guide, some are downright annoying. Sure some are OK, but that is not an excuse for the two smoking achievements that have no purpose and do nothing except irritate the player who has to replay the game just because the girl smoked and extra smoke or did not smoke enough.\nLess likable art style, art feels rushed and, well, amateurish. No character portraits, which is disappointing, especially compared to the first game. \nNeeded to play the game twice to get the commentary achievement, and then another time to get the smoking achievements (the girl smokes more when Joey is active and you are listening to the commentary). This is 3 times I had to play a game that does not change one bit from playthrough to playthrough. I find this completely unacceptable and poor game design (believe it or not, achievements are part of game design, and if you choose to include them, make sure they add to the game and not subtract from it).\nI feel the need to type things in manually demands more from player, as in have a piece of paper and a pen on them when playing. I found this to be somewhat annoying, A game should not need to do that to a player.\n\nOverall, I can only recommend this game because of the good story and puzzles.", "timestamp_created":

It is a point and click adventure, and sticks to the usual control scheme and playstyle of the genre. \n\nIn Blackwell Unbound, you play the aunt of the protagonist of Blackwell Legacy. Since this game sort of jumps in to the middle of a relationship between a medium and spirit guide, it is helpful to play the original game first to get some explanation on what is going on. With the help of Joey Malone, a ghost from the 1940's, you must solve mysteries and help lost ghosts find their way to the spirit world. It is a nice shake up of the usual detective story dynamic. While you still must look for clues and interrogate witnesses, you are doing so with the help of a ghost. You can switch from time to time between Lauren and Joey, the ghost, to help you advance. Certain things can only be done by Joey, such as moving through walls or talking to other ghosts in the real world.\n\nBlackwell Unbound runs a good bit shorter than The Blackwell Legacy. I really enjoyed the notebook functionality in the first game, but found it a little lacking in this one just due to the overall shortness of the game. This may be because while there is one overarching story, there are two distinct mysteries to solve. The first game just had one mystery that kind of led to another and so on, but the clues really built off each other and involved a lot more using the notebook to combine clues and interrogate witnesses.\n\nThe graphic style is pretty much unchanged from the first game. It is reminiscent of early 90's adventure games, which in my opinion have aged better than games from the late 90's and early 00's that begin using 3D. They look well enough, but they are really lacking in detail. It's ok to use that style, but I'd like to see it sharpened up a bit with some more detail added overall.\n\nThe voice acting is much improved, with only small complaints. The main character in particular sounds so much better. She sounds engaged in the story, while her predecessor sounded a little bored. Joey sounds the same, which is neither great nor bad. The main villain sounds pretty terrible in Blackwell Unbound. It really kind of removed me from the story. I think you will understand when you hear it.\n\nOverall, I actually enjoyed this more than Blackwell Legacy. While it was a little shorter, and I missed using the notebook as much as the original, I found the overall improvement of the story and voice acting won out. I really like this main character more, although I'm not expecting to see much more of her. I will definitely try out the next game in the series, and recommend you give this game a look.\n\nGrade: B+", "timestamp_created": 1410412828, "timestamp_updated": 1410412943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11954842": {"recommendationid": "11954842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063343415", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409638938}, "language": "english", "review": "Even if Lauren is not nearly as interesting as Rosa, Blackwell Unbound is a solid prequel to one of the most interesting adventure games in a while. 7.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1409639150, "timestamp_updated": 1409639150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11915913": {"recommendationid": "11915913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076721797", "num_games_owned": 673, "num_reviews": 427, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409363933}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd certainly say this was a step up from the first game in the series; though it assumes knowledge from the first game and you'll likely be lost playing this one first.\n\nThe story's stronger here and better paced, throwing you right in to things and keeping your attention the whole way through.

I'm starting to like these games more and more. I gave the thumbs down to the first game Blackwell Legacy with a question mark, since it wasn't altogether that bad (see full review on my profile). I've come to realize that these games are not your typical point and click adventure. Let me explain. Most point and click adventure games (at least the ones I have played) are puzzle based. This game on the other hand is more dialog/clue based. There are a couple of puzzles in the game, but the game stays true to what it should be a murder mystery (Don't worry the game is not graphic at all, just a bunch of cartoon looking ghosts).\n\nI still give the first game about 6/10. The main reason being too much storyline setup, a couple of really annoying puzzles (the director apologized for these), and super short game. While not the best game, it accomplished something important. It is like the introduction to a very good book. You can not only see that the director learned from some of the mistakes made in this game to make Unbound much better. It also helped in being able to jump right into this one, as characters were already set up. If you want to play this game, it is important to play Blackwell Legacy (Hey, its short! Maybe that was a good thing). You can definitely put this on the buy list. Here are my Pro's and Con's.\n\nPro's: Great Storyline for three different characters. Lauren Blackwell and the ghost she helps. The character interaction between Lauren and Joey is very good, you'll love these two characters and their relationship. No ridiculous puzzles in this one.

The game is not a continuation of the first, but more of a \"prequel\", looking at one of the adventures of Joey and Rosa's aunt Lauren. The game a defintley easier and shorter then the first. But I think at least part of that is due to game having similar games mechanics and play style to the first game. You have your notebook, and a few other tools to find information, though this time the computer is replaced with the yellow pages (this does take place a long while ago). The one thing I did find annoying was having to constantly go back to the apartment to look something up in the yellow pages. I so badly wanted Lauren to stick that thing in a backpack and take it with her. But the apartment is a good place to chat with Joey and the only place you can make calls, so my nickpick is small. This one was... a lot more solem then the first. If you've played the first game, then you know what becomes of the characters in the sequel, so many parts were bittersweet. And just like the first, we are faced with more questions then answers about Joey, his connection to Lauren and her family, and the \"rules\" involved with being a medium. Which isn't a bad thing. There is still 2* more games of the series, after all. All in all, I'm eager to play the next game!\n\n*Review update: 3 games acutally. Last one in the series was released this year.

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nAdditional note: This review will be shorter and will be written in respect to the first in the series (Blackwell Legacy), since this is an episodic sort of series.\n\nGameplay: The biggest addition is the ability to use Joey and Lauren (Rosangela isn't the protagonist to this game, much to my surprise) independently. This is used fairly often throughout the game. If you're coming from the first game, I'd still recommend leaving hints on, as otherwise this mechanic may blindside you (as it did me, wondering when Lauren was gonna finish her dang cig). Puzzles are a little bit more logical this time around, although one issue I had was that both my solution and the game's solution made sense (I thought of recording the song with my dictaphone and letting C hear it so he could get the ball rolling on what happened). It's better enough to show a marked improvement from the first game. 7/10.\n\nStory: Again, the big surprise for me was that we weren't playing as Rosangela this time around. I called one of the big twists early, which was kinda disappointing to me.  Hopefully the Countess isn't who I think it is, since that would be disappointingly easy to figure out. I enjoyed the slightly non-linear story, since you could do either case first. In terms of writing, it is a bit of a step down from Legacy, but it's still enjoyable nonetheless. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: It seems like we've gotten a consistent art style now, which is great. Plus, all the art is OC this time around, and it's all quite good. 4/5.\n\nSound: Decidedly jazzy to fit the scenario; still quite good. Still a bit of issues with the recording quality of Joey's lines (popping every now and then). 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/7/4/4; cumulative score of 7.3/10.", "timestamp_created": 1402596268, "timestamp_updated": 1402596268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10309976": {"recommendationid": "10309976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000422381", "num_games_owned": 593, "num_reviews": 194, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401456960}, "language": "english", "review": "See my previous review (Blackwell Legacy).

But if you miss some important points along the way, you'll have to backtrack a bit to get them before you can advance again. Luckily, the story is rather linear and it didn't look like the game could be put into an unwinnable state, so you can keep trying. And there are some achievements, so there's some replay value here to get them and perhaps see more of or a different aspect of the story.

Details are revealed throughout the five installments of the Blackwell series regarding the female members of the Blackwell family, how Joey came to be, what happened to Aunt Lauren to trap her in a comatose state, etc. Together, Rosa and Joey seek out and help tormented ghosts trapped in the physical world cross over to \"the other side\" throughout the series. \n\nIn BLACKWELL UNBOUND, the player is taken back to the 1970s. Here you get a glimpse of how Lauren Blackwell (Rosa's aunt) and Joey Mallone, a ghost/spirit guide, lived and worked together.  The focus in this installment is on two separate murders whose ghosts are trapped in the physical world.  Without revealing too much, Lauren and Joey come to find that both people were murdered by the same person, who is completely insane. This insane person will appear again, although in a different form, in the remaining installments.

The logic is much easier to follow this time around, though the clue-combining system really doesn't work very well. Lauren is more interesting in this game than Rosa was.

There were a few times when I got frustrated enough to consult a walkthrough - I basically just needed an idea about whatever it was I hadn't tried yet. Usually it was that I hadn't clicked on something or couldn't think of the right word or name to search in the phone book.\n\nPros:\n+ Another look into the Blackwell family history. This game stars Lauren Blackwell, Rosa's aunt. Lauren and Joey's conversation at the end was especially sad, considering what the first game showed about how things worked out for her.\n+ A little more gameplay variety this time around. You can switch between playing as Lauren and playing as Joey. As in the first game, you find out more information by talking to people or ghosts, making phone calls, and doing research, although instead of using a computer the way Rosa did, you have to search a phone book.\n+ I liked Lauren a bit more than Rosa. You don't [spoiler]drug any animals[/spoiler] in this game, for one thing, although you do end up [spoiler]killing someone in self-defense[/spoiler].\n+ Just like the first game, this one includes a few nice extras. So far I've only listened to the voice acting bloopers.\n\nCons:\n- I noticed a few more errors in this game than in the first. At least one bit of dialogue was paired up with the wrong voice clip, and there was one part where my setting said that I was playing as Joey but the game acted like I was playing as Lauren.\n- I didn't like the voice acting in this game nearly as much as in the first. Lauren and Joey were fine, but a few of the other voices bugged me. The worst was Dwayne (that accent was terrible).\n- The story didn't feel as tight. Sure, the two cases were [spoiler]eventually revealed to be connected, but for the bulk of the game it looked like Lauren and Joey were just investigating random unconnected ghosts.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1519414614, "timestamp_updated": 1519417523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40158031": {"recommendationid": "40158031", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971726726", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518875829}, "language": "english", "review": "love it, great aventure, it is short but it is because is divided in chapters.wont be dissapointedif you play it and want good writting", "timestamp_created": 1518876195, "timestamp_updated": 1518876195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39976024": {"recommendationid": "39976024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072659138", "num_games_owned": 1256, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518266016}, "language": "english", "review": "Again, a very short point-and-click pixelated adventure game about helping ghosts.

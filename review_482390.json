As the name might suggest, you wander around a small cafe at night, but you get to enjoy the company of Vincent himself. The small tavern has five explorable rooms, though the only alloted controls are for movement; sadly, you are unable to pick up any objects, or interact with anything.\n\nThe game came out in June 2016, just a couple months after both the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift launched on the consumer market, so its lack of interactive depth is forgivable in a nomadic extent. Regardless, the game is highly detailed and incredibly beautiful, being complimented right down to the brush strokes that Van Gogh was so well known for using. A few of his artworks are represented, such as his self-portrait, the famous chair, and even Starry Night if you can manage to lean out of the cafe window far enough.\n\nEven though it is incredibly short, coming in at around 10 minutes or less, The Night Cafe is an experience that must be had by all fans, like myself, of Vincent Van Gogh. He still stands as one of the most widely recognized painters of all time, and seeing his work brought to life in VR is incredible. An modernized update to this title would be well received if the developer decided to add interactivity, and maybe a few nods to Van Gogh's more obscure works as well. Either way, it's free, and it's every art-appreciator's dream to wander in what is basically a gigantic piece of artwork from one of their favorite artists.  \n\n[h1]Rating: [b]4.0/5.0[/b] - Excellent, highly worth playing.[/h1]\nThe Virtual Reality Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31311814/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thevirtualrealitynetwork]Group[/url] Click for More", "timestamp_created": 1511849964, "timestamp_updated": 1513695378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36309650": {"recommendationid": "36309650", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971509261", "num_games_owned": 759, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509919582}, "language": "english", "review": "Walk around inside a Van Gogh painting, what's not to love?", "timestamp_created": 1509919685, "timestamp_updated": 1509919685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35784956": {"recommendationid": "35784956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169469683", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508206278}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Este jogo foi a minha primeira experi\u00eancia com um \u00f3culos de realidade virtual (HTC Vive) e fico muito feliz de t\u00ea-lo escolhido, pois minhas lembran\u00e7as dele ser\u00e3o eternas; eu amei demais a experi\u00eancia.

O que ser\u00e1 que ele pensaria se pudesse experienciar estar dentro da sua pr\u00f3pria obra de arte?\n\nO Van Gogh se levantou e caminhou at\u00e9 a janela, observou o c\u00e9u e sentou-se novamente. Eu fiquei ali parada, boquiaberta, observando tudo com uma enorme admira\u00e7\u00e3o.

Andei para perto da escada mas n\u00e3o quis descer pois estava escuro l\u00e1 embaixo kkkkkkk Observei as l\u00e2mpadas, onde a luz de tinta brilhava hipnotizantemente... \n\nEnfim, foi uma experi\u00eancia sem igual.

A new and innovative Way to bring classic Artworks closer to a broader public Audience. I would gladly spend Money for an Experience like that, if it would offer a lot more (and diverse) Artists and their Works. This little Teaser is free anyway, so there\u00b4s nothing to regret. The Experience isn\u00b4t very long and because of that i will bascially review through some short Pro/ Con Points.\n\n[b]Pro:[/b]\nNew and fresh Experience\nBit of an 'Edutainment' Effect\nChill Factor\nFree of Charge\n\n[b]Con:[/b]\nShort Experience\nUnintuitive Movement and Controller Settings\nMotion Sickness Factor\nNot the whole Picture of VvG implemented (org. Artwork vs 3D Environment)\n\n\nA bit of further Explanation regarding to the Cons. The 'Playtime' surely can vary from User to User but let\u00b4s say it this way: If you would rush through the Room you would have seen everything in less than a Minute but the Atmosphere is great and it sucks you in the Van Gogh World, so you may spend some more time in it. \n\nThe Controller Settings are at least arkward. You can\u00b4t move 360 with the Sticks of the Gamepad but instead you have to use a Mix out of Sticks and digital Shoulder Buttons, which are turning the Camera for 45\u00b0. Felt not very intuitive to me.\n\nFor the Motion Sickness: I\u00b4ve played 1000s of hours with my DK2, mostly Elite, Project Cars and 'seated' Games and i would say that i have a good Resistance against MS (played Stuff like Dying Light or Alien Isolation in VR) but this makes me (a bit) sick if i am moving too much or to fast. It\u00b4s the old 'Moving as a Person in FPS' vs 'Sitting in a Car/ Cockpit' etc...\n\n\n\nHowever, i wanna see more of Stuff like that. A full 'Game' so to speak. More Artists, from all Epoches and a more accurate Implementation of 'all' the Details of the Artwork. (The implemented Details at the NC TtVvG are to few, compared original Picture vs Ingame Scene) A 'full' Experience could have DLCs over and over btw. On top i wish for more 'Edutainment'. More Details depending on the Artists and their Lifes and Works, maybe some Sheets, Lists, Data, Timeline, etc.\n\n\nAll in all a good [b]8/10[/b], recommended! \nIt\u00b4s free anyway, so no way to hesitate.", "timestamp_created": 1465384959, "timestamp_updated": 1465385483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758358", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23446024": {"recommendationid": "23446024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287754753", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493006018}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u5f88\u6709\u611f\u89ba\uff0c\u4e0d\u932f\u7684\u9ad4\u9a57\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1465356711, "timestamp_updated": 1465356711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23443418": {"recommendationid": "23443418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308481584", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465357907}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent experience that will open your mind to the possibilities of VR.", "timestamp_created": 1465340820, "timestamp_updated": 1465340820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23435971": {"recommendationid": "23435971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091319461", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465061223}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good experience.

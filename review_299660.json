I was enamoured by the moon's personality and his interactions with the other celestial bodies because it felt like an interactive children's book.\n\nThe level of difficulty is moderate and that feels completely appropriate for this game. 6180 the moon aims to be a lovely exploration of the screen-wrapping that emphasizes enjoyment over demanding a high level of motor coordination. \n\nMy favourite bit is [spoiler]that the S10 level that is essentially a reward for completing the beginning half of the game. Likewise, the very last stage is just as simple, and that feels perfect for this game. There is no need for an epic boss battle, and I think more games can take this as a lesson to leave the player happy instead of relieved upon completion.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1515652944, "timestamp_updated": 1515652944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39232068": {"recommendationid": "39232068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238854082", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 235, "last_played": 1515602924}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll go ahead and get the negatives out of the way:\n1) It's too short. I got 100% completion in under 2 hours of play time (104 minutes without trying hard).  Even with the 2nd half of the game (reverse levels) the game just isn't long enough to justify its price (unless you get it on a good sale)\n2) there are a couple glitches in the game, where you can fall through a block you shouldn't be able to fall through (not a breakable block, a normal platform block).\n3) the story can be a bit meh, and there are some grammar errors (only including this info as it really bugs some people) in the english version\n4) probably not much replay value here as there isn't even a time trial option or something like that. \n\nNow for the positivies:\n1) The game is very fun (if you like this sort of game)\n2) Soundtrack is great\n3) the reverse levels are actually fun and add a bit of difficulty to the game that I think most reverse levels in other games don't add. \n4) the graphics are a positive for me as I'm a bit colorblind and this game is very easy to see and is very easy on the eyes as well (no eye strain)\n5) if you do get it on sale, the game is worth every cent \n\nFinal thoughts:\nI'd buy it if you get it on sale. It's definitely enjoyable and relaxing.  \nI wish there were updates with additional levels, a time trial mode, or perhaps a new quest or something, but as it stands it's a fun title and I don't regret purchasing it during the steam winer sale.", "timestamp_created": 1515593475, "timestamp_updated": 1515593756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39111706": {"recommendationid": "39111706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020563592", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515229421}, "language": "english", "review": "Platformer where the screen wraps vertically.\n\nThe main mechanic is not unheard of, but handled pretty well here. The graphics and sound are fine, the levels themselves generally decent. The reverse levels were a nice touch.\n\nThere were a few levels that I was not particularly fond of, generally because the controls were a little sloppy and made the levels artificially difficult. For something of a precision platformer where you die all the time, the dying animation took way too long. There was also a little slop in terms of what would kill you and how you bounced off the breakable bricks.\n\nI did not enjoy the \"story,\" I would recommend skipping all the cutscenes.\n\nTook about two hours to get through all the levels, forward and backward. Felt pretty cheap but decent the whole time, rarely frustrating or hard, overall just pretty nice.

Der Mond macht sich nun auf die Suche nach der Sonne, und begegnet unterwegs den Planeten Erde, Venus und Merkur.\nDiese Handlung klingt sehr wie etwas aus einem Kinderbuch, und tats\u00e4chlich kam mir das beim Spielen auch so vor, aber das ist in Ordnung. [i]6180 the moon[/i] ist ein Spiel zum Entspannen, und braucht keine tiefgr\u00fcndige Handlung. Und auch wenn die die Handlung sehr leichte Kost war, musste selbst ich als Erwachsener hin und wieder Schmunzeln.\n\nEs versteht sich von selbst, das die Handlung und das Gameplay des Spiels einer wissenschaftlichen Pr\u00fcfung niemals standhalten w\u00fcrden...\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIn den Levels von [i]6180 the moon[/i] durchquert man als der Mond das innere Sonnensystem (was nicht ann\u00e4hernd so leer ist, wie es die Bezeichnung Welt[u]raum[/u] vermuten l\u00e4sst). Auf horizontalen Leveln versucht man Hindernisse zu meiden und das Ziel zu erreichen.\nEine besondere Mechanik ist, dass der obere und untere Bildschirmrand miteinander verbunden sind. Soll hei\u00dfen: Wenn man unten aus dem Bild herausf\u00e4llt, f\u00e4llt man von oben wieder herein, und umgekehrt. Das erlaubt neue M\u00f6glichkeiten, was das L\u00f6sen der R\u00e4tsel betrifft. Hin und wieder werden auch neue Elemente eingestreut, wie zum Beispiel Lichttropfen, die den Impuls des Mondes auf null zur\u00fccksetzen, wodurch man etwas weitere Spr\u00fcnge schaffen kann.\nAlles in allem ist das Spiel nicht sonderlich schwer, aber hier will ich mal ein Auge zudr\u00fccken, da schwerere R\u00e4tsel wohl nicht zum allgemeinen Ton des Spiels gepasst h\u00e4tten.\n\n[h1]Atmosph\u00e4re[/h1]\nDie Atmosph\u00e4re l\u00e4sst sich in einem Wort zusammenfassen: [b]Entspannend[/b].\nDie Optik ist minimalistisch und erinnert an einen gestirnten Nachthimmel dessen einziges Licht von eben jenen Sternen kommt. Dadurch wird ein Gef\u00fchl der Ruhe und Friedlichkeit geweckt.\nAkustisch untermalt wird das Ganze von sanften und langsamen Kl\u00e4ngen, welche von nur wenigen Instrumenten gleichzeitig kommen, und sich somit auch nicht zu sehr in den Vordergrund dr\u00e4ngen. Somit kann man auch einfach mal abschalten. Durch diese Art der Pr\u00e4sentation wird in Kombination mit der seichten Handlung eine sehr angenehme und unbeschwerte Atmosph\u00e4re geschaffen.\n\n[h1]Schw\u00e4chen[/h1]\nZwei Dinge passen meiner Meinung nach leider nicht zusammen, und dass sind die Spieldauer und der Kaufpreis. Der Preis von 3,99 \u20ac w\u00e4re f\u00fcr eine l\u00e4ngeres Spiel angemessen, oder umgekehrt, die Spieldauer (bei mir knapp 99 Minuten f\u00fcr alle Achievements) f\u00fcr ein g\u00fcnstigeres Spiel.\n\n[h1][u]Fazit / TL;DR[/u][/h1]\n[i]6180 the moon[/i] ist ideal zum Entspannen geeignet. Durch die minimalistische Pr\u00e4sentation und leicht zu verdauende Handlung wird ein Gef\u00fchl der Ruhe und Friedlichkeit erweckt, welches auch \u00fcber die nicht sehr schwierigen R\u00e4tsel hinwegtr\u00f6stet.\nAufgrund der kurzen Spieldauer in Kombination mit dem Kaufpreis empfehle ich aber, auf einen Sale zu warten.", "timestamp_created": 1506938082, "timestamp_updated": 1508137537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34960265": {"recommendationid": "34960265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142760884", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504480124}, "language": "english", "review": "not bad, not amazing, but not bad. gameplay is pretty fun tbh, and easy achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1505433702, "timestamp_updated": 1505433702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425581", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34918282": {"recommendationid": "34918282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040527801", "num_games_owned": 1041, "num_reviews": 141, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505304462}, "language": "french", "review": "Sa faible dur\u00e9e de vie (2h) ne doit pas vous rebuter.\nVous avez l\u00e0 quelque chose de qualit\u00e9, avec une tr\u00e8s bonne m\u00e9canique qui retournera vos habitudes, dans le bon sens.\n\nCompter aussi sur une narration succincte, mais suffisante pour se plonger dans l'histoire.\n\nSauter dessus !", "timestamp_created": 1505304642, "timestamp_updated": 1505304642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500450", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34747613": {"recommendationid": "34747613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028635556", "num_games_owned": 720, "num_reviews": 146, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507873789}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple platformer with a strait-forward gimmick.

It isn't really derivative of SMB and feels like its own game, but the controls aren't as tight.  There's a little touch of looseness which has you missing platforms and touching spikes.  While I slogged through the addictive levels of SMB until I 100%ed the game, I found myself playing 6180 in short sessions, and I've completed it in 5 hours.  Like SMB, death is quick and restarts are quick.  There are little continue points sprinkled through levels to make it less frustrating.  The jumps have a wrap mechanic from the top to bottom, but you quickly get used to it.  Each set of levels adds a new mechanic, but boy oh boy was I sick of spikes at the end of it all.  The music is beautiful, but the levels get a little repetitive and it;s not nearly as addicting as SMB.  Actually, if SMB is an A+ game, this is sort of a C+.

Pong type gameplay with goals rather than against another player.  Extremely short. Minimal gameplay. Minimalist art style.  Learning from making  mistakes is the point of this game. Singleplayer only.\n[b]ACHIEVEMENTS:[/b] QUICK AND EASY.  For achievement hunters.\n[b]STATUS:[/b] COMPLETE.\n[b]WHEN TO BUY:[/b]  ONLY IF BORED. Get it on discount.[/quote]\n\n[i]More info below....[/i]\n\n[h1]THE LOWDOWN:[/h1]\nYou are the Moon on a mission to find the Sun.  Guide your sphere across  forty or so levels of variously configured platform puzzles to its goal.    Use only the spacebar & arrow keys to direct elevation and projection. Gameplay bears some similarity to Pong style, the first video game that was played on black and white TVs back in the day.  Which is also the case here.   Once you complete the forty levels you get to replay them in reverse for that extra challenge.\n\n[h1]THE GOOD:[/h1]\n+ What there is is polished.\n+ Fun if youre inclined to enjoy the mental challenge.  There is very little else.\n\n[h1]THE BAD:[/h1]\n- Limited gameplay.\n- Basic graphics.\n- Steam cards are very expensive.\n\n[h1]AND THE ORDINARY:[/h1]\n* A nice piano tune accompanies play.\n* Only four levels of ten puzzles but you get to play them back in reverse.\n\n[h1]VERDICT:[/h1]\nThis is not a bad game.  Its actually quite enjoyable.  But it is not my sort of game.  Appears more of a student-made demo.  Its very short and limited gameplay will only appeal to players of casual games and fans of cheap and cheerful bundles.  Which is where this 'game' probably belongs.  \n\nHaving said that what there is, is fun and well-made and if I were the developer I would be  proud of this little puzzler.  I have enjoyed games like Lyne and Hexcells which I bought but, for around 3$/euros I dont think 6180 the Moon is worth it.  Even though I dont recommend it, some of you will enjoy it no doubt.

For a 4 dollar title, you get a nice relaxing experience that not only has some good level design that will challenge you with the mechanics it puts place, but one that will put you in a zen state of mind, even if you get frustrated. While the biggest problem it has is the games length (which lets be clear, seems appropriate for the 4 dollar price tag), the strong presentation carries the game by making it something you just want to look at, despite the limited color scheme. Mechanics don't stick around for too long before moving on to the next one, and sometimes you do have to think a little outside the box in order to move on in a stage. All in all, if you're looking for something to test your mind but not stress it, 6180 The moon is a solid pick up. \n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfHm0jJ2W2Q\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Solid puzzle elements that introduce new mechanics in a timely fashion. Just as you master the last element, you are introduced to a new one, or a shift in thinking to use it in a new way. \n[*] Great presentation, using the limited color scheme to make it feel.\n[*] Timing is tested here, and its in a good difficulty setting.\n[*] Pleasant piano music really puts you in a relaxed mode. \n[*] The reversal of stages on the way back shows some really good level design understanding and giving a challenges. \n[*] Sound design is good, giving you the little hints you need to react appropriate.\n[*] Animation is fluid. Yes, it's not that difficult to get animation working, but hey, it stills is good. \n[*] The story is touching, even in its simple, cute form. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]  Little hiccups with controls here and there on respawn. \n[*]  Story may make you groan at times.

Whether you'll want it in your library or not depends on your tolerance for simple indie puzzlers that can be fully completed in under two hours.\n\nMy favourite aspect of the game was the serene atmosphere it presents. The soundtrack is good, calming and appropriate for the setting, and just sitting on a random platform while plotting your next move can be quite contemplative. I found the visuals to be hit and miss; very minimalistic, but the textures are somewhat jarring and jagged on some of the obstacles, and I found the collision hitboxes to be slightly wacky on the side of the spikes. YMMV.\n\nThe story is whimsical and vaguely irritating, but nothing offensive, just pretty standard indie stuff. The gameplay is quite fun at points, with the general idea being to get from A to B via a screen that wraps around from top to bottom, negotiating obstacles as you go. Overall, I found the game to be relatively lacking in challenge and a bit uninspired in terms of level design. As mentioned earlier, it's also quite short, even for something so cheap and cheerful.\n\nThis is more of a neutral review than anything else, but given the sheer volume of games available on Steam these days, it's hard to recommend 6180. There are other cheap games that do everything far better, particularly in the sales. For cool bouncing mechanics involving spherical objects, The Floor Is Jelly and The Sun & Moon are worth a look, whike NightSky is a very atmospheric momentum game.

There is a very atmospheric soundtrack to the game, not only fitting for the space theme but also quite calming, rather welcome when some of the stages can present frustration and repeated deaths.\n\nIt is quite a short game, perhaps an hour or less to play through fully.  It certainly doesn't overstay a welcome, and if anything feels like it could've been longer.  However, it seems the developers wanted things to end once they had presented the ideas they had with the mechanics, and so the game ends with all the stages well designed but without it being drawn out and without stages repeating themselves.\n\n6180 the moon is a game which I would recommend.  If you are interested in an unusual platformer, or want a quick game which does a great job of presenting its mechanics and challenges directly, then I would highly recommend checking it out.

But why is this so important? Well, it's my issue with this game; it feels like it never developed far beyond a fun little coding or development project.\n\nAside from the screen-wrapping mechanic you can see in the trailer, 6180 The Moon features all the typical \"minimalistic puzzle-platformer\" fare you might expect, albeit at a very rudimentary level. Move from left to right across the screen, get to the objective, and avoid the spikes. Levels are short and relatively uncomplicated, with difficulty in most puzzles coming through manipulation of the gravity mechanic. In essence, jumping pushes you out the top of the screen and in through the bottom; you hit an arc somewhere in the middle, and float right back down again. And that's the game.\n\nI definitely enjoyed some of the puzzles, but felt from very early on that I was playing something made in a Game Jam. There's nothing wrong with that at all, mind you; but I feel the developer wanted this game to be treated as a complete experience. So that is what I am reviewing 6180 The Moon on, and why my review is negative. The strange, wishy-washy story, the sometimes \"muddy\" feel of control during a jump, and the little glitches scattered all the way through make this game feel more like a great amateur project than a good published game (if that makes any sense).\n\nNow if this [i]had[/i] been presented as a hobbyist's project or a Game Jam submission, I reckon I would have been a lot more forgiving with my review. It definitely has a number of real positives too, like the pretty soundtrack which I see is mentioned in almost all of the positive reviews here. However 6180 The Moon isn't a game I would recommend parting with any money for, whether at full price or on sale; there are plenty of other \"puzzle-platformer with a unique mechanic\" titles to pick up on Steam that feel a lot more polished overall.", "timestamp_created": 1479714439, "timestamp_updated": 1480107459, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569625", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26579601": {"recommendationid": "26579601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075673573", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 160, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479012961}, "language": "english", "review": "I rate the game 6180 the moon 4/5. Good.\n\nThis little puzzle/platformer game, in which you play as a visually minimalistic and anthropomorphized version of the moon in a mostly high-contrast environment, bears the number \"6180\" because that is apparently the number of minutes it took this game's two programmers to create this game from start to finish. \"109\" however is the number of minutes it took me to decide I had played this good little game to my satisfaction and while the gameplay itself is fun, it is the generally wonderful music that really makes this game truly worthwhile (despite the fact that in some parts the music does sound like bad shopping or elevator music). Truly, the good parts of this game's music are so wonderful that the quality of the game itself is often completely overshadowed by the amazing music. Despite a few shortcomings here and there, this little game definitely has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard any game have (if you like quasi-ambient peaceful music with high pitched tones).\n\n+Interesting gameplay with a nice mechanic where you are able to jump or fall through the bottom of the screen and then out of the top of the screen.\n+Lots of interesting platform game style puzzles.\n+Fun little anthropomorphic story featuring anthropomorphic planets which talk to each other using text.\n+Wonderful, beautiful music (except in certain places where the music sounds like elevator music).\n+Keyboard controls allow for a great deal of precision.\n+So far as I remember, this game was very inexpensive.\n+No bugs.\n\n+/-Highly minimalistic graphics, interface and controls.\n\n-Can become repetitive or frustrating easily (though this is minimized by the game's tremendously fast loading times) to the extent that this game is best played for short periods of time only once in a while (unless you like this kind of puzzle platformer game more than I do).", "timestamp_created": 1479039432, "timestamp_updated": 1479039432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26493635": {"recommendationid": "26493635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044380284", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478630893}, "language": "english", "review": "A simplistic, pretty smart platformer creates a pensive, relaxing atmosphere that will mostly punish you if you rush in (though, at some points, just that is \"required\").

After the Sun disappears, the people of Earth beg the Moon to search for the Sun before all of Earth's trees are cut down for heat and everyone freeze's to death.\n\nFull review: 6180 the moon is a neat platformer which uses a technique, which should really be used more in gaming, called \"screen wrapping,\" or a \"wraparound\". This technique connects the top and bottom of the screen in each level so that otherwise bottomless pits will simply seamlessly drop you from the top of the screen whilst you keep your momentum.\n\nIntroduced in each new (literally) world are new mechanics which make solving each level somewhat difficult, including spikes, one-time-use \"spring blocks\", temporary walls and floors, buttons which connect to otherwise unbreakable walls and floors, and momentum-stopping balls of light.\n\nThe story is rather simple, not thought provoking, and isn't really needed in this type of game, but the addition of a story is a nice touch none-the-less. The \"characters\" introduced are also somewhat memorable and can give you a bit of a chuckle.\n\nI only have two small problems with this game: 1) touching the non-sharp, smooth, non-deadly sides of the spikes kill you (this is a problem in most video-games which should really be looked in to. Spelunky is the only game I know of where touching the sides of spikes doesn't kill you). 2) the hitbox of said spikes are a bit bigger than you'd expect (when the Moon \"dies\", you can see its \"body\" fading into darkness, and when you see this animation you can see that there's a good 1cm gap between the spike and the Moon's \"body\").\n\nDo I recommend buying 6180 the moon? Yes; it's a simple, not-too-easy/not-too-hard puzzle game that can entertain you for a couple of hours, the soundtrack's nice and doesn't distract you from the gameplay, and if you're a speedrunner this might be a good game to race others with. For NZD$4.99, I'd say wait for when this game is a dollar or two off before buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1476399435, "timestamp_updated": 1476399435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25977857": {"recommendationid": "25977857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165145176", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476165002}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1\u4e8b\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u53ef\u4ee5\u800d\u800d\uff0c\u9006\u5173\u5361\u73a9\u4e0d\u4e0b\u53bb\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1476165053, "timestamp_updated": 1476165053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25971139": {"recommendationid": "25971139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201025290", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459283915}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey look a short, fun and charming indi platformer with a good soundtrack.

Dal momento in cui la meccanica principale consiste nel giostrarsi tra i due bordi orizzontali dello schermo che risultano collegati da un unico andamento gravitazionale, il titolo sconfina anche con fare molto cauto nel rompicapo di fisica. L'immaginario che sottosta alla trovata di gameplay \u00e8 quello astrale del ciclo perpetuo delle fasi del giorno, visto come movimento ondulatorio in cui sorgere e calare si confondono. Non potr\u00e0 non saltare all'occhio che 6180 ha fatto decisamente scuola con l'ottimo The sun and moon, che ne riprende temi \"di superficie\" e genere spingendo per\u00f2 assai di pi\u00f9 sul senso di \"sfida dell'impossibile\", tanto da essere decisamente classificabile con la sfuggente etichetta di \"impossible platform\". 6180 ha dalla sua un messaggio che vuol essere decisamente pi\u00f9 esplicito: tutto il corso del gioco \u00e8 collegato linearmente da una storia narrata tramite dialoghi tra stelle, pianeti e satelliti. I toni sono fiabeschi, ma 6180 riesce a sostenere un livello metaforico tutt'altro che originale ma godibile e percepito in qualche modo come \"necessario\" (per un esempio di fiaba fine a se stessa, potete leggere la mia recente recensione di Moonlight). Quello che sto recensendo \u00e8 un gioco dai toni profondamente junghiani. Tutto ruota intorno all'idea del valore dell'oscurit\u00e0, all'accettazione di questa da parte di se stessa e da parte della luce. La luna si sente in qualche modo sfruttata dall'umanit\u00e0 che le chiede insistentemente di portare indietro il sole, caricandola di responsabilit\u00e0 e al tempo stesso ammettendo di preferirle il giorno. Ma \u00e8 a lei che l'uomo rivolge le sue preghiere, non al sole. E' lei che si muove in un viaggio vorticoso, non il sole. E' lei che il sole deve ringraziare se l'uomo lo apprezza, perch\u00e9 non pu\u00f2 esistere gioia della luce senza uno stacco chiaroscurale netto. Traslando queste immagini in termini psicologici si ha una bella immagine di equilibrio e di unit\u00e0, rafforzata dallo sfondamento della differenza alto/basso all'interno dello schermo. Il bilanciamento delle parti riesce a mantenere vivo un Taijitu spaziale in cui chiudere il ciclo \u00e8 faticoso, ma sereno: assai ben collocato \u00e8 il riferimento a Armstrong verso la fine del gioco, che diventa simbolo della vita effimera dell'uomo. Al di l\u00e0 della struttura contenutistica, 6180 non riesce a impressionare particolarmente nella direzione artistica o nel level design. Sebbene le idee siano ben variate e distribuite, l'atmosfera rimane fin troppo serena e la trovata della seconda met\u00e0 del gioco non sempre regge un principio di difficolt\u00e0 crescente. La durata (circa un'ora e mezza) risulta veramente troppo limitata, lasciando il giocatore desideroso di vedere cluster ambientati sugli altri pianeti del sistema solare: questo \u00e8 il risultato di aver costruito una storia il cui climax non corrisponde a un corrispondente picco di complessit\u00e0 a livello di struttura di livelli. Il comparto sonoro \u00e8 molto coerente con l'atmosfera creata, sulle dolci noti di una melodia dell'io intimo. Tuttavia non riesco a non fare un paragone con la trovata della traccia unica in The sun and moon: ancora, scelta diversa per fini diversi, ma devo dire che sono stato rapito maggiormente da quest'ultima idea. In definitiva 6180 the moon \u00e8 un'esperienza molto rilassante, sia a livello epidermico che psicologico. Il suo fine ultimo \u00e8 far vedere la positivit\u00e0 nel buio, ed integrarlo in un senso di unitariet\u00e0 cosmica che, se percepita, pu\u00f2 risollevare anche gli animi pi\u00f9 feriti. A livello ludico puro consiglio tuttavia di guardare anche (e forse con pi\u00f9 attenzione) il suo \"figlioletto\" pi\u00f9 volte menzionato in questa recensione.", "timestamp_created": 1458076437, "timestamp_updated": 1458076524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21577993": {"recommendationid": "21577993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161487164", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456458558}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely game in which you play the Moon looking for the Sun.

A simple aesthetic isn't the last word in quality, but the danger here is that the challenges presented might have about as much thought put into them as the presentation. 6180 the moon may give that impression at first glance, but it turned out far more clever and engrossing than I expected.\n\nYou play the moon, on a quest to find its eternal buddy the sun. This journey takes you across fifty levels divided into five regions of the solar system, broken up by adorable little cutscenes with other heavenly bodies. The game's gimmick is that the screen wraps around the top, so if you plunge off the bottom you'll drop back in above. That means no bottomless pits to worry about, but the numerous spikes are more than happy to take their place for ruining your day. Your jump sends you a full screen height and change so there's nowhere on the screen that's unreachable, giving you very pleasant freedom of movement.\n\nLevel gimmicks include spikes, moving platforms, breakaway blocks, spikes, switches and gates, spikes, and a few other not-spike features. Once you wrap your brain around wrapping around the screen the game goes quite smoothly, and you'll likely complete your sojourn to the sun in 30-40 minutes. This unlocks a new mode where you play through the levels in reverse, with gravity flipped, and this one little change blew my mind. The vast majority of the levels are completely unchanged, but become far move difficult because of their genius dual design. Playing through the first time was a subdued, relaxing experience, but playing through the second was a distinct pleasure.\n\nThe whole game will take you just over an hour to complete, and there are no additional modes or corner-case achievements to chase so it'll all be over before you know it. But the clever puzzles are truly a delight, accompanied with an excellent piano soundtrack and the aforementioned cutscenes that just ooze charm. It's a bite-sized puzzle platformer, but you're sure to relish it more than a lot of larger offerings.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

The fact that the top of the screen wraps around with the bottom is quite cool. The goal is to get to the Sun and ask him some questions. Then after you do that, to go back to your place by Earth.\n\nThe Moon level set does a good job of making you understand the main mechanic of jumping through the screen. \n\nThe Earth level set gives you another interesting mechanic: a box which launches you in the opposite direction from where you hit it (up or down). It also plays a note that goes along with the background music which is a really nice touch. \n\nThe Venus level set has the best music in my opinion. It also introduces a sort of power-up which allows you to pause your upwards jump or downwards fall, stopping you in the air completely before gravity kicks in and pulls you downwards again. This allows you to avoid hitting spikes on the ceiling or to make longer jumps.\n\nUnfortunately another mechanic is introduced which is boring and rather frusterating. It's a timed wall that appears for two seconds and vanishes for two seconds. There's nothing really cool or fun about it, but it does add to the difficulty and challenge of the game.\n\nAfter the Venus levels, the game becomes a drag. It doesn't take too long to complete. While rushing, it took me about 1 hour 20 minutes. There are also achievements. These were fun to do. They add to the game if you want some extra, non-required challenge.\n\nOverall, it was a fun game for a while. AND IT'S ONLY $4. It's definitely worth buying the soundtrack with it.

This allows for unique level design, since platforms can become ceilings or hazards and the forced jump height can turn simple jumps into precise platorming tasks. 6180 the moon derives most of its level design from these unique physics, but also introduces a couple other elements later on, such as breakable blocks that will shoot you quickly up or down, depending on which side you hit it from, again making you consider your jump arcs. While the game is not overly difficult, it does provide a decent challenge and forces you to rethink basic platforming concepts. Along the way, you'll meet a few other planets who you greet with a short dialogue scene. These charming moments comprise most of the fairly sparse story.

The Moon, worried by the disappearance of the Sun, decides to look for him. What are the pros and cons of this little game?\n\n+ Reactive gameplay and lunar gravity are well translated\n+ Switching from top to bottom of screen allows an innovative level design\n+ Well introduced progressive difficulty\n+ \"Reverse\" mode unlockable after having beaten the regular levels (Inverted level design plus inverted gravity)\n+ Pleasant and relaxing instumental soundtrack\n+ Attractive price\n+ Steam achievements and trading cards\n\n- Too short (Completed in 2 hours, including \"Reverse\" mode)\n- \"Reverse\" mode even faster to complete than the original levels\n- Expensive soundtrack (Costs 75% of the base game's price)\n\nBy the use of short levels and an atypical gameplay, 6180 the Moon succeeds in keeping us involved all along the story. It is clearly stated in the first level that you will never die. Your mistakes will not be punished in any way (No lives, no \"Game over\") and the failures will only be your very own fault. De facto this game is really less frustrating than some other platformers can be.

If the problems had been worked out, it could have been interesting. As it stands, it is a couple short hours of at best a mind-bending and fairly forgiving physics gimmick game, and at worst intense frustration, glitches and shamefully awful writing.\n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b] Music is excellent, but writing is abysmal, glitches abound, and when you reach the half-way point, the game reverses your physics and expects you to redo the levels backwards, while pressing the [i]up[/i] arrow to jump [i]down[/i].\n\n[h1]Good:[/h1]\n    [b]Music[/b] - This game comes with a buyable soundtrack and there's no mystery why. The music is atmospheric, floaty and zen, which blends in well with the simple aesthetic the designers were clearly going for.\n    [b]Menus and UI[/b] - This might not normally be worth mentioning, but the menus introduce the game and its theme well. They fit the aesthetic and are intuitive and easy to navigate.\n    [b]Floating[/b] - This game makes use of a fixed jump height with a floaty arc as the base of its jumping physics, and admittedly it feels great and free just clearing a bank of spikes with a long, lazy, beautiful arc.\n\n[h1]Bad:[/h1]\n    [b]Writing[/b] - So bad that it is noticeably the worst thing about this game. Each of the planets is depicted as a dry, one-dimensional stereotype that seems like it's trying to give a Sunday special moral lesson that in many cases isn't even true. The game would be improved greatly by removing the dialogue moments entirely.\n    [b]Glitches[/b] - Above dialogue moments often show text popping in at one size and then immediately popping down to another font size. Sometimes two text entries appear on top of one another, rendering both unreadable. There's a negative space that you move through in between the moment you disappear off the bottom of the screen and the moment you emerge from the top of it, and while in that space you phase through moving platforms; it seems like they go through more negative space than you do. There are also a couple of glitches that can make you hit the wrong side of a bounce block, or freeze in place.\n    [b]Phase Walls[/b] - One of the introduced mechanics are walls that appear, fade, and disappear. This is a platforming staple, but in this game, I found it hard to get a feel for how long they would spend in each phase. More distinct or more fluid visual cues might have helped here.\n    [b]Symmetry[/b] - Given how much time you spend bouncing from the top to the bottom of the screen and back again at times, it can feel awkward how different falling down feels compared to rising up.\nHowever, the symmetry of controls becomes more important once you have reached the sun and are tasked with going back through all the levels in reverse - in this mode, you \"jump\" down (by pressing the up key, no less), \"fall\" up and stick to the bottoms of platforms, which is extremely unintuitive. Having come back to this game and completed the reverse levels, I can attest that many of the earliest levels are in fact designed to be much more challenging backwards, but nevertheless, the difficulty curve on the return is highly erratic rather than smooth.", "timestamp_created": 1428084762, "timestamp_updated": 1436251157, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499730", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15145894": {"recommendationid": "15145894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109617102", "num_games_owned": 1217, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427834022}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting platform puzzler based around the idea that the top of your screen is connected to the bottom.

One such game is 6180 the moon, a platforming game developed by first-time developer Turtle Cream Studios.\n\nThe gameplay of 6180 the moon is as simple as its story. You play as The Moon, who rolls through the various levels of the game in pursuit of the Sun, who has recently disappeared - the Moon has made it its goal to find the Sun and work out what has gone wrong. The mechanic that makes 6180 the moon unique is the fact that the top and bottom of ther level are connected - falling down causes you to reappear at the top, and jumping through the top causes you to rise from below, which makes for some rather interesting gameplay, which slowly develops over the course of the game's five areas with other mechanics, for instance blocks which explode, pushing the Moon upwards or downwards. Some of these mechanics, particularly the connected ceiling and floor and one mechanic where pressing a button causes some blocks to disappear, remind me of the old indie game Karoshi 2.0, which had some similar mechanics.\n\nThe game starts off easy and pretty much continues being generally easy throughout, though not so much so as to be boring - There is the slightest hint of challenge to keep you interested as you play through. That said, it is also a very short game, so don't expect to complete ther main game in over an hour; it took me about 45 minutes. But despite its short length, 6180 the moon is still an enjoyable experience with its interesting mechanics and the simple art style and soundtrack, which reminds me in part of some of the old WiiWare games for Nintendo Wii.\n\nOverall, I'd reccommend 6180 the moon. Short but sweet, it's a cute little platformer with a unique little style, ideal for when you feel like a quick one-hour game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1425213189, "timestamp_updated": 1425213189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489407", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14606029": {"recommendationid": "14606029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053885956", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424666360}, "language": "english", "review": "Still don't know why it has 6180 in front of the name", "timestamp_created": 1424666424, "timestamp_updated": 1424666424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512600", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14580654": {"recommendationid": "14580654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062596272", "num_games_owned": 1043, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424601350}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u041c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0442\u0435\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440, \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f.\n\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0430 5 \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044e \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437 \u0437\u0430 \u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0442\u043e\n\u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430, \u0434\u0430 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438,\n\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u044f \u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443. \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0443.\n\u0414\u0430 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1424543857, "timestamp_updated": 1424543857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542272", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14565877": {"recommendationid": "14565877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032078478", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424292473}, "language": "english", "review": "6180 is an experimental platformer where the top and bottom of the screen are connected.

Minimalist graphics and an amazing soundtrack make even the most intense moments seem relaxing. The story feels like a children\u2019s book. Not in a bad way, though. It\u2019s a straightforward plot involving celestial bodies. The moon goes looking for the sun and meets some planets along the way. Each heavenly body has a distinct personality and reaction to the moon\u2019s quest. When the moon finally does find the sun, he learns the truth about himself and the sun\u2019s disappearance.

A bit short, not much of a story line, it kinda had a child bedtime story like quality to it. Calming music in the background, and despite how simple it was, im sitting here cussing at it lol! Tis a puzzle based game where you have to take into account how high you jump, and you WILL jump through the top of the screen and reappear at the bottom. Think of this as a very easy version of portal,...portal for kids lol. I bought this game cause i thought it would be similar to 140. (140 is another puzzle game, I love 140 and its much more difficult than 6180) Took me no more than 2 hours to earn all achievements for this game, and I honestly wasnt trying to get them, just trying to finish the game. Most achievements are, \"Oh, you progressed, achievement!\". \"Oh, you jumped X amount of time, achievement!\" Right now this game is on sale for like a buck or two, I recommend it. However, take into consideration that this game really is easy, so if you like challenges, I wouldnt suggest this game. Get 140 and/or portal instead.

After beating it, it unlocks a mode where you can play the stages the other way around (last->first). No time trials, or user generated content to keep you interested.\n-Occasional lack of response to my keystrokes, or response to keystrokes that never were.\n-Twice I got stuck in thin air and once more somewhere I could not see me.\n-For some reason the \"W\" key decided to stop working halfway through, forcing me to switch to arrows, 3 levels after thinking it was a deliberate game mechanic.\n-Infuriating platforming and extremely lacking on the \"puzzle\" part. Some extremely unforgiving levels, which felt unfair. I almost ragequit 3-4 times and would have if this game wasn't so short.\n-Stupid timed puzzles, completely out of sync with the music, making timed jumps a massive pain. These were some the most infuriating levels.\n-The music loops too much, becoming boring really fast and annoying even faster.\n-I had constant screen-tearing, no clue why, my PC is more than capable of running this game. Combined with some extremely fast changes from \"black with white spots\" to \"really bright dark\", I currently have a  headache.\n\n\nOverall, this game is a personal disappointment and feels, above all, like a wasted oportunity.

The sun has gone missing, and with the people of Earth becoming distressed as the light disappears, you the moon have taken it upon yourself to heed their plight and discover where the sun has gone off to. \n\nThe writing, shockingly, actually wound up being my biggest issue with the game. Not so much because the narrative is flimsy and only the last handful of lines actually matter, but because it continually tries to fit in a rather odd, ambiguous meaning to the experience that never surfaces, and instead just floats around in the spectrum of weird space occupied by discarded poems and first drafts of better works.\n\nIf you disregard the story entirely though, 6180 is a rather delicious little platformer with an interesting (if basic and one note) mechanic of continual motion through the top and bottom of the screen. Falling through the ground pops you back out the top, and its with this in mind that platforms and obstacles are setup to require you to manipulate gravity and momentum to get past. The level designs are fairly simple and the difficulty consistently low (save a few frustrating spikes, pun not intended), but it's engaging and relaxing in a way that kept me interested in playing at least for the 40 or so minutes it took to complete the game.\n\nSimilarly, the modest but pleasant aesthetics and sleepy soundtrack fit in right along with an experience that seems designed to be played on a raining afternoon, sipping a cup of tea or cocoa without requiring you to process much more than a single button and the position of a few odd platformers. It's not deep, it's not innovative, and I likely won't remember it for very long, but I don't at all regret the time I spent with the moon and find it easy to recommend as a small snack of a game.", "timestamp_created": 1412396127, "timestamp_updated": 1412396127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701413", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12343848": {"recommendationid": "12343848", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967235073", "num_games_owned": 1065, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412377435}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little game!\nStart to finish with all achievements: 90 minutes. + extra idling to get all Steam cards.\n\nThis is a pretty nice and small platformer with a simple main mechanic: The screen wrap the top and bottom. Jump through the top, appear in bottom, and vice versa.\nWith this simple mechanic they challenge you in doing different jumps with timings and angles, introducing new elements and features slowly. They never felt unfair and I finished the game with a glass of whiskey being sipped on at the same time.\n\nI played with a 360 controller, no setup required, didn't try keyboard.\n\nThe graphics are just as you can see on the store page, I personally like the simple glowy style and it fits with the gameplay and music.\n\nThe music is nice in an ambient kind of way and reminds me of Thomas Was Alone and to some degree Knytt Stories (check em out, also good games).

Compare it to any good platforming game (in any subgenre) and this is just worse. Additionally the mechanics are clunky and in general the whole thing feels rushed.\n\nStory? Yeah, there is something resembling story. And it's the worst part of the game. It seems to be a story for kids, but it's sooo badly written...\n\nTo sum up - I really wish I didn't waste money (not much, but still) on this game. It seemed nice in the TB video, but it's not.

The game takes a completely new take on platforming mechanics and executes a great 2-3 hour experience with it. In this game, falling off to the bottom or jumping through the top (or in the later half of the game, the opposite!) will instead loop you around to the other side, as though your jump went across a cylinder. On top of that, you can't control how long your jump is, making for even more careful (not torturous) platforming. It's completely wild and in the same kind of way that portal does, it just absolutely bends your mind for nearly the entirety of the game.\nThe soundtrack of the game is zen-like in its nature and even if a level would otherwise be particularly hard and mildly rage inducing, I even found myself just saying \"Damn.\" calmly after multiple failures at just the first part of one level. In fact, I have yet to be actually mad from this game just from it's soundtrack. Your experience may vary, but it is still a great feature.\nThe only unfortunate thing about this game is that its story is completely lost in translation. You can certainly understand what's being said if you mix and replace some words, but the story is extremely minimal and unless you are someone who plays games almost exclusively for a story then this shouldn't be an issue and may even further lighten the mood because of some silly translations.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game, espeically for its price point.

Some of the levels are lacking in good design and the story is relatively weak. A great starting point if you wish to get into platformers.\n\nSTORY\n-----\nYou play as the moon on a search for the sun who seems to have disappeared. You'll visit each planet on your way to the sun and will learn far more than the moon ever bargained for.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n--------\n6180 The Moon is a 2d platforming game. Much like most the goal is to make your way from the left of the screen to the right of the screen while avoiding obstacles. It has a unique mechanic which it uses to great effect, that being the top and bottom of the screen are connected. Falling through the bottom of a level will make you reappear at the top keeping the same speed and arc. You'll use this alot to avoid obstacles and reach certain platforms. This also means there are no fall deaths. The game isn't super hard and can be completed in a short amount of time.\n\nSOUND\n------\n6180 The Moon has a really beautiful soundtrack. It's soothing and peaceful and suits the game very well. I bought it personally and use it sometimes to study to. Absolutely one of the top tier soundtracks of platforming games.\n\nPROBLEMS\n--------\nIn some retrospect the game might be a bit too easy for platformers looking for a challenge. Levels are very simple. The story isn't super interesting either but I guess for a platformer it isn't really a necessity. I don't really have alot of problems with this game. What it does it does well.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n------------\nReally quite easy luckily. After beating the game you'll have to make your way back through every level in reverse which is a greater challenge. There's a bunch of misc achievements you'll unlock just by playing too and if not there's a level select to quickly grind them out.\n\nPERSONAL THOUGHTS\n------------------\nFor starters to platformers this is a great game. It has an easy difficulty curve, a great soundtrack to get you into the mood, smooth gameplay and great visual design. There's not much to brag about and the price may be slightly steep for how long the game is but overall there's nothing to complain about.", "timestamp_created": 1521166340, "timestamp_updated": 1521429258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40724177": {"recommendationid": "40724177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053495983", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492881995}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple puzzle game with great pacing, chill vibes and somewhat challenging puzzles.

You are The Moon in search of The Sun. It has a lovely soundtrack, and the sound effects suit their purpose for the game (there are volume sliders for both of these, as well as a toggle for fullscreen, and a language selection). There are fifty levels over the course of five worlds/areas, which you go through twice (the second time through in reverse with reverse gravity as well). There are also new mechanics that are added to the game with each planet you meet in your search for The Sun. I completed the game with all of the achievements in about three hours.\n\nI gotta say, I enjoyed my time with this game, it's feels like it's about medium difficulty, as I got stuck here and there, but it wasn't for any extended period of time. I feel like the level of challenge and the feeling of accomplishment were well balenced for this more relaxed platformer game. I would say if there is anything negative against it would be that it is just a little too short for it's price (so getting it on a sale would probably be best). I give it a recommend for those that are interested in playing a somewhat challenging game with a quaint story and beautiful music.", "timestamp_created": 1517815880, "timestamp_updated": 1517816291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 390, "total_negative": 35, "total_reviews": 425}}

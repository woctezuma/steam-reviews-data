No come\u00e7o o jogo \u00e9 bem f\u00e1cil mas vai aumentando a dificuldade com o tempo, mas fique tranquilo pois as 100 fases do jogo far\u00e3o o jogo ter uma longevidade boa, al\u00e9m de n\u00e3o ser um jogo frustrante, sem contar que conforme as fases passam e entram coisas novas, as fases por si s\u00f3 explicam como cada funcionalidade funciona, sem a necessidade de grandes tutoriais. O jogo foi lan\u00e7ado em 16 de janeiro, sendo desenvolvido e distribu\u00eddo pela Green Dinosaur Games, est\u00fadio de jogos baseado em Taubat\u00e9 - SP.\n\n\ud83c\udfae Jogabilidade\nPela sua simplicidade, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 muitos bot\u00f5es, apenas direcionais e dois bot\u00f5es de comandos, um para pulo e outro para flutuar como se estivesse com uma jetpack, mas na verdade \u00e9 pelo \"peido\", tanto que em alguns momentos do jogo voc\u00ea pega feij\u00f5es que servem para dar uma carguinha extra. O jogo lembra alguns outros do mesmo estilo, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 no visual, mas tamb\u00e9m na jogabilidade, sem contar que ele \u00e9 muito bem otimizado, n\u00e3o notei nenhum bug por cima no meu tempo de jogo.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Gr\u00e1ficos\nO famoso feij\u00e3o com arroz.

"review": "I personally purchased this game. I reviewed it for my 99 Cent Gaming series.\n\nWow...I think there has been a gold standard set when it comes to games I've reviewed on my show. Ladies and gentlemen I present to you Pinkman, a very fun masochistic platformer that is in the same vein of Super Meat Boy, N+, and those before it.\n\nThere is so much going for this title that being priced at a cool .99 (and cheaper if you get it during the first week) makes it almost criminal to not recommend. Everything from the controls to the gradual increase in difficulty to the introductions of new mechanics and obsticals are all done in a way to only help the player understand what exactly brought them their doom.\n\nLike many platformers of this kind, Pinkman offers very simple controls that support both keyboard and controller. I used controller in this case and the character handled very well and never felt too sensitive or weighty. In addition to moving and jumping you can utilize a jetpack (or \"fart\" if you perfer) to give an extra boost when trying to make up to other platforms or trying to avoid an explosive death. \n\nNever once did I feel like a death was cheap or unavoidable, something that could have easily been done to make players try over and over again to pad out play time. Every level I had played through for my review (1-35) felt fair, difficult, and fun which only made me want to keep playing once the video was over.\n\nAltough the graphics are very simplistic, they also help the player to keep focused on the obstacles at hand. There's never a distraction thrown at you from how it's designed. The sound is also amazing and it kept my adrenaline going even when I suffered a round of deaths on a few levels.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I wish there were options for recording how fast you beat a level. Games like this are a speed runners dream, and the lack of a time keeping mechanic just baffles me. Hopefully in a future update this can get added.\n\nI have more to save in the video below, but overall this was a joy to not only discover but to review. Controls were on point, everything seemed polished, and it felt like a game with a purpose. Was this worth the .99 cents: absolutely! In fact, I was in doubt I'd ever find a gold standard when it came to games around this price point. Now I hope that I'll find other games that can reach this level of 99 cent enjoyment. Definitely give this developer your support.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=himmyLacgcw", "timestamp_created": 1484621298, "timestamp_updated": 1484621298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29308544": {"recommendationid": "29308544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008938674", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498321173}, "language": "koreana", "review": "800\uc6d0\uc774\uc5ec\uc11c \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc0c0\ub2e4\n\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5c6\uace0 \uadf8\ub0e5 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0 \uae68\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\n\n\uc624\ubc84\uc6cc\uce58 \ud30c\ub77c\ub97c \uc790\uc8fc \ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc800\ub77c\uba74 \ud55c\ubc88\ucbe4\uc740 \ud574\ubd10\ub3c4 \uc88b\uc744 \uac8c\uc784\n\n\ubbf8\uc0ac\uc77c\uc774 \ucad3\uc544\uc640\uc11c \uc2a4\ub9b4 \uc788\uae30\ub294 \ud568\n\uc7ac\ubbf8\ub294 \uadf8\ub2e4\uc9c0.. \uadf8\ub0e5 \uadf8\ub7fc \n\n1000\uc6d0\uc815\ub3c4 \uac12\uc5b4\uce58\ub294 \ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\n\uc885\uc885 \uc0ac\ucd0c\ub3d9\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc2dc\ucf1c\uc918\uc57c \ud560\uac83 \uac19\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1484620952, "timestamp_updated": 1484620952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29308241": {"recommendationid": "29308241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082438826", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485639478}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "MUITO SHOW!

Rusty Lake Hotel is a creepy, short, can't-look-away room-escape game that is a must-play, for cheap.  This one, Rusty Lake: Roots, tells the story of the whole family in tiny little vignettes that are basically room-escape puzzles unfolded into one specific scene each.  As with Hotel, what happens to each family member is far more creepy than endearing, and it all comes together to keep you clicking along.\n\nI was able to finish the game without hints in about 4-5 hours or so without getting stuck, but after the \"final\" big puzzle (no real spoilers ahead), the game uses two different mechanisms to extend the game time. One is satisfying (I zipped right through it) but the other is a clunky cheap shot.  However, I considered it worth the persistence it required only because I liked the final imagery tying this game to the previous one(s).\n\nYou can play this game without playing the others because the point of this world seems to be the feel rather than the plot.  And even though the game is at present still assembled like a mobile game, like Rusty Lake Hotel (it runs in a flash window and you may have trouble with your save file if you don't manage to allow Flash to use local storage), I consider it also a must-play if you like point-and-click puzzlers.", "timestamp_created": 1514748842, "timestamp_updated": 1514748842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

When you figure the puzzle out, it feels great.\n\nHowever, there were two times in this game I got frustrated, gave up, and looked at the official walkthrough.  And when I saw the solution, it seemed counter-intuitive, and I don't think I would have solved them without the walkthrough.   But this is a small quibble I had with the game.  It could just be me.\n\nOverall, I think this game is too interesting to pass up.

Manchmal stand ich etwas auf dem Schlauch bei einigen R\u00e4tzeln, aber daf\u00fcr gibt es vom Entwickler die Kompettl\u00f6sung entsprechend im Level verlinkt. An sich waren die R\u00e4tzel aber sehr gut, keins davon erschien unl\u00f6sbar und gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils kommt man gut durch. Bei mir funktionierte die Steuerung z.T. nicht 100%ig, aber das kann auch an meiner Maus liegen. F\u00fcr fast 5h Spielzeit (evtl. weniger, wenn man die R\u00e4tzel schneller l\u00f6st) ist der Preis durchaus angemessen. Wenn man vorher Rusty Lake Hotel gespielt hat, findet man einige Anspielungen darauf, es ist aber nicht notwendig umder Story zu folgen. Die Story an sich wird auch eher weniger erkl\u00e4rt und der Spieler kann sehr viel selber interpretieren. Das was man gezeigt bekommt ist aber in sich schl\u00fcssig (soweit das in dem eher surrealen Setting der beiden Rusty Lake-Spiele m\u00f6glich ist).

To start off, I'm not very good at puzzles. I never have been and I probably never will be. Thankfully, this game has just the right amount of balance with difficulty to make looking a guide a seldom occurence (but I did indeed need one on occasion). \n\nThe story, from what I have seen, is awesome. I really enjoy the art and some scenes (like with the well) actually disturbed me. This does not happen very often and I applaud the developer for this. \n\nNow here is what I didn't like and it has nothing to do with the story or the puzzles or anything like that. I have played about six hours of this game. Six hours of continuous puzzles and wracking my brain for sequences. Then one day the game suddenly got achievements on steam! Yay! Oh wait, not yay. The update with those achievements wiped my progress and I had to start at the beginning. I have barely touched the game since then. \n\nHonestly though, it's a really good game. That's why I was so sad when my progress got deleted through no fault of my own.

I was never at a loss for what to do, I always had a goal, the puzzles were usually straight forward, and the game consistently subverted my expectations keeping game play fresh and exciting.  \nBe warned however, this game might be disturbing for some people, it's freaky in the very least.  It's interesting, but man I did not see some of those actions coming.  \nThe story was well told, albeit unique.  \nIt's hard not to recommend this game though, I was entertained and it ran and led me along smoothly.

As interesting as the premise and setting were, the strange little puzzle box rooms of irritating brain-teasers didn\u2019t give me much hope. That made it all the more surprising when Rusty Lake: Roots appeared to take all the lessons I had hoped they would from the prior game. It\u2019s not a perfect genesis of the series, but the improvement is so dramatic I think it makes Rusty Lake Hotel a stronger recommendation by association.\n\nThe year is 1860 and James Vanderboom has just inherited a house from his late uncle. Arriving in the spring, he finds a seed and a note with instructions to plant and tend to it as he looks after the estate. From this humble beginning blooms the tale of the cursed Vanderboom family, tracing the lives of three generations of unfortunate souls. As their lives take their tragic turns, the story weaves everything back to that original seed and their unifying curse, and ultimately one of the dark secrets of Rusty Lake.\n\nMuch like the previous game, Roots is heavily steeped in the macabre. None of the people whom you guide through these stories will meet kind ends, and many will suffer significant agonies before their lives are allowed to end. It\u2019s not as gory or gormless as its precursor though, and does a much better job of living up to the macabre label. Most of the horror here comes from witnessing the inevitable, from seeing a scene build to an obvious tragedy and being powerless to stop it. Some of the best plotlines here involve lost children or love triangles that give the sinister events a more grounded base.\n\nThe drama unfolds in short vignettes, arranged chronologically along the lifelines of the players in question. These vignettes are single scrollable scenes which contain a handful of puzzles to solve in the course of reaching a generally obvious result. It might be as charming as getting a gentleman to propose to a lady, as painful as sending a young man off to war, or as nefarious as dropping a young boy down a well. Scenes should take about 10-15 minutes to complete, during which you\u2019ll uncover more clues to the overarching mystery and perhaps a few hints as to the nature of Rusty Lake itself.\n\nThe big improvement here for me is the quality of the puzzles, which are all far more sensical and thematically consistent than those in Hotel. Having single scenes focused around a central puzzle or puzzles helps limit potential flailing and allows each puzzle to do more in service to the story. I only found myself stumped in a few places, and this time I didn\u2019t feel like it was because the puzzles were badly designed. Everything had a purpose and a logic to it, and that gave the game a more cohesive feel overall.\n\nThe only aspect I found weaker this time was the ending, unfortunately enough. By the third generation of characters it should be clear what the ultimate goal of the game is, and when you reach the end it just kinda happens and then fades to black. There\u2019s no real revelation aside from the immediate result of your actions, and it falls a lot flatter than the insane reveals at the end of Hotel. I did play through the New Game+ style continuation to see the secret ending and while I liked that one more, it still didn\u2019t do much to satisfy my curiosities.\n\nWhile there are obviously links between Rusty Lake Hotel and Roots, they\u2019re minor enough that you wouldn\u2019t miss much by skipping Hotel. It\u2019s unfortunate the story doesn\u2019t take more advantage of the otherworldly weirdness of its predecessor but Roots is a strong enough game to stand on its own and command your attention for a few hours. The disturbing scenes and thematic puzzles do an excellent job of gripping the player as they uncover the secrets of this sad family, and only fail to completely pay off at the very end. As long as you\u2019re not expecting something mind-blowing in the conclusion, though, this one definitely succeeds where Rusty Lake Hotel stumbled.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

I regret buying and playing both of them. \n\nThis game in particular has the superior story, is longer, and... more puzzles. I don't say better or worse puzzles because while it does have some more challenging ones (in a good way) than Hotel did, it also has some that are harder (in a bad way) than Hotel. \n\nThere are intriguing puzzles that caused me to really think and learn throughout the game, but there were also janky kinds of jigsaw-puzzle areas that wouldn't function properly when you tried to \"snap\" the pieces in place, making it all the more furstrating trying to even solve them. There were also of course, the same kinds of puzzles that were in Hotel where you figure out the solutions either by accident, clicking things randomly and using your items on every possible item until something happens. It's a very mixed bag of super creative puzzles and god-forsakenly awful puzzles that make you want to look up guides sooner than ask for hints.\n\nWhat about the story? I purchased the bundle initially because I really thought the story was interesting. And throughout, it really is. It's gorey, creepy, with minimal jump-scares, and throughout the whole thing you can feel how it's only going to get worse for the characters. But by the end...? It's kind of a let down. Some have said \"It's referencing the Cube Escape games!\" but I personally believe any and all spin-off stories should still be able to hold their own in their self-contained worlds. This game sort of did, but it doesn't explain motivations of most of the characters, and leaves you with a very redundant, poorly executed conclusion of: (SPOILERS BELOW)\n\nIt's all some kind of reincarnation time loop! Not very interesting, not very appealing, and because the game doesn't explain how time is repeating this way, or why, it's just kind of. Blah. We don't even get to really know the character that is the cause of this time loop, either. Or how the supposed master-mind is pulling it off/why. It's not satisfying at all.\n\nI believe anything with effort put into it is worth some amount of money, but I do wish I had not bought these games. You can get the exact same experience just watching someone play it live, and so unless you can get it for 1 dollar, I'd say take a pass. Even if you love puzzles, the horrible excuses for puzzles, and broken controls for a good amount of them, aren't worth the head-ache. And the longer the game goes on, the more non-sensical the \"puzzles\" get.", "timestamp_created": 1499984183, "timestamp_updated": 1499984183, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

You solve puzzles to make your way through a family tree and come across a disturbing story. The puzzles are at times a decent challenge and there is even a great completion reward (similar to a true story ending) for those of you like to 100% complete games like myself.

Although Rusty Lake: Roots referenced Rusty Lake Hotel, I should have played Rusty Lake: Roots first because it was [i]wonderful[/i]. The puzzle design was much better and the various scenes were more linear, in a good way - unlike in Rusty Lake Hotel, you didn't find yourself having to replay a scene (or the whole game) because you hadn't done things exactly right.\n\nI originally only intended to play this for a little bit and then go to bed, but the characters and story completely grabbed me. Unlike Rusty Lake Hotel, I actually found Rusty Lake: Roots to be a bit creepy, and the incredibly messed up relationships and Vanderboom family history had me hooked. It also didn't hurt that most of the puzzles were relatively easy to figure out and the harder ones usually weren't so hard that my frustration outweighed my enjoyment.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the sliding controls were occasionally glitchy for me. However, it helped that the game still included buttons I could click to slide left or right within a particular scene.\n\nEdit: I nominated this for Steam's 2017 \"Haunts My Dreams\" award because this game stuck with me for weeks after I finished it. I even went out and methodically played through all the related Cube Escape games on my phone so that I could learn more of the overall story.", "timestamp_created": 1499531373, "timestamp_updated": 1511736146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33372283": {"recommendationid": "33372283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140798779", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499513693}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f9d\u65e7\u8be1\u5f02\u7684\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6bd4Rusty Lake Holte\u8981\u66f4\u52a0\u4e30\u6ee1\uff0c\u6c14\u6c1b\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u4e5f\u66f4\u52a0\u5230\u4f4d\uff0c\u66f4\u52a0\u6697\u9ed1\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6210\u5c31\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u8ba9\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u5f97\u4ee5\u66f4\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6298\u817e\u73a9\u5bb6\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1499515782, "timestamp_updated": 1499515782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501742", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33370520": {"recommendationid": "33370520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072529990", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499508312}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game as part of a bundle with Rusty Lake Hotel during a sale, and I would say it was definitely worth it.

Now let me explain:\n[First thing first before you read this review you should know that all Rusty Lake Games are kinda horror games which means that their intention is not to scare the crap out of you but to use the horror aspect in order to intrigue you and trust me they do it VERY well. ]\nThe events that take place at the so-called Rusty Lake are going to amaze you. If you have played the prequels/sequels you know what I mean. If not just [url=http://www.cubeescape.com]http://www.cubeescape.com[/url] or download the games at iOS and Android.\nMost indie-horror games that have a success like these ones are combining immersive storyline and puzzles that are just there, not too hard, not too easy but once you pass even the most simple puzzle you instantly feel rewarded as the story continues BUT without using jump-cuts/ cinematics etc so you don't get distracted or told what to do. Now to list these and some other thing pros & cons\n[b]Pros[/b]\nGood Gameplay\nAmazing Storyline\nRidiculously good art-style \nGood Music \n\n[b]Cons[/b]\nThe music even though it's good might get a little repetitive especially when stuck in a puzzle\n.\n.\n.\nthat's it\n\nNow for the order of the games (because if you didn't know there are 11 Rusty Lake games with probably one more to come) as seen from the Rusty Lake Steam page:\nCube Escape: Seasons\n\u2028Cube Escape: The Lake \u2028\nCube Escape: Arles \u2028\nCube Escape: Harvey's Box\u2028\nCube Escape: Case 23\n\u2028Cube Escape: The Mill \u2028\nRusty Lake Hotel\nCube Escape: Birthday\nCube Escape: Theatre\nRusty Lake: Roots\nCube Escape: The Cave\nand they are working on a premium project.\n\nAll in all they are all great games 10/10 i luv it and btw i got the roots game free because there was a free givaway for a milestone they hit.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1498764172, "timestamp_updated": 1498764172, "voted_up":

He isn't the oldest and certainly not the first you may have met but as he moves in to the house so too are you eased in to the game.  Just like the Hotel there is a dream-like quality to each of their lives.  A horrific logic that makes terrible things seem completely sensible.  There will be blood and things may be difficult but there is no reason to fear.  Whether you know or not the full events of Cube Escape you will find more than you bargined for here with a memorable experience.  The past is not the past here.

THEY ARE GREAT ALTHOUGH A LITTLE LESS POLISHED DEMONSTRATIONS OF WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS GAME. YOU CAN FIND THEM FOR FREE AT THE DEVELOPER'S WEBSITE OR APP STORE OF YOUR CHOICE.[/b]\n\n\n[b]Rusty Lake: Roots[/b] is a point-and-click adventure that is equal parts thrilling and intriquing with a healthy doze of dark humour. It follows the story of the Vanderboom family over generations in a plot that feels mystical, maybe even confusing at first, but rewards you whole heartedly for making sense of it.\n\n\n\nThe gameplay is what it is. There is not much to praise or criticize as is usual with games that rely very little on mechanics. It's worth noting however that the game was clearly designed with touch screens in mind. The circles that form around your mouse with every click and the way some of the objects in the world are interracted with may be a bit jarring at times, but nothing that would take away from the experience. One thing that I found surprisingly pleasing however was the complete absence of in-inventory item mixing. This may sound like an unnecessary simplification, but in practice it makes a noticeable chunck of the puzzles much smoother experiences as you always have the things that need to be interracted with right in front of you.\n\n\n\nWith that, almost ironically, given the game's themes, clarity is where the game shines. The infuriating moments where you don't know where or what to do are few and far between. While the artstyle isn't anything spectacular from a purely aesthetic view, it works wonders in telling you what is happening, what to do and what you can work with. A respectable feat once you realize just how bizzare and surreal the scenes and puzzles can get.\n\n\nThe real reason to play this game, and the thriving force that keeps you hooked, is the narrative.\n The world of Rusty Lake is a fantastic example of the kind of storytelling that only video games can pull off and still make for a thoroughly compelling story. In the world of Rusty Lake the past is never dead, it's not even the past and we are always here in our past and future lives. Time is not a matter of concern and neither is the order in which you play the games, as they all work to answer questions from other games in the series and asks new ones for the rest to unravel. In this way, the family tree of Rusty Lake: Roots is almost like a microcosm of the series as a whole, with it's splitting branches that all come together in the end to form a story without ever having to do as much but wink at the player from time to time.", "timestamp_created": 1497995632, "timestamp_updated": 1497995849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521169", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32594572": {"recommendationid": "32594572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155139846", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498835793}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fdb\u6e38\u620f\u6211\u60ca\u4e86\uff0c\u7adf\u7136\u662f\u4e2aflash\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6000\u7740\u201c\u8fd9\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u4e2a\u559c\u52a0\u4e00\u201d\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u5c31\u8fdb\u4e86\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u91cc\u9762\u5404\u79cd\u8111\u6d1e\u7740\u5b9e\u8ba9\u4eba\u773c\u524d\u4e00\u4eae\uff0c\u6216\u8bb8\u6709\u70b9\u9006\u5411\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u4e0d\u7981\u611f\u53f9\uff1a\u7adf\u7136\u8fd8\u80fd\u8fd9\u6837\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1f\uff1f\uff01\uff01\u5bf9\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u7a81\u7136\u5192\u51fa\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u7740bgm\u7ecf\u5e38\u8ba9\u6211\u5fc3\u5934\u4e00\u7d27\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u597d\u8fd9\u53e3\u7684\u53ef\u5728\u6df1\u591c\u72ec\u81ea\u98df\u7528\u3002PS\uff1a\u66f4\u65b0\u867d\u7136\u5e72\u6389\u4e86\u90a3\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6210\u4e0d\u4e86\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u6210\u5c31\uff08\u6216\u8005\u6839\u672c\u6ca1\u505a\uff0c\u54c8\u54c8\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u6863\u4e22\u4e86\uff08Archive missing \uff09\u6709\u70b9\u6c14\u554a\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1497971571, "timestamp_updated": 1497971571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32593517": {"recommendationid": "32593517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052601038", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497968673}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty strange story about Vanderboom family and their alchemist roots.

Aside from looks, the only other thing that I think might turn people away from this game is the length; it'll vary depending on one's problem-solving skills, of course, but expect it to be short, with the only 'replayability' once you solve the final puzzle being the new (as of this Review's posting) Achievements. With that said, personally, I thought the experience lasted just as long as it needed to in order to make a good impression on me. I enjoyed this game's atmosphere, and its ability to present a twisted story without heaps of dialogue.

Zum Spiel: \n\nOh was f\u00fcr eine h\u00fcbsche kleine 2,99 \u20ac - Perle. Ich bin durch Zufall beim St\u00f6bern im Shop darauf gesto\u00dfen und hab\u00b4s f\u00fcr den Preis mal einkassiert. Dieser Puzzlekram ist im Prinzip nicht mein Genre, aber das ein oder andere positive Review hat mich dann doch neugierig gemacht und ich dachte mir probier\u00b4s halt einfach mal aus. Man hat schlie\u00dflich schon wesentlich mehr Geld f\u00fcr deutlich gr\u00f6\u00dfere Gr\u00fctze ausgegeben. Ich wurde nicht entt\u00e4uscht. Einmal angefangen konnte ich nicht mehr aufh\u00f6ren, bis ich komplett fertig war... also mit dem Spiel.. ( dass ich komplett fertig bin, wei\u00df ich schon etwas l\u00e4nger..)  \n    \nErz\u00e4hlt wird die Geschichte der, nennen wir\u00b4s ruhig mal \u201eleicht dysfunktionalen\u201c Familie Vanderboom, an der sich wohl auch ein durch jahrelange Betreuung von Assi-TV- Familien gest\u00e4hlter Therapeut die Z\u00e4hne ausgebissen h\u00e4tte. \nDer Denver-Clan trifft die Munsters.. St\u00fcck f\u00fcr St\u00fcck klappert man die Lebensgeschichte einzelner Familienmitglieder ab, indem man diverse R\u00e4tsel bearbeitet. Man kann sich die einzelnen Kapitel im Grunde wie einen Escape-Room vorstellen, wo das knacken diverser kleinerer R\u00e4tsel schlie\u00dflich das gro\u00dfe Ganze aufl\u00f6st. \nBei Erfolg wachsen weitere \u00c4ste am Stammbaum und bringen neue, mal mehr mal weniger durchgeknallte Vanderbooms ins Spiel. Zur Geschichte selber halte ich mich aber bedeckt \u2013 ich will niemandem etwas spoilern daf\u00fcr fand ich die Story zu erlebenswert.    \n\nDen Schwierigkeitsgrad zu beschreiben ist..nun ja..schwierig. Mir ist ( bedauerlicherweise pers\u00f6nlich ) die Existenz von Biomaterial  bekannt, f\u00fcr dass das Beenden dieses Spiels wohl eine Lebenaufgabe darstellen w\u00fcrde. Grunds\u00e4tzlich w\u00fcrde ich das Spiel aber mal als machbar bezeichnen. Von sehr einfach bis knackig schwer ist hier alles dabei und wenn man sich mal komplett festgefranst hat, findet sich sicher irgendwo ein Guide.\n\nVon mir ( vor allem zu dem Preis ) gibt\u00b4s hier eine klare Kaufempfehlung.

I found it through my Discovery Queue. I found the overarching story and characters (including the cameos from other games) intriguing enough that I want to play more in the series. The mood and setting is spot-on eerie Victorian with touches of occult, just enough to make you uneasy but not completely revolted while playing.\n\nI found the choice to rely on pictographs, colors and other visual cues over text or dialogue to figure out puzzles a welcome challenge, for the most part. A few times, especially in the later puzzles, it was frustrating enough to figure out what to do next that I went to the Rusty Lake website to look up video tutorials. It's nice the developers make these available (but only look when you're well and truly stuck--otherwise you're ruining the experience for yourself!)\n\nThere were several classic puzzles 'reskinned' for the story and theme of the game, and I could also see the 'Escape Room' influence (the first game Rusty Lake made, Cube Escape & its derivatives, is an escape-style game). I've played some Escape Rooms with groups in real life, so I'm curious to see how Cube Escape holds up to that experience.\n\nOne last thing, the resolution is kinda small, more suited to tablet than desktop. That didn't bother me, though. I could still easily see and manipulate all parts of the screen.\n\nAll in all, even with the small frustrations, I found this game to be well worth its $2.99 price.

game Rusty Lake Hotel and other point and click games of the same developer (which are not available on Steam and I've not played), Rusty Lake Roots explain the origin of the Crowman and the life experiences of his whole family. This game has its own obvious advantages and disadvantages. \n\nThe stationary drawings are still stylish, however, the animation of the characters are somewhat crude and awkward, preventing me from immersing myself into the atmosphere now and then.\nThe background music is monotonic.\nThe storyline is quite well-written. The difficulty of the puzzles is moderate, and none of them will get you stuck too long, as far as you carefully observe and consider the scene and clues given to you. But the problem here is that the tempo of story-telling is sometimes retarded by puzzles, that is to say, sometimes you may be forced to solve some irrelevant riddles while you are eager to know more about the plot.\n\nIn the end I decide to give it a positive note since its pros surpass cons.

Other reviewers have said that it you're squeamis you should avoid this, but I don't necessarily agree with that. Yes, moments are dark, but a lot of those moments are made lighter simply by the utter absurdity of the situation. Other situation that  seem to be really dark and gloomy end up being ridiculously silly when you get to see the actual results of what happened.\n\nEach section can be completed in a few minutes. In fact, most are relatively straightforward as long as you make sure to check everything and click everywhere. Some of the puzzles require a significant bit of brain power, but the solution is actually quite logical in how it's handled. It's simply a matter of recognizing how to put the pieces together. Fortunately, the folks at Rust Lake have complete walkthrough videos available if you really get stumped.\n\nThis game is dark, macabre, funny, challenging, and downright silly all wrapped up into one.

The game's weird and often disturbing story fits the creepy nature of [i]Rusty Lake[/i] and is \"narrated\" through the puzzles the player completes.\n\nEntertaining puzzles, eerie atmosphere and low price, this game is well worth your time and I am looking forward to more games like it. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1481210245, "timestamp_updated": 1481210245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28237098": {"recommendationid": "28237098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218705369", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477803919}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u89e3\u5bc6\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8bf4\u662f\u795e\u4f5c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4e3a\u8fc7\u3002\u9b54\u5e7b\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u5341\u5206\u6293\u4eba\u3002\u6ee1\u6ee1\u7684\u8c61\u5f81\u4e0e\u4f0f\u7b14\uff0c\u6545\u4e8b\u501f\u7531\u5173\u5361\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u65ad\u65ad\u7eed\u7eed\u5730\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u5bcc\u6709\u5f20\u529b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002\u6811\u72b6\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u5173\u5361\u4e00\u5219\u662f\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u8109\u7edc\uff08\u4f46\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4f60\u8fd8\u662f\u8981\u601d\u8003\u4e8b\u60c5\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4e8c\u5219\u4e5f\u4e0e\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u6e90\u5934\u76f8\u547c\u5e94\uff0c\u4e09\u5219\u7167\u5e94\u4e86\u540d\u5b57\u3002\u8981\u8bf4\u7f3a\u70b9\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5728\u67d0\u6761\u652f\u7ebf\u4e0a\u505c\u6ede\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u5173\u5361\u591a\u534a\u4f1a\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u4e00\u5934\u96fe\u6c34\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u2014\u2014\u6545\u4e8b\u91cc\u90a3\u4e2a\u4eba\u662f\u8c01\uff1f\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u7684\u786e\u79f0\u5f97\u4e0a\u662f\u5439\u6bdb\u6c42\u75b5\u4e86\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u6574\u7406\u4eba\u7269\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e5f\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u4e50\u8da3\u6240\u5728\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1481122924, "timestamp_updated": 1481122924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28209540": {"recommendationid": "28209540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282825056", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497821717}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u89e3\u5bc6\u6e38\u620f\n\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u5f88\u8be1\u5f02\u554a\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\uff08\u4e2a\u522b\u9664\u5916\uff09\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u4e00\u8fb9\u89e3\u5bc6\u4e00\u8fb9\u4f53\u4f1a\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\n\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5f88\u6050\u6016\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u662f\u7a81\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u9ed1\u5f71\u7a0d\u5fae\u6709\u70b9\u53ef\u6015\uff0c\u521a\u5f00\u59cb\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u88ab\u5413\u5230\n\u8c1c\u9898\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6ca1\u6709\u5f88\u96be\uff0c\u4ed4\u7ec6\u627e\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u8bdd\u90fd\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u9690\u85cf\u5173\u5361\u7684\u4e0d\u6b7b\u836f\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u914d\u4e0d\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53bb\u770b\u4e86\u653b\u7565\u2026\u2026\n\n\u6c49\u5316\u6709\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6709\u4e9b\u8c1c\u9898\u4e3b\u8981\u8fd8\u662f\u82f1\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7684\u8bdd\u5efa\u8bae\u73a9\u82f1\u6587\u7248", "timestamp_created": 1480971519, "timestamp_updated": 1480971519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28207821": {"recommendationid": "28207821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010539125", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480931658}, "language": "french", "review": "Un tr\u00e8s bon point&click.

I have played all cube escape games and both Rusty Lake games. Every game shows improvements, from small details to new puzzle ideas, new mechanics and oooh boy, the secrets. The story of both series are amazing. They are connected, and while the first two or three cube escape games seem made up as they went along, the sequels felt like the story was thought out, sometimes there are secrets that, to unlock, you would need to play the NEXT game on the series, which shows that the story is not made up as they go along, like with some other games out there (not going to point fingers, but I think you know the one I'm talking about. And if you don't... IDK).\nRusty Lake: Roots DOES NOT disappoint, and was totally worth the wait and the money. You now don't arrows to click and see another wall in the room, you now have a wide room, which scrolls, and is a lot less confusing and makes the player focus a lot more on the puzzles instead of finding items and clicking everywhere. But the game is still hard, with well made puzzles, (just like any game in the series. These aren't easy, okay?) that will surely make you think. The game now has levels, which wasn't seen before on previous Rusty Lake games, and the game let's you play the levels in the order you want, for example, if you are stuck in one Frank's levels, you can always go to Rose, and that makes the game less stressful, because you can take a break from that certain part you are in while still playing and enjoying Rust Lake: Roots.\nThe game is a lot longer than previous games from the franchise, making every penny worth it. Not only that, but when you finish the game you can beat a few levels differently, and find some secrets which lead to a secret level, where... Nah, I'm not going to spoil it. Just note that to get there it's going to take a good memory and good walkthroughs... just in case.\nAnyways...\nThis review is already long as it is, so I'm going to finish it off by talking about the developers. They can make a fun game, with nice,well told story, nice game mechanics and, of course, awesome puzzles. But they thought that wasn't enough, and decided to be nice to fans and actually listen to them when it comes to feedback, fanart, reviews, suggestions, etc... They have a twitter, by the way, and it was really good to see a developer interacting with their fans in such a nice and genuine way! They retweet fanarts, tweets talking about the game, reviews, etc... (I would just like to point out that they also liked every single tweet I sent to them, including something I tweeted on a, I don't know, maybe one or two months old retweet of theirs).\nRusty Lake makes great point and click games, and if you like this kind of game, definitly check out cube escape and both   (premium) rusty lake games, you won't regret it.\nSorry about the lenght of the review, and also for any spelling mistakes or bad grammar, english is not my first language.\nP.S: To enjoy the game EVEN MORE play it while you eat chocolate.

It makes it a bit hard to play as you want to know the story, yet you are constantly searching for what you need to progress. Some scenes are harder than others, so I had to refer to the walkthrough a few times. However, most of the scenes you play are a good level of challenging - not too hard, not too easy.\n\nIf you haven't played any games by these guys yet, I suggest trying out the free Cube Escape games they have, which are similar.

I had a feeling Rusty Lake: Roots would offer more in terms of gameplay length, but I didn\u2019t think I would be blown away in terms of storytelling and characterization. I was completely wrong.\n\nWhile Rusty Lake: Hotel was a strong puzzle game, the characters I encountered were rather lacking in personality for the most part. I didn\u2019t feel for them at all and just moved from one puzzle to the next. Rusty Lake: Roots is a completely different game in this regard. Not only are there are more high-quality puzzles (you can expect 5+ hours of gameplay without using a walkthrough), I felt an emotional connection to some characters as horrible, bizarre stuff happened to them. I had a strong desire to progress the story, not only for the delightful variety of puzzles, but also to see what happened to the characters who over time demonstrated personalities (despite there being barely dialogue). Unlike the first game, the Vanderbloom family members are not props in a scene that experience ghastly deaths with little empathy from the player.

De beaux graphismes (le tableau de fond est magnifique), quelques tr\u00e8s bonnes id\u00e9es comme l'arbre g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique, une atmosph\u00e8re toujours \u00e9trange et inqui\u00e9tante, et la d\u00e9couverte des anc\u00eatres de Dale Vanderboom (personnage que nous jouons dans les Cube Escape et Hotel) qui augmente la richesse d'un univers d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien implant\u00e9. Un jeu prenant, une atmosph\u00e8re r\u00e9ussie, et une histoire toujours int\u00e9ressante.\n\nJ'\u00e9voquerai toutefois deux points n\u00e9gatifs : \n[list][*]je trouve que la narration est trop pauvre pour cet opus (qui demande quand m\u00eame 8 \u00e0 9h de jeu en moyenne pour \u00eatre fini), ce qui donne parfois l'impression de r\u00e9soudre puzzles et \u00e9nigmes pour en d\u00e9bloquer d'autres sans r\u00e9ellement sentir l'histoire avancer. L'histoire est interactive, certes, elle se construit au fur et \u00e0 mesure des jeux et de l'\u00e9volution de l'arbre g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique, mais je pense sinc\u00e8rement que des passages suppl\u00e9mentaires de narration auraient enrichi le tout, et auraient parfois clarifi\u00e9 l'\u00e9volution de l'histoire. \n[*]D'autre part, la logique de certains puzzles ou les indices pour aider \u00e0 les r\u00e9aliser m'ont sembl\u00e9 tr\u00e8s flous, ce qui m'a contraint d'aller chercher une solution dans le walkthrough (ce que je n'avais jamais fait dans aucun autre jeu Rusty Lake).[/list]\n\nMis \u00e0 part cela, je recommande chauement ce jeu, d'autant que les d\u00e9veloppeurs restent tr\u00e8s proches des joueurs.", "timestamp_created": 1478082124, "timestamp_updated": 1478082124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26369617": {"recommendationid": "26369617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328903703", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477496260}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u76f8\u5f53\u5e26\u611f\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u753b\u98ce\u9634\u6697\u730e\u5947\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5fc3\u60c5\u4e0d\u597d\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u73a9\uff0c\u89e3\u8c1c\u96be\u5ea6\u9002\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5173\u4ee5\u540e\u8fd8\u662f\u633a\u6709\u6210\u5c31\u611f\u7684\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5173\u5361\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65b9\u5f0f\u8ba9\u4eba\u6709\u70b9\u7cca\u6d82\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u73a9\u7684\u5173\u5361\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u6545\u4e8b\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u662f\u53cd\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd8\u662f\u80fd\u770b\u61c2\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u3002\n\u987a\u8bf4\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u590d\u6d3b\u6210\u529f\u4e86\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u5c31\u50cf\u6700\u540e\u83b7\u80dc\u7684\u662fBOSS \u2026\u2026\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u5e26\u611f", "timestamp_created": 1478076056, "timestamp_updated": 1478076056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26368383": {"recommendationid": "26368383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090748799", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477871457}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u730e\u5947\u98ce\u683c\u5c4c\u7684\u4e0d\u884c", "timestamp_created": 1478067422, "timestamp_updated": 1478067422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26365810": {"recommendationid": "26365810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309589716", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479263644}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Entretenidos los acertijos , algunas cosas las tuve que resolver a papel y l\u00e1piz", "timestamp_created": 1478050794, "timestamp_updated": 1480211681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26363118": {"recommendationid": "26363118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065112287", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477926034}, "language": "english", "review": "really nice game i highly recommend it for all gothic horror lovers.", "timestamp_created": 1478037371, "timestamp_updated": 1478037556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26357054": {"recommendationid": "26357054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293988243", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477993356}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5267\u60c5\u753b\u98ce\u90fd\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u5bc6\u786e\u5b9e\u5f88\u96be\u627e", "timestamp_created": 1478015731, "timestamp_updated": 1478015731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26356343": {"recommendationid": "26356343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080877488", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477881716}, "language": "english", "review": "A creepy puzzle game with an interesting concept.

The drawing style of the game is appealing and it's easy enough to navigate.

However there are enough puzzles to keep you busy, really you are just constantly solving puzzles so you're constantly entertained. I think only a couple of puzzles had me a bit stumped near the end, and those were mainly because I misunderstoof the clues or used the wrong ones on the wrong puzzle and I was getting tired. Only one puzzle involving flowers had a strange logic to it which took me quite a bit to figure out and almost got irritating.\n\nThe jump scares weren't too bad, which is a positive to me as well.

If you liked the gigantic puzzle in \"Seasons\" that took 2 hours to complete, you might be disappointed here.\n- Many of the puzzle types are recycled from previous games in the series (and from other games in the Point & Click genre).\n- Little replay value. \n\nAll in all I greatly enjoyed the game, and would definitely recommend it to fans of the Cube Escape series. For those who aren't familiar with the Cube Escape universe, I would recommend playing the previous games first (they're available for free online, and great fun).\n\nFinal Verdict: 8.3 out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1477092889, "timestamp_updated": 1511763457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26153107": {"recommendationid": "26153107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117426484", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477088086}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game.", "timestamp_created": 1477088300, "timestamp_updated": 1477088300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26145609": {"recommendationid": "26145609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138623982", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503786101}, "language": "polish", "review": "Ta cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 zdecydowanie r\u00f3\u017cni si\u0119 od pozosta\u0142ych, co nie oznacza, \u017ce jest gorsza, wr\u0119cz przeciwnie!

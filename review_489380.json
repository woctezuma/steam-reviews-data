The game is not really clear as well on how to unlock equipments. \n\nBut all in all, playing multiplayer provides the best fun and you can totally be immersed in this tower defense game for hours.", "timestamp_created": 1501366753, "timestamp_updated": 1501366753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33766068": {"recommendationid": "33766068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154266604", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500202858}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game.

At the time of this writing I have around 7 hours into it.  \n\nWithout hesitation I would recommend this game.  So far its my favorite of the games I have played and I find it fun. The developer appears to be very active too which is also a nice thing to see considering the graveyard of abandoned games out there.  \n\nThe only complaint I have is the co-op Multiplayer does not seem entirely stable.  I can normally play for around 30 minutes before the game crashes.  With that said, the multiplayer is fun, just needs some refinement.   \n \n\n**Detailed Random Thoughts**\n\nIn a nut shell, the game is a tower / zone archery defense consisting of 4 areas that are increasingly harder to defend.  A zone is secured by holding a certain point on the map until a gate closes, allowing the player to advance to the next zone.  These gates prevent spawns from occuring behind them, but are destructible and need to be protected.  \n\nLocomotion is handled in this game with basic room scale for fine movement and teleportation circles activated by passing an arrow through them for coarse movement.  Each zone consists of several defensive vantage points that the player can teleport to using these circles.  Some vantage points are towers, others are landscape.  As the zones progress the vantage points become more difficult through either distance, height, or target angle providing the attacking waves with an advantage.  Later items allow the player to temporarily travel to any spot on the map for a limited period of time.      \n\nDifficult is increased linearly as time progresses, but the rate can increase based on certain in game events happening.  As difficulty increases the quantity, rate, travel speed, and powers of the attackers increases.  \n\nWhen the round ends, the difficult determines the special item or currency you get.  Currently currency has no in-game feature.  The special items grant different offensive, defensive, and support powers to the players.  \n\nI find the bow mechanics engaging and realistic, and a good mild exercise too.  \n\nThe current level seems well thought out and a decent amount of polish applied for a early release game.   \n\nI look forward to seeing what else comes along.", "timestamp_created": 1496714690, "timestamp_updated": 1496714690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32179245": {"recommendationid": "32179245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376504633", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496778987}, "language": "english", "review": "I was really excited to play this game but I can't get past a glitch, the view keeps tweaking out whenever I start the game like the perspective is wrong and no matter how I try to recalibrate it won't work.

This seems to be a game that is actually undergoing improvements.\n\n===========================================\n\nOkay, let's get the bad things out of the way first:\n\n1) It seems to be one level total, with 4 \"areas\" inside the level, so it can get repetative simply because the scenery remains the same throughout. It's early access, so hopefully that will change.\n\n2) Some strange things can happen when you use a teleport arrow in the wrong place...\n\n3) Pulling the string back to the side of your face sometimes results in the arrow jittering, making it hard to aim as if it were a real bow and arrow.\n\nThat's it.\n\nSo on to the good. The aiming mechanics are top-notch (ha! puns!), and the rumble effects from the vive controllers makes it feel like you are pulling a string, throwing a bomb, releasing an arrow,  or grabbing an arrow. \n\nArrows fly in what feels like a natural flight path, and it's consistent, so you learn quickly how they fly and how they land.\n\nThe hit detection is very well done, such that I know it's my fault when I miss, not the game's.\n\nThe music is repetative, but not annoying, and it changes up during boss battles, giving you that extra bit of tension (more puns!).\n\nThe graphics are superb, even if you turn some things down to maintain a good FPS rate.\n\nThe items you unlock during play actually add to the gameplay, with teleportation arrows, scatter arrows, proximity mines, time-slowing grenades, fire grenades, and more available as the game progresses.\n\nThe enemies vary well enough that as the level gets progressively harder, the enemies become  more varied (fog, speed, bombs, teleporting, and launching mortars at you and your team). The landscape may be the same old level, but the fighting never seems to get old.\n\nMultiplayer is hands down the best part of the game, as with a group, it becomes much quicker to get to the higher (and more intense) parts of the level. Plus, it's super weird and fun to wave to people who aren't really in your room with you and have them wave back.\n\nTo top it all off, if you get some 1-3lbs wrist weights, this game ends up being one hell of a workout, which is pretty cool considering how fun it is. \n\n10/10 would shoot alien orcs in the face again.", "timestamp_created": 1495425288, "timestamp_updated": 1495529249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585687", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31817547": {"recommendationid": "31817547", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964601929", "num_games_owned": 818, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513377279}, "language": "english", "review": "a fascinating game with drop-in co-op that will show you how bad you are at archery. but when you peg it? you'll feel great. if you like fighting off waves of enemies with strangers and don't mind sucking, pick this shit up!", "timestamp_created": 1495091317, "timestamp_updated": 1495091317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31814807": {"recommendationid": "31814807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203839563", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503684243}, "language": "english", "review": "There isn't anything quite like defending a keep with a team of archers.

If all you're looking for is a better bow simulator then what's offered in The Lab then I would get this game but only if it's on sale.\n\nThere's also a lot to not like about this game.  It's only two player and having an extra person, while fun, doesn't exactly add a lot of depth.  At no point did my cohort and I feel overwhelmed or like communication was necessary.\n\nThere's a lot of ambiquity in the game and the tutorial doesn't fill you in on much except how to shoot.  There are purple crystals that you can shoot that do.... something?  You get gear for defeating each boss (sometimes - more then a few times I got \"duplicate item\" and would be rewarded with re-spec crystals) or re-spec crystals if you lose.  One boss is a rock monster that is stupidly laughable and a hell hound that has frustrating artillary requiring you to move often.  I actually enjoyed this mechanic at first but after multiple repeats you get tired of zone hopping while trying to turn the dog into a pin coushin.  \n\nGear upgrades are pretty blah as are the effects.  I never once had a use for the blocking pillar arrow and the regen field lasted too short and got too few enemies in it to be of use.  Bottom line - I don't get excited at the idea of upgrades/respecs and that's frustrating as it diminishes the replayability.\n\nTravel, conceptually, is a neat idea.  You shoot an arrow through the ring at the point you want to get to and you teleport.  In practice this doesn't really work as the moment you get under pressure from too many mobs you'll be missing shots for locations you want to be at so you just end up holding choke points.  Plus some areas are either hard to see, hard to hit, or give no tactical value.  I think it would be better replaced with a wrist flip/hud map.\n\nShoulder vs hip arrows - I hate the shoulder arrows as I kept smacking my Vive head unit but the hip arrows have weird grab distances.  Either I would miss them completely or I could grab them in front of me out of thin air.  \n\nHaving said all of that it's still a fun game that makes you feel like you're doing a mini version of Helm's Deep and if picked up on the cheap should be added to your library.", "timestamp_created": 1491544265, "timestamp_updated": 1491544265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507511", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30931401": {"recommendationid": "30931401", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981309354", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506555538}, "language": "english", "review": "When I finally bought my vive, this was the first game that I knew for sure that I was going to buy.

The developer, Blueteak, had us racing to unlock secrets/easter eggs in the game. This is a signal of great things to come.\n\nI downloaded this game right when the early alpha was released, was impressed with the bow mechanics, escalation of wave difficulty, and enemy variety. After the early access version released, I immediately bought QuiVr, and it quickly became the game I think about when I'm not in VR, alongside Arizona Sunshine.\n\nI do miss many of the enemy types they had in the early alpha, but chose to scrap for the paid early access version. However, the ability to close more gates beyond the one directly guarding your keep, while strategically using the magic abilities (throwing fireballs, chain lightning, slow time bubble, etc.) attached to your gear is why I keep coming back for a few rounds every day! I love the Diablo 3-esque feature of being able to \"re-roll\" the mods on your items in hopes of getting the best quality version in the range of possibilities. There is hardly anything more satisfying in VR than judging an enemy's run speed from hundreds of yards out, and connecting on that nearly impossible shot!\n\nI'm really hoping the devs bring back the skill tree that was available in the alpha, or add more than one mod to each item. This game could be one for the ages if they add more gear and RPG elements!\n\nGET THIS GAME AND PLAY ONLINE!", "timestamp_created": 1484934784, "timestamp_updated": 1485206581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29378094": {"recommendationid": "29378094", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966388984", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492628728}, "language": "english", "review": "In my opinion the best VR game at the moment.

Besides all the great gameplay aspects which you can prob read on the other reviews, something I find that sticks out from even non-VR games is the development process of this game. \n\nThe developer (Blueteak), in my opinion, has suspended the idea of this being \"his\" project. It has become the community's project in the sense that he HEAVILY listens to feedback and is extremely responsive to it, while still maintaining a necessary amount of control/balance. Additionally the daily reports/patches keep everyone informed on what is going on which is another huge thing for me with Early Access games.\n\nas for some cons: \nThe structure of the game itself can be a little repetative but thats just the nature of it. This is mainly a heads up to those who don't like this, again try the demo. This could change in the future though. Also some performance issues here and there, those have been acknowledged in patch notes [0.31.2] . Finally I would probably like to see the dev team get bigger but with the savage financial struggle that is VR development, you can't place much blame there.\n\n8/10 this game still has even more potential. If you are doubtful of purchasing at least try the demo. You could definitely still wait a while if you aren't really set on buying it (ADD IT TO UR WISHLIST). If you like it enough you should also realize that being part of it early on will allow you to be able to shape the game in small ways with feedback which I think is what Early Access should really be about.

At its base, it is a Wave Defense game where you use a bow and arrow, but it has the formula very well refined.\n\nFirstly, the archery gameplay is great. I came from Holopoint as my only other VR archery experience, and QuiVR blows it out of the water. Instead of having the aim be based only on the bow hand like in that Holopoint, it aims based on the location of both hands, which makes it much more comfortable and easy to aim. \n\nThe objective of the game is to defend a series of gates from hordes of enemies. You can take gates by standing on their \"Portals\", and once a gate is taken that becomes the new point of defense. Once a gate is destroyed, you can revive the gate provided you have the right equipment, and you get enough headshots. (You can get the gear you need early on.) And, as time continues, the game gets more difficult, so it never gets stale.\n\nSo, the game becomes a push and pull between taking and defending gates, and it really does feel great when you can retake a gate, or kill the boss right before he knocks down the final gate.\n\nAdditionally, you get different pieces of gear as rewards for playing, each giving its own special powerup to assist in your efforts.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the game is the development of it. Blueteak, the developer, has been making consistent and clear changes based on feedback the community has been giving. In fact, I suggested a change and a few others agreed with me, and Blueteak had it in the game THE NEXT DAY. \n\nHonestly, that is what Early Access should be. Blueteak has really earned my respect.\n\n[b] In short: \n\n- Great development with consistent updates and community interaction\n\n- Comfortable archery gameplay that is easy to pick up and fun to master\n\n- Fun \"objective\" wave defense that gives you more than just 'stand here and shoot'\n\n- Changing difficulty means you'll be hard pressed to find boredom\n\n- Strong multiplayer adds a lot of fun [/b]\n\nIf you have a Vive, I would HIGHLY recommend this game.

I've spent a reasonable amount of time with Holopoint and I thought I'd give this a try. I haven't played a ton yet but I did play a game before the recent patch and one after, so here's a couple of impressions.\n\nGenerally I like it. The art style is nice. Grahpics are good and everything seems to be running smoothly. I like that it has a bit of a loot/progression system so you can add upgrades and customise your character a bit. I like the way you can teleport to different vantage points. I like the way you're moving forward to close gates, since it gives a degree of objective beyond just killing enemies. \n\nI think the recent update did improve things a little. You don't feel so immediately under pressure as soon as you start and the waves are a little better spaced to let you catch your breath. It still felt like thingas were getting a bit crazy towards the end but in fairness I'm relatively early in the game and things may start to become more manegable as I progress and unlock more upgrades.\n\nOne thing I did notice, hit registration seems a little finnicky. Initially I thought maybe I was just a lousy shot but after I started paying more attention I definitely had a few arrows that should have been solid hits that didn't seem to be doing anything. Perhaps a bit more leeway with the hitboxes might be good? It's a little frustrating when you've got three or four enemies pounding on your door and you're firing into the scrum to no effect. \n\nBut yeah, overall I like it. In comparison to Holopoint it's not as active (I like Holopoint as a workout game since you have to move like crazy) but I'd say this is overall a more polished experience that has for more potential for expension into something even better.

I'm not sure how the randomness works, but it seems like the better your score at the end of a match, the better the drop rate is.  These can be for your head, chest, hand, quiver, bow, or arrow.

There's a good variety of enemies, all that time playing Quivr isn't wasted because the bow dynamics are still excellent and you need to mix it up against airborne and some very fast ground based attackers. \n   Unlike a lot of games you're not going to feel overwhelmed if you're in there as part of a multiplayer team too.\nCons: Wear and tear on the trigger from furiously nocking arrows\n           Too much time playing this when i should be doing stuff in the real world.", "timestamp_created": 1482223833, "timestamp_updated": 1482223833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573205", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28481568": {"recommendationid": "28481568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003437787", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482552520}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic, I can finally give Blueteak the money he deserves.\nI urge everyone who enjoyed the QuiVR alpha to support the dev by purchasing this release.\n\nGreat game, great dev.

LiEat was the first game from Miwashiba that I'd ever played, and I was absolutely amazed.\n\nFirst off, the soundtrack is gorgeous. It makes the story feel more alive than it already is. Each chapter has its own music too, it's not just one soundtrack being filled into every storyline. As the game advertises the OST comes with the game, which makes it all the more worth it. Not just the sound, but the art style is gorgeous as well. Not so much as the main world, but the CGs during certain cutscenes. Some of them you can see above, in the game's featured videos/screenshots. I absolutely love the art style and how well it fits into the game.\n\nBut besides the soundtrack, the story is downright amazing. The game is split into three distinct chapters. The storylines don't fully connect, as they take place in completely different locations, but they do tie together and are told chronologically, so I would highly recommend playing them in order. Each chapter takes about an hour and a half to two hours to complete, depending on how fast of a reader you are, or if you read the content at all. \n\nThe entire storyline focuses around Efina, the Lie-Eating Dragon and her \"papa\", who goes by Leo/Hal/Sid in the three chapters. Along they way they solve three separate mysteries, while learning about Efina and her power, and where she came from. There's a heavy emphasis on the story's tales of dragons, along with liars and how they relate to the world. There's a large portion of the story that's either downright adorable, or so intense that you feel strongly for what is going on. For a cute game, it also has it's serious points, mostly to do with liars and caring for loved ones. It's charming in a way that works, even for a simple and short RPG.\n\nThe only thing I would even remotely have against this game is how small the world is. There's only one area and a couple side areas to explore. I feel like this game makes it work rather well. All the story is in one spot, which makes it straight forward and you aren't getting lost or turned around often. For the story requiring you to do things in a certain order, I feel like this is more of a good thing than a bad thing, but if you enjoy exploring a massive world, you may not enjoy how small the map is.\n\nFor you achievement hunters out there, some of them are more difficult to find as they require you to interact with the world. Reading the info on the achievement should give you a straight-forward idea of how to get them all, though they're all chapter specific, so you have to know where to look for what. In my first runs of each chapter I got probably half of them, or a little over half.\n\nThis game is one of my new favorites, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs and fantasy.

The game consists in going through a town (which is not very big, consist in 1 to ~5 screens and houses/rooms), talking to people and eat the lies that materialize around them to uncover the truth.\n\nI did not like this game much, but it has its charm. Mostly, I didn't like the game's direction. It had great potential, good artistic skills, and great musical skills.\nThe art is very confusing. It's close to impossible to tell which character is a guy or a girl, and it's hard to identify their dialogue-sprite with their in-game sprite, the sprites just don't have enough detail. Also, there is a weird drawing around the dialogue-sprite which is confusing, and at the beginning, I thought it was part of the sprite where the character had some weird wings or something.\nAs for the music, there are sudden changes between dead silence and cheery music in a dark atmosphere. Most of the time the music did not feel quite right.\nThe thing I liked the most from the game, is the battle theme. At first, you fight small lies which take seconds to defeat, but later in the game, you face a big deformed lie, which takes some time, and that was when for the first time I heard the whole battle theme, and woah, it's a masterpiece. The piano is fantastic, it really gets you pumped up to fight.\nI said this game had a lot of potential, mostly because of the following reasons:\nBad directing, too short, and boring gameplay.\nThe combat is really easy, it's almost impossible to get a game over. You always equip the same items in all 3 games, and there is 0 strategy. I know the game tries to focus mainly on the story, but a more challenging combat would have been nice too.\n\nSomething that surprised me, was that the game had animated cutscenes, which look nice, but too short.\n\nAs for the story... it was ok, it's a matter of taste, really. I liked the \"couple\" Efi and Leo, but I wish there was a bit more interaction between them. Leo always seemed way too distant from Efi, which made me kind of sad. I would have enjoyed a bit more \"romanticism\" or affection between them.\nThe 3rd game has the best story, in my opinion, that is why I decided to give a recommended vote instead of a non-recommended.\n\nIt's very cheap, but I'd suggest to put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale. I'd also suggest to not listen to the soundtrack before you play it (especially the battle theme) since it's great and it's better to hear it while you're inside the story.", "timestamp_created": 1511191245, "timestamp_updated": 1511191245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36643705": {"recommendationid": "36643705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256004871", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511188879}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7269\u7f8e\u4ef7\u5ec9\uff0c\u6307\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u90a3\u4e48\u4e00\u56de\u4e8b\u5427", "timestamp_created": 1511177032, "timestamp_updated": 1511177032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36615065": {"recommendationid": "36615065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133964440", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511071337}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5206\u4e09\u90e8\u6765\u8bb2\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6e29\u99a8\u7684\u5c0f\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u6218\u6597\u90e8\u5206\u975e\u5e38\u7b80\u5355\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u96be\u70b9\u5728\u4e8e\u770b\u5267\u60c5\u6765\u627e\u8def\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5730\u56fe\u5f88\u5c0f\u6240\u4ee5\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u96be\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u5411rpg", "timestamp_created": 1511071610, "timestamp_updated": 1511071610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36607186": {"recommendationid": "36607186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113065757", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511039553}, "language": "english", "review": "It's ok.

However Efina is not your average young girl...she instead is a dragon, blessed with the power to see and devour the lies of others. An interesting premise for sure, especially considering her choice in a traveling partner. I wasn't expecting much out of LiEat, but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe game is broken down into three acts (LiEat I, LiEat II, and Lieat III). Each act involves the conman main character taking on a different name and getting involved in a few messy situations in different locations, from a sleepy town to a fancy resort. In the process of doing so, the conman's unfortunate past is slowly revealed and Efina grows from a naive newborn dragon into a capable young girl (although she's still pretty naive). LiEat I and II are really just build-up for the finale in the third act, in which you can get a bad, neutral, or good ending depending on your choices during the third act. The story, while simple, is still interesting enough and is able to resolve itself happily in the end (or tragically, if you got the neutral ending). Each act takes around an hour to complete, and it's one of the most entertaining games I've played that takes under five hours to complete.\n\nThe combat is in a simple turn-based format. I'm not sure how the turn order entirely works, as it seems like the enemies almost always took the first turn, which was mildly annoying as healing items do not take priority. Each character has a few different skills to use, most of them dealing single-target or AoE damage. The format is extremely simple and does not take long to pick up on. Throughout the games, if you are diligent in searching around the world, you can find some nice new gear, including legendary weapons which allow you to one-shot most enemies and make boss fights absolutely trivial. However, without a guide, these weapons are rather difficult to find. Quite frankly, they break the game, so it might be better not to hunt for them.\n\nThe OST, while nothing special, does what it needs to do to evoke certain emotions in certain scenes. In particular, the final boss fight for the first act is something that stands out as one of the better tracks in the game. It's nothing to write home about, but certainly above-average for a cheap Steam JRPG.\n\nLiEat is a game that ends up being a lot better than it first lets on, and if it goes on sale, I would recommend picking it up.

The first area where this game succeeds in its world building. The world and its structure are reasonable and creative. Basically, there are humans and monsters, most monsters are uncommon and/or urban legend but dragons are the exceptions given that they\u2019re born near humans (each dragon, born with their own unique power). Our heroine is a dragon that was born with the ability to sense and eat lies. Our hero (if you can call him that, he\u2019s kind of a jerk), Is a human that is something of an information broker which we can assume is a popular trade in this world, given that at least \u2153 of the characters you meet in the first chapter are information brokers too. In chapter 1, the narrative comes off headstrong in that it does a weak job of immersing the player into this world and suffers from an issue that plagues most ametuer narratives; world building is eagerly thrown at the player left and right without pacing or tact. Between each plot point are moments that seem purposely designated for combat.\n\nThe combat doesn\u2019t do much to break from a traditional turn-based system but it doesn\u2019t do anything to fail that tradition either. The combat never drags on, the enemies are diverse enough, and the battle system is simple: attack, skill, item. This makes it easy to keep fighting  I wish there was a \u201cdefend\u201d option for the player because sometimes the quantity of enemies is overwhelming (and the enemies can defend) but I can understand leaving it out because every turn spent defending is one that you could\u2019ve spent doing something offensive and that\u2019s what this game\u2019s combat is about: supplementing the story through quick and simple turn based mechanics. This is executed perfectly, better than the turn-based combat in a lot of big budget titles. Combat is coupled with satisfactory animation and great music.\n\nPrior to finishing the first chapter, I was ready to dismiss the game\u2019s audio as satisfactory at best but the post chapter \u2018theater room\u2019 (my term, not theirs) was an excellent way to emphasize the quality art and music this game had to offer. In the center of the room is a music box-esque system that lets you play the tracks from throughout the chapter with a twist. Each track can be sped up or slowed down using on screen sliders. Every track sounds just as good at any speed and there are plenty of tracks to play around with. I would have been satisfied with this but the theater room has a far wall with different art from the chapter.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to appreciate the well crafted aesthetic of the game. The chibi anime art style is complemented with a mix of pixel-vintage-theatre visuals which serve to reflect the narrative of the game perfectly and contributes further to the fantasy theme. The theater room was so impressive and well done, it made me wish every rpg had something like it. Opportunities to reflect on what a game does well (in this case, the art and music) leave the player with a more memorable experience overall.\n\nIt might seem from my review that Lieat is an average game that hits a few good points but it\u2019s execution confirms the opposite. It\u2019s rare that a game does simple things the right way with satisfying results like Lieat. In a time where the rpg genre is oversaturated with lengthy cutscenes, over-the-top combat that tries to reinvent the wheel, long/drawn out narratives, Lieat is a breath of fresh air that I recommend to any fan of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1508195945, "timestamp_updated": 1508196084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35779968": {"recommendationid": "35779968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004371521", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509238608}, "language": "english", "review": "Great games!

The small town slowly becomes darker and darker as night approaches. I especially love that they give new character portraits when you are playing later chapters, you can see some characters have grown, indicating time has passed. Short little animations and CG scenes also play out during parts of the game, a very nice touch to give the game some life out of pixel rpg sprites.\n\nThe music has a really gentle tone, but it is also used to build a sense of unease during certain events. It's not used carelessly either, sometimes no music plays and you can feel something bad happened. It's good stuff, I don't usually complement the music in reviews but I really should for this one.\n\nThe writing... The characters are often times are very humourous, I liked almost all the main and supporting characters. I can't put into words how much I enjoy the dialogue in this game. Talking to a NPC multiple times sometimes trigger dialogue that is both interesting and adds to the lore of this game. My favourite characters have to be the Captain of the force and the main character Efina, both dragons with interesting abilities. Conversations between them give some context to the captain's backstory and even a possible reason why Dragons with unique abilities are born.\n\nBuying LiEat gives you 3 games, I highly recommend finishing each of the games in a single sitting. As stopping midway during one of the games can be immersion breaking and ruin the atmosphere. They aren't very long, about 1-3 hours for each game. I do not regret this purchase and I urge anyone who wants a great time to give it a shot. \n\nIf I can name only one thing to convince you to buy the game, it's the writing. I'm a writer in training and I wish I was as half as good as writing the dialogue in this game. The gameplay really doesn't focus on combat much, which I feel is a good thing. It keeps the pace going and is more focused on character interactions instead.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507820218, "timestamp_updated": 1507820218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35619967": {"recommendationid": "35619967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263173901", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508169469}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6545\u4e8b\u77ed\u5c0f\u4f46\u662f\u7cbe\u7f8e\n\u97f3\u4e50\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u4e5f\u662f\u5f88\u8d5e\n\u6bcf\u4e00\u7ae0\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5f88\u5201\u94bb\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u4f1a\u85cf\u6709\u795e\u5668\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\u6218\u6597\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4e00\u70b9\u7528\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\uff08\u7b2c\u4e09\u7ae0\u7ed3\u5c3e\u9664\u5916\uff09\n\u96be\u5ea6\u4e5f\u8bb8\u7565\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\n\u559c\u6b22\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u7684\u4eba\u5f88\u63a8\u8350\u5165\uff0c15\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u76f8\u5f53\u503c", "timestamp_created": 1507649628, "timestamp_updated": 1507649628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35586677": {"recommendationid": "35586677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198425973057", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507515750}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed the story and the charracters are very well developed, very worth for the money.", "timestamp_created": 1507512774, "timestamp_updated": 1507512774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35583026": {"recommendationid": "35583026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198395955116", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511077820}, "language": "english", "review": "Yet a game that is really enjoyable.

All three games are proper sequels to the previous(well, there WERE a few towns skipped but that's because nothing really important happened there).\n\nThe story is of a man who's present is riddled to the brim with lies and a dragon girl born from his wishes, who can eat lies. The games sum the story up, as if you were watching an anime: it keeps it short, semi-well detailed yet entertaining. Personally, I enjoyed the twists the stories had each time, with new, unfamiliar faces with each of their own backgrounds and reasons for their actions.\n\nThe sprite work is pretty fancy and smooth to the eyes, yet sometimes very very distracting(for example the alley way in 1, that took some time to find!), but over all pretty pleasurable to look at. Character design focuses very heavily on making every character look as adorable as they could possibly make them.\n\n...Thing is, that's where LiEat begins to fall short.\n\nThe gameplay is rather dull, as there's not much thinking to be done during combat. The moves are very straight forward and often you just need to spam them to win basically any battle. Exploration is often limited or pointless, and it's very easy to get confused. There aren't many places to explore and there aren't anything worthwile to find.\n\nPros:\n+Endearing spritework, pleasurable to look at\n+Story is indeed, pretty good and the world keeps it as consistent as it could.\n+Efi. That's all.\n+The price is rather low for such an experience.\n\nMixed:\n+/- It doesn't focus on music too well. Sure, it gets the job fairly done, but it is, still, just midis.\n+/- Characters often don't return, some for good, some for bad.\n\nCons:\n-Combat isn't exciting, rather dull and repetitive.\n-Exploration is stuck to a maximum of 9 maps, very few things to find.\n-The games aren't really that difficult, as they serve little to no challenge.\n-All three games combined are really really short, summing up to 4 hours.\n\nOver all, I do recommend LiEat. Why? It aims to be a story telling RPG game, and it does that job well, and I absolutely adore that. The world is pretty well built together, makes you wonder on and on about what could, what would and what is in that universe. Characters are memorable and adorable and the spritework does it's best to reflect that.\n\nIf you did like LiEat(especially part 3), I'd reccomend you check out DSP(Deep Sea Prisoner)'s works. They being The Gray Garden, Mogeko Castle and Wadanohara and the Great Blue Sea. These are all story driven games with fun characters where the story does end up getting really eerie near the end.

It's a simple style but because of its semplicity I find it very fitting with the game scenario and ambiance. Keeping this cute almost childish style considering the rather dark story gives it a weird yet interesting effect.\nI enjoyed the story even though I found it pretty short, giving little bits of the story here and there throught the three chapters and a big chunk of it at the very end of the third, which was a little overwhelmind in my opinion. I would have liked if the series started from an earlier point, like the moment in which Efina hatches to get a better grasp of the characters personality and the why of everything that is going on little by little instead of getting it all thrown at you at the very end.\n\nIt's a very nice game, I surely recommend it but if you're unsure, I would wait until it's on sale for two dollars or less

While extremely easy and containing a weirdly-written finale in its third vignette, it's worth sitting through in an afternoon.\n\n[Actual Review]\n\nLiEat is a series of three short JRPGs made by Miwashiba on WOLF RPG Editor, originally released in 2004. It follows a dragon by the name of Efina -- who has the ability to eat lies -- and her conman \"papa\". Each tale brings them to a new location on a different job, usually where supernatural circumstances are at play.\n\nThe story of LiEat is very easy to condense down into what happens within these three chapters as well as the loose worldbuilding connective tissue between each one. Playing each episode in close succession allows these threads to all come through, even if some of the characters end up being filler. The main problems I personally had with the stories as a whole included the shoehorned bad/neutral ends. At best, they came out of nowhere (one of them I actually had to look up a guide to get, simply because you have to go out of your way for it). At worst, they contain questionable writing choices (particularly in the third story in the set). The entire third game feels like a series of padding decisions after a little while, and it all feels like it's a rush job to a neat-on-paper character arc resolution. I still like it, but it definitely felt rushed. What I enjoyed about the story the most, however, was the nature of why people lie, and how that is addressed. The reasons people lie, the consequences when found out, and how one lives with themselves when they tell nothing but lies for a living. It's worth looking at even for that alone, along with the different powers that dragons possess in terms of standard fantasy worldbuilding.\n\nAesthetically, this game has a distinctive style to it that I greatly appreciate. It feels like a NIS game's typical art style combined with GBA Castlevania in a sense, thrown into WOLF and garbled a bit. It feels like I should be playing it in either 240p or on a handheld, which is not a knock against it. There's a lot of imagination to the character designs in general, even when playing with anime archetypes in design. It's a nod to the good bits of subtle worldbuilding in LiEat, not being afriad to differentiate between what is and is not human.  The soundtrack is pretty alright, too, with some standout variations on the battle theme throughtout and some musical progressions that bring to mind European folk villages; there's a lot of good, tense additions to the atmosphere in the score that I really appreciated.\n\nThe gameplay is standard turn-based RPG format. You wander around a standard map, interact with things (you don't have to do moving \"puzzles\" of any sort until LiEat 3), and then get into battles that spawn on the map (no random encounters here). Battles are the typical Attack/Skill/Item/Nothing system, but I appreciated how quickly it flowed. Every episode has strong weapons you can find on the map, and it makes battles a major breeze to get through. Not much strategy, but given how quickly each game unfolds, it's nice. The exploration in LiEat 3, as explained with the general story of that game, feels like padding more often than not, but it still includes a lot of streamlined elements within battle to make that a lot easier.\n\nOverall, LiEat is an easy but interesting experience. The nature of the release is benefitted by how streamlined it all is, and for as cheap as it often is and how quick of a play it is, it's a worthwhile investment if you enjoy JRPGs.", "timestamp_created": 1504492097, "timestamp_updated": 1504492097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34725718": {"recommendationid": "34725718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065039490", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504490569}, "language": "english", "review": "really really cute game, great characters and story.

Battle system is a nice addition though the game doesnt focus on it. The main attraction for me in this game is both Theo and Efina, it is fun to see them together solving detective like case together. The game separated in three part like some anime episode. Feel free to play it here from translator vgperson(thank u for translating this game) and Miwashiba for the game freeware(do support him though, really like to see another sequal or spin off from this).

Von Stadt zu Stadt wandert der L\u00fcgner mit seiner kleinen Drachendame, die - wie jeder Drache in diese Spiel - nicht nur rar ges\u00e4t ist, sondern auch aus einem ganz bestimmten Wunsch geboren wurde. Unser Protagonist hatte einen Wunsch, einen starken noch dazu, und wurde mit einem Drachenei entlohnt, das pl\u00f6tzlich auftauchte - wie ironisch also, dass der L\u00fcgner einen Drachen bekommt, der L\u00fcgen manifestieren und essen kann. Kein Wunder, dass Efina ihn 'Theopants' nennt, nachdem sie seinen realen Namen - den sie erst durch Umwege herausfindet - erf\u00e4hrt. Liar, liar pants on fire - was? (War das nicht auch ein Achievement?)\n\nZusammenfassend, ohne viel zu spoilern, sei gesagt: Jeder, der ein kurzes Abenteuer f\u00fcr zwischendurch, mit ansehnlichen Farben und Grafiken, sowie ein bisschen Horror in ein freundlicheres Gewand gepackt m\u00f6chte, der ist - nicht nur durch den Soundtrack der \u00fcberall sehr sehr gut klingt - herzlich eingelanden, einen Blick in diese komische, magische Welt zu werfen und herauszufinden, was es mit Theobald Leonhearts (da hat die Translation einen Fehler gemacht, weil's nicht LeonHART sondern LeonHEARTS ist) auf sich hat. Lange wird man zwar nicht bleiben, weil das Spiel verdammt kurz ist, aber die 2 Euro ist es auf alle F\u00e4lle wert - und dann w\u00fcnscht man sich mehr, und muss leider herausfinden, dass der Macher nicht auch nur im entferntesten daran denkt, weiterzumachen - schade.

At the same time, while this theme overarches across all three games, \"LiEat\" doesn't let its main story overtake the story of any individual game.\nBefore I really begin, I want to clarify that this game will not be for everyone. As a writer myself, I found the story to be lacking and, as a gamer, I found the balance of the game to be even worse. That is not to say this is a bad game, because it isn't... but it does mean you will be less likely to enjoy the game if you focus too much on either aspect of the game. Both parts are equally important and should not be ignored. That said, for the purpose of this review, I will be analyzing the aspects separately.\nFirst, let's discuss the music, which was one of my favorite parts of the game. In all three games, you have interesting, well-composed tracks that fit beautifully not just with the game and the scenes they appear in, but, as actual songs, they also fit well with each other conveying a smooth story-progression through their melodies. While there were a couple songs that felt somewhat generic, the game's composer did an (overall) excellent job at matching the moods and tones that needed to be conveyed.\nWhile there are plenty of parts in the graphic design of the game that feel like a generic RPG Maker game, there are just as many unique design choices. While the interfaces may be plain, they are still functional; and, while the overworld feels initially uninspired, it is very clear there was effort put into making the game feel both familiar and new at the same time. While the overworld is far from original, the real prize is found in the cut-scenes. Just as the monotony of the overworld and the repetitive combat (more on that in just a moment) got to be tiresome, the beautifully stylized cutscenes (and even the stylistic still-frames) appeared, and, with them, a breath of renewed enjoyment in the visual experience of the game would arrive. Finally, we have the character sprites. While most of the enemies look like generic black slimes, each of the actual characters was visually beautiful and had their own unique charm.\nI feel \"LiEat\"'s combat deserves its own discussion... for how overwhelmingly bland and generic it is. In \"LiEat\", you really only have 2 main enemy types: Lies and Bosses. While each Boss looks unique and different, and while there are different appearaces for the Lies, combat in this game is really just \"Stab... Stab... Stab...\" with no need to act differently. During my first playthrough of \"LiEat I\", the game accidentally made my party completely incapable of taking ANY damage from the game's BOSS due to its poor balancing of stats, enemies, and EXP gains. The only thing noteworthy about the combat is the artwork of the bosses and the lack of too many combat animations gives the game a sort of neo-classical sort of charm to it as though it is trying to be reminiscent of older games... otherwise, it's a no-thought-involved cookie cutter system that makes you actually have to try in order to die.\nFortunately, in the overall gameplay, you can avoid most of the sLIEmeS if you want, and I encourage it if you want the game to have an ounce of difficulty, but otherwise, gameplay is almost as simple and generic as combat was... But it worked well with the story and actually felt fitting for the overall feel of the game. Most of the puzzles were exceedingly obvious, but never felt like chores to solve because, unlike many games, the puzzles reward you as you do them with interesting dialogue, access to new areas, and overall story-progression in the moment and not just at the end. While combat was underbalanced, general gameplay was quite well-balanced and well-done. The way gameplay integrated the story into each action of the quests... it was a breath of fresh air. During typical quest completions, I usually don't actually have fun, but that was not so for \"LiEat\". The fact the story is given to you as opposed to needing to be hunted down was another nice touch. While the game does reward you handsomely for investigating and looking for secrets, it also doesn\u2019t make you need to do any needless hunting in order to find where you need to go next; the game maintains a nice, consistent flow that is only added to by searching and not detracted from, which is something most games try and fail to do.\nFinally, we have the (spoiler-free) story. The story is essentially a modern take on classic noir fiction. While the setting may not be black and white, many of the other core elements are there. Overall, the story is fairly predictable if you know the standard tropes and patterns associated with classic noir fiction and if you picked up on the foreshadowing used throughout the games from the very first scene. That said, if you're unfamiliar with the genre, this game can serve as an excellent gateway enabling you to see the charms while still being family-friendly. However, the story did have some issues. To begin with, the story felt shallow from its over-devotion to a central story line over three terribly short games. Generally, maintaining a persistent narrative would be a virtue, not a vice, but it actually worked against \u201cLiEat\u201d. While the writer tried to sprinkle foreshadowing into each game to show what was yet to come, there was still little build-up. The writing was amazing for a children\u2019s game or if it had been a longer series, but for general audiences as it is right now, it would fall flat. The other major problem was the lack of dimension to the characters: only the anti-hero and the \"bad cop\" (of sorts) had more than one dimension to their personalities. Overall, I still liked the story, but it irritated me how quickly the Chekhov\u2019s Guns went off and how the characters needed more than one game to develop even slightly.\nDespite how harshly I criticized \u201cLiEat\u201d, I actually enjoyed the series significantly. I didn\u2019t have to go out of my way to find the story. The game still rewarded me for being curious. The music was great and the cut-scenes were eye-grabbingly beautiful. There really isn\u2019t a reason to outright dislike \u201cLiEat\u201d if you look at it as a whole. While combat was rubbish and the writing weak, it was still enjoyable for as brief as it was. Everything contributed to the series equally. Even if the combat was absolute garbage and even if the writing wasn\u2019t where I would have liked it to be, the way the individual parts of \u201cLiEat\u201d interacted with one another created a beautiful tapestry of a series. My only regret is that \u201cLiEat\u201d was as short as it is and lacks any real replay value, as even a self-imposed \u201chard-mode\u201d does little to increase the difficulty of the games.\n\"LiEat\" is a beautiful series and may have just become one of my favorites. While it seems odd that I can have so many complaints but still love these games (possibly more than I do some of my childhood classics), \"LiEat\" had an interesting story, despite not being as fleshed out as it should have been. The music and cut-scenes were amazing. The gameplay, bar the combat, blended well with the narrative and pacing. If you think of a game as being about mostly this or mostly that, don\u2019t spend a cent on this game\u2026 but if you can accept the bad qualities of a game because those qualities themselves are actually made better by the other qualities of the game, \"LiEat\" should be in your Library and thrown to the top of your Queue.\n~Sora\nEstimated Playtime: ~1 hour to get all achievements via speed-run, thus making my review moot\nTaking Time: ~3-5 hours if you let yourself get absorbed into the world\nMy Rating: 8/10 \u2013 worth the $2.99 gamble\nWithout the Garbage Combat: 9/10 \u2013 Not perfect, but definitely great", "timestamp_created": 1503414326, "timestamp_updated": 1503414326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34412550": {"recommendationid": "34412550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315282734", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503732777}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6240\u4ee5\u8bf4\u91d1\u5e01\u5230\u5e95\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u7528\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1503396692, "timestamp_updated": 1503396692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34408025": {"recommendationid": "34408025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278445361", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503374508}, "language": "english", "review": "Great gam!!!

If you are looking for an epic adventure of heros and villains, with hundreds of hours of gameplay and countless weapon and armor varieties, you'll need to look elsewhere, but if you're feeling like trying a small game with a pretty deep story and strong moral messages with less stress on heavy combat, then give LiEat a try!", "timestamp_created": 1502920587, "timestamp_updated": 1502920587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34273621": {"recommendationid": "34273621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156932677", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490619652}, "language": "english", "review": "LiEat is one of those good games in the sea of RPG Maker games in Steam.\nIt has 3 parts which you can see how Efina and her relationship with MC grows.\nThere is little to no actual grind for the first 2 parts except for the last one to obtain the True End.\nDon't expect much in battle mechanics for this game focuses in story and its characters.\n\nThe story is unique.\nThe characters are well-written and with their individual personalities.\nI love the art of this game and its short animations!\n\nShort yet memorable.\nI'd recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1502879771, "timestamp_updated": 1502879771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34261479": {"recommendationid": "34261479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198265329992", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502804334}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "jogo \u00e9 pequeno mas muito bom, o fato do jogo ser dividido em 3 partes deixa ele passar mt rapido mesmo assim o jogo \u00e9 mt bom", "timestamp_created": 1502822383, "timestamp_updated": 1502822383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34257150": {"recommendationid": "34257150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043828640", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502806970}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u52a8\u4eba\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u53ef\u7231\u7684\u4eba\u8bbe\uff0c\u65e0\u53ef\u6311\u5254\u7684\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u4e00\u6b3e\u80fd\u8ba9\u4eba\u7ec6\u7ec6\u54c1\u5473\u5f88\u4e45\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n[spoiler]\u770b\u4ec0\u4e48\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4e70\u554a\uff01[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1502807823, "timestamp_updated": 1502807823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34227839": {"recommendationid": "34227839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301768339", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506715752}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es corto pero te hace pasar buen rato buenos personajes buena historia buen soundtrack todo sin duda uno de los mejores rpg que he jugado\n", "timestamp_created": 1502681112, "timestamp_updated": 1502681112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471204", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34205403": {"recommendationid": "34205403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316947074", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506707732}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\uff1f\u600e\u4e48\u5c31\u8fd9\u4e48\u70b9\u6545\u4e8b\uff1flz\u8fd8\u6ca1\u770b\u591f\u5462\uff01\u5176\u4ed6\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1f \u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1502595797, "timestamp_updated": 1502595797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34194215": {"recommendationid": "34194215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148812508", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502546974}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]LiEat.[/i] \nWell, how do we start this? It\u2019s pretty much a compilation pack of three short, story-driven RPGs, telling the story of a conman traveling with his trusty loli dragon that eats lies, Efina. \nI won\u2019t say that this game is really good, but it certainly wasn\u2019t even close to mediocre as well.\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\nThere... isn\u2019t really much to write about regarding gameplay. Combat\u2019s there, but it\u2019s pretty basic\u2014attack option, skills (which most of the time is just multi-hitting attacks, but there\u2019s also HP-to-MP conversion, so I\u2019ll give you that), items, and flee; things you\u2019d expect from these kinds of games.\n\nThere are also, in fact, things you can find and equipments scattered throughout the game(s) in a non-linear fashion, so you can, for example, cheese your way through fights with that \u201cendgame\u201d weapon you (somehow) found in the first game [spoiler]which is stuck on/in a broken streetlamp... before you can even fight something in the game proper![/spoiler]\n\n[i]I personally consider this a good thing, since it helped me enjoy the story without thinking too much about those pesky encounters. [/i]\n\nThere\u2019s also emphasis on puzzles in the third game, but it\u2019s not really that difficult either.\nWhich brings us to our next topic...\n\n[h1]The Narrative (Story, Characters and Stuff)[/h1]\nWhat LiEat lacks in gameplay, it makes up in the narratives, and it does them well\u2014really well.\nEvery character (well, at least those who have portraits) are well-rounded and really memorable (arguably even the four maids in the third game, who just serves as a puzzle setpiece!). vgperson are partially to blame for this.\n\nWorld-building is also there, solid enough for you to understand what\u2019s going on, but also loose enough at some parts to be open to interpretations. \n\n[i]By the way, there\u2019s also a novelization of the game, also translated by vgperson.  Just throwing this in, since we\u2019re talking about narratives.[/i]\n\nThe last but not least...\n\n[h1]The Aesthetics (Music, Artwork)[/h1]\nThe artwork is somewhat of a middle ground here. It isn\u2019t [i]particularly[/i] distinctive, impressive or anything like that, but there\u2019s a certain charm to it that makes them really interesting.\nThe same also applies to the music. It\u2019s not good, it\u2019s not bad, but it definitely served its purpose well.\n\nAlso, there's animated scenes/CGs! Granted, the animation's just the \"one person goes pose one to pose two, end\" kind, but still.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nI\u2019d like to re-emphasize that, again, LiEat as a whole is a story-driven RPG, albeit a short one. If you want a strategy-heavy RPG, this isn\u2019t the one for you; but if an interesting setting, characters, etc. is what you\u2019re looking for, this is one of the better choices. \n\n[i]It also comes with a free soundtrack in the files, so why not?[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1502553120, "timestamp_updated": 1502553965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34194026": {"recommendationid": "34194026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268813444", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502653749}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0413\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c.\n\u041a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043b\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0440, \u041d\u041e \u0418\u0413\u0420\u0410 \u041d\u0415 \u0417\u0410\u041f\u0423\u0421\u041a\u0410\u0415\u0422\u0421\u042f.\n\u041a\u0442\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0435\u0451 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f.\n", "timestamp_created": 1502552568, "timestamp_updated": 1502552568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491308", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34193517": {"recommendationid": "34193517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365491739", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505740501}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5f15\u5bfc\u4ee4\u6211\u5fc3\u7d2f\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\n\n\u627e\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u8981\u67e5\u653b\u7565\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1502551057, "timestamp_updated": 1502551057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34193501": {"recommendationid": "34193501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256956166", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501707123}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember liking this a lot more as a kid, aside from some ending points that are really dumb in my opinion.\nBut hey, if you like them anime RPG maker games this one is worth picking up.

Many people like it for its \"unique\", but for me the art is completely \"normal\", and the \"ingame\" sprite are horrible.\n- RPG-maker standard with nothing good in game play. They have a \"money\" system that do nothing.\n- \"3 small games\" - 3 parts doesn't connect to each others - means that after farming monster (which contibute nothing to the story) you'll have to do it again when you play another part.\n- Too short. Not so much content was added in the game. The map was small and don't have anything really special. I like the idea in part 1, but it was too easy to predict. Part 2 was boring. I feel that they don't really put much work in story making, so this story don't really have depth.\n\nOverall I don't dislike it.

Though the combat itself leaves something to be desired and is pretty repetitive, but the story itself is great to say the least. The story is played out in the 3 games Lieat I/ Lieat II/ Lieat III all of which can be played within roughly an more or less. In the begining you are introduced to the two protagonist: Theodore Leonhart A.K.A.:Leo/hal/theo. Theo is a 23 year old \"con\"man who likes 3 things: Beer, money, and women. He is a liar who travels from place to place with a mysterious past that is found out later in the game who is accompanied by the other protagonist a small \"dragon\" that goes by the name Efina or Efi, but she's not the kind of dragon we're used to instead of scales and reptilian she's a small girl that looks roughly 4(though she's 6 months to 1 year at the end). You follow these 2 goof balls as they go through the 3 games helping out in solving crimes the first a murder the second disappearing memories/ a crucifixion and the finale a thief. Each of the characters have unique personalities, but there is a severe lack of characters which is understandable due to the length of each of the games. The combat is earthbound esque you pick up random pieces of gear and level up you don't use money and the game itself is pretty linear and I'd recommend playing it more for the story than the combat. That is all please do buy the game and enjoy :).", "timestamp_created": 1499235818, "timestamp_updated": 1499235818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33259392": {"recommendationid": "33259392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186700666", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509859705}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u552f\u7f8e\u840c\u7cfb\u753b\u98ce\uff0c\u6709\u79cd\u9ed1\u6697\u7ae5\u8bdd\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u3002\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u9057\u61be\u5c31\u662f\u5267\u60c5\u6709\u70b9\u77ed\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6574\u4f53\u611f\u89c9\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u597d\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1499227408, "timestamp_updated": 1499227408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33255079": {"recommendationid": "33255079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142851187", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499526236}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it.", "timestamp_created": 1499216224, "timestamp_updated": 1499216224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33242920": {"recommendationid": "33242920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072223359", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512101886}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, it has love able characters", "timestamp_created": 1499193583, "timestamp_updated": 1499193583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33240759": {"recommendationid": "33240759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348050800", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510066414}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u5c0f\u578bRPG\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u633a\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u4e2a\u4eba\u633a\u63a8\u8350\u7684\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u4e5f\u5f88\u53ef\u7231", "timestamp_created": 1499190429, "timestamp_updated": 1499190429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33223027": {"recommendationid": "33223027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133821578", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499781392}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u756b\u98a8\u53c8\u53ef\u611b\u5287\u60c5\u4e5f\u8c50\u5bcc\u89f8\u52d5\u4eba\u5fc3\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1499161090, "timestamp_updated": 1499161090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33223020": {"recommendationid": "33223020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012452005", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499160839}, "language": "english", "review": "Its adorable.

probably because I'm very sensitive and I developed a liking to the characters, but mostly because I was crushed when the story didn't continue, I really hope for a part 4.\nThis game even taught me the affects of lying and how it can destroy people from the inside, so I guess that's pretty good.\nOverall, absolutely amazing game, very well made, and affects you on a personal level if you are a

Everything is original to the game, and it's all well done for it's miniscual scale. It has it's own artwork for each character, and even some small animated scenes. The music sets the stage alright enough, and is something I like to listen to casually. \nI'd like to empisise miniscual though. This game is a very small game, easily completed in 2 hours for a first run for a normal player. The game is made even smaller by being cut up into 3 peices, each a labled \"game\" You'll pick from once you start up the game. Each one is self contained, but they all add up into a complete plot of the main characters. I like how it was handled, too.

It doesn't look like it from the thumbnails, but I fell in love with these characters halfway through because they're SO WELL WRITTEN. Efina and Leo are wonderful, but I personally have an affinity for side characters. Trust me, they're all adorable (subjectively, anyway) and even kind of get their own development?

LiEat also presents an original and intriguing concept with the whole dragon thing and its mythos.

I am simply reviewing each individual aspect based on my opinion. This allows for my reviews to be spoiler-free. You may find I rate by different categories in each of my reviews. This is because every type of game is different, and will not have the same content. I think it is pointless to leave a category blank or write 'unrelated', or something similar.)\n\n[h1] Game Content: [/h1] \n[b] Type of Game: [/b] Pixelated RPG, Indie\n[b] Graphics and Art Style: [/b] **** - As mentioned above \u2013 pixelated, but in anime style. The cutscenes have higher quality graphics, as well. I feel that in this case the pixel graphics are not a hindrance to the game, or a product of lack of developing money, but a way to add a different feel to the game. If the game had Final Fantasy graphics (an example) or something similar, it would not feel nearly as cute and the player would not feel as at home in Effie\u2019s world.\n[b] Music: [/b] **** - The music really suits the game, it\u2019s (mostly) fun and upbeat with a different style depending on the chapter or the happenings in the game at that moment. When simply strolling around a new area while \u2018Papa\u2019 is off working, the music has a pleasant tune. But when someone has been hurt or disgraced, the music conveys the character\u2019s anger, sadness or malice.\n[b] Addictiveness: [/b] *** - Once you start the story, it really makes you question the nature of Effie\u2019s world and how she even came to be. When I was playing it, I thought about it even when I was far from my computer. So I will give it three stars for catching my mind\u2019s attention to the point where I always wanted to play it more.\n[b] Storyline and Character Development: [/b] ***** - As mentioned above, the story is breathtaking in complexity and the characters are closely related to their world, which is why I combined those two categories for this review (and also so I don\u2019t have to say \u2018as mentioned above\u2019 every five seconds). The characters are complex with intertwining relationships and there are some you might be able to relate to or empathize with in some way. The dragons in this world are often mistreated, with Efina being lucky to have a (somewhat) caring companion, so you can also hear a bit about other dragons\u2019 experiences, although most like to keep it to themselves.\n[b] Difficulty: [/b] *** - It\u2019s pretty easy really. The battles are even easier if you find the incredibly overpowered Legendary Gear. Even if you don\u2019t, you shouldn\u2019t have a problem. (P.S \u2013 There is already a guide on Steam that shows you how to find all of the gear, so use that as you will!)\n [b] Replay Value: [/b] ** - It\u2019s kinda just one of those games you play again once you have forgotten about it, really. XD\n[b] Gameplay and Controls: [/b] *** Standard RPG controls, basically. Nothing special and nothing too difficult.\n\n[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]\n[b] Marks Overall (judged by the mode of the numbers): [/b] *** - 6/10 (although I consider it a 10/10!)\n[b] Who Should Play This Game?: [/b] Anime RPG lovers, people who appreciate a good story and dragon lovers! XD\n\n[u] Thank you for reading! If you have any suggestions about removing/adding/changing anything in my reviews, please let me know.

Each of these episodes centers around a single area where you mainly talk to people, solve puzzels and encounter fights. While these are all essential (and only possible) features of every RPG-Maker game (and usually how well you incorporate each of these determines the game's success), I personally enjoyed a lot how the fighting encounters were incorporated as more of story element rather than forcing them to play a bigger part in game's overrall flow. Granted, this means that the fighting part overrall feels very one-dimensional and easy, which can make the bossfights feel like a letdown.\n\nThe stories are mainly detective-like, where you spend most of the time uncovering what has happened. There's a lot of characters, and luckily those that you meet in all three episodes are the most with most substance. Since the game overrall is pretty short (It took me 4 hours to get every single ending & achievement), it does have quite a lot going on and its emphasis on exploring the background of the other MC can feel a bit tedious. On the bright side, most of the dialogue between charachers flows well and the game is sure to leave you warm-hearted after experiencing all of it.\n\nI'd say that the biggest problem I had with the game was the fact that getting a neutral/good ending of the final episode is heavily obscured compared to earlier ones.

At first, I didn't have high hopes for it. I bought it one day, Then left it sitting in my library for about a week. I decided to finally play it when I had nothing to do for around 30 minutes while I waited for my game to update. I ended up playing the whole story 4 hours straight, and I did not regret it.\n\nThe story was lovely. I loved the dialogue, and the personality of the characters. Especially Elfi. Her dialogue was adorable, how she was really clueless about many things. The art was really good as well. It isn't as sparkly, and shiny as the art of really good artists, but it gives off a really nice charm.\n\nI wasn't expecting cutscenes from this game. Though really short, I feel that it gave a really big impact to the story. Text, and pictures can't always tell a story better than it being animated.\nThough saying that, The cutscenes are just around four seconds, but it was still a nice addition overall.\n\nThe first two games are pretty much the same thing, but the third game really starts getting into the characters. That's all I can say about the three without spoiling it to much. Though I'm not saying the first two are repetetive. They both have a unique story. The second one teared me up. Don't even ask me about the third.\n\nFor the mechanics, The battle system is pretty simple, and most monster fights are pretty easy. The bosses have really high health, but they don't hit as hard if you do the right thing. Though the main part of this game is solving problems, I wouldn't necessarily say it's a puzzle game. I don't know the word, or how to explain it, but it's like piecing the parts together to get the answer. I guess it's like that.\n\n\n\nOVERALL:\nThe game has a lovely story, and the puzzle part of the game isn't to hard, but it can be a challenge here, and there. Overall a wonderful experience, at least for me. I recommend it for anyone who's in for a good story.", "timestamp_created": 1494256110, "timestamp_updated": 1494256301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Sadly, most of the interesting puzzles and gameplay consequences are exclusive to LiEat III and kept sparse between the other two.\n\nLiEat's appeal primarily lies with its snappy personality filled dialogue exchanges between characters, utilizing bittersweet tones to good effect and visual presentation, featuring some nice dark and not so dark fairy tale motifs and the occasional non-sprite animated segment (something rare to find in Wolf RPG editor titles). It's a cute/neat looking game to be sure and a nice little collection of reads if you have the patience to figure out what to do next, but alas it finishes off like a read that was just getting to a good part before snapping shut with no continuation in sight.\n\nI found myself quite enjoying the setting and general idea of LiEat but was also finding that, as deduction + lie eating as a gameplay mechanic was never capitalized on nor amounted to anything outside of flavor text, perhaps the whole thing would've worked better as a novel like the prequel was rather than using a not so great RPG as a medium to relay the story.

This actually has three games in it, or at least when I run it it does. Each part is their own seperate story, and even though you can technically play it out of order or only one game, its better to play all the games.

I bought it for like $.99 or $1.99 on a sale expecting a generic game I could play for laughs. Instead, I got a game with a compelling story that, while I only spent 3 hours playing, I enjoyed every minute of. The normal price is $2.99, and I'd say that the price is worth it for what you're getting. Unless you're a soulless husk, I gurantee you'll enjoy the game. The storytelling is top tier, with a narrative that does wonders getting you to care about the characters in a relatively short time, which is something many AAA titles have trouble doing in 60 hours. The pixel art looks decent in game, but really comes to life in the short cutscenes and other artwork (such as portraits). These really help the characters pop and really brings them to life. The soundtrack is just phenomenal, with the boss music doing a great job to set the mood. The only 2 things I didn't like about the game was the lack of an options menu (so no volume adjustment or fullscreening) and 2 of the 3 endings for Chapter 3.

This game is one of my favorite games in my library. It's both simple yet also complex. The game starts you off with some story then it's up to you to figure out what to do next. This gives you the freedom to explore a bit and find items that make combat almost too easy and, if you're not careful, can lead you to a bad ending. I got the bad ending 3 times in the third chapter before I figured out what to do. I wasn't mad, though, because it meant that I hadn't been exploring and leveling up properly.

I saw this game a while back and being a lover for pixel graphics, I placed it in my wishlist for a while. Bought it on sale, and pursued to try it out. And I loved it.\n\nThe game actually splits into three hour-long games, depending on how you play, and each has it's own interesting and individual story. You follow the characters Theo, a con man, and Efina, a lie-eating dragon, as they travel to town after town, figuring out information they can later sell to earn most of their money. However, they come across some dangerous situations, from vampires to a phantom thief.\n\nThe \"RPGness\" of this game is rather simple. There's no real strategy to winning, other than using powerful weapons you find while exploring the area around you, which is the best way to complete battles. Hence, the game focuses more on character development, dialogue, and exploration to drive the game forward. The different endings add a good small variety to the game, and the game progresses as there is an actual universe in the game that conflicts impact the ending.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed all three games. Althought the slight limitations of doing your own thing are low, the story is genuinely good and original. Even though the puzzles sort of play themself, I was immersed in the story greatly, and actually felt emotinal with all the endings.", "timestamp_created": 1490466559, "timestamp_updated": 1490466559,

LiEat is a trilogy of short games lasting around one - two hour each and you follow around a young guy and his pet dragon called Efina solving mysteries. It's one of the only games I own on steam, that I would recommand to every friends I have. The game is worth the money and doesn't feel like a $3 game at all. If you're just considering buying the game because it's cheap, do it. It's well worth it.\n\nIt took me a total of nine hours to complete all three LiEat games and also complete all the achievements for each game. Sometimes I did have to start a new game to do an achievement but as a completionist and i forgot to save it two times, I didn\u2019t mind, it was worth it. \n\nSo let\u2019s talk about the  style, it was lovely and cute imo, kind of has an anime/VN vibe to it and the little characters in the game are adorable as well!!. Simple but with the perfect amount of detail when it\u2019s needed. Also, when you progress through the game, you will come across crucial moments where there would be a short animation clip, just to make the game more visually appealing which I really appreciated. If you can\u2019t get enough of the clips and you would want to view it again, once you complete the game your character will be transported to the ending room where you can look back at images and clips you came across in the game and also read more information on the characters in the game.\n\nThe games themselves aren\u2019t hard to beat, really, but the last installment will require the player to look up a walkthrough if they want the good ending, due to the very random, very specific requires that must be achieved in order to unlock the good ending.\n\nThe mysteries in the games were very good and a lot of fun to explore and figure out, and the characters were all very diverse. I was incredibly pleased when the police dragons continued to show up throughout the series as well. Awesome game. Ten out of ten. (What can I say? I\u2019m a sucker for a good story.) I would probably have to rate this teen and up though for the blood and the second chapter\u2019s setting, which while not too graphic, is something kids probably shouldn\u2019t be learning about quite yet.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1488296429, "timestamp_updated": 1488296429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0,

I believe that LiEat is a very easily enjoyable game for those who don't mind playing something light on gameplay.\n\nThe game is split into three chapters that each follow a pattern of the main characters, Efi and Leo arriving at a town, the player meets and interact with the other characters, a mysterious event occurs, the police captains, Brett and Neil, show up and investigate the mystery alongside Efi and Leo and they catch the culprit who is one of the previously introduced characters.  A heartwarming ending follows if the player chooses to achieve the good ending of each chapter. Each chapter takes 1-2 hours to get through.\n\nThe gameplay tends to be on the lighter side as it is almost impossible to die unless you are trying to achieve that.  Until the last chapter, you are already given all the healing materials needed and it is possible to find extra. You will be fighting small monsters called little lies throughout the duration of the game and leveling up, gainging strength and skills to fight with until you reach the end of the chapter which results in a boss fight.  From these fights you usually take very little damage until the boss fight and it is very easy to heal.  In fact, it is possible to pick up special, stronger, weapons if you look for them within the game which makes fights pretty easy.  The characters walk at a nice pace and the controls are easy to figure out but i would have prefered if there was a screen that listed the controls, especially since the title of the game window was left untranslated from Japanese and as a result many don't know that F4 will convert the screen to take up the desktop.\n\nDespite the lightness of the gameplay (if light gameplay does not suit your tastes), and the episodic nature of the chapters this game boasts an incredible amount of charm and likeability that is unshakeable to me.  Leo and Efina are fun and interesting characters which create nice foils to one another.  Leo's cunning and mysterious past as well as Efina's innocence and many other childlike qualities  are fun to watch on screen and make interacting with other characters twice as enjoyable.  Though, the characters introduced each chapter tend to be likeable by just themselves. The animated cutscenes and music look and sound especially nice adding just another reason to like this game.\n\nLiEat is definety worth your 3 dollars and is a charming and enjoyable to pick up at anytime.", "timestamp_created": 1487535041, "timestamp_updated": 1487535041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

picky heroin addict. Most triple AAA companies don't fill that niche because their more involved with violence, scenery and massive [strike]erections[/strike] explosions. The whole game in it's three episodes have managed to reel me in like a hungry shark, or more appropriately attracting a story telling audience with a game that leaves you emotionally satisfied, and if your like me you will be walking around the house reminising, and scaring the crap out of you family members.\n\n[u]atmosphere[/u]\nthe art style is the first thing you will focus on the first time you play. it has a minimalist, yet very thoughtfully lay'ed out placement of locations and people. it manages to fit the tone of the story in a semi-realistic world [spoiler](yes there is magic, but there are also cellphones and GUNS that are known to be really powerful, in a world that shouldn't have things like that)[/spoiler]. characters are interesting and well rounded, and has a very good pace of story without text dumping the player.\n\nthe music in this game is, wow. it's not fully real orchestral music but its so good that you could be listening to it for hours and not get sick of it. its sort of like a renaissance/pop music and every time i start an episode, the music would be spot on for atmosphere. it is something that will make you stick with it longer and will probably encourage you more to show the game to your friends or family member.\n\nthe story in the game is as unique as it is engaging as this game. you play as two people, a con artist and the lie eating dragon, which at first doesn't look anything like one. but the story unfolds in this surreal, but believable world. the main focus of the game is to rid the selected location of lie's which take fiscal form and if it goes on for too long, the liar who spawns them will get consumed by the lies. imagine living in a world like that, where if you lied, your in more risk of getting yourself killed by your own lies. Surprisingly most people in the game world don't care and if you think realistically enough, it would be taken seriously and anything that encourages lying would get decimated. so the story and the believability of some of the people are a little off, not bad but might take you out of the experience a few times.\n\n[u]gameplay[/u]\nOk to be honest, I never played many of these rpg games. I'm not talking about rpg games like Lisa and Hyics that have a focus on combat mixed with story (if you can call hylics a story driven game). I'm talking about story driven rpgs that have an influence from Japanese culture and a style in minimalist form, like Ib, the witches house and yume nikki. The ones that do have combat in the traditional turn based formula tend to be, meh.\n\nThe combat in the game is your average rpg combat, and i don't have to sing you the bloody formula. you do reset to your starting lvls every new episode, but your abilities are so small and basic it's not anything to go on about. But even with the combat in the game its like that annoying plastic wrapping around salami. you have to take it off to eat it and, even if it's tedious you still have a tasty salami to eat, and people are only mildly annoyed by it.\n\n[u]conclusion[/u]\nlieat is a unique story driven game with a lot of original ideas to hook you in, painfully by the mouth. it's a really good game that serrate you and makes you into sushi for it's customers. if you don't want to die like that, that are other games that would suit you like DOOM that blows you up with a rocket launcher in Indonesia. or Thief gold that makes you run for your life from a hunter and into a spike trap [spoiler](man i'm talking alot about linking pain with pleasure)[/spoiler].", "timestamp_created": 1486358416, "timestamp_updated": 1486526791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29731589": {"recommendationid": "29731589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168716605", "num_games_owned": 2112, "num_reviews": 594, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486386615}, "language": "french", "review": "Un superbe petit jeu avec des personnages attachants, (Efi est trop mignonne!) beaucoup d\u2019humour et des combats assez simple.

(another perk of this game)\n\n\nif you skipped all of this like most people do, just buy the game. nuff said.", "timestamp_created": 1486326827, "timestamp_updated": 1487907233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29724559": {"recommendationid": "29724559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032998559", "num_games_owned": 528, "num_reviews": 141, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486316212}, "language": "english", "review": "this is not a game. this is a walking into rooms and leaving a million times in boring, empty towns simulator.", "timestamp_created": 1486316305, "timestamp_updated": 1486316305, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.405370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29717845": {"recommendationid": "29717845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314856223", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498630465}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u592a\uff01\u53ef\uff01\u7231\uff01\u4e86\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1486298936, "timestamp_updated": 1486298936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29694888": {"recommendationid": "29694888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047417609", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487071157}, "language": "english", "review": "Why you always lying (':", "timestamp_created": 1486219959, "timestamp_updated": 1486219959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29686420": {"recommendationid": "29686420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127353047", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487388010}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5973\u751f\u505a\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u679c\u7136\u4e0d\u4e00\u6837\u3001\u5973\u4e3bEfi\u8d85\u7ea7\u840c\u5c31\u77e5\u9053\u5403\u3001\u8fd8\u753b\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u53ef\u7231\u7684\u7537\u5b69\u5b50\u3001\u753b\u98ce\u5f88\u6696\u975e\u5e38\u559c\u6b22\u3001\n[spoiler]\u521a\u5f00\u59cb\u73a9\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ae0\u3001\u5438\u8840\u9b3c\u54e5\u54e5\u56da\u7981\u5438\u8840\u9b3c\u59b9\u59b9\u3001\u8ba9\u6211\u60f3\u5230\u4e86\u857e\u7c73\u56da\u7981\u8299\u5170\u3001\u5438\u8840\u9b3c\u4eec\u90fd\u8fd9\u4e48\u7231\u73a9\u56da\u7981play\u561b_(\u00b0\u03c9\u00b0\u300d\u2220)_\u3001[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1486192545, "timestamp_updated": 1486192545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29672517": {"recommendationid": "29672517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064222534", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462797887}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful game!\nAddicting story, music, and graphics.

Its art style is cute, although my main issue of the game was that I kept confusing one of the protagonists with some of the other characters (but that might just be me with not paying attention to the charater sprites while I'm reading). The music is wonderful and there are times that the game can be quiet, but it adds a bit of suspense.

As a puzzle solving detective game, this game really shines. I felt each of the stories was interesting in their own way, and after playing the 3rd chapter, I was glad I did in fact play them in order and experienced the story the way it was meant to (which you arent forced to do by the way). As an RPG it is mostly unbalanced, with most enemies being far too easy, then having a chapter boss that is extremely difficult.  The key to succeeding is finding the hidden equipment that is all hidden in vague places, along with not avoiding battles, and finding the hidden health restoration items (which are the only ways to heal other than sleeping in beds, which the game kinda leaves up to you to assume that it heals you and never points it out). I enjoyed this game. Though I 100% cleared all 3 chapters of the game with all achievments and all of the different endings to each chapter (each chapter has a good and bad ending, with the 3rd chapter having an additional neutral ending as well) in less than 5 hours. This was with the help of guides however, as some of the sections that require you to talk to specific people after certain events, had me confused. So without a guide, this may possibly be a 6 hour game. Due to the short gameplay length, I would recommend picking this game up when it is on sale, even though the $3 pricetag isn't unreasonable. <3", "timestamp_created": 1484443637, "timestamp_updated": 1484444467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29238817": {"recommendationid": "29238817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273572761", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511418200}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u90e8rpg\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u73a9\u7684\u4e00\u672c\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002[spoiler]\u5c31\u662f\u6709\u70b9\u77ed\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u610f\u72b9\u672a\u5c3d[/spoiler]\ncg\u6f14\u51fa\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5076\u5c14\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u6f14\u51fa\u4e5f\u4e8b\u76f8\u5f53\u53ef\u7231\n[spoiler]\u4f46\u662f\u5e3d\u5b50\u60c5\u62a5\u5c4b\u6b7b\u7684\u7a81\u5982\u5176\u6765\u554a\uff01\u867d\u7136\u4e4b\u524d\u786e\u5b9e\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b7b\u65d7\u3002\u660e\u660e\u6211\u8fd8\u5f88\u840c\u5979\u7684QAQ[/spoiler]\n\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u76f8\u5f53\u6709\u8bda\u610f\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63\u4e86\u4e2d\u6587\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684bug\n\n\u3010\u4ee5\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u57282017.2.16\u66f4\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u3011\n1.\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u8981\u8fdb\u5165beta2\u4e2d\u624d\u80fd\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u65e0\u9650\u5d29\u6e83\n2.\u4e2d\u6587\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u90e8\u5206\u6210\u5c31\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u9501", "timestamp_created": 1484365876, "timestamp_updated": 1491271564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29228737": {"recommendationid": "29228737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358240560", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484276570}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Amei o jogo,a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 linda,o unico problema \u00e9 a legenda.\u2665", "timestamp_created": 1484329742, "timestamp_updated": 1484329742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29227989": {"recommendationid": "29227989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263992655", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482930673}, "language": "english", "review": "A really cute and funny game.I recommend playing.", "timestamp_created": 1484327703, "timestamp_updated": 1484327703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29221194": {"recommendationid": "29221194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018595337", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484301519}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought LiEat because I am nothing if not a sucker for interesting aesthetics. And JRPGs. The premise is a young dragon girl who can eat lies; that combined with the art style was enough to convince me it was worth the very small price tag.\nThis game is broken down into three 'parts'. Essentially, each is a self-contained adventure in a confined space that takes about an hour to play through. I'll be honest...I got stuck quite quickly. They take an odd format and presentation that completely stumped me; it dumps your character in an almost empty town and says to go do stuff. What follows is a very linear series of events that are so loosely connected that I highly recommend following a walkthrough.\nThis sounds like it should be a negative point, but the fun of the game isn't in working out the next step. Instead this should be seen more as a visual novel with token battles and movement that go a long way to investing you in the story. And it is the writing that gets this game a definite recommendation.\nYou experience the events - that take the form of a series of 'mysteries' to be solved - both from the eyes of the naive and childlike Efi (the lie-eating dragon girl) and her 'father' Leo (an early twenties conman). This split perspective works very well and lets you see the various characters with whom you interact in differing ways that would have been unavailable if your protagonists didn't act independently.\nEfi is endlessly cute and acts very much like an actual child would; playing, exploring and making friends with all the shady people Leo regards with cynicism and weariness. She is initially the focus of the game's attention, but this regrettably shifts to what I hesitate to call the 'over-arching plot' in the last part.\n\nOkay. Cards on the table. This game is very short. Four hours to 100% it on my first run. And that includes leaving it running a couple of times while I got distracted and wandered off. I would have absolutely loved if there had been another three or more of the little 'episodes' even if that doubled the price of the game. As it is, the game peaks with the second part and the third part kinda lost me.\nThe first part focuses largely on the combat which varies from impossible (if you didn't stumble randomly across better weapons) to trivial (if you happened to find the best ones). The second is a mostly conversation-based little story with less combat where Efi is at her best and the third takes a very 'puzzley' attitude that almost forgets combat exists until the end where you need to grind for a couple of minutes.\nAs I said, I think this game is best played with a guide open (made easier by the fact the resolution CANNOT be changed from a 480p window), allowing you to find the good weapons and get through the weird sequence of interactions you need. Without the 'gameplay' to slow you down, you can explore everything and talk to everyone. It's the talking to everyone that makes this a fun adventure.\n\nConsidering I bought this very cheap based mostly on its aesthetics, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like it. It is crammed full of a cuteness and charm that appeal greatly to me and smother any ill feelings about the relative lack of gameplay or the short runtime. While the third part is by far the weakest, it does end in such a way that a sequel or expansion is not impossible. If one is ever released, I'm sure I will play it and enjoy it simply if it is more of this.\n\nOh. And the idea of having all art stills and cutscenes viewable at the end of the 'part' is brilliant. They're pretty if few in number and they're worth that second look at the end.", "timestamp_created": 1484304316, "timestamp_updated": 1484304316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562044", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29218229": {"recommendationid": "29218229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243856362", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494145516}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u60a8\u63a8\u85a6\u9019\u6b3e\u904a\u6232\u55ce\uff1f\t\n\u662f", "timestamp_created": 1484288929, "timestamp_updated": 1507039124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29175819": {"recommendationid": "29175819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348321727", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484309842}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a short game that one can finish in three hours, unless you want to unlock each achievement \nThe drawing style suits the game itself, the soundtrack is also well-made, tho it can get annoying/boring when u hear it again and again.

Never actually played it, but I did a run through before I wrote this for my own purposes. [And not just cause I wanted to be able to name the stickers I was sending people on Line haha]\n\nLiEat is a super simple JRPG that features the extramily adorable Efi- Efina if you want her full name- and... Well he's got a lot of names. I loved them both as well as the supporting cast, each with a visually distinct design and their own little quirks. The story of the first two sections is very simple and are likely more focused on getting the player accustomed to the controls and aquainted with the characters. It builds up the mystery that is much more elaborated on in the 3rd part- not that it doesnt introduce its own cast of course. Think of them as one game rather than three, least thats how I do it. They are enjoyable on their own of course, but they are fairly simple imo.\n\nI absolutely adore this game, miwashibas works are some of my favorite of these little rpgs [and I guess perhaps visual novels as of 1bitheart, would you call it that?] and their art is honestly just beautiful. That alone makes me love the game just a bit more- I'm a sucker for art as an artist myself. \nThe combat is simple [Albiet perhaps a little too much so, but I'm not particualrly skilled at games a lot so it's a easy game for me to pick up and play] and the controls are easy to get accosomed to. I only had one problem when I was starting the 3rd one, my controller wouldn't get picked up by the game. But, I played something else for a bit and when I went back it was fine. Who knows what happened. \nWhile the writing and story are very much simple but very nice to read I did feel it was a tad short. Even spread over 3 games. The buildup is very nice but the finale of the 3rd game felt just a tad fast.

LiEat is about a partnership of a lie-eating dragon and a master liar. Together they solve mysteries and find out the truth. The concept itself is interesting and fun enough already.\n\nThe story and the gameplay are very simple, which is both a positive asset and a shortcoming. On one hand, you get to understand what's going on right off the bat and it doesn't get any more complicated as you go. This allows you to enjoy the characters' personalities and dialogues rather than having your mind preoccupied with every detail you come across. On the other hand, it takes away the mysteriousness of the detective-esque scenarios. There is no wrong answers or missed clues. All you need to do is talk to everyone and kill monsters to finish the stories. The plot comes off as shallow and it makes it too easy but it's fun to go through nonetheless, and at the end of the day, that's what matters most.\n\nA biggest part of the experience is the very stylish design. From the interface, to the sprites, to the CGs. Not to mention the beautifully animated cutscenes. The music throughout is also very ambient and appropriate to the situation. The second biggest part is the characters. The energetic and optimistic Efina is easily the most fun character to interact with or play as. She is ever so energetic and optimistic. Her childish personality is very entertaining, and it complements the serious, albeit playful, attitude of her partner, the master liar.\n\nWhat I personally liked most about this game is the chemistry of the two main protagonists which I think is very cleverly constructed.

The characters look colorful and unique without overshadowing the very pretty, if somewhat small, world maps. The game generally sticks to a 16 bit style, although its cheating and going a bit over that limit- to good effect. Interspersed in there are hand drawn frames, stills and animated scenes normally about 3-5 seconds long, that have a simple but colorful style to them that mesh with the normal graphics very well.\n\n I was not expecting anything more than a 10 second loop track or four with this game and boy was I wrong! This game has at least 8 tracks that are over 1-2 minutes long for each chapter, and I rather liked quite a few of them. They are left open in the games files so you can drag them right onto a music player. They are very soothing to listen to, many of them are quiet music box ones but there are some others that are more robust.\n\nThe gameplay itself is rather basic rpg format. turn based with limited ability menus. There are item upgrades if you want to search the wold maps but I found that it really wasnt neccessary until the final chapter when you have to battle a fairly tough boss without your AP recovery guy around. The game itself is extremely short, clocking in at around 4 hours for me to unlock all endings, but I still haven't unlocked over half the acheivements. \n\nThe story is engaging if you like fantasy. Its nothing too mind blowing but still enough to make you cry a little. Reminds me of a Miyazaki film a bit. The characters are easy to grow attached to.\n\nOver all I really enjoyed Lieat a lot more than I thought I would, and highly recommend it for anyone looking for an easier game to chill and get lost in for an evening.", "timestamp_created": 1483083151, "timestamp_updated": 1483083221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28819459": {"recommendationid": "28819459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287848242", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483810005}, "language": "english", "review": "I wasn't sure how to feel about this game when I first bought it - it was way back  in August when I made the purchase.

The characters in the game are cute with designs that compliment their personalities. The main protagonist has an edgy look about him but one could immediately infer that he is actually kind due to how Efina is always by his side. This helps to complete the image of a naive daughter and her stern father who will obliterate you if you touch her. The music is also cute because they made it sound music-boxesque. This makes for a triple-threat of cuteness. In addition with the 8-bit aesthetic of the game, it's a quadruple awwwperation. Nothing in the game looks out of place, highlighting how they have expertly applied colour to simple pixels.

In this world, human is just a term that refers to anyone who walks on two legs - except for one creature, the dragon. Dragons are the only humanoid who can use a magical ability, and for this reason they are hunted and enslaved. They are born from the particularly strong wishes of humans, and this wish gives them the magical power they will have for life. Efina hatched in front of Leo with the ability to manifest lies and eat them. As the plot progresses, you find out why such a rogue would have a need for a dragon like that.\n\nYou get three games in one, and it took me around 45 minutes to an hour to do each one. The gameplay is straightforward and easy. There is a turn based combat system, but it's rarely used and seems rather pointless. You can find very, very powerful legendary weapons just by examining objects carefully at the beginning of all the games. The only time you might need to grind the lies instead of just ignoring them is when there are a couple of achievements linked to level (Get Efi to level 10 in part one, and there are two endings to unlock in part three if you are above or below level 13). Most of your time will be spent trying to find out how to trigger the next cutscene, sometimes the directions are not so clear. For example, Leo tells Efi to go explore for a while in part 2, and you have to ask certain NPCs to play with you before sleeping will trigger the next scene. There are also some localisation issues which make finding the next task a little difficult, and there are some sentences which look like they have been translated literally from the Japanese when a more standard English expression would have been clearer. I can't complain though, I do the same thing! And actually I enjoy seeing the original Japanese show through, it's cute. Major props to the translator who was great at interpreting Efi's strange way of reading words (fantathief!).\n\nThe art in this small game is absolutely fantastic. There are short animated scenes included at major plot points, and the pixel art and colour palette is so beautiful. It's low-res, but this is a limit with Wolf RPG maker and higher resolution artwork can be found online.\n\nI started LiEat because I wanted to play something similar to Mad Father, but it wasn't quite the same. It's not a horror, just very gothic. Even though the story of LiEat is well-developed I did not find that it was as good at exploring individual characters and motivations as Mad Father, and it would have been nice to learn more about the other characters that pop in and out of the story like Rosalie, Carol, and Iris. Like Rosalie seems to have a history with Leo but she only appears in part one, and doesn't really do anything? The game would have been much the same without her in it. There is also a LiEat novel being translated by the game translator (http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/130927788020/lieat-the-novel-prologues-part-i) which might add more worldbuilding.\n\nOverall this game is really worth the pocket change it costs to buy, you get a wonderful story for your money.

The two make quite a strange team, solving mysteries through the girl's ability eat the lies of people whilst the liar himself lures out the people's lies. All in all, the story and characters are well crafted, each with different backstories that captures a fine detail. Expect giggles and laughs with their humors, and be prepared to face how serious they can be!\n\nThe game uses a simple battle system that is akin to the many RPG predecessors (Earthbound, Final Fantasy, etc). Miwashiba managed to keep it fast and easy to learn, anyone unfamiliar with the system is able to figure it out quickly thanks to the descriptions. Since the game wasn't designed to be a grinding fest, you hardly even need to get to a high level in order to beat the storybosses, it's way easy unless you're after the achievements (like me).\n\nNow, the art and sound... Don't even get me started on those! It presents an adorable artstyle, map, battle and cutscenes. The music fits the game's design of being something similar to the Pokemon games, changing based on the current events that are happening. In my opinion, music can change one's mind of thinking, LiEat did a good job in presenting this!\n\nI'll rate it 9/10.\nThe only problem I have was how short it was.

but extremely pleasent story. The characters are interesting and develop well within the small space given, and make for a nice amount of contrast in the interactions. It has its funny and happy moments, but does gradually develop into something darker and more tense as the plot progresses.\n\nLovely art styles throughout, with good use of colour and weights.\n\nMake sure to check all the dialogue available! There's a lot of fun dialogue you can very easily miss if you don't check absolutely everything - sometimes multiple times.\n\nI also suggest checking out the novel for the game before playing the last one (The Gold Thief), as it adds a lot more to the overall development of the world and charaters - and is generally a good read, if you enjoy these games.\n\nIf I had to make some complaints:\nThe RPG elements are pretty bare bones. There's almost no real strategy or depth in equipment or combat as all games only have 3 sets, which are purely just going from weaker to stronger, and your enemies do little more than standardly attack you. The battles feel more intended for narrative purposes than actual gameplay. The battle soundtracks are still very worth it however.\n\nSome conversational dialogue is very annoying to get. There are many, many times an NPC will have a total of 3 possible dialogues when you talk to them. The issue is it's random which of the 3 they select, so they can have you potentially be speaking to them over and over and over again trying to see what the last dialogue is because random chances aren't helping you here. It's highly worth seeing as much of the dialogue as possible as it really adds to the game, but it does take a little bit of game-awareness and effort to actually see it all sometimes.", "timestamp_created": 1480166007, "timestamp_updated": 1480166007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27645646": {"recommendationid": "27645646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071005388", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480160933}, "language": "german", "review": "Amazing Game with an good Story! ;)", "timestamp_created": 1480160901, "timestamp_updated": 1480160901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27630232": {"recommendationid": "27630232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256501993", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458069237}, "language": "german", "review": "LiEat ist ein Spiel mit einer interessanten Story und die 2,99\u20ac die es kostet auf jeden Fall Wert.

For each chapter of the game, you're confined to only one area, and your stats and items don't carry on between chapters.\n\n...Oh yeah this is an RPG. If you're interested in the game for that, you'll be pretty disapointed. The battle system is best described as really basic, and despite getting gold from every battle, oddly enough I couldn't find anywhere to spend it. Equipment in the game is found by looking around, and there's some really powerful equipment that's not very well hidden. You could almost fight every battle with your eyes closed. I believe that the battles are just there to keep things from getting boring since without them the game would just be wandering around from point A to point B just to hear dialogue here and there. \n\nWhere the game really shines is the story. While it's obviously not shakespeare or whatever, it's enough to hold your interest for the 3 or 4 hours it will take you to beat the game. The world is intriguing, the characters are cool and interesting, and the art is really pretty.

The characters have plenty of personality, I see so many games with bland characters, I hate that just as much as I hate not having a good story to follow. There are some emotional moments, especially at the end. I love games...or anything really...that can make you actually feel something. The gameplay is also simplistic, which I don't think is a bad thing. Sure, I like a challenge, but making things too complicated can turn into a bad thing quicker than simplisity can in my opinion. Overall, I loved the game. My only real complaint is how short it is, I didn't defeat it in a single day but I could have if I had had the time to just sit and play it without interruption. Note, my recorded time is not the actual total time I played, I would often get called away in the middle of playing or would be chatting while playing, I had also started playing through for a second time in an attempt to get the rest of the achievements so do not take that as an accurate estimate of time. If I were to give a real estimate, I would say it would take 5 hours at the most, but likely less if you can just sit and play without interruption. I would have loved seeing more, but the content it does have isn't bad for the price so it's not a big complaint.\n\nPROS\n- Interesting Story\n- Cute Anime Style Graphics\n- Good Personality in Characters\n- Emotional at Times\n- Simplistic\n\nCONS\n- Too Short (But, again, it's not a big complaint, the content is decent for the price.)", "timestamp_created": 1479514727, "timestamp_updated": 1479515174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26681485": {"recommendationid": "26681485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114792288", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470612705}, "language": "english", "review": "LiEat is an interesting game which is all about exploring, whether it's inspecting items or conversating with everyone you can.

Theo ist Con Artist und Efi 'sein' Drache. Warum genau die Drachen, die menschliche Form haben, entstehen, wird im Verlauf der Episoden gekl\u00e4rt - ein Rest bleibt dennoch. Jede Episode beinhaltet eine neue 'Mission' der beiden, die Beziehung zueinander und auch die Beziehung zu den Charakteren (Polizei), die immer wieder in jeder Episode auftauchen, wird facettenreicher. Es lohnt, wie in eigentlich jedem RPG, mehrfach mit den Personen zu reden.\nJeder Teil hat eine besonders ber\u00fchrende Stelle, ob es nun NPCs sind oder Dialoge der beiden Protagonisten. Wenn es einen Teil gibt, den ich als etwas schw\u00e4cher empfinde, so ist es der zweite, wenngleich in diesem mich die Definition \"Mensch\" sehr ber\u00fchrt und auch gefreut hat. Wow.\n\nDas Geld ist gut investiert, jeder Teil ist liebevoll ausgearbeitet, gut durchdacht und teils sehr kniffelig.\nM\u00f6chte man alle Achivements, so lohnt sich ein Blick in den entspr.

game, but it turned out to be better than I expected.\n[list]\n[*]The game has an interesting story. It starts off rough, as it feels like you are thrown into the middle of the adventure, but it makes use of letting the players know the lore and backstory of characters while leaving them very entertained. \n[*] The art style ranges from alright to good. The character sprites in the text boxes are detailed enough to portray expressions of characters (Though when a person is consumed/starting to be consumed with lies, the sprites get kinda messy and it's hard to determine expression by then). The animated and drawn scenes look interesting and show a lot of the characteristics of characters (Efi is so adorable when her eyes sparkled in II). They break away from the pixel artwork of the game, and is probably the peak of the game's art style.\n[*] Gameplay is nothing to be stellar about. I beat the game holding the confirm button (which to me is the A button of the Xbox controller). It's the weakest part of the game.  Wish the combat was a little more challenging.\n[*] Controls are basic and simplific. Two buttons and the arrow keys/WASD/D-Pad.\n[*] This game has no difficulty. Probably one of the easiest games I have ever played in my life. I wouldn't be suprised if a monkey was able to beat the game.\n[*] Sound track is catchy, but cuts when tracks loop over, which is sort of an annoyance.\n[/list]\nThis game sets up an interesting world, but I feel somewhat that there could have been more to this game.

It has a nice little story (the game is mostly story telling, not much RPG action), and cute pixel graphics. Only thing that bothered me was the controls, (would have liked to use WASD instead of UpDownLeftRight).\n\n\nI bought this because I was feeling brain fried from studying and needed a short break, but I had to be able to get off and go back to studying in a reasonable amount of time: this meant staying away from long or addictive games, and definitely staying away from Youtube and Netflix.\n\nLiEat is actually three short games in one, each taking about 1.5 -  2 hours to complete, so I could play through an arc and get back to studying without a burning desire to get back to playing. \n\nAs far as gameplay goes, while there are some standard elements of a JRPG (turn based fighting, leveling up, items, and what not), these seem secondary to the story telling. Each arc, or game, revolves around some mystery that gradually reveals the history of the characters, and as such the bulk of the gameplay is running around talking to various NPCs or searching for clues, which is not bad if you enjoy a good story. \n\nThe only thing that really bothered me about this game was the control scheme. I would have liked to use WASD or a control pad for movement, but you are forced to use UpDownLeftRight. \n\nUltimately I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story, has little time/doesn't want to get too involved, or is a fan of cute pixel art.\n", "timestamp_created": 1479089582, "timestamp_updated": 1479089582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534720", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26590716": {"recommendationid": "26590716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205686085", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495491917}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Vou At\u00e9 Comer Uma Mentira Agora :P", "timestamp_created": 1479075160, "timestamp_updated": 1479075160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26590451": {"recommendationid": "26590451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092804476", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479073667}, "language": "english", "review": "As others have mentioned, the gameplay mechanics aren't the best.

You'd have to make an effort to die, and you can get out of every encounter by keeping A pressed to basically auto-attack.\n\nI don't have a problem with story driven games.

I've always loved Miwashibas games, and while LiEat is actually my least favorite of their works, it's still a nice series in it's own ways. Miwashibas art is great, and other then 1bitheart's sprites, it feels the most polished in the pure amount of CG's and Movies that are in the game. Miwashiba has also always had great character designs in general, and with how the main characters change in appearance (Efinas papa especially) it's fun seeing how they evolve.\n\nThe story can be enjoyable depending on your preference. For the most part it feels like episodical games ala shonen anime, but the first game is somewhat connected to it's prologue novel, and the last game is very character centric over the main characters past. I do feel like there should have been more fleshing out on the characters and story, and the battle system honestly isn't neccessary. I think Miwashiba realized that fault, since their later game doesn't include a battle system at all, instead opting for Dangan Ronpa/Ace Attorney style gameplay.  All in all, LiEat has it's faults, but it is genuinly a fun and beautiful game to play, and I also reccomend playing miwashibas other games, Alice_Mare and 1bitheart if you find yourself enjoying miwashibas storytelling, characters, and art.", "timestamp_created": 1478770810, "timestamp_updated": 1478770810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26515319": {"recommendationid": "26515319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317018708", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500640733}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u5f88\u68d2\u3002\u7f16\u5267\u529f\u5e95\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5176\u5b9e\u633a\u590d\u6742\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u6ca1\u6709\u4e13\u95e8\u957f\u7bc7\u5927\u8bba\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u80cc\u666f\u8bb2\u89e3\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7269\u95f4\u7684\u7b80\u77ed\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5c31\u4e3a\u73a9\u5bb6\u6784\u5efa\u51fa\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u3002\n\n\u5267\u60c5\u7b80\u77ed\u5374\u53c8\u5341\u5206\u4e30\u5bcc\u662f\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5356\u70b9\uff0c[spoiler]\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u8c8c\u4f3c\u592a\u77ed\u4e86...\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u535615RMB\u7684\u8bf6...[/spoiler]\u5176\u5b83\u7684...\u50cf\u662f\u586b\u4e0d\u6ee1\u7684\u88c5\u5907\u680f\u3001\u6ca1\u5565\u7528\u7684\u91d1\u94b1\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u89c6\u4e86...[spoiler]\u6240\u4ee5\u8bf4...\u8fd9\u91d1\u94b1\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5e72\u5565\u7684\uff1f...[/spoiler]\n\n\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5e76\u4e0d\u91cd\u5728\u6253\u602a\u5347\u7ea7\u62ff\u88c5\u5907\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u4e0a\u8fb9\uff0c\u7b49\u7ea7\u8fc7\u4e8620\u8981\u901a\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u5927\u4e86(\u5c31\u7b97\u53ea\u670910\u7ea7\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4f20\u8bf4\u4e2d\u7684\u6b66\u5668\u4e5f\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u901a\u7684...)(\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6700\u7ec8\u5173\u60f3\u770b\u5230Happy Ending\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u9700\u8981\u7ec3\u7ec3\u7ea7\u7684[spoiler]\u5f53\u521d\u4ee5\u4e3a\u53ea\u6709Sad Ending\u548cNormal Ending\u7684\u6211...[/spoiler])\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u96be\u5ea6\u633a\u4f4e\u7684(\u5927\u6982\u662f\u4e0d\u60f3\u8ba9\u4f60\u6c89\u5728\u6253\u602a\u5237\u7ea7\u8fd9\u4f20\u7edf\u5957\u8def\u91cc\u8fb9\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5267\u60c5\u5427)\u6ca1\u6709\u7279\u610f\u7ec3\u7ea7\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u3002[spoiler](\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u628a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u7ec3\u523030+\uff0c\u7ed3\u679cBOSS\u51e0\u4e0b\u5c31\u6302\u4e86...)[/spoiler]\n\n\u611f\u89c9\u4e0a\u561b\uff0c\u8fd915RMB\u5c31\u662f\u4e70\u4e86\u672c\u6545\u4e8b\u4e66\u56de\u6765(\u9644\u5e26\u4e86\u5f20CD)\uff0c\u633a\u503c\u7684[spoiler] \u8981\u662f\u540e\u9762\u8fd8\u9644\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6e05\u56fe\u96c6\u5c31\u66f4\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e86[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1478767221, "timestamp_updated": 1478767221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26512073": {"recommendationid": "26512073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198453956538", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479781620}, "language": "english", "review": "09.nov.16, Wow, i bought the game yesterday and tried out the first chapter today.

I had a bit of experience with some of these before I played this, but LiEat is special to me.\n\nMusic:\nAll of the music is just fantastic and great music, it really sets the mood of the game as well as the situation. I would love it if there was a remastered soundtrack or something, I'd be willing to buy it if there was such a thing. Like most RPG Maker games, the music is free-to-use type of music. So finding it is a matter of finding the one who wrote it.\n\nCharacters:\nThere are a lot of interesting characters, but the most interesting our are main two: The con artist that goes by many names (such as Leo, Harold and Sid) Leo and Efina, a young dragon that can eat lies. Most of the characters are brand new each game and range from likeable to just not caring much about, but these two are always there and have a great connection with on another. At its core, I'd say these two make it a buddy story in my eyes. Leo is the serious work focused character that keeps to himself and doesn't like talking about his past, while Efina is the young carefree  character that is still trying to understand things and can be reckless but cares deeply about the people she meets. The two have the child and caretaker relationship, but they play off of each other and grow from being with one another so well.\n\nGameplay:\nHere is where I have to give a bit of a negative. While I know there are some RPG games that are easy, even they have challenging moments despite the low difficulty. LiEat on the other hand, like Wadanohara, is far too easy. There is hardly any strategy and the only way you can lose is if your too cocky and don't pay attention (and heal) or lose on purpose to get a bad ending. Unlike Wadanohara though, this game does have a bit of varity although very, VERT small. Aside from attacking, enemies might defend to reduce damage or charge up to deal more damage with their next attack. Some can also take a lot of hits and do require some strategy such as increasing defense and attack, but even then the fights usually are still fairly easy. The only fights I found challenging were some of the bosses in the third game of this pack, but that is of course if your a low grinder and only do what is needed to get the good ending. Overall, gameplay isn't terribly easy but still suffers from being far too easy.\n\nStory:\nI'm going to keep this one short as I actually say it woud be better to experience this amazing story on your own. LiEat is compose of three games that make up one huge story, in each Leo and Efina go around and uncover mysteries in the places they vist as Efi learns more about humans, about why she eats lies, and about Teo's past and why he lies a lot. In turn, Teo learns to trust Efi more and slowly becomes willing to tell her a bit about himself to her as well as lessening his lying. The first game focuses on a town where a wolf is said to attack people and its vampire legend, the second focuses on the two looking for more info on dragons by exploring a town that is rumored to have a dream-eating dragon. The final game concludes the story as the two look into the mysteries of the phantom thief, which I can't even say much due to very big spoilers as this was by far my favorite of the three. There are many lessons that could be given in these stories, as I believe stories should have a hidden message for the viewers to take in their lives. LiEats is the danger of telling too many lies, even if you had good intentions behind them and the lies could controll you. It's a heartwarming tale with a great message.\n\nLiEat is a fantastic short RPG Maker game, the full game can take up to three hours long to finish with each of the three taking about 55 minutes to an hour or so to finish. It is certainly worth getting and playing. Heck, if your not sure if you want to buy it despite it being only $3, you can download it to try it on VGpersons site and if you like it enough to show support, buy the Steam version like I did. There isn't many changes between the regular and the steam version, except for it comes with all three instead of having to download all three one at a time. Yes the battles are far too easy, but there is a small amount of varity that at least makes up for it minorly and the rest of the points prove to be much stronger. I'd highly recommend getting this game if your looking for a short good RPG story to dig into, you won't regret it and if you say you did, you better call Efina to eat that lie.", "timestamp_created": 1478253982, "timestamp_updated": 1478253982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26406792": {"recommendationid": "26406792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031639225", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478205596}, "language": "german", "review": "It's like 3 bucks people, just buy and play it already!", "timestamp_created": 1478211109, "timestamp_updated": 1478211109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26394603": {"recommendationid": "26394603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155968509", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489146097}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, I' m see it once and I'm love it.\n, since I see It ,It made me one of Miwashiba fan //w//\nI'm alway hope I can support Miwashiba san who make this game\nAND NOW I CAN !!

But this one? Oh boy, this indie game is quite something else. It's worth the few coins it costs, definitely. It's a very big shame they stopped at 3 games (all are included), they could have made so much more. The games themselves were about 2 hours long each (give or take) and though at the start you're kinda just thrown into this world without any back story you eventually find out about every character. An overall great game with 3 VERY touching endings, though they could have done so, so much more. The levels themselves weren't very large and didnt have much going on in them, mostly story, they could have expanded on the puzzles a lot but they only really introduced puzzels at the end, (the final bit of the LiEat 3 was really the only amazing part) and they didn't touch on character items almost at all, 2 weapons each per game sometimes a 2nd hand weapon and only once did you get armour for the Efi (but not Teo) and there was no 3rd accessory, despite there being space for one. I felt like some game mechanics weren't finished, and so much could have been expanded upon for an even better version of this game; if the rest of the story was as full of puzzels, plot devices and atmosphere like in the last one I'm sure It would have been even more amazing - stating it was already good without it.\n\nIf the story doesnt get you, the music will.

Story wise, there's not much I can say without spoiling it for you, but while this game doesn't do anything ground breaking in this department, it has its own merits that warrant making an emphasis on it.\nWhile you do engage in combat against small critters, they're really not hard fights. If anything, they exist for symbolic purposes only, as you can break the game combat-wise very early on in each chapter by finding the legendary variants of your initial equipment in not-so-subtle places around the map.\n\nThe closest I could compare this game to for people who're wary about RPGMaker-like games on Steam are like those one shot manga you'd find at a convention that were so well received by the adventurous few that gave it a try, that you get to see a sequel in the following year's gathering. Except you get all three in one package for no aditional price.\n\nI'd recommend this game over any 99 cents joke game on Steam any day.", "timestamp_created": 1474140024, "timestamp_updated": 1474140024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25540335": {"recommendationid": "25540335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065646078", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474088448}, "language": "english", "review": "A story-driven rpg with a great soundtrack and premise.

I just feel like if that's what you desire, pick up DOOM instead. Not a RPG game, they are more story driven.\n\nI am no expert at making video games, probs the worst at it. But IMO, LiEat is pretty darn cool.\n\nNow, I cannot call it just a RPG or a puzzle game, cause it is an abomination of those genres. RPG materials, puzzles on each part and lotsa characters. You know, a triple.\n\nI am gonna cut this review to parts cause if I don't I feel like it's gonna be fairly clugged up. The game doesn't really have gameplay, as you can just get the OP weapons on each part if you really feel like it.\n\nFirst of all, characters:\n\nYou aren't given, like, huge logs of info about each character. When you end a chapter, you are given a decent amount of info on every minor and major character of that specific part. While playing, you are given info more about their personality than specific likes and dislikes. Which is GREAT cause nobody cares about what a fucking character likes eating or what their fucking hobby is, I am here for the actually important shit.\n\nGameplay:\n\nTHERE ARE PUZZLES AND YOU SOLVE THEM\n\nYOU GET THE OP WEAPONS AND SLAY MONSTERS\n\nWHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT GAMEPLAY STORY'S THE MAIN THING OF THIS GAME\n\nSprites and shit:\n\nI am god awful at drawing all round so I cannot say too much about them. They look pretty cute and are consistent, the color palette is pretty pleasing to the eye and the animated cutscenes are smooth as my baby butt. I like 'em.\n\nMusic:\n\nMy god, the music.\n\nMY GOD, THE MUSIC.\n\nI know I said Joyful and Painful have some sick music, but LiEat is Joyful X10! As soon as you enter the first chapter's main area, you are given the best piece of music I've ever heard in any type of media!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1klAwy0k9Q\n\nI-It's just so pleasing, so chill, so fucking amazing!\n\nIt's basically a blessing that the creator of LiEat also gives you the OST if you buy the game. Each area owns it's own music for every mood it needs to deliver! And as far as I heard, you never hear the music you heard a chapter's music on the other chapters too!\n\nI am sorry if I sound really pumped up about it, I just really love this OST.\n\nAnyway, my final thing, the story:\n\nI do not want to go on for long, so let me give you a summary:\n\nThe main character, Teo and his little dragon lie eating daughter Efi visit towns and sell information they can gather while Efi eats up all the lies they bump into. There are also a large police force of dragons and their main objective is to free every enslaved dragon and protect them, even sometimes hire them! The captain of the force, Neil and his vice captain Brett are familiar with Teo and his little shenanigans. They usually come up after specific murder cases have occurred, like actual police would. Teo and Efi usually meet up with these two on each town they visit, except every time they see each other, Teo and Efi have different clothing and etc. When you sell info and eat lies you shouldn't be running around with the same clothing, should you now?\n\nThe story's worth looking into by yourself IMO, it's pretty cool!\n\nIn my opinion, this game is worth picking up and playing 'till the end. But hey, I am weeb trash for playing this according to the internet, what do I know?\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1474044904, "timestamp_updated": 1474044904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2,

If you like short RPG games with anime style storylines, LiEat might just fill that need for you.   It\u2019s light gaming with interesting characters, clues to uncover, and lots of text. Oh, and little pixely people.\n\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n-\tA nice blend of pixel art with hand drawn anime cut scenes\n-\tpuzzles are not very difficult\n-\ta good background fantasy world with a strong character driven dialogue story\n-\tleveling up and upgrades easy to achieve\n-\ta good soundtrack\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n-\tgame towns and rooms look very similar\n-\tsome doors, messages, and openings are not apparent\n-\tfirst chapter is somewhat slower than second and third.\n-\tRPG elements are barely there\n\n\n[h1]Long Review[/h1]\n\nA close family member recommended this game to me as an easy game to relax with. I don\u2019t really play any RPG Maker games, so it was a gamble whether I would like this or not.  LiEat started a little slow and didn\u2019t have a ton of RPG action going on, but it actually makes up for it with charm and characters.\n\n\n[h1]First Impressions[/h1]\n\nFiring up the game, you start with a bit of back-story for the first chapter.  It begins with an explanation of the relationship of some vampires, wolves, and a village.  I won\u2019t add more than so that I don\u2019t spoil the story.  After watching the opening, I was a little confused because it seemed like this was a vampire game of sorts.  Shortly afterwards, the two main characters Efi and her Papa - who says, \u201cremember, call me Leo here\u201d - are introduced. \n\nThose two characters are the beginning of the real story \u2013 Efi and Leo.  It\u2019s about those two, not the vampires \u2013 at least not for a good while.  Their dialogue is charming and personal.  Efi is a little girl, not a teenager so her affections and emotions come off as pure and innocent. She only helps Leo with heartfelt devotion, not from any hidden motives.  Leo, on the other hand, changes his name in each town we enter.  We\u2019re never quite sure what he is up to and what his motives are.  Efi even calls him Papa more than by his name since he doesn\u2019t make his background clear to her.  His personality is murky and he feeds Efi a healthy amount of lies \u2013 which becomes interesting later on.  It\u2019s this dynamic relationship that fuels the story.  They both have a history together that makes the dialogue feel like we\u2019re eavesdropping on them.  Each short conversation is filled with quips and witty remarks.  My only problem is that sometimes the banter starts out well but can suddenly become too silent.  Conversations will be be moving along only to be shortened to \u201c\u2026!\u201d or  \u201c\u2026 \u2026 \u201d.  I understand pauses in dialogue, but it seemed like there were a great deal of them over and over.  Thankfully, this improved a bit towards the middle of the chapter as the story fleshed itself out and greatly improved from chapter two on down.  \n\n\n[h1]Gameplay & Story[/h1]\n\n\n So, what do Efi and Leo do in this game exactly?  They are pretty much detective investigators.  Efi is a Dragon \u2013 a being created by someone\u2019s wishes.  She is somewhat immortal and possesses a special power unique to herself - she eats lies.   Efi and Leo - a.ka. Hal or Theo - spend the entire game solving detective cases.  This makes LiEat more of a mystery adventure game than an RPG.  Yes, you will use RPG elements and fight monsters, but that part of the game is actually very minor.  The combat is simple with attacks, skills, and powers.  You\u2019ll walk and open doors, drawers, etc and find some items to level up.  It\u2019s very accessible to people who have not played RPG maker games, so no worries about dying throughout.  However, the bulk of the game is solving a dectective who-done-it case and saving the day.  Each chapter is a new adventure for Efi and her Papa.\n\nUpon playing a chapter you encounter an x-factor that surprised me. These \u201cDragons\u201d , a whole race of non-humans, are mostly employed in a police force of sorts and help in each investigation.  Usually, they help on a side quest while leaving the bulk of the game to Efi and Papa, but it does add some great opportunities for character development and side missions.  There are some touching scenes with Efi, who seems at odds with being who she is.\n\nIf you like anime style dialogue, you can very easily imagine voice actors voicing this script and it\u2019s actually done nicely.  There are some translation issues here and there, but its nominal.   The entire story is dialogue driven with the exception of the short intros at the beginning of each chapter.\n\n[h1]Graphics & Sound[/h1]\n\nRPG Maker graphics.  You\u2019ll have limitations in details and color palette. It\u2019s done as well as it can be within those constraints.  You will see both still-shot cut-scenes and fully animated cut-scenes for important scenes during gameplay.  There is a color tone of magenta and muted green with soft tones of pastel orange, red, purple, green, and mauve.   This is very nice to look at, but there are limits of the RPG maker engine itself.  Sometimes, I\u2019d have no idea there were scrawled words on a wall or a door to the side.  \n\nThe soundtrack has a hint of Harry Potter in it\u2019s tonality  - a whimsical magical composition.  Generally, nothing unnerving or irritating since it loops for most of the levels.  Additionally, none of the sounds effects were annoying or overdone.\n\n\t\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]\n\nIf you like dialogue driven anime, adventure games, or episodic RPG\u2019s then you might enjoy this game.  The actual RPG elements are very light, however, and anyone seeking a moderate RPG experience may want to look elsewhere.  LiEat is about solving mysteries and characters, less so about leveling up or exploring.  You may or may not fall in love with the main characters, but one thing that stands true in each chapter is the emotion of the story.  It takes a few chapters, but there was a surprising depth to the storytelling that I was not expecting later into the game.  After the first chapter I was only mildly interested, but by the second chapter I was involved in learning more about the characters.  By the third chapter I was engrossed in seeing what happened towards the end.  \n\nSpeaking of the ending, there are a few of them depending on how you play out your choices.  Save your game at least one extra time after you get past the stairwell if you want to see them all.\n\t\nI was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed playing this game. It\u2019s only $3 and frankly priced just right for the amount of content you\u2019ll get.  While not a must play game, it\u2019s exactly what I was a told to expect \u2013 a relaxing little  RPG mystery.", "timestamp_created": 1472531577, "timestamp_updated": 1472532281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690616", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25240204": {"recommendationid": "25240204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324475892", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472482130}, "language": "schinese", "review": "win8\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u540c\u6837\u62a5\u9519\n\u5f00\u53d1\u800513\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u4ee5\u524d\u5df2\u53d1\u8d34\u79f0\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u4fee\u590d \u4e0b\u9762\u94fe\u63a5\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/373770/discussions/0/359547436760308413/\n\u5728steam\u6e38\u620f\u76ee\u5f55\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u91cc\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u76f4\u63a5\u8fd0\u884c", "timestamp_created": 1472519465, "timestamp_updated": 1496546040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25237516": {"recommendationid": "25237516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050213512", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472348129}, "language": "english", "review": "Story was alright, but all in all I really love these characters and I really cherish them.\n\nThere's also a light novel made by the developer, Miwashiba (\u25b3\u25cb\u25a1\u00d7), herself which takes place before the first game (or in this case the first chapter).

The positive ones overvalue what people perceive as \"cute\" while the negative ones bash the game too much. There are a few reviews that make a justified description or review of the game. Obviously I'm not doing any side a favor with this. I'll explain why I can't recommend this game after stating a few facts about it. Keep in mind I'll be taking in consideration the price of the game and what the game offers for that value.\n\n[h1]The TLDR pros/cons version:[/h1]\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n- Cutscenes and Artworks for some in game events.\n- Movement is fluid.\n- The overall style is cute.\n- Small optional interactions you can do in the game to make yourself feel more involved with the story (such as poking Leo when he sleeps because why not).\n- Multiple endings.\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n- Lack of consequence if you do certain mistakes;\n- The lack of actual places to explore per chapter makes the game feel repetitive and boring on the long run.\n- No combat depth despite being advertised as a JRPG. Additionally, if you grind some levels you can actually become immune to damage, including boss damage.\n- Despite being advertised as \"A fantastic JRPG focused on storytelling.\" the storyline is very short and doesn't hold up to that statement. The story is appropriate for the price of the game. Don't get your hopes up.\n- Some in-game designs for characters are poorly made (especially the artwork of characters on the right of the dialogue).\n- The in-game money you acquire is useless.\n\nFor those interested [u]in more details[/u], I'll start off with the [b]pros[/b]:\n\n1. I didn't expect any type of cutscenes at all. I thought it's just some trailer animation. It was a nice surprise. It makes it easier to imagine what's depicted or how the characters actually look in an RPG viewed from the top.\n2. For this price I had some feelings that movement speed or the FPS cap would be an issue. Good thing I was wrong. The movement is fluid and fast enough for the size of each map.\n3. While it doesn't captivate me as much as others, the style is chibi-oriented and cute.\n4. The small and sometimes meaningless optional interactions you can do does make it, at least for me, a better way of appreciating the game, rather than not having them at all.\n5. It's great to have multiple endings to slightly personalize the story depending on some actions you do. Some might argue that a linear great ending would be better rather than branching out.\n\nNow for the [b]cons[/b]:\n\n1. The moment I saw Lies that you can battle I immediately thought of \"hey, this looks like a nice detective game! Maybe if I pick the wrong choice, it's gonna affect the case or make me redo it...or at least lose a certain amount of HP\". Sadly it doesn't expand on it and there's no consequence with failing to find the lie(s) (unless you count the fact that you waste some time on some battles)\n2. Being used to JRPGs, I expected more zones than what it has. There really isn't too much to explore. But for the game's price I can't really complain that much.\n3. If a game has \"JRPG\" or even \"RPG\" as its genre, I expect some combat depth and some grinding. Sadly the only part where I had to \"think\" was in the first chapter where I used an AoE attack to get rid of a line of mobs. Overall, you can just keep mashing the Attack option and still win. And if you reach a certain level with your characters you become immune to damage.\n4. The storyline is okay for the price attached. I really wish there were more scenes and more character development because I wanted to get to know some characters more than the game allows me to. I spent some time in RPG Maker. Adding text is not that hard (And yes, I do imply this game was made in RPG Maker or something similar). But like I said before, for the price I paid, it's not a big issue.\n5. There's a lot of pixelation done with the characters in the artwork shown on the right of the dialogue, such as Leo looking way too low quality compared to others and not too appealing to the eye. Maybe that's just me, I don't know.\n\nWhy do I not recommend this game? Because it could have been something awesome like \"To the Moon\" or \"Ib\" with enough hardwork and patience. I would buy the game at a 5-10 euro price tag if the game was focused on the following:\n- More places to explore\n- More optional dialogue and interactions with the characters\n- Expand the combat by adding some strategy to it\n- Most importantly: Make it a detective JRPG game where I interrogate people and find the truth about the case.\nThis game had the potential to be a JRPG focused on finding the culprit and solving mysteries. Not to the lengths of \"Danganronpa\" or \"Ace Attorney\" series, but at least give more player input and consequences related to uncovering who done what they did. It has a dragon loli who can detect lies, for crying out loud!\nI'm not gonna go into details on how this could be made as everybody has their own ideas of how to improve the game. However, I really wanted some negative effects if I'm doing something wrong with finding lies, make me find who the culprit it according to clues and then give me the option to accuse someone. Heck, maybe use in-game money you acquire to buy hints.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nThe artwork is okay, the BGM is okay, the story is okay, overall this game is average. And that's the problem. I really wanted to recommend this game but I can't. And it's not because of the value of the game, it is for what is worth. It's because it could have been something awesome and unforgettable giving the right time, patience, hardwork, and price. Yes, I'm not recommending this game only because it wasn't polished to its fullest potential. I wanted this game to be awesome (with an appropriate price for its greatness), but the dev team decided to stop and deliver an okay game for its current price.\n \nI am aware that the reason for not recommending it isn't truly justifiable. From an objective standpoint I'd recommend this game. But this is a review with my own personal opinion. Thus, a subjective point of view is more appropriate.\n\nA message to all reviewers who keep saying stuff like \"omg that girl is so cute and you should buy the game because of that!\": You are overvaluing the \"cute\" aspect of the game way too much. Is it really that big of a thing for a dragon loli that discovers life to be this game's selling point? Or the artstyle? Because I don't think so. Maybe that's just me. Who knows.\n\nA message to all reviewers who say this game is \"horrible\" or bash certain aspects of the game in an exaggerated manner: don't forget you spent 2 to 3 euros/dollars on it. For that value, don't expect too much out of it. It's not gonna be Final Fantasy. As mentioned above, the game is neither good or bad. It's average. If you're that disappointed, just sell the Trading Cards you get from it and compensate some of the money you spent. If you're lucky enough to get a Foil type of Trading Card, you can sell that for at least the amount of money you spent on the game.", "timestamp_created": 1472495474, "timestamp_updated": 1472495877, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818591", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25219775": {"recommendationid": "25219775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016627432", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471634933}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't want to hype this game (because hype ruins everything), but for the record, LiEat will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nWhat you get when you purchase this game is actually three games. Or you might say the game consists of three episodes. Each episode has its own self-contained plot, and there are a few questions or over-arching plot threads that persist across each episode, so it's not *entirely* episodic. The combat takes a backseat to storytelling. It's simple turn-based, and not really difficult. But it really doesn't add anything to the game or take it away. It's just kind of there.\n\nThe stories, even if you find them predictable, you will find well-executed. The game just throws you straight in, and uses a great combination of character interactions and the events in each episode to give the player information on who Leo and Efi are and how their world works without bogging down the experience with tedious heaps of information. These games reward exploration. Even if you are not required to speak to a character again, often visiting them again after the story has progressed a little will reward you with new and interesting dialogue. I personally enjoyed all the characters, Efi especially :P\n\nThe art is adorable and the music really brings the atmosphere together. There is a good balance of humor, and seriousness in this game. This game's only crime is being too short. It's only $3 and imo it's worth more than that. Buy this game.

You play as Theobald Leonhearts and his dainty companion Efina through 3 games, each taking place after one another. You follow them through 3 different settings each one sprinkling you bite-sized bits of Theo's and Efi's personality and past while foreshading a deeper meaning to your adventures. Each game plays the same way only differing in story and setting so the game will be evaluated in a general sense.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe sound design in the game works well but isn't anything special at all. It gets moody or bright when it needs to be. Overall the music seems to give off the feeling of bittersweetness which is fitting for the game.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay here is what you expect of an RPG with a little twist where you can decide if you indeed want to engage or not in combat beased on being given an option to decided whether or not a lie is genuine or not. This makes the combat pretty much optional save for the bosses and the few unavoidable fights. However the ending you recieve can be determined by your character level but unfortunetly the enemy scaling is really bad. All the enemies save for boss characters are lies in a physical creature-like form and it is possible to get strong enough to destroy the bosses by grinding on the weakest enemies. \nThey just give you way to much exp and this becomes more apparent each game the first being the most balanced in my opinon. I also find it odd you get money too but never use it for anything. The game progresses for the most part by speaking with characters or checking objects in a sequential matter which is sometimes boring to be honest. Sometimes this leads you to pressing 'Z' on everything you come in contact with or searching around far too long. This also led to me finding the legendary weapons in both the 2nd and 3rd games which was pretty cool because they were hidden invisibly but they really break the game and I don't recommend even picking them up unless you just want to enjoy the story. In the second game you can find the legendary weapon on the second screen right at the beginning which is very unfortunate but the thrid game fixes this. \nOverall the gameplay is fine if a little imbalanced and sometimes mundane. It seems comfortable not taking the idea of deciding which lies are genuine further than a plot device rather than a real  fight mechanic. I liked that Efi follows you like Pikachu would in the old Pokemon games but was dissapointed that I couldn't turn around to converse with her.\n\nStory\nThe story is the meat of this game in my opinion but it sure takes it's time selling you on it and I really felt like most of it was in the 3rd game while the other 2 were just primers for the big drop. It's not the best but not the worst and once I was learning more about Theo and Efi I definetly wanted more and the game delivers well on that part. This game contains interesting lore where dragons are born with human appearences and each with a special ability and it delves a bit into the idea but often I found that the abilities were pretty lame. For the most part the characters you engage with are interesting and have a personality that is acceptable but they are mostly forgettable. Sometimes the dialog makes no sense given the context an example of this is the responses you get from the maids after completing the investigation on them in the 3rd game. The most enjoyable moments here are the interactions between Efi and Theo.\n\nLiEat is an RPG mostly centered around it's story and the relationship between the two main characters. The combat is almost optional and could use some work to balance out. The settings could be better since the 2nd and 3rd game's are too similar. It is thematicly cute feeling but keeps a dark and surreal tone when it comes to the plot devices which was pretty neat. Overall it is enjoyable but rough around the edges at times. You can tell if this game is going to be enjoyable for you almost immediatly. I say follow your gut on whether or not you want to play this one because it is an experience that is varied but what is appealing about it very apparent and doesn't stray far from that.\n  \nGraphics\nThe art design is what you would expect from an RPG Maker game however LiEat sets itself apart from the others with it's brief animations which are usually used to introduce a character for the first time or during key events. The static images that are sometimes used instead of an animation in these sequences are okay, they usually feature a character posing cooly. My only gripe here is the character portraits that appear when one of them is talking. They are cool looking but are harsh on the eyes to make out the smaller details in them. \n\nFor me this was a 6/10 slightly above average but could have been a 7 if the game had a little more strategy involved in the combat it was just too much of a breeze. I enjoyed it in parts but didn't in others but I'd still recommend becasue the price is very fair for what it offers.", "timestamp_created": 1472394430, "timestamp_updated": 1511466110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501900", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25196421": {"recommendationid": "25196421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075422219", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472407569}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "comprei esse jogo meio com p\u00e9 atras mas valeu cada centavo", "timestamp_created": 1472352453, "timestamp_updated": 1472352677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25195934": {"recommendationid": "25195934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101991645", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501731430}, "language": "english", "review": "LiEat is a story-based game comprised of three somewhat short stories.

For starters, the game looks like an RPG but it could practically be a visual novel. It has the entire RPG coat of paint with stats and equipment and such but none of it really matters since there's almost no fighting. You actually aquire equipment faster than you can use it and collect more restorative items in one playthrough than you would need for 10 playthroughs. In other words, it's all about detectiving and the story.\n\nYou play a conman/detective who is a habitual liar and also as a young dragon who looks about 5 or 6 but is actually just a year old. Said dragon eats lies but she can't eat Mr. Conman's lies since the person has to admit the lie and she has to know it's actually a lie before she can eat them. So this game has 3 chapters and with each new chapter the duo move to a different town where Mr. Conman dons a new identity and they have a new mystery to solve. It's all well-written and interesting.\n\nThere are some flaws, though.\n\nFirst, in Chapter 1, there was a point where you had to identify lies and clues were hidden in the area to help with that. I thought that was cool but it turns out that sort of mechanic was not really used after that. It would have been nice to have that mechanics used a lot more and in more clever ways. A lot of the time you're just guessing, the answer was spoon-fed to you or it's a \"clean up the lies\" segment where everything is a lie and you don't have to worry about getting it right. \n\nSecond, TINY TINY window. If there's a way to run this game fullscreen, I never found it. Not even Alt+Enter works. The game normally runs in a 640x480 window.\n\nOther than that, I would highly recommend the game.

The pixel sprites are beautiful and the illustrations and short animated scenes are simple, yet pretty.

Efi's relationship with her [strike]tsundere[/strike] \"papa\" is funny and heartwarming.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is that the battles are [i]way[/i] too easy. If you check the global achievement stats, you'll see the least common achievements are the Bad End ones, which require you to lose to each chapter's final boss. This is especially frustrating in the last chapter. You'd expect battles there to be crazy difficult (they give you SO MANY HEALING ITEMS too), but they're actually the easiest in the whole game (boss battle included). \nConsidering how short the game is, you may also find it a little pricey depending on your region and currency.\n\nDespite those 2 downsides, however, I still heavily recommend this.

All 3 games in LiEat are about an hour long each, and each involve solving some kind of mystery. They mostly play like an adventure game with multiple endings where the two play detective and hunt for clues and pick out lies.\n\nThe translation is pretty spot-on, but some subtleties are always lost. For example, the con-man calls Efi 'runt', which might be a tad rougher than the more endearing 'chibi' in the original. Other than the illustrations by Ike which either have striking perspectives or are absolutely adorable, Miwashiba did everything else himself - writing, music etc. and it's great!\n\nThe conclusion is quite awesome in tying up all the loose ends.

You don't need to grind as much as you might expect from the usual JRPGs. Which is fine, but it still needs a bit of extra work in my opinion. There is no variety of monsters aside of the bosses, I wish there were more disgungished differences between the lie monsters but theres barely any in-battle. (Outside of battle they have different looks yes, but in-battle, there isn't much difference. They all have the same attack moves so there's nothing special to it?)\n\nAside of that: visuals. The visuals in this game are good! As a fan of anime art-style, I felt the art style used here really fit the characters. The pixel art as well is very lovely and I do fancy it quite a bunch. At start the weird filter of the game's first chapter bothered me, but as I proceeded the story; I began to understand it was part of the atmosphere each chapter gives you. \n\nThe music is fantastic, very soothing and very nice to listen to. It's very fitting to the atmosphere the visuals & story is trying to give you. \n\nThe characters are fantastic as well, there is literally no other complaint other than I wish I knew more about them! Theo does his job great playing the \"mysterious\" character, and Elfie is way too adorable! Honestly in every JRPG I tend to hate one specific character because of traits that I don't like, but I don't really think theres any character to hate here. All of the characters you get introduced to are reasonable and have well thought-out backgrounds. Some remain more mysterious than the other, which is fine as it leaves things better to interpretation to how they may be like outside of our protagonist's views! Each story is left with an \"open-ending\" to what happens next to these characters aside of the protagonists and I like that.\n\nHonestly, my only complaint about this game is: I wish it was longer! I wish the plots were longer as well, or that one chapter had more to it than the main plot and the tiny errands you do! Because the plots are so short, the maps are short as well. There is barely anything to explore. However if you're bored, inbetween you might come to find some interesting things.

One of the biggest ones is 'overstaying your welcome'. See, I don't handle horrendously long games that well. Well... that might not be true. It's probably better to say that developers don't often make a long game a good one. I think this is driven by an industry standard in which long games = better games? Or perhaps you can charge more for a longer game, people might like to pay for a certain number of hours of playtime. But quite frankly, I think that's a horrible justification for long games. That's essentially saying that you made a game long to make the game long. It's like padding on a woman, sure, it might make them seem more appealing. But at the end of the day you're both disappointed. Ironically for the reason behind this game! Lying.\n\nThe game's title is a very clever combination of the words 'lie' and 'eat'. You will at some point in the game eat lies. Simple enough, right? Right. You play... well I don't want to spoil the plot for this one so let's just call them Dude and Efi. Efi is the dragon, she can eat lies. Dude is an information broker, but he seems to play detective. That's where the lie-eating dragon comes in. You, the player, deduce what the lies are, and then eat them. You arrive at the scene. Something has gone down. You talk to everyone, gather clues, and then when you're ready to do your deduction game, you're given a few 'lies'. Of the lies, there will be truths hidden. What this means is that you'll have to use your notes and what the lies are saying to deduce which are actual lies and which are truths. You don't want to eat the truth (apparently it tastes bad).\n\nCombat is turn-based like every JRPG and their mum. But that's not so bad because the combat doesn't make up the bulk of the game. Combat is a fine method of progressing through a game, but it cannot carry a game. That's where the rest of the game's elements come together. LiEat has a magnificent aesthetic. It reminds me of Pokemon Gold and Silver era. It's also kind of amusing when you realize how the art links together, but that's probably just my gaming quirk. For instance, there's a room with a giant eye in it. Really, it's just two layers. A hole, and a background with an iris looking drawing on it. As you move through the room, the iris background moves with you, making it appear as though the eye is following you for creepy effect! Is that impressive? Not really. But it's my blog and I'm going to squee over it because I think it's awesome. The art style just really comes together. It has this Victorian feel to it... if I'm using that adjective properly.\n\nThe music is fabulous! The music really sells the theme. It's classy, it's silly, it's spoopy, it's whatever the tone needs it to be. And it's amazing how I never noticed the transitions until I noticed the transitions. That's not the way I meant to word that. What's a better way to say this? I never noticed the transitions until it was apparent that the mood in the story had changed to fit it? Maybe the best way to say this is that I never noticed transitions. The music always fit the tone and you, the listener, could not distinguish when the tone changed because it's just done that well.\n\nThe story is generally rather basic. You could likely tell how things were going to play out well in advance. And perhaps that's the game's intention. Each game (LiEat 1, LiEat 2, LiEat 3) started with some kind of storybook sequence. A myth, a dream, something like that. And you could tell how the dream applied when you started playing the game and talked to all of the characters to get a feel for the scenario that you were about to play. The dialogue is well-written, each of the characters are as interesting as they need to be for their involvement in the plot. \n\nOf the three games, I think the second one was the one best made. The first one felt like the stretching of legs, to see if this game concept would work. The characters are so adorable how could this game concept not work? The deduction game in the first one is rather simple. I got the bad ending first because curious =(\n\nThe second game was where the writers really seemed to hit their stride. The setup was great, the characters were rather flaunty, and the deduction game (while still simple) felt more involved. It felt like more work had gone into it somehow. I don't know if that's true, but it's how I felt. And Efi just seemed to be on her game for funsies the most in this one.\n\nI don't think the third game had a deduction game, and this might be why I rate it second. I tend to favor the third game more because it ties together the threads of the first two games, but it didn't have a deduction game and the method to getting the good vs bad ending seems a bit too simple, which I'll spoil because it's that bad. To get the good ending you need to be a certain level before fighting the final boss. That's it. That's not what I want for my story endings! I want some choice that I made earlier in the game to be more significant! But the story itself reveals so much about the characters in the game. And I was more invested in the characters in these games anyway. So I rate three below two for gameplay, but three above two for story. \n\nThe thing that wraps this up in a nice little bow is that it's wrapped in a nice little bow. The game is as long as it needs to be. This is the way I like my games. Show up, get in, get out. It didn't drag itself out for the sake of runtime. It didn't drag itself out enough to make me lose interest in the characters. It had three short stories that it wanted to tell. It told these three short stories in a timely manner. And for that I applaud it. It's self-contained, a lesson that I think more developers should take to heart. \n\nAt the end of the day, I highly recommend this game. At the time of writing it's $2.39 on Steam. That's like $0.80 per short story.

It's really three small games in one, tied together by common characters and a few other details. Each game takes maybe an hour and a half at most to play, so it's certainly short. It has some RPG mechanics, but the combat is (possibly intentionally) fairly one-dimensional. Doors have functional but interesting, or more specifically large, hitboxes. Despite sounding those all sounding like bad characteristics, none of these detracted from what LiEat seemed to be doing and none of them bothered my enjoyment of it.\n\nWhat LiEat brings to the table, and what caught my attention through all three parts, is a game full of charm. The mechanical and plot choices help present itself this way, making for a game that coheres with its stylistic choices. I never felt like the game was too wordy, yet I found myself repeatedly amused by item descriptions, invested in every character with a portrait I met, and sincerely trying to guess what the next piece of the story would be. The music was pleasant and atomospheric as needed. The game has a built in difficulty setting, if for some reason you want the combat to feel a little more on edge, that felt more organic than most games, where easy/normal/hard is often just thrown in settings somewhere.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a cute story, some well built characters, and nice music, this is a game worth playing.

Simply put, it is a good game. \nFor some people, the length may bother them. It can be finished in about 2-3 hours, if you do not go achievement hunting. The pixil sprite design works well, like something made with RPG Maker or that came out on the Gameboy or NES ages ago. The story, about a newly hatched dragon that eats lies, is augmented with occassional still images and mini-cutscenes to help further the plot and immersion. The Achievements are also somewhat interactive, a few corresponding to gameplay choices that benefit you, or make you look like a jerk.\nLiEat is divided into three parts; LiEat I, II, and III. All come with this purchase. Each story builds on the character interaction between the heroine and her caring yet curmudgeonly \"papa.\" The other two reoccuring characters that help progress the story and develop the characters are a pair of policemen. And hidden around the game are hints to the final confrontation that occurs in part III. \nBesides the short length, one other downside is that the worlds in each part are small, and you will rarely if ever need to go beyond Level 10 for each boss. \nSaying any more and I fear I'll start stepping into Spoiler territory, so I'll stop here.

first actual review, all reviews i have done was some art of trolling to recieve funny votes(didnt recieve any lol).\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] Awesome game, Awesome story, Unique plot, heartwarming Characters, Short story but awesome gameplay; Aka must buy!\n\n          First of all, im mostly an online gamer. I dont spend any time on offline games, except rare cases such as undertale, to the moon, A Beginners guide and such. Personally i enjoy single player games that are focused on the story. And this was one of the best ones i have played so far. I had some spare money that i had to spend. I grabbed this game since it had an anime thumbnail and an interesting story. I started playing it after two weeks or so and i enjoyed it so much.\n\n          You start the game as a dude with a cute little fella with him. (Trying to give as less spoilers as possible) You learn that the cute girl with you is a special person who can eat lies. Your ability is being able to lie just like you breathe. You learn that theres a gossip in the city and you start to investigate it with your little fella's help.\n\n          If you are a fan of games that are JRPG-RPG's, this is a must buy game. Just grab it whenever you see it in discount, its already pretty cheap. If you got the money for it just straight up grab it.\n\n\n[h1]Pros [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Awesome gameplay experience\n[*]Unique plot\n[*]Cool and fitting music\n[*]Nice graphs\n[*]Multiple endings (not undertale much)\n[*]Awesome artstyle\n[*]Easy achievments\n[*]Really well designed characters\n[*]Controller support, Hurray!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Music loops [b]may[/b] start bugging you after a while\n[*]Short playtime (If it lasted 12 hours i would still say short lol) :c\n[/list]\n\nFinal conclusion: BUY IT!", "timestamp_created": 1466967774, "timestamp_updated": 1466967826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548078", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23836992": {"recommendationid": "23836992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032248652", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466964279}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little game.

It is split into three separate chapters with each one telling a self contained plot while all are connected by the overall arc of the main (and side) characters.\n\nThe game has an amazing and lovely art style and features some short animated scenes which are able to convey certain events better than its - still very clean and atmospheric - 16 bit (ish) graphics.\n\nYou combat different types of lies that will manifest and learn various new abilities as you level up. The combat system can feel a bit simplistic and easy at times but this is only a small issue, as the main focus of LiEat lies (no pun intended) elsewhere: the storytelling.\n\nEven in its short length (took me roughly six hours to complete all three chapters with all trophies) the game made me care deeply about the characters and what would become of them by the end of each chapter. This also acts as a motivation to unlock the best of multiple endings of those chapters.  The soundtrack further strengthens your investment as it is perfectly set up to match the mood of each scene, which can vary drastically from happy-go-lucky to rather dark and sad.\n\nHeart is what makes this game worth every penny and second of your time and this game has lots of it. It would be nice to see more games brimming with heart like this one. Even many of the missable side achievements are acknowledged by the game with a lighthearted pun or some trivia and therefore reward exploration. \n\nMy only gripe is that there is not more of LiEat at this point in time, so I am hoping for a sequel in the future.\n\n[u]In summary[/u]: A game filled with heart, characters you will be invested in, intriguing stories, clever dialogue, lovely art style, lighthearted comedy and deep feels. \n[b][u]Definitely recommended[/u][/b].\n\n\nAlso: Efi is just too cute and adorable so go buy this game.

However the story itself is not particularly interesting. The stories (there are three of them) are very obvious, have no interesting twists, and no serious amount of drama. The game is merely about talking to / interacting with people and objects in a fixed order; there is no flexibility to the story save for in the third story where you have good/neutral/bad endings based on a minor variation at the very end.\n\nI don't really care for the relationship between the main characters, which is something the writer was obviously shooting for. Despite many \"d'aww\" moments of how cute they look together in some of the art, none of the relationships between characters is particularly deep.\n\nIn the end you get a game with neither interesting combat nor an interesting story. There are \"puzzles\" that are essentially non-puzzles, as they are obvious to the point of not being worth including in the game, and I would have liked to see something more challenging. The stories also tend to be rather rushed, and some of the explanations / motivations behind some of the stories are rather lackluster, in a \"and it was all a dream\" kind of cliche way (without being that particular trope).\n\nThe art and music are fine, but I would recommend either Undertale or To The Moon if you want a similar experience with a more memorable story.", "timestamp_created": 1465781333, "timestamp_updated": 1465781333, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23515428": {"recommendationid": "23515428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227884224", "num_games_owned": 1630, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472015866}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me start this review by saying I was lukewarm to ambivalent about getting this game at the time I got it... I just wanted something cheap with achievements and trading cards.  The description was slightly interesting, but didn't really draw me in.\nTHIS GAME IS NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE STEAM GAMES!\n\nAfter playing through this game completely, I have to say that it was amazingly good!\nThe graphics are not anything to shout about, being comparable to NES games or Greyfox or the Elements series.\nHOWEVER, the STORY was in-depth and engaging, and VERY imaginative!  WELL worth the price of admission!\n\nAlso, unlike many similar RPG's on Steam, this game has smooth and responsive controls (no clunk, yay!), and no bugs that I've noticed (there are probably bugs somewhere, but none that a casual gamer will notice)!\n\nIf you want a fun, retro-ish NES-style RPG game that is cheap, has trading cards, and achievements, GET THIS GAME!\nIf you want a game with an imaginative, interesting story, GET THIS GAME!\nIf you want a game to gift to a friend that likes old-school RPGs, GET THIS GAME!\n\nThis game is middling eay to beat normally.\nHOWEVER... if you want to go GOD-mode (G.reatly O.verpowered D.readnought), each of the three games has \"Legendary Weapons\" hidden somewhere.  The excellent guides on Steam's guide page can direct you to them.\n\nThe game is cut into 3 separate games, each with 10 achievements (some of which are pretty funny!  (Happosai achievement FTW!).  None of them are bugged, as far as I can tell, and each chapter is pretty short.  Even shorter if you keep spamming enter and skip all the text, I suppose, but you REALLY want to read the story in this, it's REALLY GOOD!\nYou don't carry anything over from \"chapter\" to \"chapter\", each one is started as a blank slate.  Leveling is quick and easy, with a minimum of grinding involved.\nAfter each \"chapter\" is complete, you'll appear in an \"after-game room\" with pics and a sound test book.  Make an extra save here just for fun, and exit to go to the next chapter!\nIn the last chapter, there are 3 endings, each with a separate achievement... good, bad, and ug... erm, neutral!\n\nAs mentioned before, specifics are covered by several well-made guides in the community hub.", "timestamp_created": 1465714292, "timestamp_updated": 1465714766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23507238": {"recommendationid": "23507238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126812544", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466555233}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][u]  Spoiler Free Review: [/u][/h1]\n\nSo I haven't play the whole game through yet\nbut I had to write this after finishing the first of 3.. let's call em chapters.\nLately I grew a heart for these kind of games and judging by you reading this, so did you probably.\nThese kind of games may be short and rather cheap compared to other games on steam but\nyou rarely find games that have such heart and story put into them.\nThis is the essence of what I want from a game and the smile on my face should tell you that I'm not regretting buying this game.\nAlso there is something at the end of each chapter that is simply awesome and I'd love for more games to implement that.\n\nIf you are not fully convinced or you already have played this game and want to talk about it or other games alike to me\nthen feel free to add me ^^", "timestamp_created": 1465671576, "timestamp_updated": 1465671674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23475509": {"recommendationid": "23475509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067771899", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466696667}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is cute and fun to play with great music.\nOnly negatives are that it's short and a bit too linear.\n\nIf you like cuteness, then you will probably like the game.", "timestamp_created": 1465511994, "timestamp_updated": 1465511994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23468312": {"recommendationid": "23468312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044056670", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462900525}, "language": "english", "review": ":) wow just wow", "timestamp_created": 1465480862, "timestamp_updated": 1465480862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499326", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23467859": {"recommendationid": "23467859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077935762", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465478051}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely wonderful, the animation and sprites were amazing and the music was simple and yet enchanting.

The characters I love and the plot is well told even though the gameplay let's it down by being rather generic but like Portal, it makes up for this with a unique selling point which isn't humour but ability to suck you in like a three cunted prostitute because it makes you feel for the characters but where it doesn't mesh with me is the fact it doesn't feel like it ended well but I'm not going to spoil it for you. It is very short in terms of all three chapters but multipue endings give it some length but I stil haven't went and replay it for reasons I don't know. Maybe because it makes me feel dirty to ruin my exprience with this considering the fact that I got all the good endings in the game I don't want to get the bad endings even though they are non-canon.\n\nThis is a game I suggest playing in the background. It's something you play will you wait for a download to happen. I could suggest it for a proper game through once they add a fullscreen option and I would like to see more of this the future.

characters... Not much in this game not to like, really. I almost feel bad for letting it sit in my library for a few months before finally actually playing it... I also almost feel bad that it was so short, as I really enjoyed it and played through the whole thing in a single sitting. So yeah, a great title.\n\nLiEat isn't a very long game, as it took me less than 4 hours to 100%. There isn't really any grinding involved like in many RPGs, so that should be a fairly accurate time it should take most people, I suppose. There was some extra exploring to do, but not all that much. The game is definitely story-centered, though the concept in the fights, where you fight and eat lies is a pretty fun and interesting idea.\n\nI'd suggest just buying the game and going in blind, as it's pretty short and it's nicer to find out everything throughout the story and dialogue rather than read about it.\n\nIf you need just a small taste of what's to come, the story is basically following a man and this very young dragon-girl as they go around from place to place (well, just one place per episode, and there are 3 of them, but still) and the man basically works as a detective, with the girl helping him out with her ability to see and literally eat lies.\n\nIf I have to say one negative thing, the... 'puzzles' in the last episode were a bit frustrating, as they had absolutely zero challenge to them, making them a bit frustrating \u2014 but they included dialogue and more story-telling as you progressed in them, so it wasn't too bad.", "timestamp_created": 1464309063, "timestamp_updated": 1464309474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23224375": {"recommendationid": "23224375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211706608", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477980404}, "language": "english", "review": "Technically this is three games, the entire LiEat trilogy.  Each game is a relatively short and sweet rpg with a light fantasy-detective vibe.  The art is cute or disturbing as the narrative demands.  The writing is what really sells these games, though.  All of the characters are engaging and dynamic, the story of each game drags you in, answers your core questions while still leaving some backstory up to your imagination.  I don't have much background in music theory, but I found all of the songs nice to listen to and non-annoying, so there's that.  Those who enjoy stories about growing up, healing after traumatic experiences, and found families will most definitely enjoy these games.\n\nIf, however, you're super not into anime-esque graphics, or getting very little explanation for your story elements, then this is probably not the game series for you.  Also, the battles aren't particularly challenging, so if you're more into game mechanics than story this going to be another no-go for you.  Additionally, I didn't think that any of the answers to the mysteries were particularly tough to figure out way before the characters, but that might just be me.\n\nOverall, I heartily recommend the LiEat series for those who favor story over gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1464295575, "timestamp_updated": 1464295575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23214986": {"recommendationid": "23214986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189342123", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464404424}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u4f55\u5ea6\u3082\uff08\u4ed6\u306e\u8a9e\u5c3e\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u306a\u3044\u9650\u308a\uff09\u304c\u3001\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3092\u518d\u751f\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u5049\u5927\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1464254619, "timestamp_updated": 1464254619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23212182": {"recommendationid": "23212182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038783484", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464311165}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, simple, and super charming.", "timestamp_created": 1464234719, "timestamp_updated": 1464234719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23211270": {"recommendationid": "23211270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305598416", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464228207}, "language": "english", "review": "I paid about $3 for this game, and it was worth every cent.

Well, to list a few, they would be the cost, art-style/design, and a simple, yet original plot. The game is seperated into three stories/games to play. You start off the trilogy playing as a character named Leo whom's past is mysterious and has multiple aliases. While your little partner, Efi. is a very carefree and happy young girl who's special ability to eat lies may bring more trouble than asked for. The game overall is a very nice small enjoyable JRPG, but may fall short in 'super deep' character development(You shouldn't expect this in a 2-3 hour game, 4-6 if you're a completionist). My main complants about the game are about how short this wonderful little game is, (hope for a sequel? Most likely not. T_T) and the leveling within the game.

Each story is told like a fairy tale and each character is okay.  There isn't much depth in this game sadly.  You mainly play this game for the story since fights can only be encountered at certain times.  The battle mechanics are okay for the few fights you're going to be fighting.  There are no shops in these games (because this game actually contains 3 stories) so you'll have to be more explorative when wandering around to find certain things like weapons, armor, or consumables.  Since this game is story driven it would be expected to have decent writing and aesthetics.  This is true.  The story as simple as it was had me hooked.  The over arcing mystery of the main female's existence interested me to no end and I believe the music and art compliments everything well.  Gameplay and most cutscenes are in a pixel style and it looks nice, but there are a few cinematic cutscenes that are in an anime style and they look nice.  Overall I would say that this game is great, but don't expect something on the scale of Final Fantasy, Fire Emblem, or just a licensed RPG title.

It's cut into three short chapters, and you should be able to get through each chapter in a matter of a few hours. It's a unique way to handle a game, but one that makes it fun to binge play in small sessions. I've already played through each chapter, am currently going through to get all the achievements, and plan to play it for friends in the near future. \n\nEach of the chapters has a unique story with colorful characters. Most won't be seen in all three chapters, other than the two main characters -- our alias-changing conman and Effie the dragon. However they'll definitely leave lasting impressions and are incredibly unique, so you'll never forget which characters go to what story. \n\nI highly reccommend this wonderful title!

The ending was a little cheesy and weird, but not bad. It could just as well have been a VN, though i am glad it's not. The F4 button is your friend.

The focus here was really on the characters and the events that occur around them in their hunt for information. The battle system is turn based, and works well for how simple it is, although it can get repetitive. The \"enemies\" you'll be fighting are lies, but you get to decide if you want to get into a fight or not by deciding if it is a lie or the truth, so there's a kind of detective aspect to it, as well. For example, the area that the lie is in will probably have characters with diologue, if you talk to them it might give you insight as to why that lie is there, or who told it and why, or if it's even a lie. There are many, many implied things happening behind the scenes that aren't directly told to the player, and plenty of little tidbits of information and extra stuff/diologue to be found in the small but interesting areas. Most of my time was spent walking around clicking on everything and anything that had the slightest chance of being intereactable because I was so interested in the world and the people in it. Also, the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, each track being a pretty much perfect fit for the area you'll hear it in.

It looked pretty cute, and it supposedly had a good storyline. So, I picked it up, and I can say I'm quite impressed.\n\nTo start off, the game's story revolves around two characters : Efi and Leo. Leo is a man who does nothing but spew lies, and Efi is a young dragon that turns lies into monsters and eats them. Over the course of three chapters, smaller stories involving legends, oddities and supernatural events are laid out in a mostly linear path that prompts the player to interact with objects or NPCs to progress.\n\nThe game is strongly story-driven, as the RPG element is fairly lackluster, though the way in which battles are introduced is rather unique and serves the story (the main focus of the game) well. Essentially, Efi is used as a \"lie detector\" and must defeat and consume manifested lies as Leo solves a \"mystery\" surrounding the abnormal events. Most points of the game are rather cheery and quirky while others tend to be a bit unnerving, though overall the game gives off a light-hearted tone while delivering a tangible plot. Regardless, I thought the story was pretty solid, which is what makes this game what it is.\n\nAs far as art and music go, the artstyle is all very cute-sy and pixel-styled, and my only complaint is that during combat some numbers are difficult to read (though it isn't that large of a problem since battles generally exist to progress plot elements and serve as little more than button mashers). The soundtrack is very nice in my opinion; the themes all fit the art very well and while a bit on the simple side, do generally fit the situation.\n\nSo there you have it; LiEat: A small story-driven mini-RPG.

Although this is great for early-midgame of each part, you find yourself disappointed as the endings are pretty much the most obvious paths you could even imagine. Hell, red herrings are supposed to lead the player to believe that one character is the culprit, only an UNEXPECTED person to be the crime doer! This game doesn't do that. Also the ending condition for LiEat III was petty. Basically the game forces you to check around with little direction for a clue, consequently the player rechecks a lot of thing. If you check a certain thing more than once, bam, you get a bad ending without the slightest warning. \n\n-end spoiler- \n\nDespite the disappointing endings, I recommend this game because it entertained me most of the time, which you know, is the point of games!

At the start of each chapter the two have arrived in a new location after assuming new identities, and are almost immediately thrown into some chaos as a local legend comes to life. By making use of Efi\u2019s ability to materialize and consume lies, the two unravel the tales of the people and places they come across. In each chapter we\u2019re also given a better understanding of Leo\u2019s character and what Efi means to him.\n\nIn this world there are humans (who often do not look human by our standards) and dragons. Dragons are born from the wishes of humans, and their powers are shaped by the nature of the human\u2019s wish. While I felt like I was presented with just a slice or two from an entire pizza, I did find the tidbits about the world juicy to nibble on. The character designs are inventive, and the colors used set different tones for each of the three games. \n\nThe soundtrack makes use of tinkling music boxes, bells, harpsichords, accordions, piano and more to create somewhat classical-inspired tunes. It\u2019s not an in-your-face soundtrack but some of the tunes are quite catchy and most are great for the scenes they\u2019re used in. \n\nWhile there may be some confusion about where to go and who to talk to in order to trigger the next event, the areas are small so being lost for any significant period of time is impossible. Each game lasts maybe an hour to an hour and a half, most likely less for anyone who has played the free version before (which are still out there, by the way, the Steam version is here just to support the dev with a few bucks). About the only thing I didn\u2019t like about LiEat is that there isn\u2019t more of it. Okay, okay, if I have to force out something negative, it\u2019s that the battles offer no strategy or challenge at all. They\u2019re more a means to an end, and the game would likely be just as good if they were replaced with something else or removed entirely. \n\nWhen all is said and done, I\u2019m left impressed by the colorful world and some of the especially nice touches that you typically wouldn't expect from little indie rpgs like this. Despite the short length, I felt attached to the characters. Hopefully there will be more entries into the LiEat world. \n", "timestamp_created": 1460140705, "timestamp_updated": 1460140705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663411", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22301958": {"recommendationid": "22301958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139845473", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460229919}, "language": "english", "review": "LiEat is definitely one of my top favorites as of now. Its got that same kind of charm that games like Undertale and OFF have. The gameplay is lacking, but the storyline is fantastic and more than makes up for this.

For instance, theres no use for money in the game, yet you earn it. Even something small like adding a tiny little vendor somewhere would make it feel more developed. The money feels like it was just tacked on last minute. HOWEVER you really don't need to buy anything since the game is so short and you find plenty of healing items and such. If they decide to release more LiEat, I would love to see this added if they extended the game and joined all the episodes into one bigger game with more areas to explore.

This game comes with all three LiEat games and is definitely worth the $2.99. As a League of Legends fan (boooo, says everyone...) I've come to use this game to play in queue because Rito Gaems has awful queue times. I've only played two games out of three, but I really, really enjoyed the two. I'm looking forward to completing the third!\n\nHere are many pros of LiEat:\n- Absolutely adorable characters\n- Very immersive story\n- Soundtrack for you\n- The music and game pauses when you minimize the screen/open something else (Perfect if you're waiting in some kind of queue for a MOBA such as League...)\n- Three games in one, little client\n- Quite a bit of replay value if you enjoy the games (100% achievement)\n- There are trading cards, backgrounds, and emoticons!\n- YOU CAN SAVE [B]WHENEVER[/B] YOU WANT\n\n...although, you might want to consider these [b]very few cons[/b]:\n- If you're a fast reader, you're going to get through these games quick. Luckily, as I stated before, there's a lot of replay value if you find this game fun.\n- The game will not full screen, it's a rather small window\n- It's great that you can save whenever you want...but you have to save constantly. You never know if a little lie is gonna wipe the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of your HP leaving you with 20HP...and you've run out of small candies to eat. And then wowie! you have to battle someone else. RIP Leo + Efi.\n\nOverall, this is a game I rate 10/10 because who doesn't love small dragon children?

I've played it enough to know a bit about it. I definitely enjoy the adorable art style of the game and how it was made. It's very well thought out when it comes to the story. For the most part it's about a con man and his dragon girl, Efina. Efina is abnormal compared to the other dragons in the world, as she has a different diet that revolves around, 'lies', lies are physical beings created when a character in the game lies. It's your job to determine which is a lie, and which is the truth.\n\n\nPros:\n-Really fun\n-Adorable\n-Great story, it's super fun to play\n-Characters act human like\n-Entering homes with the space bar instead of just walking in - This feels more natural to me than just walking into some place as if the door automatically opens for you.. I like it more.\n-Features a minor use of the mouse. Not many games do this, I kind of like it.\n\nCons:\n-Issues figuring out some controls, for newer players (like myself)\n-Fighting is a tad bit too easy in the beginning.. - Gets a BIT harder, by introducing something like an eight on two battle..\n-Some issues arise with the music, making it sound kind of.. Troublesome, and problematic to want and listen to. The looping situation isn't all that good, and definitely could've been better.\n-Clunky use of the Fn keys, it's all scattered around.\n-Problems with the FPS change.. Not really made for it\n-Sometimes when holding a button for a full second will cause you to instantly skip text you may have wanted to read..\n-Kind of throws you into the game.. Without instructions\n-English translation is still having some issues, but so far it's getting there, example is at the top.. It doesn't translate well... Or at all in this matter.\n-Really short if you rush\n\nQuestion:\n\n- Why isn't there a WSAD implementation into the game? Alongside the Up, down, left, right arrows? Kind of like Undertale has? It's possible to do..\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow upon further investigation there's a few things not notted that I kind of wish were in the game fully as an, 'option' setting. See, the thing about the options is that they aren't fully labled. They utilize the Fn comands, such as F1, F2, etc. Now, not all are used but I will list the ones that are used. To help newer players figure out how to change around some things. Also not included inside of the game in any way is instructions on how the game plays\n\nKeys that don't do anything:\n- F1\n- F2\n- F3\n- F6\n- F7\n- F9\n- F11\n\nKeys that have use:\n\nF4 - You start with the default screen which can be too small to some users. Or too big. Press it once at the default size, and it'll grow larger. Press it again, it'll become small. Once more and you're back at the default screen size.\n\nF5 - The game itself runs at 60 Frames Per Sec. By default this is the source frames you're going to get to determine how fast the game plays. By pressing it once, the game will lower the FPS to 30 Frames Per Sec. Pressing again will lower it to 15 FPS. If you press it again, the game will bring it back up to 60 FPS, and it'll be the default speed.\n\nF8 - If you don't use the default FPS setting made by Steam to determine how many frames you're on. The game has a built in FPS counter that's VERY accurate. It works the same as the default FPS setting in Steam, and is just as accurate.\n\nF10 - If you HATE the default screen sizes and would rather play it in full screen, the game can be played in full screen by pressing F10. The resolution isn't bad, but it looks a bit better and makes it easier to see when using it.. Not sure why this key wasn't binded to the same one as F4. But, it still helps if you want it, just press F10 to go out of full screen.\n\nF12 - By default Steam utilizes a screenshot mechanic that allows you to capture games, this is useful if you wanna screenshot it.\n\nESC/X/Backspace - The escape key, X key and the Backspace button are all used to open your menu, this will allow you to swap items and view other things in your inventory.\n\nSpace Bar - Allows you to go through text, press it and it'll go to the next screen.\n\nUP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrow keys - All used for movement. Different from the WSAD movement, this game uses that.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSo if I was to rate the game as a game developer himself, I'd give at at least a 9.5/10. Now, I'm not one to call games out on what they are and if they have issues. But upon reading reviews, this is supposedly the first game made by this indie dev. It's a REALLY nice game despite the issues. I definitely enjoy playing it, and so does my lover. I convinced them to get it to play with me, they REALLY like it as well. They notice the issues, but it's definitely not that bad.\n\nI would really recommend the game because it's.. Nice, it's a very fun game, the character designs are interesting. I also should mention that there's use of drawn out scenes, which might I add are absolutely great to look at, it fits well and expresses differences in the characters. There was a use of one scene where one of the character's hair was blowing in the wind, and I thought it looked great. Overall. It's fun, it's clunky, but it's really nice. \n\nIf you want a game that's short, but has a nice background to it, with interesting characters, adorable moments, some weird moments, and extra stuff to it, I definitely reccomend it.\n\nNow, this is mostly a review from someone who has played only the first part out of three, but.. I can tell this is worth it by how much time I'm spending just playing it. Try not to rush the dialogue, or else you'll miss out on where you need to go. There ARE some spots.. Where you have to figure out where to go on your own, but it isn't too hard, search all the houses you know that characters are in, you'll find the next spot you need to go. Make sure to talk to them to get more dialogue. \n\nRemember, this is only a standpoint of me currently, and I don't think you'll be disappointed. The game is definitely worth more than $2.99. To me at least, it could be at least $3.99, but.. $2.99 for this game is a steal nonetheless. If it was longer I'd say bump it more, but I really hope this dev comes out with even more content in the future and continues to update and create a better translation to the game. \n\nTL;DR\nGame is great, read above for controls, definitely is different and it's really fun.", "timestamp_created": 1459377695, "timestamp_updated": 1459382688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22150355": {"recommendationid": "22150355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202165754", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511549414}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game triology <3\nIt's kawaii, funny and interesting!\nThe pictures and gifs (are that gifs?) are nice designed and are fitting good!\nThe music is great!!!\nThe fights are, well, ok.

The Characters, story, and gameplay was so good I played the till I got all the achievements, Pictures, and videos\nI recommend This game for anyone who likes a good story, Characters, and Fun Gameplay.\nIf i Could Compare This to Anygame It would Be Undertale although There is know 4th wall breaking", "timestamp_created": 1458587698, "timestamp_updated": 1458587698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21939905": {"recommendationid": "21939905", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972770844", "num_games_owned": 2069, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476507978}, "language": "english", "review": "Looking around my steam library i somehow sumbled on this.

The main characters, Efi and Theo, have an interesting relationship, the nature of which starts mysterious and becomes more clear over the course of the three chapters in a very satisfying way. While fairly short, each chapter has new character graphics (Theo and Efi recieve makeovers) and multiple endings to find. It took me a couple of hours for each chapter, playing casually and exploring.\n\nA note about the gameplay: The game utilizes JRPG style battles which are quick and easy to win. In my estimation, the battles are not there to present a challenge but rather to support the central conceit of the game ([spoiler]Efi causes lies to manifest in the real world, which she then eats.[/spoiler]) without getting in the way of the storytelling. If you only enjoy video games that challenge, then you should be warned to approach this one with a more open mind or to move on to something else.\n\nI definitely recommend this game for it's original story, great characters, and adorable yet dark aesthetic.", "timestamp_created": 1458376624, "timestamp_updated": 1458376624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21916076": {"recommendationid": "21916076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242900506", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468899760}, "language": "english", "review": "Omg I have chosen a very good game for my frist RPG game.

an inspiration to me. The art, character designs and soundtrack are amazing, and I love the concept of it all though the story leaves room for a lot of mystery (there is a novel preceding the games that I have yet to read though; I imagine some insight lies there). \n\nEach game takes roughly an hour or less if you know what you're doing, or just bumrush through, but if you like poking every useless nook and cranny (or staring at character portraits endlessly like I do), then tack on another hour. I would like to iterate that because this game has a strong focus on story, the RPG elements are very easy--don't play this expecting there to be challenging fights or anything (especially if you get the op gear), and the only reason you might need to grind for levels is to get the good ending in one instance.\n\nI first played this series when it was still being tweaked, so I missed out on the cutscenes and bonus rooms, which make it all the more charming! Sure, a quick search on google can get you a free download, but I really encourage supporting this wonderful developer. If you're interested in other works by them, they have a horror game called Alice Mare, as well as a recent release (of 2015), 1BitHeart.\n\nAlso Neil and Teo are mY WAIFUS PLEASE DON'T HURT THEM AAAAA. ;www;\n(LOOKING @ U CYRIL. idk you're both still kinda shippable though.)", "timestamp_created": 1458167444, "timestamp_updated": 1473123584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21874838": {"recommendationid": "21874838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073434257", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458168994}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is cute.\n\nThe game is split into 3 seperate games in the same world. It's an rpg about a mysterious con man and his little dragon girl, Efina, who has the ability to eat people's lies. They live in a world inhabited by \"dragons\" and they go from town to town solving problems acting as detectives( since Efina is basically a lie detector), all the while the man sells info for cash. Humans and dragons have a rough relationship with eachother. Dragons are sometimes seen as slaves, however they are allowed to be in positions of power and allowed to live among humans.\nThe \"dragons\" in this game aren't dragons in the traditional sense. They are still born from eggs and each can breath fire, but they are human in appearance and each is born from wishes. They each have a special ability based off of the nature of the wish.\n\nThe characters in this game are likable enough. The con man, who gets several diferent names throughout, is your typical rogue with a heart of gold who still wants to help people but usually at a price. He tells lies, but with good intentions. Efina is a cute, naive, dragon-girl who sees the con man as her father. Her power is to eat lies as mentioned above. She wants to help her father stop lying one day.\nThe side characters are mostly just there for world building and to help Efina understand her powers. There's the police force captain, Captain Neill, who is also a dragon and he is just your generic captain who is stern and helps people. The vice captain, Brett (also a dragon), is a little more angsty and hates humans. Each game has its own set of characters for that game's story obviously. \n\nThe art style is consistant and cute. It's pixel art with a chibi look to it and It's styalized in a sort of fancy gothic way. Everything has a dark outline and it's just nice to look at. The two main character get diferent outfits for each story and they fit pretty well with where they are. The music is pleasant and fits with the setting. However, it's not very memorable by itself. There is also a problem with the music and the cutscenes. When a custscene plays the music will often just stay the same or keep playing even as the cutscene is happening. So something might be happening in the cutscene but the music doesn't help portray it very well.\n\nThere is also something to be said about the rpg elements. You get the basic stuff (switching items, leveling, looting, etc.), and you fight enemies. But the enemies aren't random encounters, they often just appear as you progress the plot. There are enemies that you can fight over and over however to level up. But there really isn't much need to, as you just get the levels you need during the story anyway. You get rewarded with money from winning battles. But as far as I can tell, there is nothing to use the money on so it's ultimately pointless.\n\nThe game isn't very difficult and is more just about the story. There are multiple endings to each game depending on what you do. To get each ending you just have to do one or two things diferently. There is a detective element as mentioned above, where you have to figure out wether lies are actually lies or if they are the truth, but there really isn't a punishment for guessing wrong so you can just guess until you get the right answer. You can also just find items by looking around that can make you completely overpowered to futher drop the difficulty. \n\nThe game is also very short. Each story can be beat in just under two hours at most. You could probably get a little bit more time out of it to get all the endings and achievments, but you just need to use an old save to do that unless you want to play through it again.\n\nHonestly though it's an alright game for the price. Short and sweet, not to difficult, and just plain cute. It does have flaws just mechanically but nothing that gets in the way.

It's my first time writing one. I usually avoid it, but I fell so deeply in love with this game that I just had to write a review. \n\nSecondly, this game is beautiful. The art, the soundtrack, the STORY! Everything just mesmerized me. Okay I have to admit, during the beginning half of the first \"chapter\" I was kind of reluctant about this game. But when the plot actually kicked into gear, I just kind of...fell in love. Hard. \n\nThird, let me just emphasize the story. It's great. I don't want to give spoilers away, but the ending truly touched me. Seriously though I wanted to just cry a lil when I saw the neutral and the good ending. I felt like I suddenly joined an army of LiEat lovers. I want fanart and fanfics of Leo and Efina! Although very certainly in this case, Incest is not wincest. Please. Don't do that to me.\n\nIn all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's worth $2.99. It really is. Although it's short, it's sweet.

During these chapters they'll come across challenges that ends up with having to to do some detective work, which results in going into battle to eat the lies in people's alibis. Along the way they'll be some recurring characters you'll learn more about and about the world around you. I'll try to keep this short and as spoiler-free as possible.\n\n[b] The story [/b]\nThe story, having three chapters, is actually a lot shorter than most RPGs. Each chapter has about the length of one short story, and yet is still capable of keeping you wanting to know what comes next in the further chapters. All while the story goes on, the game manages to inform you about the world and characters without falling into the pit of having too many exposition dumps. I mean, sure, they do have some, but doesn't all games at least have a few?\n\n[b] The characters [/b]\nThe characters are another big part of the game, giving the recurring characters life and background quickly, and still giving you immersion. Most of the characters are quite endearing, and has some quirky trait to make them stand out. I would agree that the game does have some holes in certain supporting characters, but these characters usually last only as long as the chapter.\n\n[b] The mechanics [/b]\nThe battles and mechanics are very barebone, with nothing special about them. In fact, most of the battles are just ways to move the story(thanks to all the enemies being physical manifestations of lies, and beating means said lie-eating dragon eats them). This doesn't mean the combat is bad, however. It's just very average and short-lived. Although the lack of grinding or needing a good strategy can be a bonus if you are more interested into the story rather than combat.\n\n[b] The soundtrack [/b]\nThe soundtrack is actually pretty good to listen to as well, espcially if you enjoy the sort of piano-and-bell sort of music. Add the fact that the most recent update to this game has let you listen to them through steam's music player makes the sounds track another bonus to this game.\n\n[b] Side notes [/b]\nHere I'll be listing some bonus points, in case you care. The endings are mostly there to set yourself up to see the next chapter, but saying anything more would risk spooling the game. There's also bad endings, but luckily, you won't automatically run into them so long as you don't do something stupid like run into a back alley in the middle of the night. I also enjoyed the achievements, especially the ones that shame you for taking items that don't do anything out of people's houses just for the sake of taking them. And yes, there are trading cards. \nAdd this all together at a price of about 3 dollars, and you've got a good game.\n\n[b] A list for the lazy people [/b]\n\nPros\n-Good story\n-Endearing characters\n-Good soundtrack\n-Trading cards\n-Cheap price \n-Funny achievements \n\nCons\n-Bland combat system\n-Relatively short story, won't last as long as more expensive RPGs\n\nI'd recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs with good stories, and have a few bucks to spare for it.", "timestamp_created": 1457539545, "timestamp_updated": 1457559898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497122", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21728307": {"recommendationid": "21728307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058444820", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474790580}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u3092\u9023\u308c\u307e\u308f\u3059\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "timestamp_created": 1457530773, "timestamp_updated": 1457530773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465407", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21726594": {"recommendationid": "21726594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074201403", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495053120}, "language": "english", "review": "Endearing.", "timestamp_created": 1457523801, "timestamp_updated": 1511770341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492284", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21725625": {"recommendationid": "21725625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001696425", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457496885}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story, kind of short but theres all 3 games in this version. really loved the animations and music.", "timestamp_created": 1457518967, "timestamp_updated": 1457518967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469634", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21725056": {"recommendationid": "21725056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092560082", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479507916}, "language": "english", "review": "Instead of being a jumpscare RPG (as Japanese always do), LiEat comes with three simple but beautiful stories.\n\nEasy controlling as a Japanese RPG maker game.

Well, imagine you come across \u201cLeo,\u201d a caretaker, and \u201cEfina,\u201d a demon who is a lie detector, nourishing herself by eating lies. You would probably be in a rather awkward position, wouldn\u2019t you say?\n\nLiEat is a rich story /JRPG game where you play \u201cEfina\u201d and her caretaker in three very well written short stories (LiEat I, II and III). Leo is essentially a con artist who is selling information from one town to the next and keeps changing his name and appearance all the time. Efina was born from a dragon egg; she has the appearance a four year-old child but she is only two months old. She call Leo (Hal, Theo, Albert and god knows what) \u201cPapa\u201d (father) due to the fact that he has raised her since she hatched. \n\nIn each location they visit, they will be faced with strange events, will investigate them and aim to find all the culprits. You will interact with interesting characters in each of the stories and even have the ability to read their bio\u2019s at the end of each episode. I like that, as it really reinforces the thoughts behind all the characters in their journey. \nThere is a combat phase, which is not the big aspect of this game; it is easy and provides you with a little bit of respite between the reading stages. \n\nThe Pixel graphics lent the game a nostalgic feel, reminding me of playing on my colour Gameboy. Some people may find the low resolution a bit of an issue but all I can say is, do not worry about it. Great price point, only $2.99 for practically three games. No voice over in this game, however the soundtrack is good. \n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tThree short and rich stories \n-\tInteresting characters\n-\tNice Pixel graphics\n-\tAchievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tCombat phase could have been better\n\nLiEat series are well written and enjoyable to play (mostly reading).  Whether you already like this genre or have not yet been introduced to it, I recommend this series.\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

You never if they contain reasons or ugliness.\"\n\nMade with the freeware WOLF RPG Maker and translated to english by vgperson, hits LiEat now the Steam store bundled up with all the three stories into one big game.\n\nThe game is divided into three stories taking inspiration from folklore and bedtime tales where you play as the dynamic duo  featuring a big time liar and con man Leo/Hal/Sid and his trusty young dragon companion Efi, wandering from town to town, gathering information and eating lies, Efi's dragon power. \nThese games focus on a pecculiar form of detective work that could be envisioned as a fullblown franchise if it got developed even more, although cut low since it's by one guy. \n\nBearing joyful plots and the use of it's inspirational sources, not only strikes LiEat on the writing of the world, but of the characters.\nSee, the two main protagonists here are on their own fleshed out quite good, dipping it's toes into terriories like on how being different, the xenophomic nature held up to a more leviated species, conflict of how to lie for a just cause and show that individuals either a different breed, line of work, interest and stances should't trace back to the majority because the lack of contexts of action. \nThe true nature of lying as a crux can show how far these things can stretch before guilt manifests and swallow one whole on various levels, which is why it's interesting to see several of the characters makes up their own reasons by protecting somebody they love in almost all the instances of the series. LiEat is a nice spin on fronting, even enforcing truth in this by implementing that core element.\n\n\nThis isn't the only anchor point, but the distinguising artstyle using spesific coloring sets to separate the stories from one another along the semi minimal moe Final Fantasy-esque drawings displayed through either still images, animations or pixels. This isn't bad, as a matter of fact the creator must've known the doodliness works effectively here compared to his other art pieces (see KADOKAWA and v flower project).\nCharacter designs are indeed good looking, however I cannot say it goes along with the environment cus the bits limit. It does however act lively, rich and blooming. Too bad this got killed due to the indoor enclosements in both II and III. \n\n\nAlbeit an interesting detective fantasy RPG game, it's a working mess. \nI know from past experiences with the same engine that they're heavily scripted as well as ment to drive the plot from point to point exploration and dialogue exchangement (mainly notable in LiEat III). \nThere's other things lacking like an options menu for resolutions and fullscreen, even though the F4 and F10  buttons would do that for you, but it would be nice to have a volume control incase you want to listen to something else than the great loopy BGM.\n\nSpeaking of sound, the tracks aren't the casual midi chiptunes pumped into a low functioning rpg game, but it sure hurts listening to the orchestra through on stereo.

The weight on the text and the character avatar presented thus making it feeling overwhelmingly unscaled.\n\nThe game finishes in multiple endings, and whenever completed, the player will be treated with a gallery as a reward featuring short bios of characters, the BGM you can mess around with, and gallery frames of still images and animations from the story for viewing leisure.\n\nAdditional Steam bonuses like easy-to-get achievements and trading cards comes with, but if you want to experience the games without supporting Miwashiba's chibi gothic adventures, then see here: http://www.vgperson.com/games/lieat.htm\n\nI'm not gonna lie, it's not a bad game overall spite the complaints, but goddamn is it a functional cluster.

Al princio del juego, te daras cuenta que Efi, no solo es una ni\u00f1a, si no un dragon el cual, es de n tipo de especie que come mentiras, lo cual, hace un poco mas interesante y compleja la trama, hay tres finales, los cuales, son totalmente gratificantes.\n\nLiEat, mas que ser un juego para hardcores de RPG's, es una muy buena aventura para jugadores nuevos en el genero, es muy facil, aunque divertido a la vez, las mismas graicas le dan vida al juego en general, y la musica ni se diga, totalmente hermosa :3\n\nPros:\n\n-Tiene cromos\n-Bunea historia\n-Excelente musica\n-Muy sencillo, disfrutable y casual\n-El precio es bastante accesible (apenas 35 pesos mexicanos)\n-Es totalmente rejugable, pues hay varios finales, mas los logros!\n\ncontras:\n\n-Tal vez pudo ser un poco mas largo\n-Hubiera sido de mucha ayuda incluir el idioma espa\u00f1ol, pues puuede que se le dificulte a algunas personas agarrarle el hilo a la trama.\n\nEstos 2 puntos negativos, no son completamente malos, hay que entender que es un juego indie, por lo tanto, no tiene el dinero como para agregar mas idiomas o efectos.\n\nDe todos modos, es un indie rpg muy recomendable, y accesible para nuevos en el genero.\n\nGracias :3\n", "timestamp_created": 1457066331, "timestamp_updated": 1457066331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516830", "comment_count": 0,

That being said, the game is still quite enjoyable since it's really relaxing but still gives you the feeling you actually have to do something to progess instead of just clicking and sometimes making a choice like most visual novels.\n\nThe story is divided into three arcs each considered their own game, making it a trilogy. While it certainly doesn't deliver the most depth, the lovely characters manage to pull you into their world and make you want to unweave the mysteries and see the solving. There are multiple endings to each arc based on your decisions and the key parts of the story are beautifully illustrated/animated. \n\nAnother part about the game that really stuck out to me was the music. Every arc has it's own set of 10 themes and most of them became stuck in my head at first listen. Not only is the soundtrack diverse and catchy, it's also always perfectly fitting the current mood, enhancing the atmosphere in every situation.\n\nEach arc of the LiEat trilogy takes about 1-2 hours depending on how fast you read and how meticulous you search for hidden stuff.

The RPG combat elements are really only there to help lend a sense of player involvement in the story, and, as crappy as they honestly are, they serve their purpose well enough. The main appeal here is story, and let me tell you, it's quite good.\n\nThe game itself is very mystery-focused, and you'll find yourself feeling sort of like a detective as you try to uncover what's happening and which characters are the culprits of various crimes in each of the three episodes. While the mysteries are nothing mind-bogglingly ingenious, and it can be unclear at times where you need to go, they're generally well put together and suit the overarching theme of the game very well.\n\nThe characters are truly charming, especially the two main characters, who (amusingly) kind of serve as foils to each other.

But that's not a bad thing, since the monsters aren't a challange in the first place. The game runs smooth, with no hiccups, aside from the text glitch, but that's easy fix. The artstyle feels handdrawn, with little animations here and there that are very nice. The music isn' amazing, but it fits with the atmosphere, and I would buy a digital soundtrack & artbook if they ever released it.", "timestamp_created": 1456828234, "timestamp_updated": 1456828234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500936", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21561713": {"recommendationid": "21561713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064071854", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457028352}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.\nWould spend more money on trading cards than game again.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1456827378, "timestamp_updated": 1456827378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21561052": {"recommendationid": "21561052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221439684", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486969721}, "language": "spanish", "review": "TOTALMENTE RECOMENDADO.\n\nLiEat (Un juego de palabras entre Lie y Eat (Mentira y comer respectivamente) Posiblemente no te pueda ofrecer muchas horas de juego (la primera parte la pase en hora y media, y eso, porque no sabia como avanzar en la historia) Pero sin duda es un buen juego para pasar el rato, con una banda sonora bien elaborada que te hara vivir cada momento del juego como se debe. \n\nLos 36 pesos que yo inverti en este juego me han dejado satisfecho con una historia muy interesante (o asi lo veo yo).

I love these two characters and loved how they were put togeather and why they were (No Spoilers Here ;) ) Each episode is about 30 minutes to an hour long and can be difficult to solve some of the puzzles for people who are new to puzzles in games or are terrible with puzzles (Like Me). The story of the whole series becomes pretty straightforward but still gives a few clues, hints, or secrets to reveal about the characters' backgrounds or part of the story.\n\nThe downside to this game is that their are not a lot of environments. For example, the first episode takes place in a single town and a small section outside the enterance. This also includes a single alley way that had more to do with the story than more than half of the houses in the town that had less than five citizens. The rest of the episodes are relatively the same when it comes to the number of environments and characters.\n\nOverall, this game is one of the cutest RPGs that I have ever played the downside to this game is that it does not include a lot of content which is its downside.

If you're a fan of such games as Ib, The Witch's House, Alice Mare then LiEat is probably a game meant for you. Although it isn't quite horror oriented other than for mild body horror, it is a very story-driven game, which focuses on two main characters, a con artist named who goes by many names and a dragon girl named Efina.\n\nThere are 30 Steam achievements for this game, most of which can be found on your first playthrough if you're looking everywhere and talking to each character. Such dedication is rewarded with not only more information about our main characters and their history, but also different items, some of which make our heroes nigh impossible to defeat. As it might be evident of my high play time I sought out all achievements and replayed each chapter at least 30 times due to just wanting to explore on my own and uncover secrets without helpful guidances. However, getting the last few achievements proved to be quite difficult, so if you get stuck, be sure to look up vgperson's site, who translated this game, along with many other.\n\nThe graphics are adorable and the pixel portraits are very nicely done, so those who enjoy 2D pixelated graphics will definitely enjoy the game. The soundtrack is nice as well, it never seemed to get on my nerves or annoy me after listening to the music for hours upon hours. LiEat knows how to create atmosphere, whether it is to make things silly or horrifyingly dreadful, something which can definitely be experienced throughout the chapters, especially in the last one.\n\n[b]TL:DR;[/b] If we want to go by Funhaus Spoole's view on the worth of games, which is 1 Dollar 1 Hour, aka if you pay one dollar that equals one hour of gameplay, then buying LiEat gives you more than enough content over 3 hours.

Instead, I'll hazard to say that LiEat (I, II, and III) doesn't pander at all. Instead, the developer focused on bringing us a solid and well written story. The story itself isn't anything amazing, and often, the mysteries solve themselves in the first act. However, what really kept it interesting were the characters. The characters are endearing, mysterious, and funny.\n\nThe game includes 3 Chapters. Each has multiple endings. The first two chapters each took me about 1.5 hours, and the last one stumped me for a bit when I couldn't get the Good Ending.\n\nThe BGM are great and sets the mood as well. \n\nI highly recommend this to anyone looking to play a short game with memorable characters. Just don't expect this game to last you any more than 5 hours tops.\n\nEDIT: Also, any achievement that includes Ranma 1/2 is gold in my book: Happosai~!", "timestamp_created": 1456639189, "timestamp_updated": 1456639472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790451", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21514430": {"recommendationid": "21514430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190852334", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456648353}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoyable and leisure game.", "timestamp_created": 1456628753, "timestamp_updated": 1456628753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496580", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21512014": {"recommendationid": "21512014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066496648", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484899483}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego simple y corto, pero es solo una escusa para contar una historia.\nEste juego te presenta personajes entra\u00f1ables y misteriosos, conceptos muy sorprendentes y un mundo simple, pero que se siente real.\nUno de mis juegos favoritos, que recomiendo de coraz\u00f3n, y no es una mentira.", "timestamp_created": 1456618892, "timestamp_updated": 1509508918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21510981": {"recommendationid": "21510981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071871285", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456967917}, "language": "english", "review": "Text goes off screen and makes me cry\n\nstill good tho\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1456615156, "timestamp_updated": 1456615156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453928", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21510147": {"recommendationid": "21510147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184853715", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472371771}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing game.

It's a bit of a short game, only taking me about two hours to complete each of the games, but with the small price as much is to be expected. It can be at time creepy, but it's not really a horror game, so if you're looking for your usual RPGMaker Horror game, you won't exactly be crapping your pants every other scene, if that means anything to you.\n\nI think that this is one of those games where saying anything huge about the story is something of a spoiler, but to generalize it, the story follows a stoic young man and a happy dragon-girl that he come across not long before the first game, and each of the games follow the same pair, despite physical properties somewhat shifting. It's a bit odd, if the concept interests you even slightly, though, I think you won't be disappointed.\n\nOf course, you probably don't need me to spell it out to you, but if you're looking for strong gameplay, you should look elsewhere. The normal battles all pretty much play out the same, and the bosses only require an ever-so-slight amount of thought to actually beat. This isn't a gameplay based game, of course, this is only there to add the experience slightly.\n\nBasically, do you like story games? If yes, and you have a three bucks lying around (And really, who doesn't?), then I highly reccomend giving this game a try. If you're cold and heartless, a free version of the three games can be found on it's website, but it's obvious that Miwashiba worked very hard on this game, so don't be stingy and just give up the pocket change, believe me, it's worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1456537122, "timestamp_updated": 1456603708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532697", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21487326": {"recommendationid": "21487326", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974745397", "num_games_owned": 634, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456507714}, "language": "english", "review": "Every now and then a game comes along as something more of an experience worth being a part of rather than something to 'beat.' LiEat falls squarely in that realm with it's low asking price and unique charm. \n\nThe story isn't anything complicated that you'll need to sit and think about, and there isn't any powergaming to worry about. LiEat simply exists as a platform to tell a unique story that I think many people would get some joy out of. \n\nThere are minor RPG elements in the game, but really more than anything they only exist to carry the story to it's conclusion. There are multiple endings to the chapters, and some extra achievements and scenes to unlock if you're a bit of a completionist. In the end, however, LiEat is something worth taking your time with and simply enjoying rather than looking for the quickest way to get to the next stage.\n\nThe spritework and CG art are absolutely phenomenal, and the small bits of animation here and there breath a lot of life into the characters and the world around them. The music only further adds to this. \n\nAll in all go into LiEat with an open mind. I think most people will find it worth their time to play.

Each individual title is a mystery-horror set in a fantastical world where anthropomorphized animals and humans live. Aside from this there exist the rare \"dragon\" who are human in appearance but have horns and the ability to use magical powers. You take control of the party of the main character who changes his name and appearance in every game and her small lie-eating dragon Efina. Each game takes place in a different small location and presents a different situation and presents a different \"mystery\" to our characters with small touches of horror. The main character is a con man who uses Efina to get information out of people and then use it to sell to interested parties among other frauds, while Efina is just an almost newborn dragon who follows the main character everywhere. In each story we meet a colorful cast of characters, including some recurring ones that will shed some light into our main character's enigmatic past. While each story is self-conclusive and mostly unrelated to previous one playing in order is advised.\n\nThe gameplay is minimal in LiEat, there are RPG battles every now and then but they are pathetically easy and almost impossible to lose. You get a large stock of healing items found throughout the map and three sets of equipment (stronger weapons, armor and overpowered weapons), nothing carries over from one game to another but every equipment and item is laughably easy to obtain. There are multiple endings (bad, neutral and good/true) in each game with varying requisites but they don't add a lot of replayability since the requirements are simple and usually involve following a set of events in a certain order. At the end of each game you can access a bonus room with galleries, music player and character info which is nice. The games are REALLY short too, each story lasts roughly 45 minutes so the entire trilogy can be beat in 2-3 hours.\n\nThe game sports a pretty distinctive art style in both pixel art and event images. Each game has a motif color (red, blue and gold respectively) and character designs are pretty charming and cute. LiEat I&II have been updated to match the third game and now also have short animated cutscenes at key events. The music is nice, nothing that I would listen to outside of the game but suits the mood and is nice to hum while playing.\n\nLiEat is not the biggest masterpiece of story telling but I found each story charming and fascinating on their own. The freeware versions of each game are still available for download in many languages, so paying for the Steam version is pretty much just supporting the authors and getting the knick-knacks of achievements and trading cards.

allowed outside during the day.... jee I wonder...\n\nif you don't want to waste time fighting then pick up the overpowered weapons hidden somewhere in the one stage you get per game to jump your

It's a \"story-based\" game, which is to say, the \"game\" aspect is merely a vehicle for literally everything else. It's technically a Japanese-style RPG, but the battles are a mere formality; combat rarely amounts to more than holding down the Confirm key until they end, with very little strategy except in rare situations, and even those can be circumvented entirely if you're of the mind and find the right items. I'm normally averse to these sorts of titles, a firm believer that a game that doesn't focus at least in part on its gameplay is a waste of a game, but LiEat appropriately made a liar out of me, and my annoyance with that fact is matched only by my gladness at being wrong.\n\nI didn't quite know what to expect when getting into this one, but I can say that whatever I could have guessed it was would've been wrong with room to spare; LiEat is surreal, strange, sometimes creepy, sometimes silly, yet consistently, if I have to admit it, charming. Developer Miwashiba uses each \"game\" to tell a tale of the ongoing travels of a humanoid dragon child who subsists off of the lies of the others, and her cynical, conniving, big fat liar of a caretaker, as they travel the land in search of the world's most valuable commodity: information. Our liar's muddy morality and views on the world are intriguing, and his foil is one of the most legitimately delightful child characters in any work of fiction I've encountered; rather than being smarter or tougher than you could legitimately expect her to be, she's reactive, naive, and even a little dense, yet without being grating, and while she's hyper-idealized, I'm willing to bet you're not going to care. I swear that if I didn't know my own kid wouldn't be the most insufferable thing ever just to spite me, I'd want one just for the off chance it turned out something like her.\n\nThis is all conveyed well by translator and localizer vgperson's mostly enjoyable interpretation of the games' quirky dialogue, the writing of which is consistently engaging and thematic. Like its plot, the original score is unusual, yet enjoyable, the setting is foreboding, yet inviting, the characters are mysterious and enigmatic -- save for one mentioned above  --  and the plot isn't fully explained. Rather than fall prey to being confusing as a result, though, the whole thing ends up interesting, and every interaction teaches you more about LiEat's strange world and its inhabitants, which is impressive given that each of the three extremely short games take place in one area each. There's little exploration, no adventuring, and no questing; you're presented with a self-contained mystery to solve, and the game is over as soon as the case is closed. Each game features at least one bad ending, and one \"real\" ending, and after the latter, you either move onto the next game after a visit to a gallery room, or run out of games.\n\nThe result is probably unlike anything you've come across, even among the independent scene. There's no soapbox for it to climb upon, no deep, hidden meaning for people to form a cult around and talk down to others over, no quirky fetishes to pander to, and no nerd culture to propagate; it's just a story of two people and the people they run into, but it was enough to get a couple legitimate laughs out joy out of this grouchy old fart, and again, this isn't even my kind of game.\n\nSo how much is a smile worth? Turns out the best ones are free, but three dollars was a fair price, too.\n\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't think that if you've read this far, you'll agree.\n\n* Note that I'd previously played this game from an alternative source, which is why my total time played is low as of this writing.", "timestamp_created": 1456476332, "timestamp_updated": 1456476481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 166, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866292", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

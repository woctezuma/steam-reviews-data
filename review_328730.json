In each level, he has to fight one or more monsters. The monsters take damage based on the words the player spells out. Those words must be made based on the titles that are available in the tile grid. The titles can be swapped for others if the player gets stuck. Over the course of the game, the player is able to unlock books, potions, weapons, and other items that help them towards the end. All of those items can be upgraded with in-game currency that is earned when beating monsters and levels.\n\nPros:\n- The graphics are cute and smooth.\n- The titles are easy to read, but can be traded out for other options later on.\n- There are multiple save slots.\n- Family friendly.\n- Levels get progressively more challenging.\n- Each level offers four different challenges, which players earn stars for when they beat them.\n\nCons:\n- Some grinding might be necessary in the middle of the game, especially for new players.\n- Only offers story mode, which makes the game lose it's replayability.\n- Upgrading items can take a lot of time.\n- Some achievements can be irritating.\n\nPeople looking for a fun word game will likely have a good time with Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey.

Since the remastered version would be bigger and better, I decided to play this version first lest I'd not want to go backwards and ever play it.  After finishing all of the achievements, I can say that I do recommend playing this game.  The fact that they upgraded it and allow you to have both versions without any extra fees says a lot about the developers, who did a solid job making this game.  \n\nThe gameplay is basically an RPG version of a game like Boggle, where you have a field of letters to work with to spell out various words.  Unlike Boggle the letters don't have to be connected to each other at all.  Each letter has either a single dot, two dots, or three dots on it, which represents the difficulty in using that letter in a word, as well as how much damage it will deal to the enemy.  You go back and forth as they attack you and you hack away at them with what words you spell, with a basic rule of thumb being, the longer the word the more damage you deal.  As you play through the game you will buy upgrades for your character, equipable books that grant various benefits, and selectable weapons that grant a bonus to one aspect of your character.  \n\nIt's kind of an odd idea on face value, but it gives a bit more purpose and development to what can otherwise be a perpetual routine.  Developing your character and making them stronger gives you more of a reason to keep playing as opposed to an arcade style system where you'd just start all over again each time to earn the high score.  After a bit of a learning curve where you feel like you have to grind for a while, you figure out the right pace for replaying earlier levels at higher difficulties for more gems (currency) without having to keep replaying stages to make any progress.  \n\nI think what I enjoyed most about the game as it is designed was the enemies who took damage with multipliers based on certain conditions, such as using letters from a specific part of the board or using certain letters.  It could be a bit annoying sometimes, especially if you weren't given the letter you needed to get the damage multiplier, but there was never a challenge that was too hard to overcome given a bit of grinding or a second attempt with better letter RNG.  For me it just made it so I had to think my moves out a bit more while still trying to get maximal damage, which is far more interesting then only scouring the board for the longest word possible each and every time.\n\nOne troubling area for me was how the game replenishes your letters as you spell out different words.  I wouldn't know whether this is true or not, as it would probably require looking at the programming, but it seemed like I got certain combinations of letters more frequently then not.  I'm no Scrabble pro, but my vocabulary isn't half bad and there were several times that the best words I could spell out were the same.  It took away a degree of replayability when the same combinations of letters and words I could spell kept repeating themselves, despite having 15 letters to work with.\n\nA similar issue applies to the final achievement.  This would only apply to those who bother with achievements, but this game's final achievement was quite a grind to earn.  All you have to do is spell out 3,000 words, but by the time you've finished clearing all of the stages you still have 1,000+ words to work on.  There is certainly some range in that aspect as some people might spell out smaller or larger words or have to grind more if they don't get upgrades that dole out more gems, but I doubt my experience was abnormal.

A core strategy is to find the longest words with the letters like X, Y, Z, Q, K, H, J in them.\n\nBut it would be boring if it was the only approach. Many levels have restrictions. Sometimes you can damage the enemy by writing 4 letter words only, or the words with less than 5 letters. Sometimes you need to finish the word with E to do x7 more damage. There are a lot of these mini restrictions/buffs. It makes the gameplay fun. \n\nYou can buy many upgrades with gems (main currency in this game). You can make your weapon do more damage, regenerate life in battle, take less damage from enemy hits, increase your character's HP, get bonus gems at the end of the level and so on and so on. \n\nThe first several hours is really fun and quite challenging.

Easily worth the small price tag.\n\nDecent little spelling game.  Mostly, you're just making words from the tiles, though there is occasionally a hangman mini-game mixed in.  Each level can be played in four modes:  regular, timed, special challenge and elite.  Timed was usually the hardest for me (I had to try a few times on some of the levels).  The special challenge and elite really aren't that hard, if for no other reason than that you aren't under time pressure.

The heroes have different stats, though I never noticed a compelling reason to use one over another.  Character optimization just doesn't seem necessary.  You can carry a few each of two different potions (one heals and one clears tile debuffs).  But you won't be having conversations, nor do you get any choices that affect the story.    \n\nThe story is told in comics at certain points.  It's fairly lame, doesn't pretend to be anything other than silly, and doesn't get in the way.  I had to go back over the comic while writing this because the story made virtually no impression on me.  Easily forgettable, but similarly forgivable.  \n\nThe dictionary is fairly good, though it's definitely got gaps.

Come on... \n[*]Second, the dictionary does not include common swear words, racial epithets and the like. I was expecting a more clinical, adult approach to language and not omitting them. \n[*]The third, lesser problem are the definitions that the game delivers after submitting a valid word. It's admirable that they tried to implement such a feature, but its execution is very rough. When a word can be both a verb or a noun without context, the verb definition is almost always delivered. And the definitions themselves are often... wonky. Like, really obscure. I'll just leave it at that. But, you know, this doesn't affect gameplay at all. I'm just being grumpy here.

Your job is to come along for the ride and use some fancy words to get your way out of difficult situations. Better the vocabulary, better the chance of you winning and sometimes it really isn't as easy as it looks.\n\nHonestly, at first glance it looks like a bit of a childish game due to the animation and bulky look of menus, playable blocks and just the general idea that follows this, but it's honestly perfect for all ages as a casual puzzler to lay back with and get yourself really thinking to try and get passed certain levels. \n\nI enjoy that the difficulty is set in the middle somewhere - Not punishing, and not dead easy. It's pesky in mini-boss fights as well as certain levels (Also hard levels), while not being impossible to get through. It makes winning feel rewarding and for a game to get that right, it has a lot of brownie points from me from the get-go.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] Cute, smoothly animated, nicely cartoony, all round really nice.\n\n[b]Soundtrack:[/b] Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the soundtrack to the levels, menu etc. However, it does tend to grate a bit after a decent amount of play time as there isn't enough variations to how it sounds. I found myself turning the music down if not nearly completely off after the 3 hour mark hit as that was my limit.\n\n[b]Menu:[/b] Isn't really much of one, but for what there is of it; it's nicely set-up, easy and simple enough for anyone of any age to navigate around.\n\n[b]Final Conclusion:[/b] Wonderful little blend of RPG and a family favorite (e.g Scrabble/Boggle/etc), It blends together really nicely for a game that can be enjoyed by anyone of any age.

It has the same basic build-words-to-attack mechanic as Bookworm Adventures, but I still feel that that title was more accessible and enjoyable.\n\nThe protagonist Grimm here feels quite weak in the beginning, and a few levels into the game the difficulty spikes, requiring upgrades to be purchased to progress further. This is unfortunate, as I feel the game could have added a number of extra quests without much effort to give a feel of constant progress.  Instead it felt like I was constantly retreading old ground on a grind quest to earn gems. This is where it becomes quite obvious that the title was a mobile port (gems = in-app purchases).\n\nAlso, as the difficulty increases, the special debuff/damage tiles begin to clutter the board early on.  That gets a bit frustrating to deal with, especially with the quantity thrown onto the board in one turn.  I do believe their presence helps make the game a bit more dynamic, but this could have been tweaked a bit, along with the aforementioned difficulty spike.\n\nDespite those concerns, I still feel the game is easily worth a few bucks and is a good casual game to pass the time. It seems the developers have been cool about updating the game and listening to customer concerns, so that is a plus.\n\nOne thing I'd personally suggest to the developers is to fix the fiddly way that the 'Help' button needs to be pressed to find out what a special tile is, or what the current quest is, or stats and other info.  This is where 'tooltips' would be useful.  Hovering the mouse over an item for a second or two could display relevant information somewhere on the screen.  Also, easier navigation with the keyboard would be welcome.\n\nOther than those concerns, I feel this is a pretty nice effort overall.\n\nP.S.

Longer words and rarer letters make for more damage, and you go back and forth until either you or the enemy falls over. Simple enough. I'm a big fan of that genre (what few games exist for it, anyway), but unfortunately, this game doesn't really do the genre justice.\n\nThis game is a lot easier than Bookworm Adventures or Word Realms, though. For one, you have a massive hand of tiles (20 at once!), so it's not at all hard to spell words. Second, enemies rarely do anything especially bad to you\u2014they do sometimes mess with your tiles, but none of the things they do to you are particularly problematic. You can purchase all kinds of numerical upgrades (increased health, increased damage, etc.); some of the challenge missions basically aren't possible until you do this, but that's more due to strange enemy design than due to actual challenge. Also, letters don't have specific point values, but instead are just ranked into three tiers. This makes it easy to spell words that score decently high, but it also means that there isn't much reward for using really obscure letters.\n\nOnce you beat a level, you'll have to go back over it three more times, with different rules each time. There's a time trial, which is exactly what it sounds like. There's a challenge level, which either beefs up the enemies or puts restrictions on what kinds of letters you can use. And there's a \"crystal star\" level, which is where the real gameplay happens; in crystal star levels, different enemies have different attributes that actually affect what words you can or should use against them (one might take extra damage from words beginning with a vowel, and one might be only damaged by words that involve letters from the corner of your grid). Crystal star levels are actually fun, since the different monsters feel different and are more than just blocks of tofu for you to spell words at. (Outside of the crystal star levels, the monsters feel very, very similar\u2014they might do slightly different attacks to you, but they don't feel differentiated from each other at all.)\n\nAs far as presentation goes, the game feels half-assed. The music is awful, the graphics are boring (the monsters are all basically recolors of the same five or six sprites, and they aren't even animated), and while you're not playing this game for a gripping plot, even the paper-thin story is lackluster. This game lives and dies on the gameplay (which isn't really a bad thing, since the gameplay is the most important part of any game, but still), since it doesn't really do anything to make itself pretty.\n\nOverall, this game's only real strength is the price. If you're looking for a word-combat game that actually feels well-made, you're better off playing Word Realms. If you've already beaten Word Realms and Bookworm Adventures and just want something else in the genre, this game will keep you amused for a couple hours, but it won't reinvent your world in any sense.

Wir spielen den Sensenmann Grimm der sich ne Pizza bestellt und abholen will. Dazu gibts noch 5 (bzw. mit 100 % nen sechstes) Comicbild. Die Grafik ist im Cartoonstil und die Gegner wirken eher harmlos und  niedlich. Aber um Story und Grafik geht es hier eig. auch nicht.\n\nErstmal muss ich hier sagen, dass ich nen ziemlicher \"Deutschfan\" bin. Ich schreibe gerne Texte (insbesondere Reviews *hust*). Man muss sich m\u00f6glichst lange W\u00f6rter suchen, um den Gegner zu erwischen. Es hat mir viel Spa\u00df gemacht, da ich oft dann pl\u00f6tzlich eine \"Erleuchtung\" bekam, und dann lange W\u00f6rter wie \"Waitress\" oder \"October\" gefunden hatte. W\u00e4hrend der Anfang recht einfach ist, wird es sp\u00e4ter schnell schwieriger, wenn man nicht trainieren geht und alte Level wiederspielt. Insbesondere die Zeitaufgaben(Schaffe ein Level in einer bestimmten Zeit) h\u00e4tte ich ohne Buch wohl nicht immer geschafft. Buch?\nJa, mit gefundenen Edelsteinen lassen sich Upgrades kaufen, Waffen und B\u00fccher, welche auflevelbar sind. Dazu noch viel Anderes n\u00fctzliches Zeug. \n\nGelegentlich habe ich auch einfach mal rumgeklickt, in der Hoffnung ein Wort zu finden. Oft stie\u00df ich dabei auf Abk\u00fcrzungen. Hierbei ist es auch cool, dass man nachgucken kann, was das Wort bedeutet.\nAuch ist das Spiel leider nur auf Englisch verf\u00fcgbar, was ich aber auch verstehen kann, da es l\u00e4nger dauern w\u00fcrde, neue Sprachen zu editieren.\n\nFazit:\nEin sehr lustiges Spiel, wo man immer wieder ein paar Level spielt oder wie ich, einfach mal ein Stunden t\u00e4glich dransitzt, bis man es durchhat. Mir Pers\u00f6nlich hat es so sehr gefallen, dass ich auch alle Achievments gesammelt habe, weil es wirklich eine Herausforderung darstellt.

You spell words based on random letters (ie, like Bookworm) and deal damage to monsters based on the complexity of your words. You earn gems over time that will let you deal more damage, take less damage, or other miscellaneous effects. There is a story, but it is frankly not very good (Grimm is looking for a pizza...).\n\nNormally I am quite critical of free mobile games being ported to PC with a big price bump. Thankfully Letter Quest is very well done and is worth the price. The mobile version is free, but supported with lots of IAP - the PC version is balanced so that you can play normally and get enough gems normally to afford to upgrades that you need. Plus you can directly type in words and such, so in many ways I feel that the PC version is going to be superior for input purposes.\n\nThe developers, who are still active (~9 months after the launch of the game), actually support the game and make it quite fun. The game is going to be a challenge for those who don't have a big vocabulary, but if you play enough the power-ups will help you out a lot. I actually learned a bunch of new words by trial and error and I like that it shows the definition for most words that you can spell (apparently the game dictionary is ~190,000 words).\n\nThe graphics are repeated a lot but are vibrant and cute. If there is any constructive feedback I can give, it is maybe that a easy mode can be added for kids. Once you are through the first dozen or two stages you really need to be spelling 5-6+ letter words or you are going to be spending forever grinding for potions.\n\nIn all a great find and I hope the developers make some other cool games in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1433795410, "timestamp_updated": 1433795410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16219903": {"recommendationid": "16219903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082394081", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434024335}, "language": "english", "review": "1.

Happily Letter Quest has found a winning formula. A combination of humor and tried and true RPG-lite mechanics incentivise and distract from the fact that you're essentially doing primary school English homework.\nThe aesthetic is decidedly cartoon-ish and crafted with a younger audience in mind but it shouldn't be off-putting to older players. The story is silly, lighthearted, and sparse but is punched up by the amusing and word-play filled enemy descriptions. Finally the sound track is fun and energetic but it only plays one track per level so the looping can get in your head a little if you spend more than a couple minutes on a given level. If you enjoy them though you're in luck as the soundtrack is included with the base game.\nSpeaking of school work and a younger audience, it was nice to see the developers not pass up the educational opportunity inherent to this genre. Every time you type a valid word you can choose to see the definition and it displays the definitions of every word you actually use. At first this seems pretty useless, for the most part you'll only be typing words you already know, but it's actually a clever bit of forethought by the developers. As anyone who regularly plays word games or does crosswords can tell you, it's very easy to \"cheat\" at a game like this and use program to come up with the best words given your letter set. By displaying the definitions of all the submitted words it almost makes using an assist like that actually more educational than just typing words you already know. What I'm saying is expand your vocabulary by embracing the urge to cheat.\nAs far as the RPG mechanics go they've definitely been paired down for both general simplicity and with the intended audience in mind. You can upgrade several aspects of your character (damage, armor, health), apply various passive buffs that are upgraded though an XP system, unlock weapons, buy potions, and even unlock more characters. Another interesting mechanic is the weaknesses that the bosses have. Things like multiplied damage from double letter words or words with both an E and a S, force you to really think about your word selection. Several of the enemies also will restrict your letter choices by poisoning tiles, locking them down for a few turns, or even changing several after every attack. It's a fairly unique mechanic that helps keep what could be very repetitive battles fresh.\nOverall, Letter Quest is very well made, especially for a two man team, and can be enjoyed by most any player but will especially be of interest to fans of the spelling genre and those looking for a light educational experience. It doesn't take terribly long to complete the main levels, 4+ hours, but the inclusion of some hard levels, special objectives to complete on each level, and a number of unlocks definitely make the non-sale price point fair.", "timestamp_created": 1433444299, "timestamp_updated": 1433444299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16157161": {"recommendationid": "16157161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056228876", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432733244}, "language": "english", "review": "It is boring.

Some might take one or two words and others take literally a dozen and you might crush under their bulkiness. One can not always be victorious.\n\nIf you beat a stage you\u2019ll notice that you only gained one star. Those stars aren\u2019t your rating on how well you\u2019ve done but just an indication that you\u2019ve beaten this level of the stage. Every stage has four level and the last one is a so called Crystal Star level. I doubt I have to tell you that those are actually very hard.\nEvery Stage has the same levels. Level one requires you to defeat all monsters, level two is a time trial while level three is a special challenge and well level four is an ultra tough crystal star challenge.\nSo there\u2019s enough for you to do.\n\nOnce you progress through the game you\u2019ll encounter various figures on your way to slay all evil!... with the help of words of course.\nAnyway. Those figures will aid you in your battle against the vile creatures of evil!\nWell for some gems. Nothing in this world is free. Sadly.\nWhether you\u2019re in the need for some more health points or you want a [i]bigger[/i] and therefore stronger scythe, they have exactly what you want.\n\nBesides the obvious health points, armor and weapon upgrades you can also buy certain Books which will give you specific bonuses. One let\u2019s you deal 20% more damage with double letter words like Bubble or Battle. Monster drop 8% more gems with another book. You can also upgrade those books. For every evil creature that you spell to death your current book gains experience points. Sweet ain\u2019t it?\n\nMoreover you can also go ahead and buy a health potion so you can take a beating for some longer.\n\n[h1]Quests? I read RPG. So there better be Quests![/h1]\n\nWhat would any RPG be without Quests? Well no RPG \u2026 I guess.\nLetters Quest has a ton of Quests for you. With every Quest you complete you gain a certain amount of gems which you\u2019ll need to upgrade yourself or buy some potions.\nQuests require you to do certain things like take 200 damage or use broken tiles twice.\n\nThere\u2019s just one thing bugging me \u2026 The game\u2019s only playable in english.\nSo if you\u2019re not fluid with the English Language then I\u2019m afraid you either have to have a Dictionary besides you while playing or you better brush up your English skills.\n\nWell if you\u2019re either a native speaker or rather fluent in English I\u2019d say this game is really worth your time. It\u2019s fun, addictive and can be quite frustrating at times. You\u2019ll feel the pain once you look at the random Letters on your screen and you can\u2019t come up with a specific word in order to kill a ghost which takes only damage from 6-Letter words.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not too fluent in english this game could also be a good exercise to brush up your English. Especially since the loading screen gives you some hints on what to spell with the letter Q for example. Like Qua.\n\nSo that\u2019s pretty much it.\nGo ahead and use the random Letters on your screen to spell words in order to slay those vile creatures! I\u2019ve said pretty much all that I wanted to say at this point.\n\n[h1]If you happen to be a spelling bee \u2026[/h1]\n\n... then this game is definitely something for you. I greatly enjoyed the game and despite its rather cute looks it can be rather challenging at times.\nDespite all that I highly recommend it.

Earning plenty of gems and upgrading your character will make the game a lot easier, but at no point totally break it to the point of being too easy.\n\nThe \"story\" goes through a grand total of 40 stages as you follow Grimm's titular Journey to get a pizza.

Each of the 40 stages has a normal mode, the first star, a time trial mode where you have to be fast, the second star, a challenge mode where enemies have special traits (like not taking damage from 4 letter words). Getting all three stars in a stage unlocks the hard version, which has stronger enemies and another set of special rules (like not having 'A's in there).\n\nAll in all there's plenty to do, and the core gameplay is fun enough to last you through it.\nIt's not the most innovative or deep game in the world, but I'd still recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1432722190, "timestamp_updated": 1432722190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587290", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16009543": {"recommendationid": "16009543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056372862", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432628402}, "language": "english", "review": "An entertaining little game, took about 20 hours to complete 100%.

Imagine this game without having to spell words, with just the adventure / combat, if you can just press the spacebar to strike.  It would be walk to the right, hack, hack, hack, hack, walk to the right, hack, hack, finished.  This part of the game is not very exciting.\n\nNow, speaking of hack, imagine a rich roguelike 2d dungeon-crawler, but with the same \"words for combat\" mechanism, perhaps framed as \"spells\" rather than strikes since we are \"spelling\".  How about the meaning of some words can have some bearing on their effectiveness, or what happens when you spell them?  I think that would be fun.\n\nThe start of the game that I've played so far is a bit too easy for me.  There needs to be some difficulty setting or another way to make it more or less challenging to suit the player.  Your game is compulsive / addictive, and I'll probably keep playing, but I haven't fallen in love with it (as I was expecting, given the unanimous approval).\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry if this is coming across too negative.

IM SO CRAZY about it in all seriousness I love it I want to buy the soundtrack\n[b]EDIT[/b] \nOMG The dev replied and apparently the soundtrack is in the game's folder included with the game itself, thats so awesome thanks guys : D\n\nThe monsters, level and all designs are totally adorable and the animations are outstanding.\nThere are a lot of achievements to grind on, And a lot of levels and you can play every level 4 times so yeah that can give you more time to play, I am pretty sure I have around 4+ hours in the game than it shows here but they're all offline mostly and steam does not record that.\n\nTHIS might interest many people out there, there is no timer when you're typing the word or thinking it so you can take as much time as you want no need to hurry up and mess up.\n\nA lot of monsters to fight, some with special conditions   EX : only takes damage from words with 2 vowels or more.

I am being 100% honest here, in all my reviews even when I fall in love with the game there's always cons but not this one, There's a good reason why this game has 100% positive reviews, the devs ... you guys did an outstanding job and my goal is to be one day as good as you guys are in game developing \n\nTL;DR\n- This game is 100% worth it for anyone who likes word games or slightly interested in them, Its tough and takes a lot of time to finish, Has a lot of content, achievements, leaderboards and cards so you cant go wrong, The 7.99$ price is so unfair for this amazing game\n\nA must buy if you're even slightly into this genre.", "timestamp_created": 1430836409, "timestamp_updated": 1430921634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634579", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1430880140, "developer_response": "Thanks for the awesome review! :)\n\nJust wanted to let you know that if you really love the music, you should take a look in the game's install folder on your computer...look for a folder \"Letter Quest Soundtrack\" - we included the soundtrack free with all copies of the game.

La historia es simple, pero como ya he mencionado a veces la historia se utiliza de mera excusa para la acci\u00f3n.\n\nEn Letter Quest, la jugabilidad se basa en combate por turnos, para infligir da\u00f1o al enemigo tendr\u00e1s que formar palabras utilizando las letras de una cuadricula de 5\u00d74, aunque eso no es todo pues para matar a ciertos enemigos tendr\u00e1s que hacer palabras de un determinado numero de letras si quieres causarles da\u00f1o.\n\nComo era de esperarse las palabras m\u00e1s largas tienen mayor valor que las cortas, aunque utilizar letras raras como la X o Z en una palabra tambi\u00e9n aumenta su valor, pues las casillas se dividen por 3 clases: Bronce (Simples), Plata (Normales) y Oro (Raras) entre m\u00e1s letras raras y normales utilices al crear palabras mayor da\u00f1o causar\u00e1n estas.\n\nCon un dise\u00f1o colorido y caricaturesco, Letter Quest no se molesta en utilizar un apartado gr\u00e1fico espectacular. Pues no es necesario, el dise\u00f1o de los personajes, enemigos y entornos ya es bastante encantador por si solo.\n\nEl apartado sonoro destaca por encima del visual, entregando gran cantidad de peque\u00f1as pistas que hacen la jugabilidad m\u00e1s amena. Algo raramente visto en juegos para m\u00f3vil y aunque no es una banda sonora especialmente memorable si cumple su cometido con melod\u00edas que terminar\u00e1s recordando por horas.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1] [list]\n[*]Estilo jugable \u00fanico y muy entretenido.\n[*]Gran variedad de items y mejoras.\n[*]El juego permite la utilizaci\u00f3n de gran cantidad de palabras.\n[*]Excelente banda sonora.

While I've never been able to properly engage in a game of Scrabble, I love the gameplay that this particular genre of game affords. \n\nWhen I first heard of Letter Quest they were trying to get onto Steam via Greenlight. After much deliberation I picked up a copy of this game via the Humble Store. I fell in love with it instantly. \n\nI didn't have much time to play through this game though, so after playing a while put it aside and waited for Valve to greenlight this. It sure took Valve an inexplicably long wait, but here are the fruits of two men's (and a lot of Greenlight voters') hard work!\n\nAs the store page states, it's a combination of Scrabble and RPG. It's a very light-hearted tale of a very hungry Grimm reaper looking for pizza and battling monsters along the way - the story is told through rather whimsical-looking comic strip scenes. Yew spell wards een awder too keel anemees...sorry. Proper words, I mean. None of the words in that terrible sentence (barring the proper homophones) would work. :P\n\nThroughout the level you get gems for killing monsters and finishing levels (breaking gem piles). This is where the RPG aspect comes into play - kill more enemies, finish more levels, and you can use the gems to better upgrade Grimm's books, attributes, etc. in order for him to better survive the trickier stages.\n\nNearly everything about this game is just perfect. Perfect cartoony visuals. Take a bow, [url=https://twitter.com/jakemacher]Jake Macher[/url]! Perfect soundtrack. Can't find out who did it, but the chiptune style soundtrack, which you can find in your game files, is gorgeous and fits the game - one of the rare times where it works SO well. Finally, perfect gameplay mechanics. Okay, nearly perfect. While the difficulty scales reasonably well, some of the monsters are rather tough to kill unless you can come up with words that are longer than 4-5 letters consistently!\n\nOtherwise, CTO [url=https://twitter.com/markjasmith]Mark Smith[/url] has done an incredibly solid job on the coding front. It's rare nowadays for a game to be released on day one with no discernibly game-breaking bugs, and for this game to do so despite being coded by practically one person is a monumental achievement. Integration with Steam features like leaderboards, achievements and even Cloud save are also huge pluses. Not to mention that he (at least I presume it's him) is very active in the Steam forums responding to all sorts of questions, bug reports and suggestions regarding the game, and also pushes out updates as well. Rarely do you ever find developers with this kind of enthusiasm and candour.\n\nThis game can stand its own against Bookworm Adventures and the ilk, with its own unique brand of wit and charm. Give yourself a pat on the back, Bacon Bandit Games. You guys deserve it.\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\nThe game's been bundled a few times recently. The [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/373970]remastered version[/url] has recently been released - you can now buy both the remastered and old version in one package!

You kill monsters. Why? For pizza.\n\n[spoiler]As if a whole horde of monsters guarding pizzas wasn't odd enough, I could have just dialed for a pizza delivery instead of questing for a slice of pizza at the end of the day.[/spoiler] Putting that aside, now for the very long game review.\n\n__________________________\n\nWhat's there to say when it's basically a word game? As long as you have a good vocabulary you're good to go... but not quite. Throw in the idea of RPGs, and you'll need not only your wits, but strength to overcome this arduous journey. The game itself is like scrabble, but it isn't a crossword puzzle. Consider it boggle, but you don't have to link the letters in a line to form the word. That's freedom, and I like the idea of it. Given a set of 15 letters, you try to form words 3-letters or more. \n\nYou think that forming longer words makes you smart and powerful, but I say \"That's rubbish.\" On your quest for pizza, you will find yourself facing some 'smarter' monsters that can only understand certain words you throw at them. If you had the brains but know not how to use it, you will definitely find yourself dead, no matter how much time you spent investing in forming a long word. Naturally, long words do more damage, but would they always? No. Some 'wittier' monsters can only understand baby talk, so insulting them with witty words proves no help in your quest. But I'm sure you are smarter than these monsters guarding pizzas.\n\nBy RPG elements inclusion, it isn't you being a hero and saving the day since you're just out hunting for pizza using your trustworthy guide. You equip yourself with books that actually aid you in your journey which automatically writes new experience for itself as you battle your way to the delicacy. You upgrade your stats to aid you in your long battle. You find a new girlfriend and you decide to let her battle for you in the frontline while you take the pizza for yourself. You prove your wits and unlock cool stuff. What more do you want? Oh yes, the pizza.\n\nSo let me put my cynical talk aside, the game itself is decent. Difficulty is well balanced, graphics are simple and clean. More importantly, fonts don't hurt your eyes to look at, especially when it's a word game. You will immediately grasp hold of how the game works when new stuff appears which in my view is ideal. Music is alright, and can get repetitive easily but no one said you can't turn it off to play your own songs, so get on with it.

The protagonists in the game has different base stats that determine evasion, hp, critical chance, and more. These affect the battles in significant ways and are able to be upgraded in the in-game shop. There are also hangman sections where you guess the word to get the treasure in the chest and merchant sections that allow you to buy items in between battles. It's been quite the bug-free experience too.\n\nThe game recognizes a fair amount of words. You can spell slurs, but the game will not recognize them unless they have a non-vulgar definition. Every now and then, an odd definition might pop up (definitions are provided for your perusal after spelling and submitting a word).\n\nThis game favors people that are familiar with English. For non-native speakers, I suggest using some aids due to a possible \"grindy\" nature the game can take on if you can't spell 4-8 letter words regularly. Keep the \"ings\" and \"eds\" in mind for increasing word length like winged and winging or touched and touching.\n\nThe art style is clean, clear, crisp, and cute. And maybe another c word. Clover? Anyway, some of the special tile sets that you can use vary in their readability. I like the default one and the transparent style. The Word With Friends style made my eyes water when trying to decipher the font. I suppose I'll never play Words With Friends.\n\nI had a good amount of fun with this title as I do enjoy words.

Grimm's Journey a firm addition to that genre and delivers on all of the above. \n\nPROS: This game takes most of the core elements that made Bookworm Adventures great and expounds on them. \n\nThere is a lot of content: Each individual level has 3 more challenges to add both depth and varied game play. So each\"level\" is really 4 as you attempt to collect all 4 stars. The first star is always a standard play-through, the second is usually a time challenge, the third is a run-through where each monster has special restrictions or weaknesses, and the fourth is hard mode where the monsters are high-powered. This provides a decent amount of extra playtime and provides more choices on what type of game play you are feeling during any session. \n\nStats are awesome: The game stats that are tracked are comprehensive. Max damage with and without bonuses, palindromes spelled, the number of times you have used each letter, how many times have you spelled bacon...that is just a few. The list of tracked data is huge and is lots of fun to look over.\n\nCONS:  I really wish there were still even more powers. The \"books\" that you can equip can help both form a strategy or just generally make your character more powerful. I feel like more options in this category should have focused more on that strategy element \n\nIt is difficult to craft a strategic run during a given level because they are mostly short (2-5 enemies) and a decent number of enemies have powers that can change tiles or prevent you from using certain tiles. In bookworm adventures 1 you could carefully spell short words using left over letters as you purposefully work toward collecting the necessary letters to spell \"Nonproliferation\". A mode or \"book\" that protects your tiles from alteration or lockdown would go a long way toward empowering the overly calculating player.\n\nOVERALL:  This is an awesome game that exands the niche RPG, word-game genre.

Clearing a zone or additional challenges in each zone yield gems which are used to purchase both cosmetic and equipment upgrades, increasing your stats or limited use buffs.

Grinding might be an issue for some as some challenges are gated by equipment and your stats. A great addition is the inclusion of word definitions after playing a word, though at present some definitions need some tidying up, something the developers seem keen to do. I can certainly see the potential for this to be used as a useful educational tool after tightening the definitions, but it is equably just as enjoyable as a casual game for those that enjoy word puzzles and word challenges.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1416827646, "timestamp_updated": 1416827646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13065283": {"recommendationid": "13065283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058412491", "num_games_owned": 589, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417034264}, "language": "english", "review": "If you\u2019re a fan of word adventure type games, then this is a perfect game for you!

A 15-letter word bank with less RNG smoothing than BA creates a slight bit more difficulty inherently, and the game pulls no punches, expecting large words and smart item-purchasing decisions from the very start.\n\nOne downside compared to Bookworm Adventures is that specialized / bonus tiles are given at random, with gear and passives to improve your chances, as opposed to being rewarded for creating high-length or high-value words. The game also seems to favor a grindy approach to building up your resources, as the gem flow in the early-to-mid game is a bit unstable, and the potion costs are exorbitant. A larger variety of chest minigames would not have gone unappreciated, for that matter.\n\nUpsides include a MUCH larger array of modifications, gear, and enhancement items, as well as a more robust dictionary. There are some sly references here and there, and a very good stable of achievements and challenges.\n\nMusic tracks are regrettably short, and sound effects have punch but unique ones are few and far between. The end result is audio that can become somewhat grating after a straight hour or so of play.\n\nAll in all, it's an extremely solid and welcome addition to the genre, but not without its flaws.

It\u2019s very similar to the Bookworm games from PopCap Games, but is harder and also has more content in it. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s the better game between the two, but let\u2019s dig deeper and find out, shall we ?[/i]\n\nYou start the game by \u2018controlling\u2019 a grim reaper named Grimm. You don\u2019t actually control him directly; the game automatically moves the character forward if necessary. Later on you can unlock and control another grim reaper, a girl named Rose. Both characters use separate stats, so it\u2019s not just another design. They actually impact gameplay.\nThe game works with levels, and each level has additional, separate/optional challenges that can be completed. There are 40 levels in total; technically 160 if you count all of the challenges, of course.\n\nSmall tutorials (tips & hints might be a better description, though) are gradually introduced during gameplay. Most things speak for themselves, but there are a few things that are important. There are levels where you have to use a certain amount of letters (or avoid using a specific amount), use letters in corners, start words with a vowel, et cetera. These challenges are usually used in challenge levels and in boss levels. Normally you can just create the words that you want, as long as you have the letters for it. But these have to be in English, which might be a bit tricky for international users who hardly speak the language. Don\u2019t worry though, you can play the game just fine by creating smaller and easier words; it\u2019s just that it might take you a little longer. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s no time limit. Since it\u2019s turn-based there\u2019s no need to rush (unless it\u2019s a challenge). You can take your time, but once you submit your word you\u2019ll be immediately attacked by your opponent.\nWord tiles will also change from time to time; there are poison tiles that will poison you (really !) if you use it in a word, and there are duplicator tiles that you duplicate certain letters (really !). There are even more of them, but I can\u2019t remember them all, especially with my terrible memory.\n\nThere are books that can be unlocked that might give you more health, or do more damage, but these have to be bought from the store with crystals. Crystals can be found by defeating enemies, opening chests and getting to the end of a level. Earning these takes a lot of time and you\u2019ll be frequently doing challenges and replaying levels in order to earn more of them. But you can also complete challenges. There are 70 in total and each one that you complete grants you 200 crystals.\n\nMore stuff can be bought from the store; there are weapons with different stats (one that heals you a little for each word that you submit or one that does more damage), and these can usually also be upgraded. You can also buy potions, better gear and books to improve your skills in combat, which is almost a must, because the game gets incredibly hard fast. But even failing levels will upgrade your equipped books so, again, you will still be able to beat them, it will just take a tad longer. \nStill, it could have used a little more fine-tuning in this area, because I can\u2019t count the amount of times that I had to replay a level, or had to do a(n earlier) challenge in order to be able to buy something better from the store.\nIt\u2019s always wise to take a potion (or two) with you but it\u2019s even wiser to not use it if you\u2019re playing a new level for the first time.  I\u2019ve also spent a ton of crystals on potions that were eventually just wasted because the difficulty ramped up halfway through a level. It\u2019s unfortunately very unbalanced sometimes and that will no doubt impact people\u2019s experiences. The game relies heavily on using items and upgrading your gear, which makes sense, but for a casual game it doesn\u2019t seem to be all that casual on that front.\n\nFor a two-man company the game is extremely well polished. But it isn\u2019t hard to see that some aspects didn\u2019t get the same treatment as some of the other parts of the game. I\u2019m talking about the animations and the difficulty spikes here (which I already shortly addressed in the previous paragraph and won\u2019t get into any further).\nThe graphics all look sharp and detailed, and everything is nicely animated, except for the enemies. The enemies just stand still and when they attack you might see a flash or something but except for that nothing else is moving. I understand it would\u2019ve taken more time to animate all of the characters but it\u2019s slightly disappointing and certainly noticeable, especially when the rest of the game feels so polished.\nThankfully the user interface is clean and user friendly. There\u2019s also keyboard support so that you don\u2019t have to click on of the letters you want to use. A simple idea, but really clever and I\u2019m sure many people will appreciate it.\nThe music itself is retro themed, and up-tempo. I didn\u2019t really enjoy it just because of that, but that\u2019s personal and I wouldn\u2019t ever say that it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s just not my style. I did find the sounds good with selected tiles making noises, and a sound that can be heard whenever a word can be submitted.\n\nThe description of the game states that it will take at least 6 hours to finish the game and I personally think you can at least add several hours extra to that number. I think 10 hours, give or take, would be a good estimate to do most of the things. For a word game, that\u2019s pretty lengthy and, even more important, worth the money.\n\n[i]Letter Quest Grimm\u2019s Journey is a game that I very much enjoyed. There are plenty of word games out there, but nothing like this one or Bookworm Adventures. This is also one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. This genre hasn\u2019t been oversaturated yet. Sure, it isn\u2019t as popular as RPGs or FPSs, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less fun. Who knew playing with words could be fun ? (well,\u2026 I did)[/i]\n\n[b][Rating: 76/100][/b]\n\nSmall note: if you enjoy word games give Typing Of The Dead a try, too (that is, if you\u2019ve never heard of it).
